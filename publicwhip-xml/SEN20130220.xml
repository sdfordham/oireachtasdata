It was welcome, fulsome and honest, and it is certainly a day on which we can now move on to make redress in the financial and other ways required by these ladies who suffered so gravely in these institutions.</p> <p>I want to put on the record of the House that I welcome the Taoiseach's statement without reservation.  He did the right thing yesterday and I certainly welcome that on behalf of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil.</p><p>Have the Leader and the leader of the Labour Party group received any clarification as to when the Minister for Social Protection received the Mangan report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare, which deals with proposals on child benefit?  The report is dated 27 March 2012.  I raised this issue yesterday.  Senator Bacik said she did not believe the Minister had the report since last March.  I know she did.  We need the Minister to come here very soon to explain why when we debated the budget and the Social Welfare Act here, she put on the record of the House that she would debate the report when it was available.  The report has been available since last March so I put it to the Leader that the Minister misled the House and I would like her to be given an opportunity to come here and correct the record and have a proper, open debate on child benefit.  I said that we would play a constructive part in that.</p><p>Last week, I raised the situation pertaining to the Dublin north metropolitan region of An Garda Síochána in the House.  There were no operational Garda vehicles available for 4.5 hours on the morning of 10 February 2013.  The Garda press office denied it but it is a fact that this was the case and our gardaí are not properly resourced.  A lady contacted me yesterday who was attacked and robbed in Clare Hall in north Dublin on 10 February.  Thankfully, she was not badly injured.  The only gardaí available to see her were two gardaí in a two-person Garda van.  The gardaí were excellent and responded to her very well but they had to give that lady change out of their own pockets for her to get a bus home to Swords because they had no Garda car available.  That is not on and is absolutely disgraceful.  It is not the policing we deserve and our citizens require.  It is certainly not the gardaí's fault.  The resources they are left with are scant in the main.  </p><p>I have four questions for the Leader.  Does this Government respect the gardaí?  Does the Leader feel the gardaí are properly resourced?  Does he believe the gardaí are overpaid?  Does he believe that rank-and-file gardaí should take a pay cut?  Once again, I will table an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to answer the four questions I put down today and explain how he intends to address the situation with An Garda Síochána when he has lost the confidence of every rank and file member of the gardaí?  This is an unprecedented situation that is getting worse by the day.  I want the Minister to state directly whether he respects or values the gardaí because his actions show that he does not.  I am formally proposing that amendment to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I am really proud that this Government has at last given the long-overdue recognition and acknowledgement of the pain and suffering caused to the women who spent time in the Magdalen laundries.  Those laundries, as everyone is aware, operated for 74 years in this State and successive Governments failed to take any action to acknowledge their existence or State collusion in and facilitation of their existence.  I very much welcome the fact that we will have a debate in this House next week and look forward to teasing out some of the issues raised by the McAleese report and what we know of the experiences of women and girls in the laundries.  We know that there were not only gender but class issues involved.  I wish to say how wonderful it was to see that heartfelt apology given by the Taoiseach, the words of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and indeed the words of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Martin.  I acknowledge that he also gave a very important apology on behalf of the Government of which he had been a member, which had failed like so many other governments to take action on this issue.  It was a night in which another light was shone into very dark shadows and corners of our past in the same way as we have already acknowledged the abuse suffered by children in industrial schools and reformatories.</p><p>  Many colleagues have raised a desire to debate the Mangan report with the Minister for Social Protection.  She will be in this House next Tuesday so we can debate the issues with her directly as to when she received the report.  It is to be published today, as we all know.  Judging by what has been said about it, some of its recommendations will deserve some comprehensive debate in this House.  In particular, I note Dan O'Brien's analysis in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which is really pertinent about the levels of child benefit and welfare payments directed towards children we have had in Ireland for many years, which have been high by international standards yet the outcomes have been very poor by international standards when one looks at our child poverty rates.  We need to look at how we can best tackle child poverty in a meaningful way through social welfare payments.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Social Protection who, since she took office, has expressed a desire to reform the system in a meaningful way to ensure better outcomes not just for child benefit but for other social protection payments.  </p></speech>

It is well-timed and certainly very sincere.  I went into the Chamber to see it and during my years there, I never experienced such emotion both on the floor of the House and in the Gallery.  The fact that a standing ovation was given to those victims and survivors of the Magdalen laundries was very much appreciated by all concerned.  The appointment of Mr. Justice John Quirke to assess the situation is very welcome.  He has a three-month mandate to come up with recommendations and should consider the families of the victims who have died and who have suffered as a result of their mothers being resident in those institutions.  They should also receive consideration.</p><p>I also recognise the fact that the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of every Member of the House recognised the gesture and decision of the Government and Taoiseach and was a member of the Government that set up the redress board for those young students in reformatories.  They must ensure that the lawyers will not receive the money they received from the redress board.  The lawyers made more money than those poor victims of institutions like Letterfrack, which is certainly a blight on Ireland.  I hope whatever is done is done speedily because some of these women are of senior age.  I hope we will have a debate next week on this issue and tease out this situation.  From an Irish perspective, it is very timely and should have been done a long time ago but it should never have happened in the first place.  We have now reached a stage where the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government has given that apology and action is being taken to give those women some form of compensation or support.  I second the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition.  </p></speech>

I am proposing that No. 10 be taken and that the Bill be sent forward for publication.</p><p>A report in one of today's newspapers related to absenteeism in the public sector.  We should have a debate on this issue in the House.  Very little real progress has been made over the past two to three years.  There are genuine reasons people are absent from work such as health or family bereavement.  In the health sector, while one finds junior doctors working long hours and the absenteeism level is extremely low, the absenteeism level on the administrative side in the HSE has still not changed to any great degree.  </p> <p>It is time to engage in a debate on this matter, particularly as it involves the use of taxpayers' money.  It is important that the debate to which I refer should be constructive.  If there is a need to consider how work schedules operate or the structures within people's places of employment, we should do so.  It might be appropriate to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to come before the House in order that we might identify the changes which should be introduced in order that we might deal with this issue.  Matters cannot be left as they stand.</p></speech>

Céim dhearfach chun cinn í sin agus tá súil agam go leanfar leis na moltaí a cuireadh os comhair an Tí inné.  I also welcome the full apology offered by the Taoiseach yesterday.  That apology is extremely apt and a recognition of the great campaign in which the women who were kept in the Magdalen laundries have engaged.  I hope the plight of those who were put into the Bethany Home in Summerhill and also that of the survivors of symphysiotomy will be taken into consideration and that their cases will be dealt with swiftly also.</p><p>I wish to draw a slight analogy in this matter.  The Taoiseach's apology on behalf of the State is welcome.  However, on numerous occasions during my two years as a Member of this House I have outlined my hope a similar apology will not be required from a future Taoiseach in respect of the direct provision system.  I have grave concerns about the system of direct provision and I am of the opinion that it must be reviewed.  Coverage in the press this morning indicates that some €655 million was paid to the private companies which ran the direct provision system during the past ten years.  These companies have unlimited status and, therefore, we are not in a position to discover the level of profits they have made.  These profits were made on the backs of people kept in conditions that were far from satisfactory from a civil rights perspective.</p><p>I appreciate that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is processing asylum applications faster than his predecessors.  However, organisations such as the Irish Refugee Council continue to raise serious questions about the conditions which obtain in the direct provision system.  The Ombudsman has called for oversight of the organisations which administer the asylum system.  A debate is required on the direct provision system in the light of the new information to which I refer in order that we might discover the level of profits the companies involved are making.  Such a debate might also be of assistance in discovering whether there is a better way to deal with asylum applications and with those who are obliged to engage with the system.  I sincerely hope it will not be necessary for the State to issue an apology to these individuals at some point in the future.</p></speech>

I must admit that I became very emotional about yesterday's events.  I take the opportunity to remember the work of the late Mary Raftery, a journalist who tirelessly worked to expose institutional abuses.  We owe a debt of gratitude to her for that work.  It is important to remember that what is happening is a step along the road.  The real proof of the pudding will lie in the quality of the redress that will be given to the victims of the Magdalen laundries.  I regret to say that I do not believe this is the end of the story.  There are many hidden histories in Ireland which remain to be uncovered.  In that context, I refer to what occurred in county homes.  As a young child, my father took me to visit an elderly relative in one of these homes.  During our visit I saw through an open ward door an elderly lady sitting naked.  I heard noises in that institution the likes of which I had never heard previously.  Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that what we need to do now is, as Donogh O'Malley put it in 1969, take the skin off the pudding.  Rather than waiting until the next unfortunate case is brought to our attention, we should consider establishing a permanent national investigations unit which could look into all of the institutions of the State to uncover evidence of any outstanding instances of abuse.</p></speech>

I do not believe anybody expected anything less of him, it was just a matter of timing.  I also include the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin and everyone else involved in yesterday's debate.  I became extremely emotional when I saw all Members of Dáil Éireann give a standing ovation to the survivors seated in the Visitors Gallery.  We normally give standing ovations to world leaders and celebrities.  Yesterday one was given to decent human beings who had suffered quietly.  That ovation was also related to the memory of those who had passed on.  It is not just a matter of raising the spirits of the survivors; we have raised the spirits of the entire nation because we did the right thing.  There are lessons to be learned from this.</p><p>On a completely separate and unconnected matter, yesterday I referred to Ms Marion Price who is incarcerated in Northern Ireland and currently in hospital in a very frail state.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement yesterday to the effect that he intends to raise the matter with the British Prime Minister and draw on the report of the all-party delegation which visited Ms Price.  He will have a direct opportunity to raise a few fundamental questions about issues such as the location of a royal pardon given to Ms Price, why she is being subjected to a flawed process in respect of her appeal which is due to be heard in a couple of weeks and why human rights are being sidelined in this matter.  This issue does not just relate to Ms Price, it also involves the need to be vigilant when it comes to the frailties in the appeals process.  It is not just matters relating to prisoners, republicanism or unionism which are at stake.  There are other issues relating to social deprivation and the fact that individuals have been sidelined and that there are individuals who have seen nothing good coming from the Good Friday Agreement or the appeals process.  If we do not engage with those to whom I refer and individuals who have difficulties with flags, etc., there is always a danger that a new generation who have no connection with the past will come to the fore and focus on matters with which their communities have a particular difficulty.  The Seanad played a significant role during the Troubles in bringing balance and a focus to fundamental and urgent issues as they arose.  It can continue to do so.  I am very pleased that the Taoiseach is prepared to take this matter to the highest level.  I urge that this be done immediately because Ms Price's review will take place in two weeks.</p></speech>

Two years ago I was fortunate to be elected from the labour panel in order that I might represent workers' interests.  I come from Portlaoise which is home to the country's two largest high security prisons.  In that context, I register my dismay at the manner in which workers who are members of the 24/7 Frontline Services Alliance are being treated in the current review relating to the Croke Park agreement and in the discussions on pay.  I support the people concerned in their view that they have been double-crossed.  The current Croke Park agreement to which they signed up in good faith still has 12 months to run.  They conceded to pay cuts, rationalisation, reform and redundancies.  They bought into, embraced and honoured the agreement but halfway through its period of operation, they are of the view that they are being double-crossed.  Those to whom I refer are being asked to accept further cuts and are being pilloried and characterised as people who do not want to move forward.  That is wrong.</p><p>It is both wrong and Thatcherite in the extreme to try to encourage divisions between public and private sector workers.  Certain organisations within the public sector are even trying to encourage such divisions between different elements within the sector.  That is also wrong.  I intend no disrespect to other public or private sector workers, but one cannot compare the work done on a Sunday by someone employed in a shop, an office or a restaurant with that done by a garda, a prison officer in a high security prison, a nurse in an accident and emergency department, a soldier or a fire-fighter on the same day, to whom we turn when we need help.  They operate in dangerous and attritional working environments and often put their lives on the line for us.  Not even Stalin could turn Sunday into Monday.  Since biblical times, Sunday has been a day of rest and recreation which people have spent with their families.  However, there has been an attempt to use the current crisis to see to it that working on a Sunday will be treated in the same way as working on a Monday.  That is wrong and will not be allowed to stand.</p></speech>

It is a tribute to him that he appointed Mr. Martin McAleese to the Seanad to carry out that very difficult task of researching what had happened in the Magdalen laundries, culminating in the report presented and last night's apology, which we all welcome.</p><p>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on red tape and regulatory impact assessments.  The Government promised that it would cut red tape by ensuring legislation from this House or the European Union would be thoroughly scrutinised to ensure it would not stop job creation or prevent the sustaining of employment.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, have carried out only one regulatory impact assessment of all the legislation passed through these Houses in two years.  That is all he has done in two years.  A total of 200 EU directives were issued last year and 167 the year before, but the Minister has only carried out one regulatory impact assessment.  This House deals on average with 50 Bills a year, but only one regulatory impact assessment has been carried out.  A report was produced on the amount of red tape involved on Valentia Island.  Between marine licences, planning permission applications and other Government-controlled authorities and regulations, red tape was preventing the creation of a total of 70 jobs.  Regulatory impact assessments need to be carried out of all legislation and EU directives, yet the Minister has only carried out one such assessment.  One report in two years does not look like reform.</p></speech>

The date 19 February 2013 will forever be remembered as the day on which a very bright light was necessarily shone on a very dark chapter of Ireland's history.  I applaud the Taoiseach for taking a period of two weeks to consider the McAleese report and his meetings with the Magdalen survivors.  This contributed to the sincerity and content of the apology he gave.  I also welcome the apology from the Tánaiste, the leader of Fianna Fáil and the fine contributions of other speakers last night.  I do not think I have ever witnessed such unanimity among Oireachtas Members.  The sense of relief and appreciation among the Magdalen survivors was palpable around Leinster House.  As other speakers said, it was a good night for Ireland and the Oireachtas.</p><p>I hope the arrangements to be spearheaded by Mr. Justice Quirke will run smoothly.  It is welcome that no very large legal fees will be part of this arrangement.  It is to be hoped the process will be non-adversarial and that the outcomes will be satisfactory to all of the Magdalen surivors.</p><p>I support Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh's proposal.  I ask for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the direct provision facilities.  We need the Minister to assure us that we are getting value for money and that the people being cared for are receiving the care and support they deserve.</p></speech>

I said last week in the House that front-line workers and middle-income earners had nothing left to give in further talks.  As Senator Diarmuid Wilson said, morale in the Garda Síochána is at an all-time low.  I know that in some Garda stations in this city gardaí do not have stationery supplies.  The Government might be looking in the wrong direction when trying to solve the problem.  It has suggested a fire crew of five personnel should be sent to deal with a house fire, while there are 30 fire chiefs and 350 assistant chief fire officers.  There is only one chief fire officer in the North of Ireland and two assistant chiefs.  That is the example to consider rather than cutting the number of front-line staff.  The same problems are evident in the HSE.  Everyone and anyone knows the HSE is top-heavy with management staff, yet we are asking junior nurses to take serious pay cuts and work for €22,000 a year.  We are looking in the wrong direction when trying to solve our problems.  We have to avoid strikes at all costs in order that the country will not be brought to a standstill.  Proper engagement with the 24/7 alliance is the only way to proceed.</p></speech>

The apology was long overdue, but it came at a very important juncture.  It is to be hoped it will give some solace to the victims of the Magdalen laundries.  The attention now moves to the question of redress, which is essential.  Such redress must not favour the legal profession substantially; rather, the money should be directed to the victims and their families.  The Government must ensure there will be no repetition of what happened when redress was made available by the State and the legal profession benefited substantially.</p><p>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator John Kelly and other Senators who spoke about front-line emergency staff.  Nurses, front-line local authority staff, HSE front-line staff and firemen should not be alienated by the State in seeking cost savings.  The Senator highlighted staff in local authorities, HSE management, at all tiers of management, including very senior staff in every Department, who are tripping over each other.  They are not being targeted, even though most of them are in receipt of salaries in excess of €70,000 to €100,000 a year.  Why is the Government touching those on salaries of €20,000 to €30,000 a year?  Strikes must be avoided at all costs.  Members of An Garda Síochána and nurses took out mortgages when property prices were high, but now they are suffering and struggling to repay these loans.  The removal of allowances which are deemed to form part of core pay should not be undertaken.  The Government needs to go back to the drawing board.  It needs to look at those at the top of the public sector pay bill to see if they can give a little more.  It needs to engage proactively with the 24-7 alliance, rather than adopt a stand-off approach as is happening.  A stand-off will lead to strikes and everyone will suffer as a result.</p></speech>

Yesterday was a fine day.  The Magdalen girls and ladies had suffered for so long.  I listened to them on "Morning Ireland" and they appreciate all that was done.  The Taoiseach's speech was very moving.  He demonstrated compassion for the ladies and scrubbed away the nation's shadows.</p> <p>I call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to reach out and meet the leaders of the 24/7 Frontline Services Alliance who are justifiably seething with anger lest the Government imposes unilateral cuts in pay that is neither a bonus nor an increment but an allowance in recognition of the anti-social and anti-family nature of working on a Sunday, week in and week out for the 52 weeks of the year, or when everybody else is on holidays, can take bank holiday breaks or spend Christmas with their families.

The Taoiseach's words came from the heart and were very worthy.  Very often our experience of a public apology is that it is tempered by an attempt at protection.  The Taoiseach must, therefore, be congratulated.</p><p>  Will the Leader consider allowing a debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation entitled, <font color="#222222">Creating Policies that Work - Actions to Address </font>Youth and Long-Term <font color="#222222">Unemployment</font>, which was launched yesterday and is worthy of discussion?  One of its proposals is that we introduce a youth guarantee in order that anybody under the age of 25 years who has finished his or her education and has not found a job within four months would be given a guarantee of either further education, an apprenticeship, a traineeship or a job.  This concept is based on a similar strategy in Austria, Sweden and New Zealand.  It would be very worthwhile to discuss this proposal because the benefits that would result are such that it should be brought to the attention of everybody involved in job creation.  The day before yesterday I went to Dundalk Institute of Technology to speak on the subject of entrepreneurship.  All students take a module in entrepreneurship.  It is a real reminder that we can do things ourselves rather than expecting others to do them for us.</p><p>  I hope in the year of The Gathering we will see the return of tourists.  One of the things that frustrates me is the number of lampposts with ties used to attach election posters.  Last night on the way home there was one lamppost which still had 15 ties on it.  When the political parties take down their posters, they leave the ties behind.  I am not suggesting we ask Dublin City Council to perform this task but that each one of us go and look at the lampposts near our home and remove the ties which look untidy and are to be found all around the country.</p></speech>

I have never witnessed such low morale among the gardaí I meet on a day-to-day basis in my county town and throughout the country.

On what planet are the bankers living?  I ask the Leader to please communicate with the Minister for Finance about the proposed increase which will drive hard-pressed mortgage holders over the cliff.  It will be the final straw.  AIB is only the stalking horse for the other banks which will also increase their interest rates.  The Minister must be asked what he will do about this proposal.</p></speech>

It is a tribute to him that he appointed Mr. Martin McAleese to the Seanad to carry out that very difficult task of researching what had happened in the Magdalen laundries, culminating in the report presented and last night's apology, which we all welcome.</p><p>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on red tape and regulatory impact assessments.  The Government promised that it would cut red tape by ensuring legislation from this House or the European Union would be thoroughly scrutinised to ensure it would not stop job creation or prevent the sustaining of employment.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, have carried out only one regulatory impact assessment of all the legislation passed through these Houses in two years.  That is all he has done in two years.  A total of 200 EU directives were issued last year and 167 the year before, but the Minister has only carried out one regulatory impact assessment.  This House deals on average with 50 Bills a year, but only one regulatory impact assessment has been carried out.  A report was produced on the amount of red tape involved on Valentia Island.  Between marine licences, planning permission applications and other Government-controlled authorities and regulations, red tape was preventing the creation of a total of 70 jobs.  Regulatory impact assessments need to be carried out of all legislation and EU directives, yet the Minister has only carried out one such assessment.  One report in two years does not look like reform.</p></speech>

The date 19 February 2013 will forever be remembered as the day on which a very bright light was necessarily shone on a very dark chapter of Ireland's history.  I applaud the Taoiseach for taking a period of two weeks to consider the McAleese report and his meetings with the Magdalen survivors.  This contributed to the sincerity and content of the apology he gave.  I also welcome the apology from the Tánaiste, the leader of Fianna Fáil and the fine contributions of other speakers last night.  I do not think I have ever witnessed such unanimity among Oireachtas Members.  The sense of relief and appreciation among the Magdalen survivors was palpable around Leinster House.  As other speakers said, it was a good night for Ireland and the Oireachtas.</p><p>I hope the arrangements to be spearheaded by Mr. Justice Quirke will run smoothly.  It is welcome that no very large legal fees will be part of this arrangement.  It is to be hoped the process will be non-adversarial and that the outcomes will be satisfactory to all of the Magdalen surivors.</p><p>I support Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh's proposal.  I ask for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the direct provision facilities.  We need the Minister to assure us that we are getting value for money and that the people being cared for are receiving the care and support they deserve.</p></speech>

I said last week in the House that front-line workers and middle-income earners had nothing left to give in further talks.  As Senator Diarmuid Wilson said, morale in the Garda Síochána is at an all-time low.  I know that in some Garda stations in this city gardaí do not have stationery supplies.  The Government might be looking in the wrong direction when trying to solve the problem.  It has suggested a fire crew of five personnel should be sent to deal with a house fire, while there are 30 fire chiefs and 350 assistant chief fire officers.  There is only one chief fire officer in the North of Ireland and two assistant chiefs.  That is the example to consider rather than cutting the number of front-line staff.  The same problems are evident in the HSE.  Everyone and anyone knows the HSE is top-heavy with management staff, yet we are asking junior nurses to take serious pay cuts and work for €22,000 a year.  We are looking in the wrong direction when trying to solve our problems.  We have to avoid strikes at all costs in order that the country will not be brought to a standstill.  Proper engagement with the 24/7 alliance is the only way to proceed.</p></speech>

The apology was long overdue, but it came at a very important juncture.  It is to be hoped it will give some solace to the victims of the Magdalen laundries.  The attention now moves to the question of redress, which is essential.  Such redress must not favour the legal profession substantially; rather, the money should be directed to the victims and their families.  The Government must ensure there will be no repetition of what happened when redress was made available by the State and the legal profession benefited substantially.</p><p>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator John Kelly and other Senators who spoke about front-line emergency staff.  Nurses, front-line local authority staff, HSE front-line staff and firemen should not be alienated by the State in seeking cost savings.  The Senator highlighted staff in local authorities, HSE management, at all tiers of management, including very senior staff in every Department, who are tripping over each other.  They are not being targeted, even though most of them are in receipt of salaries in excess of €70,000 to €100,000 a year.  Why is the Government touching those on salaries of €20,000 to €30,000 a year?  Strikes must be avoided at all costs.  Members of An Garda Síochána and nurses took out mortgages when property prices were high, but now they are suffering and struggling to repay these loans.  The removal of allowances which are deemed to form part of core pay should not be undertaken.  The Government needs to go back to the drawing board.  It needs to look at those at the top of the public sector pay bill to see if they can give a little more.  It needs to engage proactively with the 24-7 alliance, rather than adopt a stand-off approach as is happening.  A stand-off will lead to strikes and everyone will suffer as a result.</p></speech>

Yesterday was a fine day.  The Magdalen girls and ladies had suffered for so long.  I listened to them on "Morning Ireland" and they appreciate all that was done.  The Taoiseach's speech was very moving.  He demonstrated compassion for the ladies and scrubbed away the nation's shadows.</p> <p>It is time to have such a debate on scrubbing away our nation's shadows.  That would be a good title for such a debate because for too many years we put away our conscience and not just alone on this issue.  As well as doing a great service to the women who were in the Magdalen laundries and what they suffered as demonstrated in the report, such a debate would help Ireland's conscience to realise the Ireland we thought we had was all a shadow.</p><p>I am proud to be a member of a party that has a leader such as Deputy Enda Kenny who showed his compassion, that he is real and that he cares.  He has done for the country, his people and the Magdalen people a magnificent job.  I also want to pay tribute to Deputy Martin who had the guts to stand up-----</p></speech>

The Taoiseach's response went a long way towards addressing any discontent that there might have been over a perceived delay in a Government response.  What was said could have been said earlier, however.  Perhaps Dr. McAleese's report may have taken the Government by surprise to some extent.</p><p>There is also a lesson here for how communications are managed in these situations.

It has done such good work that it has been internationally recognised with membership on international patient advocacy groups.  Apparently, a decision was made to de-fund the organisation.  I am curious as to what the circumstances behind this were and would be grateful if it could be clarified for us.</p><p>Will the Leader get clarification from the Minister for Justice and Equality as to what investigation will take place with regard to potential conflict of interest issues that arise with the Magdalen laundries?  State moneys were paid to hospitals which were then paid to the laundries for a service which did the work in terms that have been described as perhaps slave labour but certainly unpaid labour.  The laundries in some cases were operated by the same religious orders with which the hospital contracts were held and to which Government funds were paid at break-even, subsistence levels or even at a loss.  There seems to be a need for a greater level of accountancy scrutiny than took place in the McAleese report which to the best of my knowledge only had accounting evidence provided by the accountants who worked for the organisations.  As it is likely there will be State-funded redress for the victims of the Magdalen atrocity, it is important those complex financial weaves are disentangled.</p></speech>

Yesterday was an extremely good day for Ireland, for democracy, for politics and doing the right thing for citizens who this State had clearly failed.  To bring this to a finality, I would like to see the same leadership to be shown by the people who ran these institutions.</p> <p>As a practising Catholic I believe that elements in the Catholic Church have a responsibility to follow the leadership of the Taoiseach and I sincerely hope that happens.

This is highly significant and I wish to put as much on the record.</p><p>  I was flabbergasted today by a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> that our pillar banks could consider writing off some of the &#8364;400 million debt of Independent News &amp; Media, the largest newspaper group with popular titles such as the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  What is the justification for this when they will not even write down the mortgages for hard-pressed homeowners and given that we have learned today that AIB is considering raising variable rate mortgages for 300,000 homeowners?  It is ridiculous.  I was pleased to read that senior Government figures are highly concerned about this.  However, I wish to know and I believe the House wishes to know details of the conditions our Government has set on State moneys given to pillar banks.  Are preconditions in place?  What type of accountability is in place for the State-owned pillar banks to the Oireachtas and to Members?</p></speech>

I was singularly proud to be in the House last night.  I consider the moment An Taoiseach, An Tánaiste and Deputy Martin paid the long-overdue apology and dues to the women who have suffered down through the years to be probably the finest moment of this Government so far.  Outside at the vigil yesterday I spoke to some of the women.  They were remarkably grateful for the tone and manner in which the apology was delivered.  It was long overdue.  I echo the sentiments of Senator Conway, who said he hoped that the religious institutes that incarcerated these women will now pay their fair share as well.</p><p>  I echo the calls this morning for a debate on direct provision.  I was horrified to read in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>this morning that &#8364;655 million has been paid to companies and individuals for accommodation to support asylum seekers, yet these people are on a pittance and have no direct right to work.</p></speech>

Anyone present could not but have been touched by the emotion in that House yesterday evening.</p><p>  We are all keen to see a proper system of redress for the ladies of the Magdalen.  The fact that Mr. Justice Quirke has been appointed to consider a proper scheme and report within three months indicates that we will have action on this matter soon.  We all agree that it was something that should have been acted upon many years ago but was not.  Now that it has been and that the apology has been given I hope the redress for those wonderful ladies will materialise fairly soon.</p><p>  Senator O'Brien asked about the Garda and highlighted that there were no Garda vehicles in a particular area.  Some 203 extra vehicles were provided last year and &#8364;5 million extra was provided this year for the purchase of vehicles for An Garda Síochána.  The matter raised by Senator O'Brien is unacceptable and I hope that funding will address the matter of the availability of vehicles.  This Government totally respects and values gardaí and values the services of all involved, not alone in the Garda but in all services, including ambulance men, nurses and everyone else.  That is why we are looking for the fairest possible deal under Croke Park for all public services.  The first five weeks of the talks have taken place and they did not concern people on the front line.  They were about the pay and conditions of other members in the public service, including people on large salaries and their pensions.  These issues have been mentioned as well and will have to be addressed and will be addressed but, ultimately, we must have the fairest system for all public servants.</p><p>  Senator O'Brien raised a matter on the Order of Business some weeks ago which I brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Senator suggested that there was a directive from the Dublin joint policing committee to the effect that in some way burglaries would be overlooked and that a lenient sentence would be given to those involved.  I have a reply from the Minister on the matter and I will put it on the record of the House:<ul>I refer to your letter of 5 February 2013 concerning a matter raised on the Order of Business suggesting that a directive had issued to the courts on the matter of sentencing in burglary cases.  As you might observe, this is not a matter in which I or my Department would involve itself.  The Dublin City Council central area policing sub-committee wrote to me on the matter and has been informed that no such directive has issued nor could issue.  As you are aware, the position is that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law and neither I as Minister nor my Department could issue any such directive in this regard.</ul> I hope that clarifies the matter raised by the Senator.</p></speech>

That would be a good title for such a debate because for too many years we put away our conscience and not just alone on this issue.  As well as doing a great service to the women who were in the Magdalen laundries and what they suffered as demonstrated in the report, such a debate would help Ireland's conscience to realise the Ireland we thought we had was all a shadow.</p><p>I am proud to be a member of a party that has a leader such as Deputy Enda Kenny who showed his compassion, that he is real and that he cares.

The Taoiseach's response went a long way towards addressing any discontent that there might have been over a perceived delay in a Government response.  What was said could have been said earlier, however.  Perhaps Dr. McAleese's report may have taken the Government by surprise to some extent.</p><p>There is also a lesson here for how communications are managed in these situations.

All told, it represents a €8 billion commitment which we will receive from international investors in transactions managed by the State or entities controlled by the State.  In addition to the deal we got on the promissory notes last week, it is a sign that on a macroeconomic level at least we are going in the right direction.  I compliment the Government on this and hope the Opposition would refer to good news now and again.</p></speech>

It has done such good work that it has been internationally recognised with membership on international patient advocacy groups.  Apparently, a decision was made to de-fund the organisation.  I am curious as to what the circumstances behind this were and would be grateful if it could be clarified for us.</p><p>Will the Leader get clarification from the Minister for Justice and Equality as to what investigation will take place with regard to potential conflict of interest issues that arise with the Magdalen laundries?  State moneys were paid to hospitals which were then paid to the laundries for a service which did the work in terms that have been described as perhaps slave labour but certainly unpaid labour.  The laundries in some cases were operated by the same religious orders with which the hospital contracts were held and to which Government funds were paid at break-even, subsistence levels or even at a loss.  There seems to be a need for a greater level of accountancy scrutiny than took place in the McAleese report which to the best of my knowledge only had accounting evidence provided by the accountants who worked for the organisations.  As it is likely there will be State-funded redress for the victims of the Magdalen atrocity, it is important those complex financial weaves are disentangled.</p></speech>

It was appropriate, long overdue but the right thing to do.  This Taoiseach has proved that he does not take advice from his advisers and opinions from legal people but says and does the right thing.  Yesterday was an extremely good day for Ireland, for democracy, for politics and doing the right thing for citizens who this State had clearly failed.  To bring this to a finality, I would like to see the same leadership to be shown by the people who ran these institutions.</p> <p>As a practising Catholic I believe that elements in the Catholic Church have a responsibility to follow the leadership of the Taoiseach and I sincerely hope that happens.  I have every confidence that the redress system will be generous, fair and easily managed.  I sincerely hope that the Catholic Church and the elements within it that ran these institutions pay their fair share under the redress system.</p></speech>

This is highly significant and I wish to put as much on the record.</p><p>  I was flabbergasted today by a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> that our pillar banks could consider writing off some of the &#8364;400 million debt of Independent News &amp; Media, the largest newspaper group with popular titles such as the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  What is the justification for this when they will not even write down the mortgages for hard-pressed homeowners and given that we have learned today that AIB is considering raising variable rate mortgages for 300,000 homeowners?  It is ridiculous.  I was pleased to read that senior Government figures are highly concerned about this.  However, I wish to know and I believe the House wishes to know details of the conditions our Government has set on State moneys given to pillar banks.  Are preconditions in place?  What type of accountability is in place for the State-owned pillar banks to the Oireachtas and to Members?</p></speech>

I was singularly proud to be in the House last night.  I consider the moment An Taoiseach, An Tánaiste and Deputy Martin paid the long-overdue apology and dues to the women who have suffered down through the years to be probably the finest moment of this Government so far.  Outside at the vigil yesterday I spoke to some of the women.  They were remarkably grateful for the tone and manner in which the apology was delivered.  It was long overdue.  I echo the sentiments of Senator Conway, who said he hoped that the religious institutes that incarcerated these women will now pay their fair share as well.</p><p>  I echo the calls this morning for a debate on direct provision.  I was horrified to read in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>this morning that &#8364;655 million has been paid to companies and individuals for accommodation to support asylum seekers, yet these people are on a pittance and have no direct right to work.</p></speech>

Anyone present could not but have been touched by the emotion in that House yesterday evening.</p><p>  We are all keen to see a proper system of redress for the ladies of the Magdalen.  The fact that Mr. Justice Quirke has been appointed to consider a proper scheme and report within three months indicates that we will have action on this matter soon.  We all agree that it was something that should have been acted upon many years ago but was not.  Now that it has been and that the apology has been given I hope the redress for those wonderful ladies will materialise fairly soon.</p><p>  Senator O'Brien asked about the Garda and highlighted that there were no Garda vehicles in a particular area.  Some 203 extra vehicles were provided last year and &#8364;5 million extra was provided this year for the purchase of vehicles for An Garda Síochána.  The matter raised by Senator O'Brien is unacceptable and I hope that funding will address the matter of the availability of vehicles.  This Government totally respects and values gardaí and values the services of all involved, not alone in the Garda but in all services, including ambulance men, nurses and everyone else.  That is why we are looking for the fairest possible deal under Croke Park for all public services.  The first five weeks of the talks have taken place and they did not concern people on the front line.  They were about the pay and conditions of other members in the public service, including people on large salaries and their pensions.  These issues have been mentioned as well and will have to be addressed and will be addressed but, ultimately, we must have the fairest system for all public servants.</p><p>  Senator O'Brien raised a matter on the Order of Business some weeks ago which I brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Senator suggested that there was a directive from the Dublin joint policing committee to the effect that in some way burglaries would be overlooked and that a lenient sentence would be given to those involved.  I have a reply from the Minister on the matter and I will put it on the record of the House:<ul>I refer to your letter of 5 February 2013 concerning a matter raised on the Order of Business suggesting that a directive had issued to the courts on the matter of sentencing in burglary cases.  As you might observe, this is not a matter in which I or my Department would involve itself.  The Dublin City Council central area policing sub-committee wrote to me on the matter and has been informed that no such directive has issued nor could issue.  As you are aware, the position is that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law and neither I as Minister nor my Department could issue any such directive in this regard.</ul> I hope that clarifies the matter raised by the Senator.</p></speech>

Chuir an Rialtas siar an cinneadh atá ann maidir leis sin.</p><p>Tá sé tábhachtach, agus na gnóthaí seo á phlé againn, go ndéanfaimid scrúdú ar an téarmaíocht agus an foclaíocht a úsáidtear sa Seanad agus sa Dáil maidir le Billí, srl.  Rinneadh roinnt plé ar an ábhar seo ag Tóstal na Gaeilge ag an deireadh seachtaine.  Tuigtear dom go raibh foclóir parlaiminte ann roimhe seo.  Tá sé tábhachtach go ndéanfaí uasghrádú ar sin chun deis a thabhairt do Sheanadóirí agus do Theachtaí a dhéanann an-iarracht ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, an teanga a úsáid sa chomhthéacs seo.  Sílim go mbeadh sé úsáideach dá bhféadfaí leagan den foclóir parlaiminte sin a athfhoilsiú agus a thabhairt do na Baill ar fad.</p><p>Mhol duine éigin ag an deireadh seachtaine gur cheart do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin bileog eolais, a chlúdódh focail ábhartha Gaeilge a bheadh comónta, a fhoilsiú agus a sholáthar dúinn nuair a thagann Billí amach.  Bheadh sé úsáideach dá mbeimid in ann acmhainn den tsórt sin a úsáid agus reachtaíocht á phlé againn.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh an rannóg scrúdú ar an moladh sin, mar go bhfuil an téarmaíocht acu.  Go ginearálta, aithnímid gur athrú beag teicniúil atá i gceist anseo.  Molaimid an tAire Stáit faoin Bille seo a thabhairt chun cinn.  Táimid sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don leasú atá ar bun aige.</p></speech>

Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille ag dul tríd.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais agus le Vivian Uíbh Eachach as an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil a cuireadh ar fáil an bhliain seo caite.  Measaim gur cáipéis iontach tábhachtach é an caighdeán athbhreithnithe.  Molaim do scoileanna ar fud na tíre an caighdeán seo a fháil.  Cuireann an reachtaíocht seo bunús reachtúil ar an gcaighdeán freisin.  Táimid sásta leis sin.  Caithfimid cabhair a thabhairt don teanga i gcónaí agus deiseanna a thabhairt do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid.  Aontaím leis an moladh a rinne mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, go gcuirfí foclóir parlaiminteach agus reachtaíochta le chéile.  Bheadh sé sin an-úsáideach, fiú amháin dóibh siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge réasúnta acu.  Tacaímid leis an mBille seo.  Tá súil againn go rachfaidh sé i bhfeidhm mar Acht go luath.</p></speech>

Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh.  Má táimid ag iarraidh cur le húsáid na Gaeilge sa Pharlaimint seo, ba chóir go mbeimid in ann gach gné d'ár gcuid oibre a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge agus is mór an trua é nach mar sin atá.</p> <p>I will be accepting Senator Colm Burke's amendment to the Order of Business that his Bill be published and No. 10 be taken before No. 1.</p><p>Senators Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, Michael Mullins and Mary Moran spoke about the direct provision system and recommended that it be scrutinised further.  I agree it is a system that should be investigated more closely because the fact that €650 million has been spent on private companies gives cause for concern.  It has been acknowledged by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh that the asylum system and the processing of claims have improved significantly since the Minister for Justice and Equality took office and they will be improved still further, if possible.  Waiting times have decreased significantly.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden spoke about the need for a national investigation unit to be established.  I will raise this matter with the Minister.  </p><p>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú spoke about Marian Price.  The Taoiseach has agreed to raise the matter with the British Prime Minister.  I am sure he is aware of the timescale involved and that he will raise it prior to the review due to take place in a fortnight's time.  I appreciate the Senator's comments.  More certainly needs to be done.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is working hard on many of the issues raised by the Senator.</p><p>I have addressed the issues raised by Senators John Whelan and John Kelly.  I appreciate the concerns of front-line workers.  What we all want is a fair settlement for all workers in the public service.  As has been pointed out by Senator John Gilroy, there were significant reductions of up to 17% in the wages of public servants several years ago.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan spoke about Dingle and road signs.  I am glad that people will again be able to find their way around County Kerry.  </p><p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson thanked the Fianna Fáil leader for apologising for spending 14 years doing nothing.</p></speech>

I understand Deputy Micheál Martin has apologised for doing nothing for 14 years.  I will not comment further.</p><p>On the proposed increases at AIB, we will have to see what the Minister for Finance does.  Senator Mark Daly spoke about red tape.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has done an amount of work to cut red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises.  If there is further information on red tape in his area of responsibility, we would welcome him investigating the matter.  I am sure he would like to hear about the 70 jobs not being created because of red tape and if the Senator has details on the matter, I am prepared to pass them to the relevant Minister.</p><p>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill stated the apology was long overdue and that the redress scheme should not benefit the legal profession.  Senator Terry Leyden also raised this issue.  The Taoiseach specifically stated redress would be for the women themselves.  We should not allow a repeat of what happened previously under the redress board when lawyers received money that should have been targeted at the individuals concerned. </p><p>Senator Cáit Keane spoke about adoption rights.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be in the House next week or the following week and perhaps the Senator might raise the issue with her then.</p><p>I note the points raised by Senators Rónán Mullen, Martin Conway and others that not only the State but also the religious orders must be asked to contribute to the redress scheme.  Everybody would agree with this.</p><p>Senator John Gilroy has welcomed the fact that the full market value of €1.3 billion has been achieved in the sale of Irish Life.  This is another part of the jigsaw of recovering our economic sovereignty.</p><p>On the issue raised by Senator John Crown, I do not know who provides funding for the Irish Patients Association, but I will try to get an answer.</p></speech>

I hope this will be done at an early opportunity.</p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames spoke about debt write-offs by the banks for Independent News and Media and asked what preconditions had been set for banks.  I will raise her questions with the Minister for Finance and attempt to get answers for her.</p></speech>

Chuaigh an reachtaíocht seo go dtí an Dáil i mí Eanáir na bliana seo.  Níl anseo ach leasú teicniúil ar an mBille.  Is é an rud atá i gceist sa leasú ná aitheantas a thabhairt d'Achtanna eile a chuaigh tríd idir 2003 agus 2012.  Ba leasú teicniúil é seo a bhí molta ag an Dréachtóir Parlaiminte.  Achtaíodh an tAcht um Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais (Leasú) (Uimh. 2), 2012 ag deireadh na bliana seo caite.  D'uireasa an leasú seo, ní raibh aitheantas tugtha don Acht sin sa Bhille a cuireadh chun cinn ar dtús.  Rinne an Dáil an leasú teicniúil seo ar an mBille, a thionscnaíodh sa Teach seo, agus dá bhrí sin, tá sé mar oibleagáid orm teacht ar ais anseo chun cead an tSeanad a lorg i dtaobh an leasú seo.</p></speech>

Mar is cuimhin leis, dúirt muid nuair a bhí sé anseo roimhe seo go bhfuilimid i bhfábhar an Bhille seo.  Aithnímid an tábhacht a bhaineann leis ó thaobh comhtháthú na gnéithe éagsúla a bhaineann le chúrsaí aistriúcháin.  Tá lárnú á dhéanamh ar na seirbhísí sin faoi Thithe an Oireachtais.  Fáiltímid roimh an obair iontach maith a dhéanann Rannóg an Aistriúcháin anseo sna Tithe.  Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh le aitheantas a thabhairt d'fhoireann na rannóige faoin dtacaíocht ar fad a thugann siad dúinn.</p><p>Is trua é nach bhfuil cúpla leasú eile a chabhródh linn ag teacht chun cinn inniu.  Cé go bhfuil deis agam labhairt as Gaeilge sa Teach seo, mar atá mé ag déanamh faoi láthair, ní féidir liom mo chuid gnóthaí ar fad a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Ní féidir liom leasuithe a mholadh trí Ghaeilge, mar shampla.  Bhéinn ag súil go dtiocfadh a leithéid de leasú chun cinn.  Dá mbeadh reachtaíocht á n-aistriú againn de réir mar atáimid ag dul ar aghaidh, sílim nach mbeadh stádas den dara grád á thabhairt don Ghaeilge nuair atá Billí á fhoilsiú.  Is céim ar gcúl é nach bhfuilimid ag foilsiú na Billí go comhuaineach as Gaeilge as as Béarla.  Chuir an Rialtas siar an cinneadh atá ann maidir leis sin.</p><p>Tá sé tábhachtach, agus na gnóthaí seo á phlé againn, go ndéanfaimid scrúdú ar an téarmaíocht agus an foclaíocht a úsáidtear sa Seanad agus sa Dáil maidir le Billí, srl.  Rinneadh roinnt plé ar an ábhar seo ag Tóstal na Gaeilge ag an deireadh seachtaine.  Tuigtear dom go raibh foclóir parlaiminte ann roimhe seo.  Tá sé tábhachtach go ndéanfaí uasghrádú ar sin chun deis a thabhairt do Sheanadóirí agus do Theachtaí a dhéanann an-iarracht ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, an teanga a úsáid sa chomhthéacs seo.  Sílim go mbeadh sé úsáideach dá bhféadfaí leagan den foclóir parlaiminte sin a athfhoilsiú agus a thabhairt do na Baill ar fad.</p><p>Mhol duine éigin ag an deireadh seachtaine gur cheart do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin bileog eolais, a chlúdódh focail ábhartha Gaeilge a bheadh comónta, a fhoilsiú agus a sholáthar dúinn nuair a thagann Billí amach.  Bheadh sé úsáideach dá mbeimid in ann acmhainn den tsórt sin a úsáid agus reachtaíocht á phlé againn.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh an rannóg scrúdú ar an moladh sin, mar go bhfuil an téarmaíocht acu.  Go ginearálta, aithnímid gur athrú beag teicniúil atá i gceist anseo.  Molaimid an tAire Stáit faoin Bille seo a thabhairt chun cinn.  Táimid sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don leasú atá ar bun aige.</p></speech>

Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille ag dul tríd.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais agus le Vivian Uíbh Eachach as an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil a cuireadh ar fáil an bhliain seo caite.  Measaim gur cáipéis iontach tábhachtach é an caighdeán athbhreithnithe.  Molaim do scoileanna ar fud na tíre an caighdeán seo a fháil.  Cuireann an reachtaíocht seo bunús reachtúil ar an gcaighdeán freisin.  Táimid sásta leis sin.  Caithfimid cabhair a thabhairt don teanga i gcónaí agus deiseanna a thabhairt do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid.  Aontaím leis an moladh a rinne mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, go gcuirfí foclóir parlaiminteach agus reachtaíochta le chéile.  Bheadh sé sin an-úsáideach, fiú amháin dóibh siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge réasúnta acu.  Tacaímid leis an mBille seo.  Tá súil againn go rachfaidh sé i bhfeidhm mar Acht go luath.</p></speech>

Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh.  Má táimid ag iarraidh cur le húsáid na Gaeilge sa Pharlaimint seo, ba chóir go mbeimid in ann gach gné d'ár gcuid oibre a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge agus is mór an trua é nach mar sin atá.</p> <p>Ba cheart go mbeadh muid in ann gach gné de a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh ar ár gcumas moltaí agus leasuithe a mholadh trí mheán na Gaeilge chomh maith.  Táim ag súil le go dtiocfaidh an lá sin, ach tá a fhios agam gur de réir a chéile a thógtar na caisleáin.  Mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Broin, bheadh sé an-úsáideach dá mbeadh foclóir ar fáil anseo.  Tá an trealamh ar fáil dúinn uilig anseo chun éisteacht leis an aistriúcháin Gaeilge-Béarla más gá sin dúinn.  Ní bheadh aon fhadhb agam le na leabhair seo - an foclóir - a bheith ar fáil ar ghach binse freisin.  Meabhródh siad dúinn uilig go gcaithfimid ár n-iarracht a dhéanamh an mhéid agus is féidir linn.  Mar sin, tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an lá sin.  Inniu, tréasláim leis an Aire Stáit agus tacaím leis an mBille agus leis an leasú seo.</p></speech>

Sílim, mar adúirt an Seanadóir, go bhfuil comhtháthú á dhéanamh ar obair a bhí roinnte idir dhá oifig go dtí seo.  Tá an obair go léir ag dul ar ais arís go dtí Rannóg an Aistriúcháín, atá anseo ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Aon rud atá déanta ar son úsaide na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais, tá an chuid is mó den mholadh agus den chreidiúint don obair sin ag dul go dtí Rannóg an Aistriúcháin.  Beidh siad in ann cur leis an obair sin sna blianta amach romhainn ó tharla go bhfuil an dá fhoireann comhtháite le chéile anois agus go bhfuil oibrithe breise, triúr no ceathrar, istigh sa rannóg.</p><p>  Tá moltaí déanta ag Seanadóirí maidir le foclóir parlaiminte.  Tá saghas cuimhne agam go raibh foclóir de chineál éigin ann agus feicim go n-aontaíonn an Seanadóir Ó Murchú liom go raibh a leithéid ann san am a chuaigh thart.  Déanfaidh mé teagmháil le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin le fáil amach an bhfuil fáil ar an bhfoclóir sin go fóill, agus má tá, féachfaidh mé chuige go gcuirtear ar fáil é do na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí a theastaíonn sé uathu.  Is moladh fiúntach é sin agus táim cinnte go mbeidh an-fhonn ar Rannóg an Aistriúcháin cuidiú agus cabhair a thabhairt dóibh siúd a bhfuil suim acu úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge.  Maidir le duilleog eolais a chur ar fáil nuair a bhíonn Bille á chur ar fáil, is moladh fiúntach é sin.  Is cinnte go gcuirfidh oifigigh mo Roinne roimh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chomh maith.</p><p>  Táim an-buíoch do na Seanadóirí as an comhoibriú ar an Bhille sa Teach seo.  Tá sé ar ais anois san áit in ar thosnaigh sé.  Beidh sé ina reachtaíocht gan mhoill agus beidh muid uilig ag feidhmiú faoi na cúraimí úra atá á dtabhairt anois do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin.  Arís, gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir as a dtacaíocht agus a gcomhoibriú.  Cuirfear a gcuid tuairimí i láthair na rannóige agus táim cinnte go mbeidh toradh fónta orthu.  B'fhéidir nach mbeidh sé chomh deacair sin foclóir parlaiminte a chur ar fáil, mar tá cuimhne againn go raibh leabhrán ann uair amháin.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé as cló, ach má chuirtear i gcló arís é, is cinnte go mbeidh sé bunaithe ar an chaighdeán a bhfuil uasdhátú déanta air, mar atá luaite ag an Seanadóir ó Broin.</p><p>  Is rud maith é go mbeidh caighdeán amháin againn go léir.  Is féidir linn go léir ár gcuid canúintí a bheith againn.  Tagann an Seanadóir Ó Broin as Contae na Mí agus tá Gaeltacht sa chontae sin.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciarán Cannon" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000012#M00300"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the various Government initiatives being taken in the area of training and skills and further education and how this will impact on employment prospects for those we hope to support.</p><p>I am sure that the Members will all agree that the many challenges presented by the current economic and unemployment crisis require a positive, concerted and coherent response from all interested parties.  Government, training and education providers, and employers must all work together, domestically and internationally, locally and regionally to meet these significant challenges head-on.</p><p>The training and upskilling of the country's workforce through a variety of further education and training programmes is a vital element of this country's recovery from the current downturn.  It will also play a vital part in securing the future competitive advantage of all enterprises and in enhancing future growth in productivity in this country.</p><p>In the programme for Government we undertook to introduce a more focused, targeted approach regarding the State's engagement with and support of the unemployed to keep them close to the labour market, provide education and training opportunities and to get them back into the workforce.</p><p>The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  In 2012, the Government launched its Action Plan for Jobs, which is an ambitious jobs plan that aims to create the environment which will encourage the establishment of 100,000 new positions by 2016 and a further 100,000 by 2020.  A further iteration of the action plan is currently being finalised for 2013 and it will shortly be published.</p><p>My Department played a key role in the successful implementation of this plan with a number of initiatives that were monitored on a regular basis to track progress.  As part of this programme, the Government provided €20 million to establish a new Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund. The fund launched late last year is known as Momentum.  It is being managed by FÁS.  Momentum has been designed to provide targeted interventions to tackle the skills shortages in particular sectors of the Irish economy where vacancies have been identified.  FÁS has carried out extensive research at national and regional level to establish where are the skills shortages.  In responding to those skills shortages we will provide 6,500 training places for the long-term unemployed.   Some of the places have been targeted specifically at young unemployed people.  Momentum will be co-financed by the European Social Fund.</p><p>Skillnets, which is an industry-led, State-funded support body, also introduced a pilot management training initiative under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.  The new initiative is being branded as &quot;Management Works&quot; and has a budget of up to €1.2 million.  This pilot project is being implemented, including the roll-out of a range of training and development programmes available to help private sector small and medium enterprises to improve their performance through seeking to build their managerial capability, which will allow them to improve trading both nationally and internationally.</p><p>The action plan also contained a commitment to initiate a review of the Irish apprenticeship training model, with a view to providing an updated model of training that delivers the necessary skilled workforce to service the needs of a rapidly changing economy and ensures an appropriate balance between supply and demand.  This review is currently under way in the Department of Education and Skills and has been undertaken in two phases.</p><p>The first stage was the preparation of a background issues paper which provides, a factual description of the current system, including the governance arrangements, trends and forecasts in relation to recruitment, identifying strengths and weaknesses of the current model and identifying the range of possible options for change, as well as information on models of apprenticeship in other countries.</p><p>In 2013 it is proposed that the second phase of the review will involve consultation with all key stakeholders on the options for change.  The arrangements for this phase of the review are currently being finalised.  Our track record of apprenticeship provision is very strong but we need to examine the model and, perhaps, reconstruct it to meet the challenges of an ever changing and innovative jobs market.</p> <p>I was fortunate to meet at a recent event the global vice president of one of the world's biggest software companies.  The company employs 45,000 people worldwide, 2,000 of whom are based in Cork.  He told me that 85% of the company's revenue is now derived from products developed within the company over the last 18 months.  He said that any company which does not constantly innovate new products and services will be left behind.  Our apprenticeship model must be able to respond to demand and rapid change in the labour market to ensure the interventions we make through the apprenticeship model are meaningful for those partaking in it.  The model must allow us to be ever more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy.</p><p>The action plan for jobs saw the implementation of many of the recommendations of the joint Government-industry ICT action plan.  The ICT skills conversion programme supports the delivery in partnership with industry of intensive, level 8 ICT conversion programmes to build the domestic supply of high level ICT skills graduates.  More than 700 places were provided in the first phase of programmes from March 2012 and graduates will become available in the first half of 2013.  There are positive initial indications in respect of employment outcomes for the first phase participants.  A full evaluation of the first phase will be carried out in 2013.  One of the reasons the ICT conversion programme has been so successful in creating long-term sustainable careers is significant co-operation with the major ICT firms based in Ireland on the design of the programme curricula.  There has also been a significant work-placement element within the graduate skills conversion programme.  The Springboard and ICT skills programmes are two new competitive funding streams that have been introduced since 2011 to address the specific skills needs of enterprise and to support jobseekers to re-skill in areas where employment opportunities are emerging as the economy recovers.  To date, more than 10,000 unemployed or previously self-employed people have been provided with places under Springboard and a further 5,000 places are expected to be delivered in 2013.  Collaboration with industry is, again, very much to the forefront in the Springboard model.</p><p>To complement the action plan for jobs, the Government launched the pathways-to-work initiative which provides for a more realistic, targeted approach to help and support unemployed individuals, especially the long-term unemployed and young people, to stay close to the labour market.  The Government has also introduced a new integrated employment and support service entitled &quot;Intreo&quot; which is being managed under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.  The services and supports involved were previously provided by three distinct State services and the innovative integration of these supports has facilitated the development of a co-ordinated structure which provides unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, with options and assistance in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training.  Intreo provides a valuable and innovative one-stop-shop service in every region.  In addition, FÁS training services will facilitate unemployed individuals through a range of training programmes that provide industrially and occupationally specific skills as well as preparatory type training to enable a diverse range of unemployed individuals referred to FÁS through Intreo to gain a recognised qualification, access job opportunities or progress to further and higher education or training.</p><p>It is argued that the further education and training sector has grown in an uncoordinated way without strategic direction over many years.  VECs deliver further education while FÁS delivers training.  The current separation of further education and training is an obstacle to the delivery of a 21st-century service to jobseekers and learners.  We have a further education and training sector that is fragmented and in which a great deal of duplication takes place.  A lot of the same kinds of further education and training opportunities are delivered by VECs and FÁS, often in the same towns.  The Government decided in July 2011 to merge the further education and training services into a single cohesive unit under the strategic direction of a new further education and training authority called SOLAS.  FÁS will be dissolved as part of this process.  SOLAS will be a new organisation with a new mandate which will merge further education and training.  This represents possibly the most significant change in further education in over 70 years and the most significant change in the training sector since the establishment of FÁS over 25 years ago.</p><p>An action plan for the establishment of SOLAS was developed by a cross-departmental group which also included representatives from the further education sector and the private sector.  The plan was approved by the Cabinet committee on Pathways to Work and is available on the Department's website.  There is great potential in the sector which has not been unlocked to date because of the lack of an overarching vision and strategic delivery.  This is a time of great challenge for Ireland.  A world-class further education and training sector will help us get back on our feet and back to work through upskilling for the jobs and society of tomorrow.  SOLAS will bring a strategic direction to the sector and enable and empower the new education and training boards to deliver an integrated further education and training sector for our people.  The creation of SOLAS is part of a wider range of Government reforms in the areas of further education and training and the activation of the unemployed.  The Department of Social Protection is currently developing and rolling out the new national employment and entitlement service, Intreo.  As part of the process, responsibility for FÁS employment services and FÁS employment programmes which involve over 700 staff was transferred to the Department of Social Protection on 1 January 2012.  This reform provides a single point of contact for the establishment of entitlements and the activation of the unemployed.</p><p>There are currently 33 vocational educational committees delivering education including further education.  Legislation is now well advanced for the 33 VECs to be replaced by 16 education and training boards, or ETBs.  Following the creation of the new training boards and the establishment of SOLAS, FÁS training centres and related staff will be transferred on a gradual basis to the appropriate ETB dependant on geographic location and readiness for transfer.  FETAC, HETAC, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board have recently been amalgamated into Qualification and Quality Ireland, QQI, the new integrated body for quality and qualifications in Ireland.  A theme running through these reforms is integration.  Integrated services will be the most efficient, from a value-for-money point of view, and the most effective, from an outcomes and quality point of view.  Taking into account the relationships and dependencies that exist between each of these elements, the implementation of this wider reform process will prove extremely challenging and will require a dedication of purpose and a well planned programme of change.  As we carry out this fundamental restructuring of our VEC and training sectors, rationalising 33 VECs into 16 ETBs while transferring FÁS's training role to the latter, we must not forget those who are currently being supported through the system and to whom we are trying to provide the best training and further education opportunities.  They cannot be neglected during the process of transition.  It is not unlike trying to re-engineer an aeroplane while keeping it in the sky.  That is how difficult this will be.  My interaction with people in VECs and FÁS nationally indicates that they are enthused by the prospect of the merger and the possibilities it offers.  I have every confidence that they will quickly make this work well.</p><p>SOLAS will be tasked with ensuring the provision of 21st-century, high-quality FET programmes which provide value-for-money and are integrated, flexible and responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changed and changing economy.  We will put in place structures to assess quickly how effective the further education and training opportunities will be.  We will put in place software-based reporting mechanisms which allow people to provide almost instantaneous feedback to SOLAS and ETBs at regional level on the effectiveness of interventions and courses and on the supports they receive to re-engage with the labour market.  That vital data will be sourced from each learner and held at both regional and national level to inform the design of courses and the provision of other supports for learners.</p> <p>The repository of that data will be held at regional and national level and we will use the data to design course provision and other supports for learners.</p><p>The development of the strategy will involve consultation with the key stakeholders such as the ETBs and other providers of further education and training.  There is significant capacity in the private sector, providing excellent further education and training opportunities.  We will also consult the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Intreo, employers, Enterprise Ireland, the HEA and other bodies we consider appropriate.</p><p>SOLAS will not deliver programmes once the restructuring is complete.  Its key function will be to provide for strategic oversight and funding for the main deliverers, the ETBs, and, where appropriate, the private sector.  It will, however, maintain the delivery of FÁS services pending the completion of the transfer of the FÁS training division to the ETBs.  SOLAS will develop and facilitate the development of new and existing further education and training programmes to meet the changing needs of employers and the labour market.  It will also monitor the outputs and outcomes of these programmes to ensure they are relevant and delivered in an efficient and effective manner.</p><p>The Further Education and Training Bill 2013 was published recently.  Its main provisions are the establishment of SOLAS and the dissolution of FÁS.  It will also provide for the transfer of FÁS staff and property to SOLAS and, where appropriate, the onward transfer of staff to the appropriate ETB.  This legislation will be discussed in greater detail when it is presented to the House in the coming months.  I hope to bring it through both Houses by the end of May or early June.  The Government is determined that the establishment of SOLAS, combined with the establishment of the education and training board structures, with a modern Irish apprenticeship system, will provide that framework for the positive future management and development of the further education and training sector.</p><p>To complement these policy initiatives and despite reducing resources, the Government will fund up to 430,000 part-time and full-time education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2013.  Places on certain programmes have been prioritised specifically for those who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.  Since 2009 Ireland has obtained significant funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for training and up-skilling in respect of specific large-scale redundancies.  A typical EGF funded programme includes a mix of supports and allowances to assist the affected workers in re-skilling and up-skilling to maximise their opportunities of finding suitable alternative employment.</p><p>Ireland has made seven successful applications for EGF support.  Six of these programmes have been completed, with one programme in respect of redundant workers from the Talk-Talk call centre facility in Waterford, operating.  It is worth pointing out that from the six completed programmes to date more than 9,300 clients have benefited from EGF supports.</p><p>One of the priorities while Ireland is hosting the Presidency of the Council of the European Union will be the progression of discussions and agreement on the youth guarantee.  The Commission's proposal is for a Council recommendation that each member state ensure no person under 25 years of age will remain unemployed, whether after job loss or on leaving formal education, for more than four continuous months without a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship.</p><p>While there is no easy solution to reducing the number who are unemployed, I reassure the House that the Government is taking all necessary steps to ensure we have a labour force with the skills needed to avail of future job opportunities as and when they arise.  When the full extent of the reforms and new initiatives I have outlined is assessed, it is clear that the Government has a clear and structured framework for dealing with the skills agenda.  </p><p>I again thank Senators for inviting me to discuss this very important topic.  I look forward to hearing their views and contributions.</p></speech>

Fianna Fáil supports the proposed Bill that will formally change the name of FÁS to SOLAS and welcomes the extended role it will play in providing for oversight and direction for the further education sector.  Like FÁS, SOLAS will play a crucial role in meeting the skills requirements of the economy in the years to come.</p><p>  In yesterday's edition of <i>The</i><i>Irish Times </i>Brian Mooney published a comprehensive analysis of the key areas of the new structures in further education.  He makes the point that they need to serve learners and employers, not trainers and agencies.  A couple of key questions arise from this analysis.  The Minister of State has touched on some of them, for example, &quot;There is still enormous duplication of courses regionally, both within the PLC sector and between it and the parallel FÁS training system.  There are currently 180,000 further education and 75,000 training places provided in FÁS training centres ... Do the teaching staff within the further education and FÁS training services have the skills to educate and train people to the high standards required by multinational and domestic employers, particularly in ICT, foreign language skills, international business, engineering and technology?&quot;  He makes a valid point because while the job announcements made in the past couple of months are very welcome, it is obvious that a significant number of staff are being sourced overseas, primarily because people with the skills required, particularly in the IT sector and language skills, do not seem to be available here.  It is a worrying trend that while jobs are being created here, they do not seem to be making a significant dent in the overall unemployment figures.  This is a shifting model and people are rotating in and out regularly, but the unemployment rate of 14.6% remains stubbornly high for several years.  Obviously, this is an issue of great concern to the Government.  Will those who are educated and trained meet the needs of those who are creating jobs? </p><p>  There also seems to be a trend to award a growing share of the budget to private sector colleges and trainers.  Other questions arise in this regard.  For example, the Minister of State talks about integration which will have to happen between FÁS trainers and the vocational teaching sector, but FÁS trainers enjoy higher pay scales than teachers and do not enjoy anything like the same holidays.  Does the Minister of State have a view as to how these two groups of public servants could be integrated into a single service under the management of the proposed ETBs because obviously there is a need for 24-7, year round involvement?</p><p>  Other questions arise in spite of what the Minister of State has outlined.  There has been a significant number of budget cuts in the sector.  For example, the pupil-teacher ratio is rising from 17:1 to 19:1, which will result in the loss of 200 whole-time equivalent teaching posts, which must have some impact on training.  The training allowances for further education and training scheme participants are reduced, with the result that participants in VTOS, Youthreach, FÁS and further training programmes who move from jobseeker's payments will no longer have their new payments increased to a maximum of &#8364;188 per week in cases in which their jobseeker's allowance is lower.  This is a disincentive.  The allocation to the VECs has been reduced by &#8364;13 million in the budgetary proposals.  The &#8364;300 cost of education allowance payable to back-to-education allowance participants is to be discontinued.  These cuts are bound to impact on the Government's very genuine aspirations that the Minister of State outlined and these questions need to be addressed.</p><p>  On apprenticeships, Mr. Brian Mooney writes: &quot;During the boom we developed a system of apprenticeship training that was convoluted, expensive and served the needs of FÁS rather than of employers and trainees.&quot;  It is interesting to note that during a time of high employment, the Celtic tiger years, the FÁS budget was in excess of &#8364;1 billion per year, an extraordinary amount of money.  The collapse of the construction sector created enormous difficulties, particularly for &quot;some students, caught in the middle of their four-year apprenticeship cycle here, to complete their training in the UK.&quot;  This was facilitated by FÁS.  It is interesting that Mr. Mooney draws attention to the fact that &quot;The move revealed an anomaly in our training model; these students were brought to full qualification in just four months in the UK.&quot;</p> <p>A lengthy Irish apprenticeship model was designed, as he put it, to provide years of employment for FÁS trainers, which was wasteful and made no sense whatever.  The Minister of State has outlined this under various headings, and there are so many that one could do a thesis on what each heading will achieve.  The Minister of State has so many headings in his presentation that he should be complimented on having an understanding of them all.</p><p>I hope these questions will be addressed, and as the Minister of State has correctly indicated, the integration of the vocational and training sector under the new education and training boards, ETBs, is a challenge.  We will discuss that when the Education and Training Boards Bill comes before the House.  That will create a new environment that will challenge all the providers.</p><p>The Minister of State indicated that SOLAS will not deliver the programmes and its key function will be to provide strategic oversight and funding to the main deliverers - the ETBs - and where appropriate, the private sector.  In the mid-1990s, the National Economic and Social Forum considered a report published about local employment offices, with the idea being that gaps in jobs would be identified in regions, with those who were unemployed being interviewed, profiled and put into either training programmes or jobs.  Is that an element of the Minister of State's proposals and will there be an integrated approach going to the core of the unemployed?</p><p>There will be difficulties in the regions, where there is an increasing imbalance.  Most of the job announcements we have seen over the past couple of years have tended to come in clusters along the east coast, Cork and Limerick.  As I come from the west and north west, like the Minister of State, I am concerned about this difficulty.  The Government cannot be blamed for this.  I spoke with somebody in the IDA recently about the regional imbalance and the lack of visits by the organisation to various counties in the north west and western seaboard as distinct from visits to the eastern counties.  It seems that companies considering Ireland make a decision to go where there are population clusters and do not go where they will not be able to avail of skills.  Nevertheless, there are a number of multinational companies in my own part of the world, including Bank of America MBNA, which is located in Carrick-on-Shannon and provides over 1,000 jobs.  There has never been a difficulty in filling those jobs.  Abbott in Sligo is a pharmaceutical company and there is no difficulty in filling jobs.  Fruit of the Loom was originally in Donegal and commercial considerations saw it fail rather than a lack of labour availability.</p><p>Does the Government have any input in this area?  Astonishingly, the person from the IDA told me that some companies take the view when considering the global market for job locations that if it is out of Dublin, it is out of Ireland.  That was the term used.  In other words, if the company is unable to locate in Dublin's conurbation, it will not locate in Ireland at all.  That is astonishing when we consider that we are selling the country's advantages, including a very impressive corporation tax rate and a highly-educated, English-speaking labour force.  It seems that when companies consider Ireland, they do not appear to countenance the provinces or regions.</p><p>I know the Government cannot force companies to provide jobs to those regions overnight by magic and multinationals have people to make their decisions.  Nevertheless, there must be a meeting of minds and the Government must try to grasp the particular difficulty that exists.  Increasingly, there will be a drift in the population to the east coast, and that is already happening.  One can see it in demographic analyses and political landscapes that are changing, particularly in light of the new proposed council structures.  The Minister of State may have a view in that regard.</p><p>I appreciate that when the Government officials sit down with industrialists or those thinking of locating in Ireland, we welcome the jobs, no matter where they are.  I do not want to give the impression that I begrudge jobs being placed in Louth, Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The regional imbalance is creating enormous social difficulties and will affect the fabric of our society in the west and north west.</p></speech>

I am sure we all read Mr. Brian Mooney's excellent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, which considered an Seirbhísí Oideachais Leanúnaigh agus Scileanna, or SOLAS.  He asked if SOLAS is the new FÁS, can it make a difference?  He indicated that the challenges facing SOLAS and the new education and training boards are enormous.  Senator Mooney referred to the fact that &#8364;1 billion per year was spent during the boom on courses by FÁS, and that was a time of full employment.  Unfortunately, a great percentage of that money went on flights, accommodation and fine wines for board members.  We cannot let that happen again.</p><p>  There is the question of whether the teaching staff in the system have the necessary skills.  How will we fuse trainers in the old FÁS with the teachers in the further education colleges, where there are different conditions of employment and holidays?  In institutes of technology and colleges, there is &#8364;500 million of investment sitting idle for months every year, including at night and on Sundays, when they are closed completely.  We should use these facilities for accelerated training programmes, whether aimed at the employed or unemployed.  It is just as important to upskill people while they are employed as when they are unemployed.  Most people have three different careers in their work life so when they have employment, we should keep reskilling them through courses and training.  That would be plenty for SOLAS and the further education system to do under the new education boards.</p><p>  With this new structure, we must align our skills with employment.  Senator Mooney referred obliquely but kindly to the fact that the first generation of people brought in by PayPal, for example, may be brought in because language skills may not be the best in local recruits.  I have discussed the issue in my local area and I hope to move on it.  We should be educating our young people in Dundalk and its environs in language skills to suit the market for which PayPal is catering.  The next generation of workers would be exclusively local as a result, meaning that they would come from the north east and raise the employment levels to where they should be.</p> <p>The further education colleges, of which we have two fine institutions in Louth, O'Fiaich Institute of Further Education in Dundalk and Drogheda Institute of Further Education, can play their part with SOLAS.  This is practical, not theoretical.  I have spoken with the head of PayPal and she believes this will work, which will mean her company will stay in the area a little longer.  I am glad to tell Senator Mooney that the recently announced 400 new jobs with eBay in Dundalk will be sourced locally.</p><p>We need to open colleges at off-peak times for everyone.  We need them buzzing with education and training.  The old ways - where one did a bit of training here and there, where one was meant to be trained for a week but was only trained for a day, where one went in at 10 a.m. and home at 3 p.m., where one did not learn any computer skills but learned how to brush the floor - are gone.  This is a unique opportunity for us to give our people - not only our young people but people of all ages, as well as those beyond retirement age - new skills so they can contribute to the new Ireland and the new economy.</p><p>The Minister of State said the Further Education and Training Bill 2013 will be coming through to the House in the coming months.  Will he be more specific as to when it will be before the House?  I thank the Minister of State for attending the House for this important debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000016#Q00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of the State to the House for this debate on the future of further education and training.  I compliment him for the wide-ranging initiatives in which he, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Government have engaged.</p><p>I come to this debate as a professional educator - as a theorist and practitioner of further education, adult and community education and training.  I also founded a voluntary organisation that has operated in this field over the past 25 years, An Cosán.  It has designed and delivered education and training from basic literacy to third level degrees, inclusive of training and ongoing professional development and the establishment of a social franchise in early years education that now employs over 100 people, most of whom we trained ourselves.  We have worked side by side with the public sector, FÁS and the vocational education committees and in collaboration with the voluntary sector, ably represented by AONTAS and NALA.</p><p>Although our time is short for today's debate, it is a genuine opportunity to have an exchange of views prior to the taking of the Further Education and Training Bill 2013 in the Seanad.  I hope our points and questions may influence the Government's presentation of the Bill to the House.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on the scale of the transformation process in further education.  They have set in train a move towards a vision of integration and co­operation at national, regional and local level.  This is central to a vision that could really work and enable SOLAS to be a beacon of light for the future.  The Ministers have stated they are developing a whole-of-government approach, insisting on co­ordination among the three primary Departments - Education and Skills, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is a great goal.  They also have laid out how SOLAS will drive co-ordination and integration at national, regional and local level, another great goal.</p><p>What is not as explicit in the Further Education and Training Bill - and it needs to be - is the co­ordination and co-operation that must happen between the three primary sectors of further education and training, namely the public sector, the voluntary and NGO sector and the private sector.  The Bill refers consistently to the design and delivery of training by public and other bodies.  Will the Minister of State please consider including in the Bill a name for the sector in the future that is consonant with the make-up of the sector as it is in the present?  I am deeply concerned, as are many others, that with the establishment of SOLAS and the enactment of the Further Education and Training Bill 2013, the public sector will swamp and swallow the vibrant, effective and long-standing voluntary sector, inclusive of adult and community education.  This must not happen.  A prime ingredient of Ireland's recovery from this deep recession is the effective education, training and placement of those without jobs, especially the long-term unemployed, as well as those living and working within social contexts of disadvantage.  The voluntary sector of adult and community education carries a wealth of know-how that works in theory and in practice.  The future of further education and training ought to ensure there is a prime place for such know-how.</p><p>Our vision of integration within this sector must ensure the design and delivery of every programme is learner-centred and always provides integration of education with training.  How can this happen?  It can happen through a pedagogy and curriculum that focuses on the interaction between students, teachers and the wider society.  The curriculum is not simply the set of learning outcomes but, rather, engagement with information, knowledge and thinking.  This is fundamental to all education but, in particular, further education, as it serves people who may have been failed by their previous schooling.  At the end of every programme we need critical and creative thinkers and skilled and capable employees.  A learner's charter, named in the Bill, would also contribute to this.</p><p>The strategies of SOLAS and of the education and training boards ought to ensure, especially through the quality control of programmes and support of the ongoing professional development of educators and trainers that is envisaged, that our future workforce will be engaged citizens, supporting the development of the person, our communities and our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000016#Q00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p><p>The education system has a key role to pay in fostering and developing the skills and innovation base to support economic recovery, as well as the development and expansion of the enterprise sector.  We have a significant problem with youth unemployment, with 82,000, or 14%, of our 15 to 24 year olds currently unemployed.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the Government's commitment to the youth guarantee.  In the past, many of those who left school early went on to complete apprenticeships or got jobs in the retail or service sectors.  These opportunities, however, dried up almost completely with the onset of the recession.  Many of these young people are now choosing to stay on or return to education to give themselves the best chance of securing employment as the economy recovers.</p><p>Further education and training has been provided over the years by a range of agencies, with an investment total of some €900 million annually at present.  There are approximately 9,000 staff employed in centres offering over 270,000 places to learners on full-time, part-time, formal and informal courses.  The aim of these courses has been to meet the needs of early school leavers, to provide second-chance education for people who did not complete the leaving certificate and to provide vocational preparation and training for labour market entrants and re-entrants.  In 2012, for example, there were 32,688 places on post-leaving certificate courses for learners over 16 years of age who had completed the leaving certificate, or equivalent, or who are adults returning to education.  There are also part-time programmes such as the back to education initiative, the advantages of which are important for those who avail of them and which I have experienced as an educator.</p> <p> Up to now, one of the largest providers of further education and training has been FÁS.  Last year, FÁS provided 81,500 market-led and client-focused training interventions for unemployed people, with a total investment of €420 million in current expenditure.  One of the excellent initiatives the Government has rolled out is the Momentum programme, which will provide 6,500 places for the long-term unemployed.  The programme started in December.  However, this sector of our education system has been crying out for change.</p><p>The Government has embarked upon a major programme of reform to ensure our education and training programmes are fit for purpose.  There is little doubt that there has been duplication of courses across the spectrum and there are areas of provision that need complete reform if we are to ensure that taxpayers are to get the best possible value for money.  We have to embrace change.  We all know the FÁS brand been somewhat tarnished in recent years.  I welcome the new training and education authority, SOLAS, which will be responsible for commissioning and funding the delivery of the service from the 16 new education and training boards, which, in turn, will replace the 33 existing VECs.  The boards will be responsible for the planning and delivery of all vocational training and further education in their regions.  SOLAS will also have the freedom to commission private sector providers as it deems appropriate.  Further education and training will no longer be an indistinct sector with no real identity; rather, it will be more akin to the higher education sector, with SOLAS having many parallels with the Higher Education Authority.  A core part of its role will be to ensure the referral of jobseekers to appropriate courses, and therefore the inclusion of a guidance service will be important.</p><p>Questions have been raised in the past about the quality and relevance of courses at this level.  With so many providers and programmes, it has been difficult indeed to ensure that the learner gets the best possible teaching and training.  SOLAS will have a role in auditing and quality-assuring the programmes that are delivered and it will have the task of ensuring that teachers and trainers undergo continuous professional development as well.  We have discussed the importance of continuous professional development previously.</p><p>As in all areas of education, the learner should be at the core of the process.  Having spent time in Youthreach courses, I am mindful that if trainees are not interested in what they are doing and if the courses supplied for them are merely gap-fillers or are run because the teacher was available in a given subject, then problems arise.  The key to ensuring students remain on courses and interested is to make the courses trainee-centred.</p><p>I have no doubt there are challenges ahead, not least those surrounding the differing terms and conditions of employment of teachers in further education services and those of FÁS trainers, to which we have referred already.  I know the area of holidays is an issue, because courses run by FÁS, Youthreach and SOLAS are to be run year-round, whereas in the schools the term is shorter.  Integrating the two systems will not be easy.</p><p>We keep coming back to the recent job announcements in the digital economy sector, such as those at eBay and PayPal, based in my home town.  They have brought a great sense of hope to those seeking employment but they have also brought into focus the urgent need for our workforce to have skills in information and communications technology, foreign languages, international business, engineering and technology.  This is something we are all pushing for.  Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to this issue earlier and I am aware from speaking with Louise Phelan that this is an issue.  Senator D'Arcy was right to suggest that we need to ensure this is addressed for the next generation, and we need to put the emphasis on teaching foreign languages, especially Chinese, which is causing a problem at the moment.  SOLAS will work with those experts who can forecast future skills needs in order that courses can be developed to respond to the needs of the economy.</p><p>As I stated earlier, the further education and training sector of the education system has been crying out for reform.  There is no doubt that excellent work is being done by passionate and dedicated people in VECs, FÁS training units, colleges of further education and so on.  The changes proposed in the Further Education and Training Bill will put learners at the heart of the process and ensure they are empowered to access the courses they need and that they can progress through the system and achieve their goals.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on the great work that has been done and on their implementation of the greatest change to further education that has taken place in more than 70 years and the greatest change in the training sector since FÁS was established more than 25 years ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000017#R00200"><p>The Minister of State is welcome back to the House, having spent several years here previously.  I have had a most interesting week.  I am following two Dundalk speakers.  I found myself in the Dundalk Institute of Technology two days ago.  One thing that surprised me about the group I met and the class I lectured to was that they were studying entrepreneurship.  It was not a full course but a module that is part of every course, which everyone does when they study business in Dundalk Institute of Technology.  I found it fascinating to meet those involved because they were Chinese or African and strangers in Dundalk.  Clearly, entrepreneurship is something that is very important.  It is not only a question of learning skills that one can use but of learning how to learn.  This seemed to be the most important thing coming across from the course.</p><p>Another visit took place in this building the following day at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, of which I am a member.  We had a visit from the Open Ireland.  The main speaker was Sean O'Sullivan, a fascinating man I had not met before.  He set up a business in Cork and was one of the inventors of the term &quot;cloud computing&quot; some years ago.  He was one of the &quot;Dragons' Den&quot; people.  His main point was that the jobs that will exist in ten years' time do not exist now.  Therefore, the question is how we can train people for that.  He provided a good example.  One of his colleagues at the meeting explained that if a person decides to be a doctor, he does not study to be a surgeon or dermatologist at the initial stage.  He studies for six years to be a doctor and then he decides what area in which to specialise.  In other words, in the case of information and communications technology, a person needs to get a broad understanding, mostly about how to learn, and then decide what he will study afterwards.  It is fascinating, because we have a great deal to learn about children's education as well.</p><p>The Springboard initiative was mentioned earlier.  I served on the board of one of the committees of Springboard for two years.  The initiative is clearly doing a great deal.  Reference was made to the fact that 10,000 people have gone through Springboard courses.  These are courses run for people who have already received education but whose education is not suitable for jobs now.  Many of them are architects and engineers but they need to study something else now.  A further 5,000 will go though the programme this year.</p><p>I made another visit almost two years ago to Tralee.  I met Jerry Kenneally, who sold his business and then built up a new business and decided he wanted to live in Ireland.  He decided entrepreneurship was the important element.  He put his money into teaching transition year youngsters of 15 and 16 years of age about entrepreneurship.  For the programme to work, those involved had to train teachers to teach entrepreneurship.  They get 600 pupils from throughout Kerry, who come to Tralee for one session at the beginning of the school term.  I was sitting with a young woman at the session who explained that the previous year she had done the course in entrepreneurship.  One of the challenges for the students is to see a problem and then solve it.  She had found a problem and then solved it.  She now employs one person, her father, a great achievement for a 15 year old.  She is now in fifth year and she exports to 22 countries and sells a product for €17.99 on her Internet site.  At 15 years of age, this girl saw a challenge as something she could take on.  I discovered young people who were learning many other things as well.</p><p>It is interesting that, as Sean O'Sullivan said, many of the jobs that will exist in five years' time do not exist at the moment.  How do we give citizens the skills they need to succeed in their personal and professional lives?  How do we prepare them for the future given that, according to a recent estimate, 65% of children entering a primary school this year will end up working in careers that have not been invented yet?</p><p>We need to learn cognitive and non-cognitive skills.</p> <p>In addition to the specialised technical skills, it is crucial that we teach children how to learn in order that they can easily pick up new skills.  I served a five year term as chairman of the applied leaving certificate programme and my experience prompts me to ask some broad questions about education.  Do all students learn in the same way?  Should we ignore international research on multiple forms of intelligence?  Do students learn best in isolation?  Is one main method of written assessment dependable?  There must be better ways of teaching.  Could a strong policy be developed to reflect the importance of lifelong learning?  Could we number our school years from birth rather than primary school to underline the importance of preschool years in a child's development?  The education cycle begins at birth.  It is interesting to see how my two recent grandchildren learn while they are a few months old.  One of the most interesting messages on education is advocated by the World Bank which argues that education should focus on basic cognitive skills such as reading, writing and communication until children are 17 or 18 years old and that vocational training should wait.  We are well aware of the large number of children in this country who left school to enter trades and lacked the skills to adapt when the economy changed.  Focusing on basic skills will allow for a flexible workforce.  Poland was able to use such an asset in the aftermath of the economic and financial crisis.  A number of experts point to Poland's flexible workforce as the reason for its continued economic growth.  Ireland can learn a lesson from this example.  </p><p>I am delighted that the Minister of State spoke about the youth guarantee.  The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has pointed out that we do not have to invent something new because New Zealand, Austria and Sweden have already introduced a youth guarantee.  Therefore, we know how to do it.  </p><p>One of the elements I would like to stitch into this discussion is the importance of entrepreneurship in order that people would be expected to do it themselves rather than always expecting somebody else to do it for them.  I was delighted to hear Senator D'Arcy speak about the lack of use of facilities, particularly in institutes of technology, which lie vacant all summer and over many weekends.  There must be better ways of doing this.  I know the Minister of State's heart is in the right place.  Let us make sure we support him any way we can.</p></speech>

As I studied multiple intelligences for my masters degree, I followed Senator Feargal Quinn's comments with interest.  I commend the Minister of State and the Government for their reforming agenda for further education and training which aims to future proof the sector in order that it can deliver a 21st education and training programme.</p><p>What is traditionally assessed as intelligence suits the socially dominant group which has largely defined the nature of legitimate knowledge in education.  Often the cultural values and beliefs in education and societal structures mirror the values of dominant groups.  The exception is adult education and I hope this will be preserved.  What is involved in adult education today should be brought to primary level.  Our education system has left many adults behind and continues to fail many citizens.  We must address the urgent social need behind the fact that not every citizen learns in the same way by catering for a wider spectrum of intelligence and, therefore, a larger population cohort.  We should have equal regard for other forms of intelligence.  While it is important that we value linguistic, logistical and mathematical intelligence, we must teach in a way that encompasses all of the intelligence of a person, with equal regard for dancers, designers, entrepreneurs, artists and musicians.  </p><p>The VEC delivers further education programmes, whereas FÁS provides training.  Both should be encompassed within a multiple intelligence sphere which recognises no difference between training and education.  We should assist students in critical and creative thinking competencies and encourage intellectual empowerment.  Perhaps if we had more critical thinkers when the Magdalen laundries were operating, they would have asked more questions about what was happening.  I hope this aspect of adult education will continue to be nurtured.  </p><p>Senator Katherine Zappone spoke about the community and voluntary sector.  An Cosán could be a model for the new SOLAS and adult education programmes.  I am working with architects to find out whether university training of architects is better than vocational training.  Accredited prior learning, APL, in education has to be developed further.  We have an ideal opportunity with the education boards coming under SOLAS to consider how APL, that is, what an individual brings through lifelong learning, can be accredited.  Architecture is one area we could consider in this regard, although it might take some time to put a system in place.  Training on the job and learning by doing are just as good as learning from books.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure a methodology is put in place for all sectors of education for APL.  There is an opportunity in the context of the draft building regulations to develop such a system through the vocational and community sector.</p><p>I have more to say, but the Leas-Chathaoirleach has indicated my time is up.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, for the job they are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian Ó Domhnaill" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000018#S00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of further education and training.  This is a particularly important subject in the current climate of high unemployment among those who have skills in an industry which is no longer creating jobs.  Many left college or school to work in construction.  They fell out of education because a more handsome living could be made in a sector which was creating employment and opportunities at the time.  Many of these individuals now find themselves in limbo and the vast majority are young men.  Unfortunately, many of them are either unemployed at home, trying to enroll in a course of choice or working abroad.  That is the sad aftermath of the Celtic tiger and the construction industry boom.</p><p>I concur with Senator Feargal Quinn on taking a holistic approach to education.  It is important not only to focus on the participant but also to be forward thinking in regard to where we are going as a country in the next 20 to 30 years.  We have to ask ourselves what types of jobs will be available in ten or 20 years time.  I was often critical of the educational element of FÁS as providing courses as knee-jerk reactions.  Long after the construction sector had collapsed, courses in stone work, brick laying and plastering were being offered to young men.  There was no change in the organisation.</p> <p> As a country and on behalf of the people, we and the Government must look at what is coming down the tracks and how we should plan for that.  Senator Quinn was right that we must start at preschool and primary school level and carry on into secondary school level.  We must look at issues like language.  Irish people are applying for jobs now, but many of them are not being called for interview because they do not have the correct language skills on their CVs.  We must look at that.  We must also look at IT skills, communication skills and all that revolves around these.  We are now living in a multimedia society and 54% of web browsing is now done from a mobile phone.  The idea of sitting behind a computer desk is changing.  This area will continue to evolve and job opportunities will arise through the new technology in the years ahead.  SOLAS should contain some kind of technology hub, particularly as it is responsible for the policy element of driving this agenda.  The education and training boards come under the second piece of legislation and they will drive training and education.  However, we must have a forward-thinking policy unit within SOLAS to look at what is coming down the tracks, to adapt to that and to plan ahead for five, ten, 15, 20 and even 30 years.</p><p>Career guidance is a vitally important area.  Many children at secondary level and many young adults out of work need support in the area of career guidance.  Unfortunately, career guidance hours have been cut drastically in second level.  I believe it has never been more important to have career guidance at second level as it is now, because people heading for third level need that help now.  They need help from professional career guidance teachers.  The reduction in the number of hours for career guidance should be reversed.</p><p>I have many other points I wish to make, but I may forward them to the Minister.  For example, the Pathways to Work document published by the Government focuses on the labour activation measures and does not take into consideration, for example, the accessibility and quality of job placements, guidance and counselling services, the relevance and quality of training and the education programmes available.  Soft skills relate more to what can be provided through guidance and counselling services and these are important to young people.  They need to be equipped with these skills.</p><p>I touched on the need for a root and branch review of the courses currently available.  There are 270,00 people undertaking courses at the present time within FÁS, community schemes and private operations across the range of further training and education, FTE, courses.  Many of these courses are very good, but many of the individuals undertaking them do not want to be on those courses.  The courses they want to be on are full or are not available.  There will be new opportunities with the new structures being put in place, but these must be adaptable and forward-thinking.  The courses of relevance to people who want to participate in them must be made available.  Private providers must be adaptive also.  If funding is being made available by the educational training boards to private providers, those providers have an obligation to provide adaptive, foward-thinking courses.  Perhaps I will send on details of some of the points I wished to make to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000019#T00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  When I started looking at the literature on this area, I was quite surprised by the extent and importance of the further education and training sector.  It is worth &#8364;900 million per year and there are approximately 270,000 places in it in both part-time and full-time equivalent courses.  There are four full-time further education courses and five part-time courses.  In total, there are nine programmes and in the region of 192,741 participants.  Therefore, this is an important sector of our economy.  One of the things that most surprised me about this sector, apart from the range of programmes and the numbers participating, was the value for money.  It was quite surprising to see that in 2012, provision under Youthreach was &#8364;70 million for 3,700 places and that under the vocational training opportunity scheme, VTOS, &#8364;80 million was spent in 2012 for 6,000 places.  This represents good value for money.</p><p>  Today, we must accept the reality that many of these courses grew, like layers of an onion, one on top of the other.  We must all accept that FÁS has become a damaged brand and that it is necessary, in order to maintain confidence in the area of training, for FÁS to move on to another existence.  During the Celtic tiger years unemployment remained stubbornly high, despite the fact the economy never had it so good.  Therefore, there is an issue in terms of the effectiveness and reach of our further education and training programmes.  If they did not achieve that reach when times were good, we must look strategically at how they can achieve that reach when times are not so good.</p><p>  I fully accept what other speakers have said, in particular Senator Quinn, with regard to the challenges facing modern society.  I was struck by something I read in the book <i>The Empty Raincoat</i>  by Charles Handy a number of years ago.  He said that in the future people would have to deal with the idea of a portfolio of careers.  He suggested the job for life was gone, as was the idea that one could stay in one occupation, even with different employers.  He said we would all have to be a lot more adaptable.  </p><p>  I want to address some remarks to the Minister of State in regard to the further education part of this debate.  While people constantly applaud this country on its high overall skills profile in the context of school leavers who participate in higher education, which is something of which we can be proud, these figures mask an underlying difficulty.  The CSO indicates that 52% of the population over 18 has not achieved more than secondary school education.  Also, our universities and ITs have a weaker adult education profile than, for example, their UK counterparts.  Further education has a critical role to play in addressing this problem.  The further education sector in Ireland is more fragmented and marginal than it is in the UK.  The areas covered under further education in this country come under a number of umbrellas, whereas in the UK there are specialist further education colleges.  As a result, our sector is weaker and less able to compete and engage with employers. </p><p>  My final point relates to the move to integrate FÁS and the VECs under the umbrella of SOLAS.  This is welcome, but rather than running the whole provision through a centralised agency, with little local accountability, consideration should be given to the structure of SOLAS.  It should be structured through the establishment of local autonomous bodies with their own locally appointed boards.  This is critical for real engagement with local employers and communities.</p></speech>

We all know that investment in education and training is vital for the economy and society.  It is even more important during a time of recession to address people's skills deficits and to improve their employability so as to empower them to move from forms of employment, such as construction, into new areas of job growth.  This must be our priority.  We need to ensure that every cent of additional money provided to us by external sources, such as the EU, is used for its intended purpose of ensuring that additional benefit is brought to those in need of support.</p><p>Some Senators mentioned earlier that they had concerns and I share their concern regarding the reduction of overall expenditure for the further education sector and the difficulties that have been experienced as a result. </p> <p>Although the CE scheme does not fall under the Minister of State's portfolio, it should be noted that it provides a vital bridge for many people, especially those in areas of high unemployment and social disadvantage.  While there was a partial reversal of the cuts made in budget 2012, the net reduction in expenditure has created real problems.  The same can be said for the PLC courses.  A cut of €13.2 million was announced for the VEC sector.  The increase in the pupil–teacher ratio from 17:1 to 19:1 not only affects teaching jobs but also the training provided.  It is a cut that is impossible to justify.  It does not acknowledge that the education system is not a one-size-fits-all system.  The courses in question provide an important educational platform for those who want to advance to university or institutes of technology.</p><p>The leaving certificate examination is considered the minimum qualification, yet the majority of adults in the State do not have the certificate.  Therefore, the importance of the further education sector cannot be overstated.  Many learners who benefit from PLC courses are mature students returning to formal education after a considerable period.  This means they need additional and specific supports in making the transition back to full-time education, particularly in order to enhance literacy and numeracy skills, which are essential to employment prospects.  Not only will the change to the pupil-teacher ratio at PLC level result in the loss of teaching jobs, it will also bring a forced end to many specialised courses regarded as essential for the reskilling of adult learners.</p><p>In his speech, the Minister of State referred to the European globalisation adjustment fund.  I am concerned about the mismanagement associated with the fund.  The Minister of State has been hands-on in respect of it but serious questions arose over how it was managed.  I would be interested in receiving an update from the Minister of State on the total proportion of the fund due to be returned from the State, that is, from all the now-closed projects, including the programme for redundant construction workers.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on the money that has been spent, be it in respect of Waterford Crystal, SR Technics or redundant construction workers.  It was used to subsidise pre-existing supports for the workers rather than to provide tailor-made additional interventions, as the rules of the fund require.</p><p>Let me touch on a matter that the Minister of State mentioned in his speech regarding the guarantee.  The Tánaiste made great play last week of the agreement, worth €6 billion, in respect of the European youth unemployment fund on the conclusion of the budget negotiations.  Can the Minister of State outline what investment the Government intends to make to match the small EU allocation?  Can he commit that the money will be additional rather than taken out of existing programme funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000020#U00200"><p>Much of what I wanted to say has already been articulated.  I commend the Minister of State on how he is dealing with the SOLAS issue, etc.</p><p>I was at an international conference in Austria over the weekend that dealt specifically with unemployment among the disabled throughout the world, particularly in Europe.  Graduates with disabilities face a serious problem in getting a fair crack of the whip at interviews.  Last week, we noted the results of the epilepsy society's survey indicating that one in two employers would not give a job to somebody with epilepsy.  This is absolutely appalling in this day and age.  Furthermore, one in five members of the public felt people with epilepsy are being stigmatised because of their condition.  This is just one example.  If the same survey was carried out in regard to other disabilities, I have no doubt the figures would reflect exactly the same trend.  This is a pan-European problem.  There is absolutely no reason this country cannot become a model of best practice in dealing with the problem and ensuring people with disabilities are given the same opportunities once they have proven they have the ability and skillset to do a job.  By ensuring this, a disability would not hinder one at interview or in securing the job.</p><p>There is no point in Ireland seeking a model of international best practice because it does not exist, except in the United States.  Therefore, we need to set the standard for international best practice.  The vast majority of people in this nation believe in equality, yet their view is not manifesting itself considering what I have said is the practice on the ground, that is, the breaching of basic human rights, namely, the rights to work, pay one's taxes and contribute to society.</p><p>The Minister of State's Department has a critical role to play in that people with disabilities who are capable of acquiring the necessary skillset have the opportunity to do so.  We need to see very focused tailor-made programmes to deal with this epidemic.  That is all it can be described as.  Many people with disabilities are in so-called sheltered employment or internships.  All this is doing is making the figures look good.  One would be frightened by the real unemployment statistics pertaining to the disabled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciarán Cannon" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000020#U00300"><p>As a former Member of this House, I was often concerned about Ministers who, on having delivered their opening address and listened intently to the debate, delivered a closing address without addressing any of the issues raised during the contributions.  I will try as best I can not to allow that to happen in this instance, bearing in mind that I have but five minutes.  A number of common themes and trends arose in the discussion.  If I do not mention individual contributions, I hope Senators will not feel slighted.</p><p>One reason the process of reform is under way to bring together the further education and training sectors is to be able to leverage the very significant existing skillsets that exist in both sectors.  There is no question but that decades of experience and thousands of hours of teaching and training expertise have not been used to their best effect in the past.  The word &quot;duplication&quot; was mentioned time and again.  It is very much the case that there has been duplication.  It is a waste of valuable State resources and people's time.</p><p>We must convince people that our intervention to get them back into the learning process will be very worthwhile.  It should not be a case of simply crunching the numbers and not really caring about the overall outcome of the process.  It is a matter of bringing together the various strands.</p><p>Senator Zappone mentioned the community sector.  I have visited at least 30 to 40 community and education projects across the country.  Significant expertise at community level is, more often than not, offered voluntarily owing to the goodwill and passion of people who have skills and want to impart them to others.  It is a matter of bringing together the various strands, including the further education sector, the work FÁS has been doing, the community sector and the private sector, which is also doing exceptional work.</p><p>Most of the recent 6,500 places offered through the MOMENTUM programme had been provided by the private sector.  In the past, that sector had flexibility.  In a recent piece in one of the national newspapers, I compared FÁS with a behemoth of an ocean liner and stated the new structure we are trying to create will comprise the ETBs, which will move powerboat-like to various areas whose skills shortages need to be addressed urgently.  The private sector has been very good at this in the past because it has small, tightly-controlled units capable of moving quickly to address particular skills shortages.  We will bring together all the various strands, and the best of every one of them will come together to make the system work better for the people we want to support.</p><p>Senator Hayden stated we need flexibility at regional level.  We certainly will have it.  This is why I said in my contribution that SOLAS, as an entity, will not be providing any training or further education opportunities.  Rather, it will be charged with ensuring that all 16 ETBs across the country will have the skills, resources and support necessary to deliver training and education locally.</p><p>Some significant national research will be taking place.  Senator Ó Domhnaill stated we need to look forward ten to 20 years.  SOLAS will be doing so and will have a dedicated research unit, as FÁS does at present, to do the kind of work required and determine where skills shortages are emerging.</p> <p>Senator Quinn mentioned that the careers 65% of children entering primary school now will have do not even exist.  I saw an article in a magazine stating that there are now 300,000 people in the US employed writing Apps for iPhones and iPads.  I read in another magazine that by 2025, half of the careers which will exist then do not exist now.  We must be able to respond to that constantly emerging, innovating jobs market.  </p><p>SOLAS will do that research at national level but the ETBs will also be required to do research at regional level and to drill right down in a very granular fashion to establish where the skills shortages are occurring.  For example, in Galway where I live, there is a huge emerging medical devices cluster.  In fairness, FÁS and the VECs are working to respond to those skills shortages, even before SOLAS has come into being.  We see similar things happening in the pharmaceutical and food sciences area in Cork and in the financial services area in Dublin.  We need to be that speed boat-like model that can move quickly to respond to skills shortages as they occur and not be running behind the curve.  We should be ahead of the curve all the time.  </p><p>Senator Quinn spoke very eloquently about the whole subject of entrepreneurship, and I agree with him wholeheartedly.  In addition to teaching the subject of entrepreneurship to our children and young adults, we need to somehow interweave the concept of entrepreneurship across all of our education provision.  Last week I spoke to a very successful businessman based in County Galway who said that when he was doing his leaving certificate, he had to respond to a questionnaire on what career one wished to pursue when one left school.  He put down that he wanted to be a businessman but the teacher handed it back to him and said that was not a career.  That kind of mindset needs to be changed, although I think it is changing.</p><p>The skills one needs to become a successful entrepreneur - critical thinking, team working, analytical skills, being able to see opportunities where others do not and learning to learn, which Senator Quinn and others mentioned - need to be very much part of all our education provision right from junior infants to PhD level.  We are trying hard to do that.  </p><p>It was mentioned that students are coming from all over the world to study entrepreneurship in Dundalk IT.  They are going to other institutions as well.  I was in DCU last week saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; to 15 Malaysian teachers who had come from the Malaysian education system to study entrepreneurship in Ireland.  We are leading the way globally in this area and are doing exceptionally good work in many areas, but we need to do a lot more.</p><p>SOLAS is about bringing together all of our expertise and our wonderful history of education in the different sectors and using that expertise to provide people with a clear, unambiguous and seamless transition all the way through the education system, so that they can see a definitive path for themselves from the moment they enter it until they hopefully re-emerge at the very end and take up sustainable, long-term, satisfying and rewarding careers.  </p><p>I agree with Senator D'Arcy who said that as well as those who are unemployed, those who are employed need to be equally careful about keeping their skills up to date and we need to be able to facilitate that through the process.  We will talk a lot more about this when the ETB and SOLAS legislation comes back to the House.</p><p>As a small island nation off the coast of Europe, we sometimes tend to think we need to look elsewhere for inspiration on how to do things properly.  Scandinavia, Austria and Germany are often mentioned as being a wonderful models but I genuinely think if we pull together all the strands and all the talent and passion, which I have seen in this sector over the past two years, and really make them gel and work well, we can become the model others look to for inspiration.  We have much important work to do and I look forward to working with Members to make it happen.</p></speech>

I am pleased to introduce this Bill in the House and acknowledge the contribution of the Minister who when in opposition in October 2009 introduced the Medical Practitioners (Professional Indemnity)(Amendment) Bill.  The then Minister, Mary Harney, acknowledged the need for change in this area and  legislation to be put in place to make it compulsory for medical practitioners to have insurance.  Three and a half years on, we are back with a new draft on which I have worked with several parties.  I acknowledge their contribution in bringing forward the Bill.  They include Dr. Brian Hunt, parliamentary draftsperson; Ms Clare Mungovan, a solicitor in my office, and Mr. Tony O'Connor, senior counsel.  I met Ms Caroline Spillane and members of the Medical Council, Mr. Ciarán Breen of the State Claims Agency, representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, and Medical Protection Society, MPS, Ireland insurers and Department of Health officials.  I thank all those who assisted my office and me in preparing the draft Bill.</p><p>  As a car owner, the Acting Chairman cannot drive a car without insurance.  As a solicitor, I cannot practise without insurance.  However, there is no legal obligation on a general practitioner to have insurance.  That is not to say, however, general practitioners do not have insurance.  I imagine 99.9% of all medical practitioners in the country do have insurance.  However, concern has been expressed for some time as to whether we can ensure that if a person is offering a medical service and it goes radically wrong, there are adequate safeguards in place to compensate someone who may suffer a loss.  This issue came to the fore in 2008 and 2009 in the case of cosmetic surgery and breast implants, although in the end I do not believe it was an issue.</p><p>  One new issue arising relates to where persons offering services have insurance and the question is whether they have adequate insurance.  I refer, in particular, to the growing tendency to offer scanning services.  There is a question as to whether the insurance people have is adequate to cover the service.  As legislators, we have a duty to ensure the public is protected.  The idea behind the Bill is to ensure it would be compulsory for all medical practitioners to have insurance.  The HSE provides cover for all of its employees engaged in medical services.  However, there are people working in a private capacity as medical practitioners and we need to ensure adequate safeguards are in place.</p><p>  The Bill is self-explanatory in the sense that it would amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Reports have been produced in the United Kingdom where there is a similar problem.  The Finlay Scott report of 2010 involved an examination of the issue of professional indemnity insurance in the United Kingdom.  One recommendation in that report read:<ul>In my judgement, making insurance or indemnity a statutory condition of registration is the most cost effective and proportionate means of achieving the policy objective. The main reasons are:<br />a. A statutory condition of registration would apply equally and unequivocally to all registered healthcare professionals; would be seen by patients and the public to do so; and would enhance patient and public confidence.<br />b. A statutory condition of registration has the unique advantage that, when supported by appropriate powers, enforcement action can be taken through low cost administrative procedures rather than high cost fitness to practise procedures.<br />c. As a result, a statutory condition of registration would reduce enforcement costs compared with alternatives, without increasing compliance costs or the costs of compliance testing.<br />d. A statutory condition of registration would require the registrant to be able to prove a positive, namely the presence of cover, rather than the regulator to prove a negative, namely the absence of cover.</ul>We took into account various recommendations made in that report in drafting the legislation.</p><p>  I realise the Bill is imperfect and that it is likely the Department will bring forward some amendments.  I would support this because I realise we are all working in the public interest.</p><p>  The Bill is divided into five parts and contains nine sections.  I will outline the various sections and what they seek to do.  </p><p>  Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and provides for the collective citation.  Section 2 provides a definition of the principal Act, that is, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Section 3 seeks to amends section 2 of the 2007 Act and proposes to insert four new definitions, including a definition of an indemnity provider.  It is important that there be a distinction between an insurer and an indemnity provider.  For example, MPS Ireland provides cover, but it is not an insurance company; rather, it is a medical protection society.</p> <p>It is not an insurance company but it is a medical protection society which offers cover to the vast majority of medical practitioners in this country.  Section 3 defines the terms "clinical indemnity scheme", "professional indemnity committee" and "professional indemnity cover".  Section 4 operates a clinical indemnity scheme.  </p><p>Section 4 amends section 10 of the 2007 Act by substituting a revised text of subsection (1), the purpose of which is to expand the immunity of the Medical Council so as to ensure that it will not be held liable for the wrongdoings of medical practitioners in respect of their obligation to hold professional indemnity cover.</p><p>Section 5 amends section 11 of the 2007 Act by inserting seven new subsections which empower the Medical Council to make rules specifying each category of medical practitioner who will be required to hold professional indemnity cover.  As there are different categories of medical practitioners, from GPs to medical consultants in the private health care sector, various types of cover are needed.  Subsection (2C) requires the Medical Council to make rules specifying the indemnity providers which have been recognised.  The Act covers both the insurer and the indemnifier.  The State Claims Agency is also included because it now has responsibility for dealing with claims against the HSE and can therefore offer considerable expertise that would not otherwise be available.  It is important that its role is recognised and its advice taken on board in the guidelines that are being issued.  Subsection (2D) states that the Medical Council must not issue a certificate of registration to a medical practitioner unless he or she has provided evidence of the required level of cover being in place.  Subsection (2E) permits the Medical Council to specify in its rules the minimum level of cover to be held by practitioners.  Subsection (2F) empowers the Medical Council to exempt practitioners from the requirement to hold professional indemnity cover.  This would apply in particular to people who are employed by the HSE because they would already have cover.</p><p>Section 6 empowers the Medical Council to establish a professional indemnity committee to carry out its functions relating to professional indemnity cover.  Section 7 states that it is an offence for a person to practise medicine whilst not being in compliance with the Medical Council’s rules, not having in place professional indemnity cover or falsely representing that he or she has the correct level of cover in place.  Section 7 also makes it an offence for a person to contravene new sections 110, 111 and 112 which are proposed to be inserted into the 2007 Act by section 9 of this Bill.</p><p>Section 8 inserts a new section 44A into the 2007 Act so as to place a duty on insurers to notify the Medical Council if they become aware that a medical practitioner’s professional indemnity cover has lapsed or been cancelled.  Many people pay insurance by instalments but once the insurer becomes aware that payment has lapsed, clearly it would cease to provide cover at a certain point.  The section obliges the insurer to notify the council and the individual concerned in such instances so that the situation does not arise whereby somebody who paid the first few instalments subsequently discovers that his or her insurance has been cancelled because the remainder of the premium was not paid.</p><p>Section 9 inserts new sections 110, 111 and 112 into the 2007 Act.  The proposed new section 110 imposes a general obligation of full disclosure on medical practitioners who are seeking professional indemnity cover.  Section 111 provides that where a person or a business, other than a patient, proposes to engage a medical practitioner, he or she is obliged to seek proof of the existence of the required level of professional indemnity cover in respect of that practitioner.  This is to cover situations where a locum is hired for a medical practice.  Section 112 obliges a medical practitioner to display evidence of professional indemnity cover at his or principal place of practise.</p><p>I may not be ticking all the boxes with this draft legislation and I understand that the Department will come forward with amendments.  I am happy to work with departmental officials in progressing the Bill.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their assistance in drafting it.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill, which we have been calling for since 2009.  I am glad we have been consistent in this regard and that we are acting on the matter now that we are in government.  This is an eminently sensible Bill which will reduce liability and offer peace of mind by obliging medical practitioners to hold professional indemnity insurance.  This should have been the case for many years.  It is incredible that Ireland does not have a regulatory authority which can force doctors to take out insurance, with the result that they are not legally obliged to be insured.  Many medical practitioners have insurance cover but those who do not have insurance are not necessarily disadvantaged, which leads honest doctors to question their own wisdom.  Such a lax attitude would not be tolerated in the legal world, as I know from my own experience.  We cannot practise without indemnity insurance and, in many cases, clients insist that the appropriate level of cover is in place before they will employ a solicitor.  This is particularly common in the area in which I specialise, namely, insurance defence.  It is incredible that the same standards do not apply in the medical world, where mistakes cannot be undone.  It seems appropriate that patients should be able to ask their GPs or medical consultants about their insurance cover before they take on their services.</p><p>This Bill will require written evidence of medical and professional indemnity insurance to be submitted to the Medical Council before it will issue a certificate of competency to practise.  I was concerned about the implication for current doctors who do not have professional indemnity insurance but have already been granted a certificate by the Medical Council.  It appears this is covered appropriately by sections 7 and 8, however.  Section 7 states that it is an offence for a person to practise medicine without having in place professional indemnity cover.  Similarly, section 8 sets out a duty on medical insurers to notify the Medical Council if they become aware that a medical practitioner's professional indemnity cover has lapsed or been cancelled.</p><p>If the Medical Council, the State Claims Agency and the Financial Regulator work together to determine the appropriate level of insurance to be held by practitioners, it would be straightforward to migrate to this system without causing serious problems for medical practitioners while providing an assurance to patients that they are in safe hands at all times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000023#X00300"><p>I compliment the Minister on showing his continued respect for the House by taking this important Bill.  I am sure he has a sense of <i>déjà vu</i>  listening to the robust proposals put forward by Senator Colm Burke.  I will not repeat the arguments made by the Senator, particularly given that the Minister spent many waking hours putting together the original version of this Bill in 2009.  I presume the Minister went down the same route as the Senator.</p><p>  Paragraph 51 of the Medical Council's guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners states that medical practitioners must ensure they have adequate professional indemnity cover for all health care services.  Clearly this cannot be equated with a statutory obligation to have in place such cover and, consequently, it could be submitted that patient protection measures are not what they ought to be.</p> <p>Fianna Fáil would support the objectives of that Bill.  In the 2009 debate, the then Minister, Mary Harney, was very sympathetic towards the Bill when it was brought forward by Deputy Reilly, now the Minister.  Deputy Reilly raised a number of issues at that time.  He said the majority of doctors were responsible and carried appropriate medical negligence insurance.  One would assume that would be the case.  As a medical practitioner, Deputy Reilly himself would be aware of the need for such insurance because of the highly litigious nature of the business in which GPs operate.  We have not quite gone as far as the United States in that regard, but it has been said many times in recent years that we seem to be going down that route.  Doctors tend to take a more cautious overview now than heretofore in terms of how they deal with patients and I am sure Professor Crown would have something to say in that regard.</p><p>What the then Minister, Mary Harney, said at the time is still relevant.  She continually referred to the trust between patient and doctor.  I would trust Professor Crown completely if I was under his care and, perhaps, would not be thinking about whether he was covered adequately if I was availing of his expertise.  At the same time, in the real world in which we live, I am sure he and his colleagues would be of the view that it is better for them to have the defence of having adequate insurance in place, in the event of something going wrong, which is essentially what we are talking about here.  Interestingly, it was stated at the time that the Department of Health and Children and the Medical Council did not know how many practitioners had insurance, what level of cover they held, the type of insurance or who provided it.  I wonder whether that remains the case.  However, this legislation will address the situation and because insurance will be obligatory the information will be available.</p><p>Another aim of the Bill is to close a loophole that could allow an unscrupulous doctor to apply for medical registration and practise without insurance.  There are only a small number of such cases.  Senator Burke referred to 99.9% of practising doctors having adequate insurance.  In the event of mistakes or medical negligence, the State must offer patients the best protection it can.  Compulsory indemnity would instil confidence in the system and guarantee patients redress if something went wrong.  This is what Deputy Reilly said at the time and we would all agree with that.  He also pointed out - I am curious as to whether these figures changed - that it was expected the State would pay out some €60 million in medical legal costs in 2009, €20 million of which would go to lawyers.  Far be it from me to suggest Senator Burke would have a vested interest in that regard, but I better not go down that road.</p><p>In her response, the former Minister, Mary Harney, gave the background and context for the debate.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was a comprehensive modernisation of legislation dating back 30 years governing the medical profession.  She said it was clear from contributions to the 2007 debate that trust was at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship and that oneself or one's family member was a patient, one wanted to have the utmost confidence and trust in one's doctor, not from blind faith or deference but for good reason.  However, she said she did not believe people wanted a bevy of lawyers, legislators or insurers metaphorically sitting in on the confidential discussions with their doctors.  We would all agree with that.  Perhaps, that is what guided her view at the time she deferred the Bill, although she said she fully agreed with the objectives behind it at the time.</p><p>She went on to say that given the complexities and sensitivities of medical indemnity insurance, the method deserves detailed reflection from the legal, administrative and practical points of view.  She did not elaborate on that, but perhaps the Minister will.  Has anything changed since with regard to what she referred to as &quot;complexities and sensitivities of medical indemnity insurance&quot;?  Financial intermediaries, solicitors and a range of other professionals are compelled to hold professional indemnity cover and I do not see why it should be any more complex for the medical profession.  Was that just the Government's way of saying that it was a fine Bill, but it would not give the Opposition the credit for introducing it so would kick it down the road for a few months and then come back to it?  However, the then Minister did not come back to it.</p><p>The last reference I can find to what happened to that excellent Bill dates to January 2011.  The then Tánaiste and acting Minister for Health and Children, Mary Coughlan, said the heads of a medical practitioners (amendment) Bill to make it mandatory for registration purposes for doctors to have clinical indemnity insurance had yet to be approved by Government.  This was approximately 18 months since then Deputy Reilly had introduced his Bill.  Was there something going on in the Department of Health and Children we need to know about?</p></speech>

I did not want to do that because I thought I would be accused of political point scoring.  I was introducing politics into this at all.  I am just asking whether there is a particular reason why, having agreed with then Deputy Reilly this was a good Bill and should be introduced, the then Minister went on to talk about legal complexities.  These were not elaborated on, there was further delay and the last word of the previous Government was that the heads had yet to come before the Government.  That is the core of what I am asking.  Is there some obstacle to the passing of this Bill?</p></speech>

I wish to comment first on the amount of work Senator Burke has put into bringing this Bill to this point and on the list of stakeholders to whom he referred.  I had a conversation on this with the Senator in the past few days; he has put a remarkable and exemplary amount of work into this.  It is probably one of the more elaborate and well-thought out Bills I have seen originating in this House and being introduced in Private Members' time.  I commend Senator Burke on that.  I note this Bill is a progression of an idea the Minister had himself when in opposition.  Senator Burke has taken that idea and developed it to this point.</p><p>It is mind-boggling that there is no legal requirement for medical professions to have insurance.  This is something I had not considered until last week when Senator Burke brought it to my attention.  I suspect that not many of the general public would even think it was necessary to ask their medical practitioner whether he or she had insurance to indemnify patients against any risk inherent in a procedure being carried out.  I suspect that is the last thing a patient would think of, yet there is no legal obligation on a practitioner to have indemnity or to say he or she has.</p><p>Senator Burke referred to the fact that 99.9% of medical practitioners have some sort of indemnity insurance.  Are his figures based on anything more than an intuitive belief?  If his figures are correct, this means that for every 1,000 practitioners in the country, one has no medical insurance at all.  Could the Minister provide more information on this?  Senator Mooney suggested the IMO is unaware of the number of doctors without insurance or of the type of insurance provided.</p> <p>There is a concern that medical insurance is becoming even more important as it becomes more common for procedures which used to be carried out in hospitals where all medical practitioners are insured to be carried out in community or private sector settings.  I do not know whether the types of medical indemnity product are standardised.  Can one go to a company and say, "I am looking for general medical cover"?  Are there particular varieties of such products?  Is there a gold standard of such cover?  If the Minister understands the point I am trying to make, perhaps he might clarify whether there is the equivalent of third party fire and theft cover or comprehensive cover in this sector.  In the absence of a legal framework in which medical practitioners face certain requirements in this regard, is there a concern that the providers of indemnity or insurance products might be a little behind the curve in developing medical indemnity or insurance products?  As medical practices evolve, the line between those procedures which used to be considered invasive and non-invasive is becoming blurred.  As medicine evolves in the community and private practices, these distinctions are becoming more and more blurred.  Do the providers of medical indemnity and insurance products keep themselves fully up to speed in the development of their products?  Are they as informed as we would like them to be?  I would like information in that regard.</p><p>In supporting Senator Colm Burke's proposal to ensure medical insurance would be obligatory, I suggest there be a relentless focus on the need for indemnity to keep pace with the ever-evolving and complex procedures that take place in the medical sector.  I will conclude on that point as I am afraid my voice is about to go.  I support the legislation proposed by Senator Colm Burke.  On the basis of his professional experience, does the Minister know of any case that was taken against a practitioner who did not have insurance?  If there was such a case, what was the outcome?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000025#Z00200"><p>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I am very supportive of this legislation which has a sort of resonance with some of the issues that have arisen in the context of the abortion debate.  We believe the contingency for which we are legislating is extremely rare, thankfully, but that does not mean the necessity for this legislation is invalid.  We have an obligation to ensure the bases are covered, just as we are obliged to ensure appropriate guidelines are in place for the rare cases in which the life of a pregnant woman may be compromised.  In this case, we must make provision for the extremely rare circumstance where people practise medicine without the appropriate insurance.  I compliment Senator Colm Burke on the initiative he has shown in bringing forward this Bill.  He is a thoughtful and extremely well informed commentator on health care issues.  In the past two years he has brought a great degree of wisdom to various health debates in this House.</p><p>The Minister might be familiar with the tombstone imperative, a phrase used in air safety circles.  It refers to the manner in which attempts are made to ensure air safety by examining previous disasters, learning from the mistakes made and trying to prevent similar bad things from happening in the future.  It is based on things like black box technology and flight recorders.  We are familiar with the dramatic scenes when teams of investigators descend on these locations.  Having been involved in studying aspects of the health service for the past ten years or so, it seems that a version of the tombstone imperative has been in operation in that period.  I accept that this has not been a characteristic of the tenure of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  It can be argued that the politics of the last health care atrocity, to borrow a phrase, is used in many circumstances to advance the health care reform agenda.  Issues to do with breast cancer care in certain areas led to the reform of the health service.  Problems with diagnostics in other areas led to further improvements.</p><p>We have to understand something.  My colleagues have alluded to the fact that Ireland appears to be adopting the US attitude to medical litigation.  If I am not mistaken, Ireland has the second highest rate of medical litigation in the world, after the United States.  We had the third highest rate, after the United States and New Zealand, which had a quirkily high place in the pecking order, for many years.  We are now higher on the league table than New Zealand.  Certain similarities between our system and that in place in New Zealand are relevant in this regard.  I give a regularly recurring lecture on legal aspects of cancer care as part of a course on the legal aspects of medicine, or the medical aspects of medico-legal care.  There is no doubt that it is incredibly important.  In the United States breast cancer is the one disease which leads to doctors being sued.  The cases refer to misdiagnosis, a failure to refer for mammograms appropriately, inappropriate treatment and a failure to provide proper multidisciplinary care, etc.</p><p>There is no doubt that there is a major problem in this country in dealing with cancer and other diseases.  For this reason, I have studied the famous book the Medical Protection Society publishes every year.  It is an annual reminder of the horrors that can befall us.  It goes through various cases that have appeared on the society's case books in the previous year and the various mistakes made.  I recommend it to anybody who wants to get a sense of how things can go wrong in medicine.  The problem that most frequently recurs in Ireland is the making of inappropriate decisions by non-consultant doctors and trainees.  The core reason we have so much medical litigation is we have an abnormally small number of career level legally responsible doctors at general practice level and in hospital specialties.  Overall, we have a relatively average number of doctors.  However, we have a bizarre demographic.  Many of our doctors are involved in various training jobs in which they are asked to make responsible decisions.</p><p>I support this legislation and it is likely that I will make some comments on amendments on Committee Stage.  I suggest we consider the issue of tailback insurance for people who have passed retirement age.  We need to ensure the relevant section of the Bill is worded in a way that would not impose an extra burden on those who may not have much income at the time of retirement.  We should remember that in some specialties the annual premium is higher than the public salary.</p></speech>

There has to be a means of ensuring the insurance provision they responsibly made during their careers gives them adequate coverage after retirement.  They should not be asked to pay premiums which are simply not sustainable for people at pension level.</p><p>This good Bill would plug a gap.  It needs to be borne in mind that the phenomenon of doctors not having insurance is as rare as it is because almost every job for which they apply requires them to have made insurance provision.  There are very few circumstances in which a medical practitioner can seek employment without having insurance.  It is theoretically possible, however.  It is certainly possible in the cases of people who practice on the fringes of medicine.  I refer to those who may have medical degrees and set themselves up to practise non-conventional medicine.  It is critically important that the Bill plug all of those gaps.  I commend Senator Colm Burke and look forward to further debate on the legislation later in the session.</p></speech>

It proposes to do this by amending the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  I thank the Senator for proposing the legislation and acknowledging that I tried to make progress with a similar Bill when I was in opposition.  Equally, I acknowledge the great work he has done to bring the Bill to the House today.</p><p>I must advise Senator Paschal Mooney that he should ask a representative of the previous Government why it did not publish the heads of a Bill.  I am not privy to that information.  I assure him, however, that I pursued the matter every time I had an opportunity to do so.  Since that time, major events have shaken the country to its foundations.  We have had to rely on money borrowed from the troika to run the country.  A great deal of legislation across all Departments has been introduced as a consequence of these arrangements.</p> <p>It makes it very difficult to get a Bill such as this into the queue.  I am very grateful for Senator Colm Burke's attention to this Bill, for his bringing it to the floor of the House and, by so doing, progressing it.</p><p>Many Members of the House may be aware the matter of mandatory indemnity is a very necessary one.  I would like to explain that the initial thought process behind this was that we would not be playing catch-up, as Senator Crown said, but rather be pre-emptive.  One will not be able to register unless one is insured whereas, at present, people register and proof of insurance may follow later, after the event.</p><p>Another very important area we need to address is that of appropriate insurance, to which Senator Gilroy alluded.  We have had situations where people have practised cosmetic surgery in Ireland and, while they were insured, they were insured for GP work, not for cosmetic surgery.  In answer to the Senator's question, I am aware of situations in the past where people were not insured and took a chance.  I am also aware of the fact people have suffered as a consequence and, although malpractice was proven, as the individual was not insured, there was no recourse for the patient.</p><p>Professor Crown made some assertions around the number of doctors, including NCHDs.  While I would certainly like to deal with that issue, it is perhaps for another day because today is about this Bill.  However, I will say this.  There would be a contention that Ireland needs double the current number of GPs yet if we had advanced nurse practitioners working in practice, managing chronic illness care and screening patients to see if they need a GP or not, I wonder just how many more GPs we would need.  Similarly, NCHDs are doing a lot of work that could be done by others, such as being called out of bed at night to put up an intravenous line, which an advanced nurse practitioner could do, or perform a catheterisation, when a nurse could be trained to do that.  A lot of the work that is currently being done by some professionals could easily be done by other professionals, freeing doctors up to do the work they and they alone can do.  That is the underlying principle when I talk about treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is as safe, timely, efficient and near to home as possible, or, to put it another way, the right patient being treated by the right person at the right time in the right place.</p><p>Because there are many similarities in both Bills, I have discussed this Bill and the Department's Bill with the Attorney General and understand the Department's Bill will take account of Senator Burke's Bill.  The Government's Bill will be prioritised and my aim is that it will be published before the summer recess.  I hope Senator Burke will agree to this proposal, whereby the Government's Bill will, where appropriate, adopt the provisions contained in his Bill.  In this way, we will get maximum benefit from the input of our respective legislative experts on this important matter.</p><p>I strongly believe there should be a legislative basis for the introduction of mandatory medical indemnity for medical practitioners engaged in medical practice, as Senator Noone and others have pointed out.  My officials have engaged in an extensive consultation with the relevant stakeholders and I am conscious that Senator Burke has also consulted widely on this legislation.  Of course, consultation with all parties will continue as the Bill progresses.</p><p>My officials have also taken into consideration the Finlay Scott report, an independent review of the requirements to have insurance or indemnity as a condition of registration as a health care professional.  As has been said, this work was commissioned by the UK Department of Health in 2010.  The report set out a number of key principles in support of its recommendations.  They include the need to place a statutory duty upon registrants to have insurance or indemnity in respect of liabilities which may be incurred in carrying out work as a registered health care professional.  Specifically, the report indicated that a statutory condition of registration should require the registrant to prove a positive, namely, the presence of cover, rather than the regulator to prove a negative, namely, the absence of cover.  The outcomes of these considerations and the report's recommendations are being reflected in the Bill.</p><p>I agree with the overall objective of Senator Burke's Bill, and we are in agreement that mandatory professional indemnity cover for certain medical practitioners should be introduced.  However, there are a number of important areas where we have reservations on the approach being taken in it, and I will give the House a few examples as to why we have these reservations.</p><p>Section 5 of Senator Burke's Bill proposes to introduce a new subsection (2C) into the 2007 Act.  This proposed subsection requires the Medical Council to make rules, specifying the indemnity providers which are recognised by it, for the purpose of providing professional indemnity cover to medical practitioners.  Such a task would be beyond the council's current range of knowledge or competencies and may raise competition issues.</p><p>Section 6 of the Senator's Bill requires the Medical Council to establish a committee, to be known as the professional indemnity committee, to perform certain functions set out in the proposed subsections (2A) to (2G) of section 11.  I believe the establishment and operation of such a committee may cause serious practical difficulties for the Medical Council and may have a disruptive effect on the registration process as established under Part 6 of the Principal Act.</p><p>Section 8 of the Senator's Bill proposes to insert a new section 44A into the 2007 Act.  This new section requires the insurer or indemnity provider to notify in writing both the medical practitioner and the council when it becomes aware that cover has lapsed or has been cancelled.  This provision will have significant practical difficulties for indemnifiers.  There may also be confidentiality issues concerning insurers providing the required information to the Medical Council.  However, I want to assure the Senator I agree in principle with this and we will try to overcome these difficulties.  We need as many cross-references and safeguards as possible to protect patients.</p><p>My Department's Bill is being drafted by the Attorney General's office in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the Medical Council, the State Claims Agency and representatives of indemnity providers, and it will have regard to the issues raised by all parties.  Under the Bill, if the practitioner does not have indemnity, the Medical Council will have the power to refuse registration.  The council will also have the power to remove a practitioner from the register where indemnity is not maintained.  The continued maintenance of indemnity cover will be confirmed by the practitioner, by declaration, at the time of his or her annual retention of registration.  It will be the responsibility of each medical practitioner to establish that they have the required professional indemnity.  In this legislation, the role of the council will be supported by powers, not duties, to require the relevant information from registrants for the purpose of registration and re-registration.</p><p>The Medical Council does not have the required expertise in the insurance or brokerage market to determine the appropriate level of cover for a medical practitioner, having regard to the type of work or specialty in which he or she is engaged.  Accordingly, the legislation will provide for the State Claims Agency to assist the council in making available guidelines, setting out indicative or minimum levels of cover, having regard to specialty and procedures.  This is an important aspect that has to be covered.</p><p>Overall, my Department is approaching the draft legislation at a high or enabling level.  The Medical Council can subsequently specify the necessary detail, by the provision of guidance and-or rules, in accordance with the statutory powers given to the council in its establishing legislation.  I wish to assure the Senator that most of the sections in his Bill will be reflected to some extent in the final text of my published Bill.  In addition to the introduction of mandatory medical indemnity cover, I believe that systems must also be in place to minimise the need for patients to initiate civil litigation.  At this point, one might also consider talking to the Medical Council with regard to insisting that the current medical indemnity certificate is displayed in a public place where the practitioner operates.  Obviously, this would cause difficulty for people who operate out of several premises but, where there is a single premises, it certainly should be the case.</p><p>The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 introduced a more proactive system of robust registration and regulation of the medical profession.  This Act, which we will be amending, has already strengthened areas such as governance, mandatory registration, fitness to practise procedures, education and training, and maintenance of professional competence.</p><p>The enactment of the Bill should help instil further patient confidence in our health system and help underpin other initiatives which are already delivering good outcomes for patients.  For example, the HSE national clinical care programmes provide a national, strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  They have three main objectives - to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost effectiveness.  The primary aim of the clinical programmes is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services, and maximising linkages to primary care and other services.</p><p>There are approximately 30 clinical care programmes and programme initiatives in different stages of development or implementation.  Many of the programmes have produced models of care and guidelines and are developing both integrated and primary care solutions.</p> <p>There are many specific examples of tangible outcomes of the programmes for patients.  A programme worth mentioning is the new stroke programme which, since its initiation, has resulted in one life saved per week and an avoidance of the necessity for long-term care for three more of our citizens every week.  We also have an excellent heart failure programme.  Both programmes were mentioned by Don Berwick, one of President Obama's health spokespersons, in a keynote address in Oregon as examples of what can be achieved in an economy as challenged as ours using a reduced budget.  More than 120,000 bed days were saved by the implementation of the acute medicine programme, which aims to save half a million bed days over three years.  Yesterday, I launched the first national clinical guideline - the national early warning score for Ireland.  The launch was the accumulation of the good work of a number of patient safety initiatives, including the national clinical effectiveness framework and the clinical care programmes of the HSE.  The national early warning score clearly sets out how to recognise and respond to patients whose conditions are deteriorating.  Recognising a patient whose condition is deteriorating and responding to his or her needs in an appropriate and timely way are essential components of safe and high-quality care.  This guideline is based on international evidence of what is known to work best and Ireland is the first known country to agree a national early warning score.  Whether one is a nurse in Tralee or Letterkenny or a doctor in Tallaght, one will be aware of the same standards that will allow one to assess whether a patient is deteriorating and what action needs to be taken.  It has since come to my notice that we have been nominated for a European award for this, so I congratulate all involved.  I have no doubt it will save many lives in the future.  Furthermore, one of the leaders told me yesterday that since it was introduced in Beaumont Hospital, the incidence of myocardial infarction, or heart attack, has dropped by 29%.  These are very welcome developments that enable us to maximise the benefits for patients from the resources in our health care system but, crucially, they also underpin the continuing focus on quality of care, which is my primary concern.</p><p>While I am here and have the opportunity, I will talk about the significant improvements that have been achieved in the waiting times for unscheduled emergency care against a background of reduced funding and staffing levels.  It is a very challenging socioeconomic climate and a growing number of older persons with an overall increase in life expectancy are now attending our hospitals.  The fact that our citizens are living longer lives is a welcome development and we want those lives to be healthier.  I will provide a few statistics.  There was a reduction of 23.6% in the number of patients waiting on trolleys in 2012, compared to 2011.  This equates to 20,352 fewer patients waiting on trolleys.  With regard to the nine-month access target for adults, excluding endoscopy, the number of patients having to wait more than nine months for inpatient and day case surgery was down to 86 at the end of 2012 from 3,706 in December 2011, which represents a 98% decrease.  The target for 2013 is a guaranteed maximum waiting time of eight months.  In respect of children, the number waiting over 20 weeks for procedures excluding endoscopy was down to 89 at the end of December 2012 from 1,759 in December 2011, which is a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine GI endoscopy procedure was down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, representing a 99% decrease.  We are trying very hard to ensure that by 30 November 2013, no patient will be waiting more than 52 weeks for a first-time consultant-led outpatient appointment.  At this early stage of 2013, the figures generally remain approximately 10% below those for the same period in 2012.  Despite the challenges we face both financially and in terms of staffing levels, the health service has responded and shown that it can change by empowering those on the front line to do things the way they want them done and not having the system strangle them as it did in the past.  To those who work in our health service, I offer a heartfelt &quot;Thank you&quot; on my behalf and that of the Government and this House.   </p><p>My mission is to improve the health and well-being of the people in Ireland in a manner that promotes better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care delivery and high performance.  The main purpose of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was to shift to a proactive system of robust registration and regulation of the medical profession in order to minimise the risk of adverse clinical events.  The Medical Council is doing a very good job in providing an efficient and accountable system for regulation of the medical profession.  The public can be satisfied that registered medical practitioners are both appropriately qualified and competent to practice in a safe manner.  My predecessor, Mary Harney, did change the structure of the council, as was mentioned earlier, so that the majority of members are not medical practitioners, which helps instill confidence in the public that medical practitioners do not have majority control in the governance of their regulatory body.</p><p>When this Bill is enacted, the additional requirement of having adequate indemnity on registration and again on retention of registration will further assure patients and their families that the system in which medical practice is undertaken is operating in a person-centred, effective and fair fashion and a manner focused on protecting them from the inevitable times when things go wrong.  It is not a perfect science or a perfect world but we can ensure that if something does go wrong, the harm and hurt to the patient is minimised through having adequate compensation and measures in place to support him or her to lead the fullest of lives possible afterwards.</p><p>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to address the House today.  I once again acknowledge the work Senator Colm Burke and his team have put into drafting this Bill.  I would like to support Senator Burke's Bill and I will now arrange for the content of his Bill to be used in finalising the text of Government's Bill.  I look forward to working closely with Senator Colm Burke as the Bill progresses through the Oireachtas, to the benefit of all our citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000027#BB00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and I thank Senator Colm Burke for introducing this Bill.  From speaking to the Senator, I know he has put an amount of work into this Bill.  Given the number of malpractice cases, I find it incredible in today's climate that not all medical practitioners have adequate insurance cover.  Any medical practitioner operating without adequate insurance is playing Russian roulette with his or her career.  We must also bear in mind the safety and well-being of the patient, who must be protected and safe in the knowledge that if anything goes wrong there will be a financial back-up through insurance to meet his or her medical needs.  The Minister spoke about putting the professional indemnity insurance certificate up on the wall or in a public space where the practitioner operates, but one still does not know what coverage the practitioner has and whether it is adequate to cover the procedures he or she is carrying out.  I am sure every medical practitioner will have a certificate but the general public would not know whether it is adequate or not.  I do not know whether simply putting the certificate up on the wall will work.</p><p>The Minister also said the HSE was moving to speed things up and carry out procedures.  It seems to be going the opposite way in Kerry General Hospital because it has withdrawn ultrasound services from GPs so they can no longer access these services in the hospital.  This means they must now refer patients to the clinic, which means longer waiting times and lists.  This is a step backwards.  It was time enough to send people to the consultants once they received the ultrasound readings.</p> <p> I again thank Senator Colm Burke for introducing the Bill which we will, of course, be supporting.  In fairness, the Senator is watching out for the interests of the general public.  When we discussed the Bill, he informed me that certain practitioners were carrying out scans, etc., and that they did not have adequate insurance cover.  I wonder how we will police this and how we will ensure medical practitioners have such cover.  I thank the Minister for coming before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1138" speakername="Terry Brennan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000028#CC00200"><p>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire ar ais go dtí an Seanad.  </p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure doctors have appropriate insurance in order that they might practise medicine.  The vast majority of doctors are extremely responsible and have appropriate professional indemnity insurance.  As is the case with all professions, however, some may not have an appropriate level of cover, either inadvertently or by choice.  The Bill would make professional indemnity insurance cover compulsory for all practising doctors and bestow on the Medical Council the power to set the appropriate levels of insurance to be held by different classes of practitioner.  The council currently has no such power and merely recommends that doctors have such insurance.  The Bill also suggests that before it issues a certificate to practise to a practitioner, written evidence to the effect that the appropriate level of insurance is in place be produced to the council.</p><p>The Bill provides for circumstances in which insurance may lapse and would make it an offence to practise without insurance where such insurance is required.  An irresponsible individual could practise in Ireland without having the appropriate professional indemnity insurance.  In the event of negligence or unsatisfactory treatment, an aggrieved or injured patient may have no access to any form of compensation.  The Bill is intended to apply to doctors who are not domiciled in Ireland but who often practise in private clinics here, as well as to practitioners normally resident in the country.</p><p>I acknowledge the many hours of hard work done by and the commitment of Senator Colm Burke in bringing the Bill before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000028#CC00300"><p>I also wish to welcome Senator Colm Burke's Bill.  The Senator obviously did a great deal of work on the legislation and the explanatory memorandum to it, both of which read well.  Of course, he brings a wealth of experience to this matter and it is an honour to contribute to the debate on his Bill.</p><p>The annual report of the State Claims Agency for 2010 indicates that at the end of that year it had clinical claims under management with an estimated liability of €786 million.  This is an extremely important area.  In the context of our commendable and successful efforts to reduce the level of risk and the number of accidents on the roads - the number of deaths fell from a high of 650 in the past to a low of 160 last year - one sometimes wonders whether similar efforts are required in the health service, in which the level of claims is quite high.</p><p>It would be interesting to discover how much the indemnity insurance to which the Bill refers would cost and whether it would be a barrier to entry.  Would people have difficulty in obtaining insurance if they had no track record?  There is a need to do further work in this matter, particularly in the context of the difficulties with the public finances.  We have tended to transfer the cost of catastrophes to the taxpayer.  As there is insurance, we should move risk away from the taxpayer, given that the Exchequer is hard pressed.</p><p>One of the suggestions Mr. Justice Quirke and his committee made in meeting claims is that we consider using periodic payment orders rather than awarding lump sums.  That may have attractions similar to those relating to the promissory notes, whereby payment would be made over the period of total liability, rather than in the form of an up-front lump sum.  Mr. Justice Quirke's committee recommended the introduction of legislation; perhaps this might also be considered.</p><p>The Minister has said he foresees difficulties with the new subsections (2A) to (2G) to be inserted into section 11 of the 2007 Act.  These subsections appear to contain perfectly normal functions in respect of insurance and I do not understand why the Minister perceives that they will give rise to difficulties, particularly as he stated, &quot;The Medical Council is doing a very good job in providing an efficient and accountable system for the regulation of the medical profession.&quot;  Seeing to it that people are insured does not appear to raise the obstacles to which the Minister referred.  I am sure, however, that matter will be resolved during the discussions between Senator Colm Burke and the Minister as the Bill progresses.</p><p>The Minister has also indicated that he has certain concerns with regard to competition and how certificates should be displayed.  On the latter, his concern seems to relate to whether a practitioner's certificate should be displayed at his or her principal office or at his or her second office, if he or she owns one.  The original could be displayed at the principal office and a photocopy could be put on display at the second location.  Sometimes the responses to certain Bills seem to be designed to make it appear that minor obstacles are actually major difficulties, which is not the case.</p><p>I commend Senator Colm Burke for introducing the Bill.  I also commend the Minister for his response to it.  I look forward to progress being made on this matter because it is very important that medical practitioners be properly insured.  I hope the Bill will be allowed to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-02-20a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013022000028#CC00400"><p>I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I apologise, therefore, for not being present to hear the contributions of the Minister and many of my colleagues.  I am sure they were extremely significant.  We are very lucky to have someone such as Senator John Crown, a professor, among us.  I look forward to reading the transcript of his speech.</p><p>It is interesting that the Minister for Health is in the House.  He is a senior member of the Cabinet, which shows a degree of respect for Senator Colm Burke whom I commend for introducing this timely and important Bill.  It is appropriate that the Minister is present because he addressed this matter in 2009 when he presented the Medical Practitioners (Professional Indemnity)(Amendment) Bill, the principal object of which was to make it a criminal offence for a medical practitioner not to have medical insurance.  I understand it is neither a criminal nor any other kind of offence not to have medical insurance.  Not having such insurance is extremely unwise.  I apologise if previous speakers referred to this fact and have no wish to be repetitive, but I would be surprised if more than a very small number of doctors did not have medical insurance.  Although the Bill includes penalties for those not registered with insurance companies, it does take a somewhat benign approach to the matter.  I have no doubt, therefore, that those involved in the medical profession would find its provisions reasonable.</p><p>The difficulty that arises revolves around the enormous cost of insurance, particularly for the medical profession.</p> <p>I refer to the considerable cost of all kinds of insurance but particularly of medical insurance and the avariciousness the human animal displays sometimes when dealing with doctors.  I have had serious infection as a result of a rather badly done treatment but I did not sue the doctor.  I do not like suing doctors because I think they do their best.  I am reminded particularly of the woman in America whose life was saved by a doctor on board a cruise ship.  He removed an ulcerated appendix which was about to burst - and from which the patient probably would have died - with a penknife, on the deck, at the behest of the captain.  Having recovered she subsequently sued the doctor for the cosmetic appearance of the scar which rose above the bikini line.  She received $1 million.  That would put anyone off.  If I were a doctor and I saw someone dying I would say, &quot;Go on, just die.&quot;  It is a terrible story.  We have to recognise this kind of culture which leads to a significant increase in costs.  </p><p> I refer to a settlement of &#8364;45 million in January between the Medical Defence Union and the Government which was part of the indemnification involved.  The Medical Defence Union is a British body and a mutual association.  It is not a commercial insurance company.  In fact, the costs to the Government were considerably greater than this.  Tragically, there are situations and circumstances involving injury to a child, perhaps during childbirth and the child is brain-damaged or there is other damage.  Negligence is asserted by the family on behalf of the child and then enormously expensive treatment is made available so that this child can continue to live.  No one would decry the life support systems that are necessary but which are very expensive.  That is the realistic fact in terms of medical insurance.</p><p> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley to convey to the Minister for Health the issue of the price of medicine in this country.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade was dealing with trade issues between Britain and Ireland.  I asked about the impact of our financial situation down here in terms of the rather realistic approach of many people in Northern Ireland and which may have affected the recent poll.  The first reaction was to do with the medical services here.   In the North there is a system of free at delivery to the patient.  Apparently the services are considerably better and perhaps cheaper - I know this is the case with dentistry.  I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>which asks if there is a reasonably priced doctor in the house.  I am aware that I am standing next to a seated doctor so at least I am in a position to run away if I antagonise him very much.  I know there are very good doctors who charge very reasonable fees and are charitable in that they sometimes will not charge a poor person.  The article described a couple of cases such as a woman in very average circumstances who had very little money.  She was charged &#8364;50 for a repeat prescription.  She did not even see the doctor.  She wanted to collect a repeat prescription from the receptionist who refused to give her the prescription until she coughed up &#8364;50.  In another case, it cost &#8364;60 for a repeat prescription.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this information to the Minister.  That practice should not be tolerated.</p><p> Senator Burke has done the House and the Oireachtas a service.  I note the quality of the debate and the attendance of the senior Minister.  This is a good day for Seanad Éireann.  I note that the Minister has said he has great sympathy and that Senator Burke has done considerable work and has consulted very widely.  I do not know if he consulted with his party colleague, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, but the Minister has taken the usual position of saying that the Bill is excellent work but that it has some deficiencies and that it will be put through.  I would have thought it would be much better, having studied this legislation, having attempted to introduce legislation of this nature unsuccessfully in the other House, it would have been preferable if the Minister had taken the time and the trouble, with this officials, to amend the Bill.  The degree of variation between the Minister's position and that of Senator Burke, is not sufficiently large to sink the Bill, in my opinion.  We have had Bills in this House with more than 200 Government amendments presented at the same time as legislation.  It would not have killed the Government to lose its dog in the manger attitude and to put Senator Burke's excellent Bill through with whatever amendments the Government chose.  It could show a little bit of deference and respect to this august Chamber of Seanad Éireann.</p></speech>

I join with other Senators who have acknowledged the considerable contribution of Senator Burke, not just on this Bill but on many issues relating to health care.  I regard him as one of the outstanding Senators and I have said so publicly and privately on a number of occasions.  It is incumbent on us when we see people putting in effort and taking the time to deal with these important matters to recognise that effort.</p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the fact that the Minister in a previous incarnation as the Opposition spokesperson on health, tabled a very similar Bill.  It would have been better if the Minister had worked more closely with Senator Burke to ensure that the Bill was progressed through this House and the other House more speedily.  However, I hope the Minister will at least allow the Bill to go through to Committee Stage and that any issues which need to be teased out can be dealt with.  While the Bill may contain some flaws its logic is quite straightforward.  The reason many people - including the Minister - have raised all sorts of other issues outside the parameters of the Bill, is because the Bill is very straightforward.  The Bill proposes that all medical professionals be statutorily compelled to hold professional indemnity cover, in the same way as solicitors and many other professionals.  This is the simple logic or intent of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will allow the Bill to progress.  I would be the first to concede that we cannot be experts on every issue and I admit I was not aware that doctors and medical professionals did not have to have insurance cover.  I was quite surprised as would be many members of the public.  </p><p>I was not in the Chamber to hear Senator Burke's opening remarks but the vast majority of medical professionals in this State have insurance cover.  We are dealing in this case with very small numbers of people who are taking a chance.  In an area as important as the provision of health care the people who provide the care should have the appropriate insurance.  The Minister referred to some professionals with some level of insurance for some medical care but who were practising something different.  He gave the example of cosmetic surgery.  Medical professionals should have insurance and also the appropriate insurance for the medical care or treatment they are providing.</p><p>All the arguments have been made by other speakers.  I commend Senator Burke on tabling the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that it progresses through the House and the Lower House as quickly as possible.  As Senator Norris said, this is a good day for the Seanad when such a Bill is brought forward as opposed to motions which can often be the case.  This is an important piece of legislation being tabled in this House which is the prerogative of the House.  The Minister made the point that there are many important issues which must be dealt with by the Government.  This explains the significant legislative list.  However, the issues raised in this Bill are also important.  The Government can use this House to bring forward Bills to help in the overall delivery of important legislation. </p> <p>For that reason also, I commend Senator Colm Burke.  My party will be fully supporting the Bill.</p></speech>

It is difficult speaking now that I know the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has said he will not be accepting it.  I apologise for not having been able to make it for his speech.  I was absolutely surprised to hear the Bill was not being accepted.  In 2009, when in opposition, the Minister published his own Bill in this area, the Medical Practitioners (Professional Indemnity) (Amendment) Bill.  I am quite confident that Senator Colm Burke examined it with a fine tooth comb to determine how well he could marry it with his Bill, the purpose of which is to introduce a requirement for professional indemnity cover for medical practitioners.  The aim is the same.  Is the Senator's Bill being rejected because it is being introduced in the Seanad?  As Senator David Norris stated, there was a Bill in the Seanad to which 200 amendments were accepted.  There could not be very many amendments associated with a three or four page Bill.  </p><p>Is it too late to examine the 2009 Bill to determine where it is similar to and different from the Bill before us?  Is there any comeback on it?  If the intention of the 2009 Bill was the same as that of the Bill before us, we have an ideal opportunity to use the Chamber to address this matter, bearing in mind that the other legislative House is so busy.  The Bill is important.  While most doctors have cover, only one doctor must have no or insufficient cover to pose a problem.  Is there a minimum level of cover?  All these questions must be answered.  I support the Bill, but I am disappointed we cannot advance it further.  Is there any comeback on it?  I do not know.</p></speech>

Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil arís fáilte a chur roimhe.</p><p>I am very much in agreement with the tributes paid to Senator Colm Burke who is extremely thoughtful and has paid great attention to detail.  I add my voice to those complimenting him on the work he has done in bringing forward the Bill which is typical of his approach.  He is a very fine parliamentarian.</p><p>If there are two types of narrowmindedness that beset politics here, one is party political whereby Members immediately resort to defending their side and castigating the other, as we have seen this very day, while the second is the narrowmindedness of the Government towards the Legislature.  There is real resistance to the notion that the Legislature might beat the Government to the punch in bringing forward sensible legislation.  It would be as easy for the Minister to join in and seek to improve Senator Colm Burke's Bill as to propose to take it into account for the future.</p><p>I was struck by what Senator David Norris had to say in his very interesting speech.  It reminds me of a recent story about a friend of mine who needed to undergo some liver tests or a cholesterol test.  He advised the doctor and made his appointment for the next day.  He turned up and was informed, after having various other matters looked after, that he could not have his bloods done because he had not been fasting.  Therefore, he had to return on another day and was charged twice.  When he returned to have his results explained to him, he was charged for a third time.  The word that came to his mind at the time was &quot;ching&quot;.  This has nothing at all to do with the issue of indemnity, but it is one of good practice.  It is definitely one of those areas in which we have a long way to go in &quot;crowning the customer&quot;, to borrow the words of my distinguished colleague Senator Feargal Quinn.</p><p>This is a sensible, clear Bill, the aim of which is to improve the lives of citizens.  It would close what is a very apparent loophole.  Having insurance would be in the interests of doctors and the customer, the patient.  It is interesting to note that in Austria, Germany, Latvia, France and Slovakia it is mandatory for doctors to have insurance.  The Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Spain require health care institutions and individual doctors to be insured.  In Lithuania and Portugal there is a requirement for institutions to be insured and it is also advised that doctors be insured.  In Italy and Estonia having insurance is voluntary.  In Denmark and the Netherlands there is a state indemnity scheme.  Sweden also has a state indemnity scheme, but there is an additional requirement that doctors practising in the private sector be insured, either personally or through the service companies in which they work.</p><p>Discretionary indemnity is allowed in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta.  Therefore, in our system we do not have a guarantee of cover.  I am not saying anything any Member present does not know at this point.  Can we do more to inform the customer, the patient, of ways of obtaining redress if he or she believes he or she has been harmed or mistreated?  How do we give patients this knowledge, given that so many are travelling abroad for medical procedures?  Patients need to be informed of the various systems in EU member states and the extent of the insurance provided.  It would be worthwhile determining whether we could raise this matter at EU level during our Presidency.  The subject of cross-border health care is very important.</p><p>The deterrent effect of the legislation would be great, but I would be concerned if the cost of cover were to be passed on to consumers through doctors' fees and charges.  How do we protect against this, or can we?  I would be interested in obtaining some information on this from the Minister and perhaps Senator Colm Burke in due course.</p><p>I commiserate with Senator Colm Burke as his very fine Bill is not being accepted.  If he chooses to put the matter to a vote today, he will have my support.  I hope the Government will, at the very least, not delay in bringing forward the necessary legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to Medical Council expertise.  It is referred to in the Bill.  At my meeting with representatives of the council Mr. Ciarán Breen of the State Claims Agency was present.</p> <p>A concern was expressed to me that the Medical Council did not have the expertise to decide the level of insurance doctors should have.  As a result, we have incorporated this into section 5(2B) of the Bill which states the council &quot;shall, having consulted with the State Claims Agency, publish on its website guidelines as to the form and scope of professional indemnity cover to be held by medical practitioners&quot;.  That deals with the criticism made by the Minister that the council does not have the expertise.  I fully acknowledge this and we took that criticism on board.  </p><p> The second issue raised by Senator John Crown is very important because if affects doctors who want to retire and are retiring, namely, follow-on cover.  This issue must be dealt, but I am not at all sure how we should do so.  I have provided for it in section 5(2A)(<i>b</i>)(i) in that there would be an obligation to have follow-on cover after retirement.  I accept it is a problem at which we must look in the long term.  The Medical Council must be involved in this issue.  There are more than 18,000 medical practitioners in the country and I fully accept that they have a huge administrative workload and that this would be a further task.  There would be no point setting up a new regulatory authority or giving this tasl to another Department.  The Medical Council is the most appropriate body to deal with the issue.  </p><p> Senator John Gilroy asked if there was any evidence of people not having insurance.  Recently I spoke to a legal practitioner in Cork who said he was involved in litigation against a medical practitioner who did not have professional indemnity insurance.  It is happening and important that we close this loophole as soon as possible.</p><p> Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the periodic payments scheme.  The Quirke report on the scheme was very comprehensive and is something at which we need to look in the context of the award of compensation.  Going back to what Senator John Crown said, we need to look at the issue of litigation, which is costing the State and medical practitioners a considerable amount of money, to see if we can do something to deal with it, while ensuring there is adequate compensation for anyone who suffers as a result of inappropriate treatment.  However, there must be limits also. </p><p> I looked at the initial Bill published in 2009 and had consultations during August and September, when there was less pressure on people, which were extremely helpful.  The Bill may not tick all of the boxes, but it covers 90% of the issues which need to be dealt with.  I am a little surprised that the Department believes it needs to draft a totally new Bill because this one can be amended and we can take on board amendments it may propose.  </p><p> The Medical Protection Society has written to me again to say it needs one or two things to be tidied up and I have no difficulty in taking on board its views, as well as those of the Medical Council.  As I said, one cannot drive a car or I cannot practice as a solicitor without insurance, but one's local general practitioner is not required by law to have insurance.  I do not want to alarm people as the vast majority of medical practitioners have insurance, but we need to tidy up this area because under EU regulations, we cannot stop a person from coming to this country and setting up a practice.  We must insist on the public being protected by ensuring there is adequate insurance cover.  That is the reason I brought forward the Bill and why we should proceed with it.</p></speech>

End of Take <p>There are well in excess of 100 students attending Mol an Óige national school, Ennistymon.  The school has applied for permanent recognition for a number of years.  It has temporary recognition.  It believes, I have no reason to doubt, it has met the criteria required by the Department for permanent recognition.  Because of growing numbers, permanent recognition is an important aspiration that needs to become a reality.  Many parents have chosen to opt for this type of education.  The alternative approach being proposed is not that much of an alternative.  Having spoken to a number of parents who have made representations to me, they consider that their children are benefiting from Mol an Óige school.  Given that it is in operation for a number of years, that the children are doing well, that the parents are happy and that it meets the vast majority of the criteria - there may be one or two areas on which discussions are taking place - permanent recognition should be granted.  Were that to be granted it would give the school certainty and facilitate the building of a new school.  At present the school is located in prefabs.  It would provide the certainty it needs to further develop the educational offering being provided at present.</p></speech>

Mol an Óige Steiner national school, which implements the Steiner approach to education, was initially awarded provisional recognition in 2008 and this has been extended year on year.  As the Senator is aware, all recognised schools, regardless of their philosophy or ethos, are required to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the rules for national schools.  Schools seeking permanent recognition must also satisfy specific criteria in relation to patronage, board of management, implementation of the curriculum, admissions policy and procedures for the appointment of teaching staff.  Permanent recognition is contingent on schools demonstrating that they meet those requirements satisfactorily.</p><p>A process is under way in relation to the request for permanent recognition from the school referred to by the Senator.  This process is based on the school's progress in fulfilling ten undertakings committed to by the school's patron in 2007.  These undertakings were based on requirements outlined in the Education Act 1998 and the rules for national schools, as well on the aforementioned criteria which all schools applying for permanent recognition must satisfy.  One of the undertakings is that the school will follow the primary school curriculum as laid down by the Department of Education and Science.</p><p>My Department met with the school authorities in October 2012 to discuss the school's current position in relation to those undertakings and with a view to enabling the school to meet the permanent recognition criteria concerned.  I understand substantial progress has been made.  However, significant issues remain to be resolved particularly in relation to how provision for pupils in the infant classes conforms with the primary school curriculum.  I understand also that the Department and Mol an Óige Steiner national school have committed to ongoing engagement with a view to enabling the school to meet the permanent recognition criteria as soon as possible.</p><p>In that regard, further correspondence has been received recently in respect of the school which is under consideration.  It is important to note that the decision regarding full recognition depends upon the satisfactory implementation of all the undertakings.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the application for permanent recognition from Mol an Oige Steiner national school in County Clare.</p></speech>

It is apt that my question is on the ambulance service, although a long way from St. Vincent's Hospital.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We miss him since he left.  The matter I wish to raise concerns the people who will be affected by the proposed cut in ambulance services in Kenmare, Killarney and Cahirciveen.  In reality it means people are going to die.  That is the stark reality.</p><p>The ambulance service in Kenmare is 24/7.  What we are hearing through the HSE grapevine is that the 24/7 service in Kenmare, Cahirciveen and Killarney will be reduced to an ambulance car at weekends and after 8 p.m.  What that means is that if a person suffers a stroke or a heart attack or there is a serious incident requiring an ambulance in Kenmare, Cahirciveen or Killarney area he or she will get a reduced service.  In an example given to me by experts in the field, it was claimed that if an accident occurs in Lauragh at a weekend and the ambulance has to come from Killarney, it would take up to an hour.  First, an ambulance car would go to the area which, as described to somebody in the profession, is the equivalent of sending a fireman with a fire extinguisher to a blazing house fire when what is needed is the fire brigade.  If the ambulance is required to transport a person to hospital in Cork or Tralee, it would then be called from Killarney.  That ambulance could be out on call which means the ambulance from Tralee would have to be called.  Tralee is an hour at speed from Kenmare and from Lauragh an hour and 20 minutes.  At this stage, as I am sure the good doctor would know, the outcome would be very poor if one was left sitting on the side of a road two hours after the accident took place.  </p><p>The reason I ask the question is that we have been told the service will be downgraded and that the reconfiguration will happen in the next few months.  Public meetings are being planned in Kenmare to prevent this happening.  We know that once the ambulance is gone it will not return.  Ultimately, people will die.  We have carried out an analysis of the ambulance service during the past 12 months which showed that outcomes would have been far worse for people in the community if they had not been transported to hospital by ambulance within an hour of an accident, stroke or heart attack.  They were on the operating table within an hour and a half of the event happening.  If the ambulance service is withdrawn and downgraded it will take two or three hours to get the person to hospital.  As the Minister is aware what will happen is that the person who suffers a heart attack or stroke will occupy a hospital bed and instead of having a stent inserted and recovering in a day or a week, will need rehabilitation and physiotherapy and will cost the taxpayer more.  We all know prevention is better than cure.  By giving people the attention they need as quickly as possible, the taxpayer will ultimately save money.  We are going to be penny wise and pound foolish.  We have been told that we are at the tail end of the process, that money had to be allocated to other constituencies to beef up services in west Cork where a campaign was run, which the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be well aware of it, having been involved in it.  The HSE will try to make the savings in south Kerry and ultimately lives will be lost and there will be worse outcomes as a result of the proposed and threatened downgrading of the ambulance service. </p></speech>

I thank Senator Mark Daly for giving me the opportunity to address this matter.</p><p>The National Ambulance Service, or NAS, is not a static service.  The NAS deploys its resources dynamically and on a regional and national rather than a local basis.  Dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures the nearest appropriate resource is sent to an incident.  Senator Mark Daly may be aware that following a Labour Court decision the NAS has been implementing the phased replacement of on-call with on-duty rostering in the southern region.  On-call rostering means that a crew is not at work but is summoned for a call-out.  The average time from call-out to a vehicle leaving a station is more than 20 minutes.  On-call rostering significantly affects response times, operational capacity, compliance with the Organisation of Working Time Act and health and safety for staff.  An on-call rostering risk assessment has been carried out for inclusion on the NAS risk register and discussions are pending with the Health and Safety Authority on its concerns about the use of on-call services.</p><p>On-duty rostering means that highly trained paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to emergency calls.  On-duty ambulances and response vehicles are deployed dynamically according to need and demand patterns rather than on the basis of station location and can be at optimal locations at any time based on predictive needs assessments.  This allows greater flexibility and responsiveness and will produce better response times and an improved service for the people of Kerry.  The NAS has been taking a number of other steps to improve response times, including a performance improvement action plan, more efficient rostering, an intermediate care service for non-emergency clinical transport, the national control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.</p><p>On the specific query raised by the Senator, the NAS advises that the current on-call static service in Kerry will be replaced.  The NAS is considering the most appropriate model for ambulance services in the Kerry region.  Consultation will take place with a wide range of interests including the public, staff, general practitioners and other health care colleagues.  Other factors to be considered include the results of the implementation of efficiency measures in other regions, new arrangements under public service agreements, activity and demographic analyses and developments in emergency aeromedical support.  In line with the Labour Court recommendations, any new service model must be delivered from within existing resources, not limited to main towns and not based on the current static on-call structure.  When the process is completed an appropriate model will emerge.

I am grateful for his statement and for the previous briefing I received from experts in the field.  Hidden in the Minister of State's statement is Civil Service-speak for box-ticking and ensuring that benchmarks are reached.  When average call-out times are referred to, what is really meant is that a person will be seen by a paramedic or a trained professional.  What is not said is that it will not be by a person in an ambulance.  It can be half an hour or an hour before emergency medical personnel arrive at a location in some parts of Kerry.  When they get to the scene, it will be in an ambulance car.  A person might need to be transported, at which point an ambulance will have to be called for.  This means more time is lost.  Any doctor will tell one that the more time lost in the case of a critical patient, the poorer the outcome.</p><p>I loved the reference - it has got to be great - in the Minister of State's speech to on-call risk assessment with regard to where ambulances will be placed.  This implies that the HSE has a crystal ball and knows where people will have heart attacks and strokes around south Kerry.  It has a risk assessment that tells the HSE to have an ambulance sitting at the Healy Pass or near the tunnel in Glengarriff on a Friday night because that is the part of the world where there will be heart attacks and accidents.  The predictive needs assessment is what is being talked about.  The HSE is predicting where accidents will occur and will locate ambulances there on Friday and Saturday nights or Sundays between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p><p>I see that we will be told before the final service model is implemented but we are not being told what the range of options is.  What we will get from the HSE is a briefing when the new service is about to be implemented but nothing about the practicalities on the ground or the effect it will have on people.  The HSE is trying to say it will have an ambulance on call, but it will be an ambulance car, which is no good to a person who is lying on the side of the road in Sneem, Cahersiveen or Killarney while the ambulance he or she actually needs has gone somewhere else.  That is what we are talking about.  People are going to die because we are taking away the 24/7 front-line service provided by the people who were protesting this week in Tallaght.  People are going to die as a result of the withdrawal of the ambulance service in south Kerry.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Mark Daly for giving me the opportunity to address this matter.</p><p>The National Ambulance Service, or NAS, is not a static service.  The NAS deploys its resources dynamically and on a regional and national rather than a local basis.  Dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures the nearest appropriate resource is sent to an incident.  Senator Mark Daly may be aware that following a Labour Court decision the NAS has been implementing the phased replacement of on-call with on-duty rostering in the southern region.  On-call rostering means that a crew is not at work but is summoned for a call-out.  The average time from call-out to a vehicle leaving a station is more than 20 minutes.  On-call rostering significantly affects response times, operational capacity, compliance with the Organisation of Working Time Act and health and safety for staff.  An on-call rostering risk assessment has been carried out for inclusion on the NAS risk register and discussions are pending with the Health and Safety Authority on its concerns about the use of on-call services.</p><p>On-duty rostering means that highly trained paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to emergency calls.  On-duty ambulances and response vehicles are deployed dynamically according to need and demand patterns rather than on the basis of station location and can be at optimal locations at any time based on predictive needs assessments.  This allows greater flexibility and responsiveness and will produce better response times and an improved service for the people of Kerry.  The NAS has been taking a number of other steps to improve response times, including a performance improvement action plan, more efficient rostering, an intermediate care service for non-emergency clinical transport, the national control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.</p><p>On the specific query raised by the Senator, the NAS advises that the current on-call static service in Kerry will be replaced.  The NAS is considering the most appropriate model for ambulance services in the Kerry region.  Consultation will take place with a wide range of interests including the public, staff, general practitioners and other health care colleagues.  Other factors to be considered include the results of the implementation of efficiency measures in other regions, new arrangements under public service agreements, activity and demographic analyses and developments in emergency aeromedical support.  In line with the Labour Court recommendations, any new service model must be delivered from within existing resources, not limited to main towns and not based on the current static on-call structure.  When the process is completed an appropriate model will emerge.  The HSE is committed to briefing Members of the Oireachtas, public representatives generally and community leaders before implementing a final service model.</p></speech>
