    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-03-20a.125" nospeaker="true" time="18:10:00"><p>Committee Stage ordered for Thursday, 21 March 2013.

Sitting suspended at 5.55 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.</p> <p> With regard to the employment and investment incentive, EII, the hotel sector currently employs 51,000 individuals.  Since the downturn in the economy, approximately 100 hotels have been placed in receivership or have ceased trading.  Access to funding will permit hotels to invest in refurbishment and enhancement.  In order to qualify for EII, hotels must be considered to be tourist traffic undertakings and, as such, will be required to have three-year development and marketing plans approved by FÃ¡ilte Ireland.</p><p>Senator Barrett also raised the issue of cost benefit analysis in respect of the research and development tax credit.  The Senator may be interested to know that the Department of Finance has already announced a comprehensive review of the tax credit, which will take place throughout 2013.  The terms of reference of the review have been published on the Department's website.  One of the central purposes of the review is to ensure the research and development tax credit gives value for money to the Irish taxpayer and, accordingly, a cost benefit analysis will be included.</p><p>I appreciate the views of Senator Quinn in respect of tax-exempt access to additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, and access to the main pension fund.  However, contributions to AVCs benefitted from marginal tax relief when invested.  We must also strike a balance between access to funds and ensuring people are encouraged to make adequate provision for their retirement income.</p><p>Senator Gilroy referred to the case of a self-employed person with a four-year-old child whose business failed, leading to severe problems.  These cases are extremely difficult.  In seeking to remediate them through the tax system, we need to make sure we do not widen the problem and create a bigger problem for other families.  We are in a programme and trying to work our way out of a bankrupt situation.  In that respect, we are still running a major deficit and so every concession made on tax must be made at the expense of another set of taxpayers.  Any concession made, whether the measures suggested today or others, can only be achieved if I tax somewhere else.  Senators must remember that.</p><p>The debate here and in the other House tends always to highlight the very difficult cases of individuals.  There are some very difficult cases for individuals but by highlighting these one tends to forget the generality of cases, which one cannot personalise in the same way.  In trying to correct the hard case, one damages the general situation and that is one of the dilemmas.  It is a question of judgment whether one taxes this or does not tax that.  At present, we are in a position of very difficult choices but as the economy continues to grow and as we work our way out of this, I hope we will be positioned to give relief to those most in need where we will not need to raise taxes elsewhere so that we can use the fruits of growth to relieve the difficult situation of our poorest families and to move on.  I hope the economy will grow and continue to grow.  It is growing this year, it grew last year and the year before.  If we could get greater growth rates, many of our problems would be solved at a quicker pace.</p><p>We will return on Committee Stage and I look forward to a debate on the detail of the Bill.  I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate and we will deal with the specifics later.</p></speech>
