My officials consulted school management bodies prior to issuing the circular and are setting up further meetings with management bodies and parent representative groups to allay fears. </p><p>  Last December the Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts for the period to the end of December 2014, which means that there are now almost 11,000 SNAs available to work with children who have an assessed care need in primary, post-primary and special schools.  There are some 10,965 posts available for allocation, of which 10,656 SNA posts have been allocated, more than at any time previously.  This means that rather than a reduction in the number of SNA posts, there is provision for a further 309 posts to be allocated to schools to the end of December.  These extra posts will ensure the Government's policy of ensuring every child assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to support.  Implementation of the circular should ensure children's care needs are better understood in order that SNAs can work more effectively to assist children.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but parents and teachers across the country have noted a squeezing of the SNA support available to students and are rightly concerned about the tone of the aforementioned circular from the Department.  A number of specific points made in the circular are giving rise to concern among parents and teachers.  It states that in order to receive SNA support, the care needs outlined must be of such significance that they are beyond what would normally be expected to be provided by way of support for a child by the class teacher or other school teachers or beyond the level of assistance which would be offered by other students or the student's fellow pupils.  The idea that a departmental circular would put the responsibility on fellow pupils to cater for needs that up to now would have been catered for by SNAs is of great concern to many.  At post-primary level, the circular states only students with chronic and serious care needs should need SNA support and that continued and ongoing access to SNA support is generally not desirable for post-primary students.  The tone of this statement is deeply unsympathetic.  I ask the Minister of State, in the context of the aforementioned points made in the circular which are causing real concern in terms of their implications for students who need support, to provide reassurance that this does not indicate a further squeeze on SNA hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900003#A00700"><p>The Deputy referred to the squeezing of SNA posts, but that is certainly not what is occurring.  As I mentioned, we have the highest number of SNA posts allocated in the history of the State and there are 309 posts yet to be allocated between now and the end of the December.</p><p>  I will outline why the circular was issued.  In June 2011 the Department initiated a value for money review of the SNA scheme.  In May 2013 the National Council for Special Education published its policy advice on supporting children with special educational needs in schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme had been very successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and assisting in their integration and inclusion.  Ultimately, that is the function and role of the SNA - to assist in meeting the care needs of the young person who may initially find it challenging to operate in a school environment, particularly at primary level.  However, I argue that it is the ambition of every parent and teacher of every child with special needs that ultimately the child achieve full independence and succeed to the best of his or her capacity while moving through the education system.  That is ultimately what we are trying to achieve; we are not trying to frighten people.  The criteria for the allocation of SNAs have not changed.  When a young person needs SNA support, it will be available up until the point where he or she can operate independently.  Ultimately, that is the ambition of parents and teachers in general when it comes to caring for children with special needs.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may not care to admit it, but it is going to make it more difficult for students who need SNA support to receive it.  That is a fact.  We have already seen cases in our constituency offices of children who previously had SNA support and who are now in the process of losing it because the goal posts have moved significantly.  The new circular states a child must have a "profound" disability in order to qualify for SNA support.  Much of the change comes on the back of the review about which the Minister of State spoke.  One of the findings of the review was that many schools did not know what was the role or remit of SNAs.  There is a lot of work to be done with schools in that regard.  Schools must be educated on the role and remit of SNAs and how best to use them.  However, that does not take away from the fact that many parents are extremely worried that children who currently receive SNA support are going to lose it because of the annual review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900004#B00100"><p>I agree with the Deputy when he makes reference to the importance of clarifying the role of special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools.  As I stated in my earlier reply, the Department's officials are at present engaging with school management bodies and parent representative groups to outline exactly this to them, as well as to allay any concerns or fears they might have that the recent circular will lead to a reduction in SNA numbers or allocations, because that is not the intention and certainly is not what will happen.  It always has been standard practice that SNA allocations are reviewed annually.  The circular acknowledges that pupils will have care needs that will remain constant and there are some disabilities which remain with the young person throughout his or her life.  In the case of such young people, their care needs rarely evolve or improve.  However, for very large numbers of other children, the exact opposite happens and with the support of an SNA and the classroom teacher, those care needs diminish over time, which is something that should be welcomed.  The fact that SNA allocations are reviewed annually does not mean this will lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils or for schools that have pupils who have continuing needs.</p><p>  I stress that what is being done here is simply clarifying the role of the SNA and ensuring that where an SNA support is needed and where those resources need to be channelled to those who need it most, this will be done and is exactly what will happen.  While I do not make this charge against the two Deputies opposite, I caution people against spreading fear among parents that this circular somehow will diminish the allocation of SNAs.  That is not the intention and as I stated previously, the Government is increasing the number of posts by 309 before the end of this year.  At the end of 2014, the number of SNAs allocated in the education system will be the highest since the SNA support system began.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900004#B00200"><p>In his earlier response, the Minister of State outlined that it is the ambition of every parent that his or her child will get to a position where he or she does not need any SNA support.  Indeed, it is the hope of every parent at the outset that his or her child would not need such support in the first place.  However, in cases where a child needs such support, it is the ambition of a parent to be able to have the reassurance that the child actually will receive it when it is needed.  The important point here is that reassurance should be given that this service will be provided.  However, in recent years, the experience on the ground has been quite different.  In common with the other Members present, I am sure the Minister of State will have spoken to teachers and parents.  When one visits a school, one of the biggest difficulties teachers will raise is the pressure on them in respect of SNA resources.  While the number of SNAs has increased slightly, the Minister of State indicated there would be a further 300 this year, the actual demand last September alone, for example, increased by 10%.  The number of SNA supports did not match that increase.  In addition, there has been a similar increase in demand for resource teacher posts and as a result, the Government decided to try to reduce the resource teaching hours being allocated per student but subsequently made a U-turn in that regard.  Similarly, the Government did not increase the number of SNAs.  A difficulty also arises with regard to the increasing practice of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, giving shared access to an SNA at school level, after which the responsibility is left with the teachers and the school to try to manage that.  This is exceptionally difficult and nearly impossible in many situations.</p></speech>

In carrying out that assessment, they indicate what resources and help a student may need.  At present, SNAs are being allocated to schools and unfortunately, the number of SNAs that some schools have does not match the needs of their students and thereafter, a great onus is being left on school management to try to distribute those SNAs as best as possible.  Does the Minister of State agree that if a SENO's assessment states that a child is in need of a particular resource such as, for example, an SNA or so many hours per week, this student should get that support and this should not be constrained by budgetary measures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900004#B00800"><p>To clarify once again, the purpose of this circular was not to provide for or allow for a reduction in the number of SNAs allocated nationwide.  That there will be almost 11,000 SNAs in place by the end of the year is testament to this fact.  The purpose of the circular simply was to clarify the role of the SNA in the school setting.  That role is to provide for the care needs of a young person who needs such support to be able to operate successfully in a school environment.  In the past, perhaps, the role of the SNA somehow had expanded beyond that role and it was important to be able to clarify for parents, teachers and school communities as a whole what exactly that role required.  It is not and never has been the intention to use this circular somehow to reduce the supports available to young children who are in need of those supports to be able to function successfully in a school environment.  Ultimately, the professional decision that is taken on the allocation of SNAs rests with their SENOs, who work as agents of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, at a local level.  The SENOs engage with parents and teachers and conduct a professional assessment of whether a child requires that SNA support.  They also carry out an ongoing review of each child's individual care needs as the child progresses through the school system.  Consequently, if that SENO makes that recommendation, then yes, the child obviously will need, require and secure those kinds of supports.  However, as a child goes through the system, his or her care needs over time evolve and hopefully will lessen.  It is important to reflect this in the allocation of SNAs in order that those who are entering the school system, perhaps at junior infants for the first time, can have resources directed towards them in times when the resources available are very scarce.</p></speech>

At 29 years, this Gaelscoil has waited longer than any other school in the country for a permanent building.  The past 11 years has been spent in a site owned by the Department of Education and Skills in ageing prefabs, some owned by and others rented by the Department.  To date, almost &euro;2 million has been spent on temporary accommodation.  Does the Minister of State agree this is an excessive waste of public funds and is money that could have been spent constructing a new school?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900004#B01200"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  This can necessitate the use of temporary accommodation, as in the case of the school in question, until the Department is in a position to provide a permanent building.  The delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  The five-year plan announced by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, early in the lifetime of the Government prioritises new school building projects, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established.  Tramore, where the school is located, has not been identified by the Department as an area of significant demographic growth.  A project for the school was not, therefore, included in that five-year plan.</p><p>  The school's building project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, that is, stage 2b.  This stage 2b report is currently being reviewed by the Department.  Following this review, the Department will contact the school authority regarding the potential, at that time, for further progression of the project in the context of available funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900004#B01300"><p>That was an extraordinary answer.  The Department of Education and Skills has told the school's board of management that it is prioritising areas of demographic growth for new schools.  The population of Tramore increased by 7% between 2006 and 2011, with 30% of the population classified as being of preschool and school-going age.  Over the past decade, enrolments in Tramore increased by more than 500 pupils and if this does not constitute demographic growth, I do not know what does.  Incidentally, last August this project was authorised to proceed to stage 2b, meaning all planning and statutory approval had been completed.</p><p>  In a letter to me last September, the Minister commented that he made contact with the school with the potential for further progression of the project.  Incidentally, we still are waiting for a reply.  In the course of the Minister's visit to the school, he suggested that despite having a site ready with full planning permission in place, the school could be accommodated in a place called the Stella Maris building, which has been rejected by the school and parents.  In October 2011, the Minister wrote to me to confirm that the project was on the original construction list but this never happened.  I ask the Minister of State to tell the parents, children and teachers of the school why this is the case, based on what the Minister wrote to me and based on the information he gave to the school, the teachers and the families.</p></speech>

Using that data, it has been concluded that Tramore, where the school is located, is not currently an area of significant demographic growth.  That is hard verifiable data from the CSO and the Department of Social Protection, from which one is able to document every child living within a certain radius of that school.</p><p> The Department has a major challenge to face in terms of delivering school buildings over the next number of years and I am sure the Deputy is more than aware that enrolment in post-primary and primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level.  That is a major challenge we face in terms of providing classroom space for those young people.  The Minister has always expressed a fear that at some point we would arrive at a situation where children of school-going age would simply turn up at a school with no classroom space available for them.  </p><p> Prefabricated classrooms are not the ideal environment for any school and we all wish we had the resources not to have to use prefabricated accommodation.   However, for the moment, those young people in Tramore have a school and classrooms.  They have quite a modern school environment, based on the fact that most of the investment was made over the past three or four years.  As we say, when resources become available to us, we will be able to progress that project to a new school building at some point in the future.</p></speech>

Some 30 children had to be evacuated, many of whom were asthmatic.  Was the Minister of State not aware that one of the prefabs had collapsed?  In 2012, the Department promised to reinstate the school building project to a building list.  Why has that not been done?  I am not too sure if the Minister of State is aware of what is happening in his Department?  He is not aware as to whether the school has been reinstated to the building list?  Is he not aware that one of the prefabs collapsed and children had to be evacuated?  That was on the national news.</p><p>  The Minister of State needs to clarify his position on Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n.  The Minister promised the school building project would be reinstated to the building list but the Minister of State said the opposite.  I have shown the Minister of State where the demographics come into play with the number of children on the school list and the population growth in Tramore.  Surely that warrants people not having to be educated in prefabricated buildings in a state of collapse.</p></speech>

It is currently on a school building list.  There are many other such projects in the same situation.  There is, and there always has been, two separate building lists in operation.  There is the five year capital programme announced by the Minister early in the lifetime of the Government to address that very significant demographic challenge in areas of increasing population and to cater for those 70,000 children coming into our system but alongside that, there is another list on which this school is included and where we are moving schools to a point where they are ready to move to construction.  The Deputy is aware that the stage 2b report is currently being reviewed by my Department.  Following that review, the Department will contact the school authority.  There will be ongoing engagement with the school authority and it is not true to say it has somehow dropped off the radar or a list of priorities for the Department.</p></speech>

The task force is chaired by the two Departments and includes representatives from QQI,  Enterprise Ireland and City of Dublin Education and Training Board as well as representatives of the private high-quality higher education and English language sectors and the Irish Council for International Students.</p><p>  This group is charged with assessing the scale of the issue and, in particular, the number of genuine students who have not yet been accommodated.  It will also determine what capacity is available in the sector to make accommodation for students and will oversee a system that seeks to make such accommodation.    </p><p>  The co-chairs of the task force have been asked to make an interim report by this Friday.  For the sake of the students involved, it is important to be clear that their immigration permissions have been extended by the Department of  Justice and Equality to allow them to continue to work to support themselves and to allow them space to make alternative arrangements.</p><p>  The Government is also introducing a robust quality framework to ensure that only the highest quality providers can attract students from outside the EEA to Ireland.  At the heart of this will be the international education mark, provided for in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 and which will be awarded by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  This mark will be introduced from the end of this year.</p></reply>

Anyone who has met or listened to interviews with the students affected by the closure of those language schools will be in no doubt as to the distress faced by many very genuine language students.  There were abuses in a number of cases but the reality is that many students who came to this country, specifically to be educated and to learn English, find themselves stranded as a result of these five colleges closing.  There are serious questions in regard to how that can happen.  I have no doubt the Minister of State is aware of the impact that could have on our international reputation and of the importance of getting to grips with this quickly and ensuring it cannot happen again.</p><p>  Many of the students who have been left stranded are in financial difficulty because they paid money for those courses.  What can be done to recompense those students so that they can continue a course?  The Irish Council for International Students suggested the establishment of a pop-up English language school to try to ensure those students can continue to learn English and pursue their education.</p></speech>

For the majority of them, it is an alien environment.  They have been left high and dry without any support or hope that they may be able to pursue the education they wish to pursue in this country.</p><p>  This task force has all the participants one would require on such a task force to be able to address this issue and it was established with lightening speed by the Minister.  It will issue an interim report this Friday but, in the meantime, it is working hard to ensure the students have their visas extended so they are not forced to leave the country and retain the right to work to support themselves while they await an outcome.   We have been trying to accommodate those students in other English language schools which operate to far higher standards.  It is important to point out that the colleges which closed were private businesses and they were not backed by the State financially or in terms of other learner protection.  The Deputy is quite right that we need to be very concerned about how this impacts on Ireland's image abroad as a destination for international education.  Ireland earns just under &euro;1 billion per annum from international education and it is one of our most significant exports.  </p><p>  We have been working very closely with the education in Ireland unit in Enterprise Ireland, the QQI and my officials to provide for this quality mark, which is provided for in the legislation underpinning QQI.  With the establishment of the quality mark it will not be possible for any institution to market itself abroad under the education in Ireland brand without having that quality mark assigned to it.  It will be a mark parents, students, academics and teachers internationally can trust.  If an institution operates under that mark, it will be operating to an exceptionally high standard where one can trust the content and quality of the education being delivered.  </p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where there is a question mark over existing colleges.  Does the Minister of State believe there is a threat to any other colleges or a danger of other colleges closing down?  What steps is the Minister taking to stand over the services currently being provided for students coming to this country?</p><p>  The most urgent aspect relates to those students currently in distress and stranded.  It is more than five weeks since some of those colleges closed down.  I know the task force is in place but many students have been left in a very difficult situation.  Urgent action is critical.  The least we can do is to provide for their needs.</p><p>The Minister of State might also give his view on how this came to pass that we can have allowed this situation arise and so many students end up in big trouble as a result.</p></speech>

It is an issue across the world where private institutions, primarily English language schools, set up purporting to offer a high standard of education when, in fact, upon scrutiny they offer a poor standard and few supports for students who find themselves in that difficult situation.</p><p>  The quality mark will be put in place by the end of this year.  Education in Ireland has been working exceptionally hard over the past three years, and travelling abroad.  Indeed, I have travelled abroad with them on a number of occasions with the third level institutions, colleges, universities and institutes of technology.  Every time we travel abroad, we stress repeatedly the exceptionally high quality of the education being provided by the vast majority of institutions in this country.</p><p>  At the end of this year, we will have a quality mark that we can stand over and under which an institution will have that credibility and build for itself a strong reputation for the provision of exceptionally high quality education.  We will work to ensure that any young person who is contemplating coming to study in this country must protect himself or herself by ensuring he or she does not subscribe or attend an institution or college that does not have that quality mark.  I am confident we will be able to build that brand internationally so every educational support and opportunity that is offered to young people entering this country will be of that exceptionally high standard and that over time those who cannot operate to those high standards will simply be pushed out of business.</p></speech>

There is a need to strike that balance.  Of course, these latter programmes also assist learners on their journey to employment, and we should never try somehow to separate those two objectives.  Of the programmes with an economic focus, investment priorities will be determined by good quality labour market intelligence that identifies sectors with skills requirements over time.</p><p>  The strategy contains strategic goals, both on providing skills for the economy and on such active inclusion.  All programmes, regardless of their focus, will be reviewed over the lifetime of the strategy.  However, the strategy recommends, subject to overall budgetary constraints, sustaining the levels of funding relating to literacy and numeracy and adult education in the immediate term.  That is the most immediate challenge that we face.</p><p>  Therefore, I am not concerned that the FET strategy will neglect non-tech or non-business related further education in the future.</p></reply>

I note that the strategy contains a number of initiatives for those who are not yet at that stage and whose further education and training is about enhancing their personal development.  The local training initiatives, the specialist training providers and the community training centres all will play a key role in enhancing a persons' personal development.</p><p>  In the strategy, there are a number of elements.  One of them is that the relationship with the business community is paramount to the success of the strategy.  I wonder how that will work out on the ground.  Will there be forums established to allow members of the FET to relate to the business sector?  Is it individual providers and employer representative groups who will sit on those forums?  If possible, I want to tease that out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900006#D00600"><p>The strategy has identified five high-level goals.  Goal number two is to support the active inclusion of those of all abilities in society with special reference to literacy and numeracy.  I suppose the best analogy I can draw in terms of what the strategy is setting to achieve is that on the national framework for qualifications, NFQ, there are ten levels or, if you like, ten different floors, and the lift needs to go to every floor.  Every person who is on whatever level, from level one to level six, seven or eight, needs to be able to press the button and be assured that the lift arrives at his or her floor and allows him or her to access that NFQ at whatever point is appropriate for him or her.</p><p>  I was fortunate to be able to engage with a significant number of learners in the run-up to the development of SOLAS and the strategy, and one of the overriding concerns of learners was that they needed to be able to access high quality educational opportunities in their community, home town or village.  That is still very much at the heart of the strategy.  That first engagement, that first support which people can find so difficult, will be supported and nurtured by SOLAS and the ETBs in future.</p><p>  In terms of engagement with employers, it is exceptionally important that such engagement occurs so we can ensure the learning and training opportunities we are providing for people are up to date and respond directly to the needs of the employment market, right at this point in time and as it evolves over time as it is doing on a rapid basis.</p><p>  As Deputy O'Brien will be aware, there are industry representatives on the board of SOLAS, but also there is provision in the legislation for similar representatives on the boards of the ETBs.  Each education and training board, ETB, is currently determining how exactly it can provide for that engagement, but Deputy O'Brien's suggestion of a forum is worthwhile.  In meeting some significant employers, I have already spoken to some CEOs who are going down that route.  For example, in Galway city there are 8,000 employed in medical devices manufacturing who hold a significant key to the future success of that city and region and it would be reasonable to expect that they would have a role to play in determining the kinds of learning and training opportunities provided in that region.  It will be done on a regional basis reflecting the needs of each individual region for which the ETB has responsibility.</p></speech>

In relation to the ETBs, because they are such a new entity, some ETBs may be more successful at creating those forums.  I wonder what facility is there in place for the individual CEOs to take best practice from each ETB area and how that will be managed.</p><p>As to my other question, one of the points in the report, on page 19, on how we measure the success of the strategy, is:<blockquote>Everybody who engages with FET, whether employed or unemployed or wishing to engage with FET for the purpose of learning, can access a high quality career guidance, counselling and labour marketing information service.</blockquote>Will the Minister of State give us some more information on how that will be achieved in practice rather than in theory?</p></speech>

That sharing of best practice will be facilitated by SOLAS at national level.  If we see examples of best practice occurring in any part of the country - I expect we will see it occurring in all parts of the country in terms of different kinds of provision and different kinds of training opportunities - it is the ambition of SOLAS to allow for that information and best practice to be shared across the system of 16 ETBs.</p><p>  In terms of the engagement at local level, the primary engagement for the unemployed will be through their Intreo office.  On approaching their Intreo office, they will be able to access two unique and distinct different kinds of advice: first, the advice from the Department of Social Protection as to what kind of social welfare supports are available for them while they find themselves in that difficult place of being unemployed; and second, expert guidance from staff from within the ETB as to what exactly are the job opportunities because there will be a forensic and ongoing analysis of job opportunities in each ETB region, and then guidance and advice as to how a person can access those opportunities.  Those opportunities will be there.  The provision of education and training in each region will reflect the skills demands in each region and will be up to date and responsive to the demands of the labour market at the time.  There will be those opportunities and there will be guidance given as to how one can access those opportunities.</p></speech>

Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach.  The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support.  In February the Department of Education and Skills published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools.  This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.</p></reply>

The letter requested principals to facilitate their guidance counsellors' attendance at professional counselling supervision on five occasions for two hours each time during the next academic year.  This service, which is funded and overseen by the Department, was put in place by a previous Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that all the one-to-one counselling taking place in schools meets the highest ethical standards and that guidance practitioners receive constant professional supervision to ensure these standards are maintained.  Given the often difficult personal issues that students raise in their interactions with guidance counsellors, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the maintenance of such high professional standards is essential.  Is he now stating that while those who are professionally trained and subject to ongoing supervision of their work as guidance counsellors have lost 59% of the time available to them to undertake this activity, the implications are limited because guidance should be a whole-school activity?  That is not a situation anyone can stand over.  I ask him to specifically address that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900007#E00600"><p>In my earlier reply I outlined to the Deputy how the vast majority of guidance support will operate within the school community in future.  The representative organisations for school principals and my Department have worked to develop a framework to allow schools to best manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocations.  That puts a greater emphasis on group work and class-based activity and, for the significant majority of the role fulfilled by guidance counsellors, I argue that it is more than sufficient.  Where the need arises for one-to-one support for young people, particularly where they experience mental health issues or other challenges, it is important that guidance and support are allocated to them as needed.  Well developed and managed student support teams are central to the successful implementation of guidance, and two previous documents which have outlined how that might happen are the guidelines Well-Being in Post-Primary School, which were published in 2013, and A Continuum of Support for Post-Primary Schools, which was published in 2010.  These documents provide a framework for schools to support students with social, emotional or academic needs, and their implementation will make a significant contribution to the general well-being of young people and provide a stable and supportive learning environment for all students.</p><p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions.  The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being.  If a school manages its resources well in terms of guidance, I do not think either of those provisions will suffer at any point in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900007#E00700"><p>The evidence shows there has been a reduction of 59% in one-to-one guidance counselling time since the Government introduced the cuts.  The Minister of State referred to a framework his Department is trying to develop with principals to govern how guidance counsellors should operate.  I remind him once again of the framework that was put in place a number of years ago to ensure that guidance counsellors are professionally supervised and trained in counselling, particularly in one-to-one counselling.  It is a service that requires training and people who know what they are doing.  In essence, the Minister of State is saying that subject teachers who do not have professional counselling skills will be expected to consider this work as part of whole-school guidance and an activity in which they can comfortably engage.  Is the Minister of State comfortable with allowing teachers who have no qualifications in counselling to counsel vulnerable children, while at the same time insisting on the highest standards of counselling from those who are qualified to do so?</p><p>  This is an exceptionally important service.  Students are encountering more difficulties with mental health now than they have in the past.  The incidence of self-harm is increasing.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently spoke in a radio interview about her plans to deploy nurses with relevant qualifications to accident and emergency departments to deal with people presenting with mental health problems.  When people present to accident and emergency departments they have already been failed by the supports that should be on offer in the community and schools.</p><p>  The Minister of State is trying to deflect from this issue by minimising the impact of the 59% reduction in one-to-one counselling time.  This is not something the Government should stand over because it is not safe or fair to children who need support from our school system and the State.  The matter needs to be reconsidered with a view to reinstating supports for guidance counselling in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900007#E00800"><p>The 59% reduction in one-to-one counselling time to which the Deputy referred includes both the guidance that a child or young person might need to deal with issues arising in school, such as bullying or mental health problems, and career guidance support for young people.  With a better allocation of resources and a reallocation of guidance counsellors' time, the supports that a child or young person might need for his or her mental well-being and in dealing with challenges are capable of being catered for within the new guidance counselling structure.  The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.  Even as our budgetary situation recovers, hopefully, over the coming years, I do not believe we should reinstate that one dedicated guidance post.  I do not think it is necessary because, with some innovation and imagination, we can end up with a more holistic guidance and counselling support service across all of the teaching community in a school.  I do not subscribe to the assertion that teachers, as highly trained individuals and responsible adults operating in a school environment, do not have the professional capacity or knowledge to deal with a significant number of the issues that arise in their classrooms on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The Minister has asked his officials to continue to have discussions with the partners through the national working group on junior cycle.  He has received detailed suggestions, particularly from the management and patron bodies, which will inform the discussions, but he continues to await similar written submissions from the teacher unions.</p><p>The Minister's door has always been, and will remain, open to anyone in the teaching profession and their representative bodies who want to engage as to how best to deliver this very significant reform of our education system at junior cycle.</p></reply>

We must ask to what extent it will be possible to reconcile the need for reform with the question whether the review of students by their teachers is the appropriate way to do it and the willingness on the part of teachers and their unions to cross that Rubicon in the interests of education and the children.</p></speech>

The group includes representatives from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, all the school management bodies, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, Educate Together, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examination Commission.  It has established three subgroups to examine closely the challenges that some have suggested might emanate from this reform.  The subgroups are on quality assurance and support for teacher assessment, continuing professional development required to support teachers and school leaders to implement the junior cycle, and workload and implementation issues for schools and teachers.</p><p>  The subgroup on quality assurance and support is considering ways the assessment and moderation of the new junior cycle will be addressed.  The management bodies, Educate Together and parents have provided written submissions containing their views and they are being considered by the Department.  However, without a written submission from teachers it is impossible to have the balanced debate the Deputy rightly suggests we have.  The teachers must make that submission to represent their views alongside all the other education partners.  Without it we are operating in a vacuum.  I call upon the teachers' unions across the country to make submissions, engage with the process and, hopefully, arrive at a point where we can collectively move forward together to implement the reform.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is being disingenuous when he says he does not know the teachers' unions' concerns because they have not provided a written submission.

That is where there is disagreement and the Minister of State refuses to take on board what teachers and parents want.

When those partners raise valid concerns about the implementation of the reformed junior cycle, it is important to engage with them.  That engagement has been ongoing and the national working group has been established.  However, it is exceptionally difficult to operate in an environment where a significant number of the representative groups involved in the process have not made written submissions.  We need those ideas as to how we can make this work to the best possible extent.  Teachers are professionals and I have every confidence in their professionalism and integrity.  Until they put their heads together and use their professional experience to suggest how exactly we can implement the reform, it is very difficult to move forward.</p></speech>

Section 7 of Circular 0030/2014 states that access to SNA support for pupils with behavioural care needs will only be sanctioned under certain conditions.  It seems to indicate that the Department believes a child with behavioural care needs should first be disciplined and punished by a school before SNA support is provided.  Will the Minister explain the rationale behind the policy?</p></reply>

However, for most pupils, the circular sets out that it is important to assess how pupils respond to behaviour management strategies in class before allocating SNA support, as SNA support is not designed to be that first response to behavioural difficulties.  This section of the circular will not prevent those pupils who need support from receiving that support.</p></reply>

A parent I know in Wexford, Jane Johnstone, has pointed out to me that the section of the circular is a serious concern for many parents.  She stated:<blockquote>Most of our kids wouldn't have the understanding of rules, and when kids present with challenging behaviours it's largely due to one of two reasons - either they can't communicate their needs, or are over-stimulated and unable to cope with their environment due to a sensory processing disability.  To implement disciplinary action on a child who has a disability or autism is therefore effectively punishing them for having a disability, and for breaking rules that they cannot understand.  In addition, there is a fear that these kids will be suspended or expelled, and will fall out of the education system completely, in the absence of needs-based support.</blockquote>Is it not true that more difficult arrangements are being put in place to save money?</p></speech>

They are being put in place to clarify the role of the SNA and to ensure that this nation's scarce resources are directed towards those who need them most.  The Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts last December up to the end of this year, which means that almost 11,000 SNAs are now available to work.   That is the largest number of SNAs we have had since the foundation of the SNA support system.  It is not about saving money; it is about ensuring that those children who need SNA support can have access to it.</p><p>  It is important to point out also that professionals - teachers - have significant skills, and they acquire those skills in their training in behaviour management within the classroom setting.  Those behaviour management skills apply to all children, and they have the capacity to determine the way and on what basis they are applied.  </p><p>  Despite the tough economic circumstances we faced, we protected - and in some cases regarding SNA provision, increased - the budget devoted to supporting our children.  This is not about saving money.  It is a reflection of our Government's priorities to protect and cherish our children who have special educational needs.  The circular does not seek to remove or reduce SNA support to those children who are very much in need of it.</p></speech>

The number of children needing help has increased a great deal and we have not kept pace in dealing with them.  We know that resources are stretched, but children are falling behind now because they do not have as much support.  The Minister of State said that teachers are qualified to look after many of these children, but the teachers already have their hands full dealing with the other children.  The Minister cannot deny that children with difficulties will fall further behind, and it is unfair to allow so much of an impact on their potential to improve, which is what the parents are telling me is happening.</p></speech>

It is not fair to characterise - I am not making this accusation about Deputy Wallace - all children with special needs as having behavioural difficulties; a significant number of them do not.  The professional assessment and conclusion drawn by the SENO should be the main factor in determining whether young people need SNA support.  It is not and has never been the intention of this Government to reduce the support available to special needs children within our school system.  This circular is, first, clarifying the role of the SNAs in terms of their function within the classroom setting and, second, ensuring that those children who need SNA support from the first day they enter the school environment have that support available to them.  As their needs evolve and change and, hopefully, diminish, that SNA support can be reduced - there is nothing wrong with that - and those supports can be allocated to other children coming into the system who might be more deserving of them at that time.</p></speech>

I attended one of the 12 meetings that took place throughout the country.  There were attendances of 50, 60 and 70 people at the 12 meetings.  The Minister has before him a survey by a reputable polling company telling him that 60% of parents believe that independent assessment at junior cycle level should continue.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has not been listening on this issue.  He tried to dismiss it as a concern of teachers alone and said that the parents to whom he had spoken did not have a concern.  The evidence is available now to indicate that parents believe independent assessment should continue.  I asked transition year students for their views and the majority of them believe independent assessment should continue.

However, there are times in the lifetime of any Government when somebody must take the lead and a stand in terms of what needs to be done to reform the education system.  Nobody denies that the junior certificate programme, as constituted, is broken.  It serves no function or purpose in empowering young people to be exceptionally able in the future.  We abolished the primary certificate programme many years ago when it became apparent that it also served no useful function.  Everybody agrees that this is the right direction in which to move.  There is no question about this; what is at issue is implementation.  The Minister and I have engaged with young people on a number of issues in the recent past, including this one.  The door is open in terms of how we should implement this badly needed reform of the junior cycle system.  The working group has been established and includes representatives of the parents council.  As I said, we propose to re-engage with parents and will do our best to make people aware of the opportunities to engage with us at various centres throughout the country.  There will be a public relations campaign around these opportunities.  Our door is open to parents, student and teacher representatives.  Nobody denies this is the direction in which we need to move.  I agree that we need to re-engage to determine how we can address the concerns raised by parents and teachers.</p></speech>

The initial National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working group report on the future of junior certificate reform advocated that the 60% examination part of the new junior cycle student award should be independently marked.  The Minister made a unilateral decision not to accept this recommendation.  At the teachers' conferences last year he described junior certificate reform as a person political project.  The result of his approach to this matter is that teachers are refusing to co-operate and there is talk of further industrial action by them in the autumn.  As pointed out by the Minister of State, reform of the second level system is very much needed.  However, it is being bogged down and brought into question by the approach being taken by the Minister.  One of the key issues is independent assessment.  It is time the Minister opened his door and worked with others in coming up with a solution and that he take on board the views of parents, teachers and students on independent assessment and incorporated it into the very much needed reform of the junior cycle system.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting the Deputy is making that charge.  As parents, we receive reports on the academic achievements and social success or otherwise in the school setting of our children at the end of first and second year and the first half of third year.  We have trusted this system for decades.  Why should we not trust it now?  That is one of the key questions for me.  That said, if parents and the teaching profession, in which I have the utmost faith, are expressing concerns, we need to re-engage.  Without that engagement and the support of parents, teacher unions and young people we cannot move forward together.  The Minister has stated he is open to significant discussion on the independent assessment and verification of young people's achievements, academically and otherwise.  His door and that of the Department of Education and Skills remain open.  As I stated, we propose to engage again with parents in the next number of weeks.  This engagement will continue until we arrive at a consensus on how to move forward together.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900010#H01000"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  First, this legislation will establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  This is one of the key elements of the programme for Government and the medium-term economic strategy published last December.  The ISIF will take over the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, comprising some &euro;6.9 billion in the discretionary portfolio at the end of the first quarter of the year, to be used for commercial investment in the economy to support economic activity and employment and some &euro;13.3 billion representing the directed investments in the pillar banks, together with related cash balances.</p><p>  Second, the legislation will put NewERA, New Economy and Recovery Authority, on a statutory basis.  The core role of NewERA is to provide financial and commercial advice on commercial semi-State bodies for shareholding Ministers.  NewERA's role also involves, where requested, advising on the disposal or restructuring of State assets.  In addition, it works with relevant stakeholders to develop proposals for investment in energy, broadband, water and forestry projects.  It has been operating as a business unit within the NTMA and the Bill defines that function in legislation.</p><p>  Third, the legislation will restructure the corporate governance of the NTMA and its associated entities.  The Bill will streamline and simplify the governance structure of the agency and its associated entities which are now relatively complex as a result of the assignment to it of additional functions since it was first established in 1991 as a single function agency responsible for funding and debt management.  The reconstituted agency will be directly responsible for funding and debt management, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, NewERA, the functions of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the State Claims Agency.  There will be no change in relation to NAMA which will continue with its own board and to which the NTMA will continue to provide business services and staff.</p><p>  Fourth, the legislation will put the Legal Costs Unit within the State Claims Agency on a statutory basis.  The NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency when dealing with claims against State agencies.  The Legal Costs Unit deals with third party costs such as those arising from the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals of inquiry, with the aim of minimising the financial exposure of the State and achieving significant savings for the Exchequer.</p><p>  The Bill comprises seven Parts and four Schedules.  Part 1 deals with the preliminary and general provisions, including the Short Title.  Part 2 contains provisions relating to the governance structure of the agency.  I trust Deputies will bear with me while I set out as clearly as possible the current governance structures in the NTMA. </p><p>  The NTMA was established in 1991 under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 to borrow on behalf of the Exchequer and manage the national debt.  The agency was established outside normal public sector structures, with operational freedom to negotiate market competitive salaries.  Information on these salaries is available in the annual report.  This business model was designed to enable the NTMA to compete with the private sector and attract and retain specialists in mid-career who would not normally be attracted to working in a public sector environment.</p><p>Subsequently, a number of additional functions were assigned to the NTMA.  As with debt management, these were also commercial and market-facing functions where the agency's business model gave it the flexibility to attract and retain staff with the necessary expertise and experience. </p><p>The agency took over the management of personal injury and property damage claims against the State in 2000, and is known as the State Claims Agency when doing so.</p><p>The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001.  The agency is the manager of the fund.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was established in 2003.  Its role is to provide financial advice to State bodies undertaking major public investment projects and to procure and deliver public-private partnership projects in sectors other than transport and local authorities.  It also procures non-PPP schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  It acts through the NTMA.</p><p>The NTMA, acting through its NewERA unit, provides advice to shareholding Ministers in regard to commercial semi-state bodies.  The NTMA also provides staff and business and support services to NAMA.  Turning to the governance structures underlying these functions, the NTMA does not have a board, although it does have an advisory committee whose role is to advise on matters referred to it by the agency.  The chief executive is directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.  The chief executive reports directly to the Minister on the NTMA's funding and debt management, State Claims Agency and NewERA functions.  To that extent, the agency is more like a Department than a State agency.</p><p>The NTMA is responsible for claims management and risk management on behalf of State agencies and is known as the State Claims Agency when doing so.  A committee advises on policy and procedures in regard to that work.</p><p>The NPRF, the NDFA and NAMA - all of which were established under their own governing legislation - all have their own boards.  The NTMA acts as the executive in respect of the NPRF and the NDFA.  It assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems.  The NTMA chief executive is an <i>ex officio </i>member of the NPRF commission and the board of NAMA and is <i>ex officio </i>chairman of the NDFA.  A director of the NTMA acts as CEO of the NDFA.  The NTMA has a number of other functions, such as providing a central treasury service to State agencies and managing various funds, but these are not affected by this Bill. </p><p>That is the current position.  The agency has carried out the functions it has been assigned with skill and dedication.  The governance structure under which it operates has become unwieldy and complex, as my speech indicates.  As we put NewERA, the ISIF and the legal costs unit on a statutory footing, we are taking the opportunity to simplify and streamline the governance structures of the NTMA to ensure it is governed in a way that reflects best practice and that will assist it in working in an integrated manner towards the achievement of its objectives.</p><p>The legislation will convert the agency into a body with members, effectively a board.  It will have nine members in total, six appointed by the Minister for Finance, serving a five-year term, and, <i>ex-officio</i>, the chief executive officer of the NTMA, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for Finance will nominate one of the appointed members as chairperson.  All these people will have to have specialist skills and knowledge in the areas in which they are operating.</p><p>The reconstituted NTMA will continue to be directly responsible for the borrowing and debt management functions, as well as the State Claims Agency and various other functions such as the central treasury service, just as it is now.  In addition, it will now be directly responsible for the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and NDFA functions, rather than acting on behalf of other statutory bodies, and it will have NewERA.</p><p>No changes are proposed to the existing arrangements in respect of NAMA.  NAMA will continue to have its own separate board and the existing arrangements whereby the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA and provides business and support services, including HR, IT, market risk, finance, compliance and treasury services, will also continue.  On foot of the changes outlined, the NTMA advisory committee and the NDFA and its board will be dissolved, as will the State Claims Agency policy committee.  The NPRF commission will also be dissolved as soon as practicable.</p><p>Turning to the detail of the governance changes, section 8 of the Bill amends the NTMA Act 1990 to provide that the National Treasury Management Agency will be a body with a chairperson and other members.  The members will in effect form a board that will be responsible for oversight of the agency and will report to the Minister for Finance.  As I mentioned earlier, there will be nine members, with six appointed by the Minister, in addition to the chief executive of the agency, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister may appoint as members only persons with expertise and experience at a senior level in a number of specified areas, such as investment, treasury management, economics and accounting.  The Minister is required to ensure that there is an equitable balance between men and women, as far as practicable.  The chair of the agency is appointed by the Minister.</p><p>Section 8 inserts a new Schedule, Schedule A, into the NTMA Act 1990.  This sets out the detail in relation to the members of the agency.  Appointments will generally be for five years, but the term of office of the initial members will be staggered so that they do not all end at the same time.  This is in the interests of continuity.  A member may not serve more than two consecutive terms of office.  Terms and conditions of appointment will be set by the Minister for Finance.  The Schedule also contains ancillary provisions, covering such areas as disqualification from office and filling of vacancies.  Any remuneration of board members will be published in the annual report.  There will be total transparency.</p><p>Section 9 inserts a new section 3B in the NTMA Act 1990 to provide for the procedures of the agency, the detail of which is set out the Schedule.  This sets out rules for the quorum for meetings, electronic meetings and the seal of the agency.  The agency will be able to hold incorporeal meetings and pass resolutions by majority without a meeting.  This sort of flexibility is essential for an agency which has a central role in the financing of the Exchequer in order to allow speedy decision-making.</p><p>Section 10 inserts new sections 5A and 5B in the NTMA Act 1990 to establish an investment committee, which will be a committee of the agency and, under the authority of the agency, will be responsible for the investment of ISIF, and allow the agency to establish other committees, respectively.  The investment committee will have up to seven members, two members of the agency and up to five persons who are not members of the agency but who have substantial relevant expertise and experience and are appointed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The chair of the investment committee will be a member of the agency and will be appointed by the agency.</p><p>Section 11 amends section 6 of the NTMA Act 1990.  It sets out the role of the chief executive, reflecting the reconstitution of the agency and the change in reporting relationships.  The chief executive will be appointed by the agency with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Section 12 inserts new sections 6A and 6B in the NTMA Act 1990.  They provide for the chief executive to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for the chairperson and chief executive to appear before other Oireachtas committees, respectively.  There will be direct accountability to the Oireachtas in that context.</p><p>Section 13 effectively updates section 10 of the NTMA Act 1990 so that members of local authorities, as with members of the Oireachtas and European Parliament, may not be employed by the agency.  If an employee of the agency becomes a member of a local authority, the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, he or she will stand seconded from the agency.</p><p>Section 14 amends the provisions concerning the accounts of the agency pursuant to section 12 of the NTMA Act 1990 to take account of the new structures.  The accounts are to be signed by the chief executive and an appointed member of the agency.  The chief executive will be the officer accountable for the agency.</p><p> Section 15 inserts new sections 13A and 13B.  These sections cover the disclosure of interests by members of the agency and committees of the agency and members of staff of the agency, respectively.</p><p> Section 16 inserts a new section 13C which provides for the indemnification of members of the agency, members of a committee of the agency, members of staff of the agency and members of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, where the agency is satisfied that duties have been discharged in good faith.</p><p> Section 17 replaces section 14 of the Act, covering the disclosure of confidential information.  It updates the existing provision to take account of the new structures proposed for the NTMA and developments with regard to the disclosure of confidential information since the NTMA was established.  The existing provision is very strict: it is an offence for a person to disclose information obtained in the course of carrying out his or her duties on behalf of the agency.  The new section is more nuanced.  It will continue to be an offence to disclose, without the consent of the agency, information obtained while performing functions on its behalf.  This is essential, given that staff of the agency will have access to information which is very sensitive commercially.  However, it will not now be an offence to disclose confidential information in certain circumstances, including disclosure to the Minister for Finance or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where the information may relate to the commission of an offence.  These qualifications to the legislation mean that there is a route available for individuals who believe they should raise issues outside the confines of the agency.  Given the pivotal role of the agency in financing the State, while sensitive commercial information is protected, it is also essential that individuals should be able to bring justifiable concerns to an outside authority without risking committing an offence.</p><p> Part 3 deals with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, which is already up and running as part of the NTMA, providing financial and commercial advice on certain commercial semi-State bodies for shareholding Ministers.  This part of the Bill puts NewERA on a statutory basis.  The idea behind NewERA is that it will help to oversee the financial performance, corporate strategy and capital and investment plans of commercial semi-State bodies.  It will provide a dedicated source of corporate finance expertise for Ministers taking a commercial approach to the oversight of semi-State companies, with an emphasis on return on capital.  It will also work with stakeholders to develop structures and proposals for investment in energy, broadband and water projects to support economic activity and employment.  Its role will also involve, where requested, advising on the disposal or restructuring of State assets.</p><p> The NTMA will be responsible for the performance of the shareholder advisory functions and known as NewERA when performing these functions.  Section 18 sets out the designated commercial semi-State bodies on which the agency will provide advice.  These are the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Bord na Mona, Coillte Teoranta and EirGrid.  The Minister for Finance, after consulting the NTMA, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant shareholding Ministers, may add other State bodies to the list by order.  This enabling provision will allow other shareholding Ministers to benefit from NewERA's commercial expertise.</p><p> Section 19 defines what NewERA does.  It provides financial and commercial advisory services on request for Ministers in respect of the commercial semi-State bodies within its remit.  This covers advice on a wide range of issues: a Minister's statutory role, exercising rights as a shareholder, the governance of a semi-State body, expected rates of return, dividend policy, corporate and investment strategy, acquisitions and disposals, as well as appointments and the remuneration of directors and the chief executive.  NewERA will also be able to provide project management services and for oversight of acquisitions and disposals and restructurings, at the request of the Minister.</p><p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have power to give directions to NewERA on the performance of its functions.  He or she must first consult the Minister for Finance and any relevant shareholding Minister.  This mirrors the ministerial power of direction over other NTMA functions.  Any such direction must be published.</p><p> An important aspect of the role of NewERA is that it is required, under subsection (4), to have regard to the effective and efficient application of capital by commercial semi-State bodies taken as a whole.  The point is that commercial semi-State bodies should not be looked at in isolation, one from another.  Rather, a portfolio approach should be considered with a view to optimising the deployment of capital.</p><p> Section 20 provides that the agency may provide financial and commercial advisory services, as well as project management and advisory services, in regard to other bodies and assets if requested by the Minister with responsibility for the body or asset.  </p><p> Section 21 requires NewERA to submit a report on the financial performance of each of the commercial semi-State bodies within its remit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant Ministers each year.</p><p> Section 22 provides that the agency, in consultation with relevant Ministers, may develop proposals for investment to support economic activity and employment in energy, water, telecommunications and forestry projects.  The Minister for Finance, having consulted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant Ministers, may specify other sectors by order.  A successful example of work in this area was NewERA's work with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the recently announced launch of the &euro;70 million national energy efficiency fund backed by London and Regional Properties and Glen Dimplex.</p><p> Section 23 requires Ministers to provide NewERA with the information it requires to carry out its functions.  Ministers must have regard to the advice provided, but this does not constrain them in any way.</p><p> Section 24 provides that NewERA is to establish procedures for seeking and providing advice, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant Ministers.  The protocols agreed will streamline interactions between the agency and Departments and ensure NewERA will achieve its full potential.</p><p> Part 4 gives the agency responsibility for the role currently carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, in regard to infrastructural projects.  The NDFA was established on 1 January 2003 under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 to provide financial advice for State authorities on capital projects over a certain size - at present &euro;20 million.  It also procures and delivers PPPs other than in the transport and local authority sectors.  As I said, it is currently a stand-alone corporate body which discharges its functions through the NTMA.  It is proposed that the NDFA and its board be dissolved and its functions be assigned directly to the agency.</p><p> The two National Development Finance Agency Acts of 2002 and 2007 are repealed by section 6 and this Part, in effect, restates the provisions of these two Acts in so far as they relate to the NDFA's functions, with one exception.  The 2002 Act provides that the NDFA can borrow and advance moneys in respect of infrastructural projects, but this power is being removed because the revised rules on Government accounting treatment, as issued by EUROSTAT in February 2004, deemed such transactions to be &quot;on&quot; the State's balance sheet and, consequently, this provision was never used.</p><p> Section 25 defines terms used in this Part.  Section 26 gathers together the functions of the NDFA under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, the National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Act 2007 and the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.  These are as follows: providing advice on the optimal financing of public investment projects for State authorities which are defined in Schedule 3 to the Bill and which broadly mean Departments and non-commercial semi-State bodies; providing a specialised procurement delivery function in respect of PPPs, with the exception of road and rail projects, for which the NRA has responsibility; and providing a procurement service in respect of non-PPP schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p> Section 27 provides that the agency shall have regard to policy directions and guidance issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to State authorities on the financing of public investment projects and PPPs.  Section 28 provides that a State authority shall seek the advice of the agency before undertaking a public investment project, subject to guidelines that may be issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 29 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may specify State authorities, in other words, bodies which the NDFA can advise.  </p><p> Under section 30, the NDFA recoups its costs from the State bodies for which it provides its services.</p><p>Part 5 establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency function to look after costs awarded by tribunals of inquiry.  Part 5 sets out the detail of how the agency is to operate when managing claims for costs.  The Government will delegate to the agency claims in respect of specific tribunals.  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 and subsequent delegation orders delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the management of personal injuries claims, including bullying and harassment and third-party property damage claims, and their associated risks, against specified State authorities.  The agency is known as the State Claims Agency, SCA, when performing these functions.  </p><p> The SCA has already started to advise on costs awarded by the Mahon tribunal on planning matters and the Moriarty tribunal on payments to politicians.  Setting up the legal costs unit within the SCA is being done to minimise the State's exposure and deliver significant savings to the Exchequer as it is recognised that third-party costs represent the major portion of the costs of tribunals.  These costs are awarded by the tribunals and their amounts are drawn up in retrospect.  The legal costs unit will provide specialist advice in this area and will assess and-or challenge third-party costs claims in order to ensure the costs to the Exchequer are reasonable.</p><p> Sections 31 and 32 define terms used in this part.  Section 33 provides that the agency will manage delegated claims for costs to ensure that costs and expenses are contained at the lowest level achievable.  Section 34 empowers the Government to delegate the management of claims for costs to the agency.  Section 35 specifies that when managing claims for costs, the agency will do so on behalf of the Attorney General.  Section 36 sets out the arrangement which will apply in respect of the payment of legal costs and professional fees.  The agency will make such payments out of advances from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and will subsequently recoup the amounts from the relevant State authority.</p><p> I will now move on to Part 6.  In September 2011, the Government announced its intention to establish the Strategic Investment Fund, which formed part of the programme for Government published in March 2011.  The intention is that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will channel its resources towards productive investment in the Irish economy and leverage its resources with private sector co-investment and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.  Part 6 of this Bill establishes the ISIF.  The ISIF will replace the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, with a mandate to invest on a commercial basis in Ireland so as to support economic activity and employment.  The NPRF was established in 2001 as an investment fund to build additional resources to support the Exchequer from 2025 onwards when it was projected that the burden of social welfare and public service pensions would have increased significantly.  The NPRF is controlled by the NPRF commission.  The NTMA is the manager of the fund and is essentially responsible for investing the NPRF as approved by the commission.  In 2009, amending legislation was introduced to allow the Minister for Finance to direct the NPRF commission to recapitalise the banks in order to support the banking system.  These are called the directed investments.  The value of the NPRF holdings in Irish banks together with related cash balances was &euro;13.3 billion at the end of March.  The value of the fund's other investments was &euro;6.9 billion at the end of March.  This is what we call the discretionary portfolio which is managed and invested by the NPRF commission.</p><p> While the State must continue to be aware of the future budgetary implications of social welfare and pension obligations, fostering economic activity and employment in Ireland is a greater priority in the current circumstances and the resources of the NPRF should be redeployed accordingly.  As the Minister for Finance has stated, the best way to ensure that the State is in a position to meet its future obligations is to ensure the economy is growing.  The ISIF is to be invested on a commercial basis.  This will put the fund in a position to leverage its resources by attracting private sector co-investment, recycle its resources in order to make more strategic investments over time and ensure the public assets entrusted to the fund are not frittered away.  The primary point of the exercise is to enhance economic activity and increase employment in Ireland which in turn will support the Exchequer.</p><p> The agency will be responsible for setting the overall investment strategy for the ISIF.  When determining and reviewing the strategy, the agency must consult the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, who may consult other Ministers, and must have regard to their views.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, on a number of occasions, I have raised the issue of the lengthy delay in getting this legislation brought forward with him and the Minister for Finance.  It was back in September 2011 when the Government first announced the establishment of a strategic investment fund so this Bill is very much overdue but I welcome its publication and the fact that we are finally getting to discuss it.</p><p>  The NTMA has undergone a remarkable process of development since its original establishment in 1990 when Albert Reynolds followed through on a budget commitment to establish, under statute, an independent office for the management of the national debt.  The impetus for its establishment was the fact that debt management had become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity, requiring flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to exploit fully the potential for savings.  Albert Reynolds also pointed out that with the growth of the financial services sector in Dublin, the Department of Finance had been losing staff that were qualified and experienced in the financial area and it had not been possible to recruit suitable staff from elsewhere.  The then main Opposition spokesperson on finance, who I believe was a certain Deputy Noonan, said that the action by the Minister in setting up the NTMA was a fire brigade action arising from the fact that he could neither maintain in nor recruit to the Civil Service persons with the desirable level of expertise to manage the national debt.  That was 1990 though and since then, the NTMA has developed from a single function agency managing the national debt to a manager of a complex portfolio of public assets and liabilities.</p><p>  This Bill looks to rationalise and simplify the governance structures at the NTMA to enable a more integrated approach to the performance of its functions which have expanded significantly over the past 24 years.  The agency will be reconstructed as a body with a chairperson and other members who will have overarching responsibility for the agency's existing debt management and State Claims Agency functions, its function in respect of infrastructure projects currently carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the ISIF and NewERA.</p><p>  There will be no change in the relationship to NAMA.   Under this legislation, the NPRF will become the ISIF and in that regard, it will have a statutory mandate to make commercial investments domestically that sustain jobs and growth.  We very much welcome this.  It also has a role in the NewERA project and will be known as such in this regard and may also bring forward suggestions for investment in particular sectors of the economy.  The Bill also establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency function to deal with third-party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry.  Three years ago, we suggested leveraging private pensions and the NPRF as a means of supporting infrastructure investment.  I know other Opposition groups have made similar proposals.  The Government is now belatedly coming round to this idea.  However, given its failure to deliver on existing promises, there must be considerable doubt over whether forthcoming announcements will actually produce the tangible benefit they have the potential to deliver.</p><p>  When the Government announced in September 2011 that it would establish a strategic investment fund, we understood that the legislation would be brought forward quickly, which simply has not happened.  While the merit of maximising non-Exchequer capital investment is universally recognised, the Government's plans lack ambition and are likely to be of limited impact as currently devised.  In our pre-budget submissions in recent years, we have proposed a mandatory total investment of 1% per annum for the next three years from private pension funds and a matching investment by the NPRF from its discretionary portfolio.  This gives a potential &euro;4.2 billion for investment on a commercial basis in infrastructure opportunities, would be separate from the public capital programme and could complement the investments that will flow from the ISIF.</p><p> The size of the fund could be further enhanced by making investment in it available to regular savers in a manner similar to the national solidarity bond as well as additional market funding where available.  Earlier this year, following a successful bond sale in which the NTMA raised funds under 3%, we called for consideration to be given for action by the NTMA to significantly reduce the current interest burden of the national debt.</p><p> Currently, for example, the average interest rate on our national debt is 4%.  This is made up of both market and official funding under the EU-IMF programme.  We pointed out that there are two options that the NTMA could consider.  First, there is the option of an open market buy-back of some of the more expensive debt funded from either the cash reserve we currently hold or by issuing new debt at the current lower rates.  Second, while the interest rate on our EFSF-EFSM funding was reduced and the term extended we are continuing to pay 4.1% on our loans from the IMF.  Refinancing these loans at even 1% lower than the current rate would save us &euro;225 million on an annual basis.  We need to secure the agreement of the European Commission and the ECB for this to happen.  Given the European authorities have stated that they wish to enhance the sustainability of the Irish economic recovery, agreeing to allow us pay off our more expensive loans would be a practical demonstration of this commitment and we call on the Government to pursue that option.  It is essential that the Minister for Finance works with the NTMA to bring this about.</p><p>We also believe that savings that are achieved should be deployed to support investment in infrastructure and job creation.  The importance of the Government and the NTMA maximising savings is also underlined by comments of former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, John Bruton, who has spoken of the possibility of another ten years of budget adjustment.  He cited the EU fiscal compact treaty, which commits us to reducing the debt-GDP ratio from 120% to 60% and highlighted the fact that the Department of Finance's figures showed that budget surpluses will have to be run to get the debt down.  The Minister might indicate his assessment of Mr. Bruton's contribution to this debate.  The NTMA in its May investor presentation is forecasting that the budget will be in balance by 2018.  That is the year revenue and spending will finally meet, yet, if Mr Bruton is to be believed, there will be another six years of consolidation after that.  We need to know the Department's assessment of his contribution.</p><p> Clearly we have to maximise growth over the next decade and with that in mind, it is vital that in making investments the focus must be on boosting Irish business and jobs rather than just generating profits for asset management companies in the private sector.  We heard earlier this year of a fund to make &euro;6.8 billion of commercial investments to boost Irish business and that 13 investments have been made by the entities into which the NPRF has put hundreds of millions of euro as part of its drive to stimulate the economy.  The NPRF made cornerstone investments totalling &euro;375 million in three entities with which it has partnered, respectively, and the funds have different objectives, with one focused on healthy businesses seeking to grow, another focused on underperforming businesses and a third on originating and acquiring loans to larger SMEs.  The theory is that these funds will benefit the SME sector but sometimes it seems the fund manager will see the real benefit.</p><p> The State has a proud record of making investments which serve otherwise unmet economic and social need over a prolonged period.  Companies such as the ESB, Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and Aer Lingus were pioneers in their time meeting critical needs in the country and at the same time providing employment and a significant return to the State by way dividends over the years.  The aim for the ISIF should be similarly ambitious in terms of the needs of the 21st century.  The ICT sector is one that offers particular opportunities for both an investment return and also significant employment benefit.</p><p> There is a huge need for capital investment in the economy.  The investment component of GDP is the one that fell most dramatically by up to 60%.  The private sector has not as yet, nor is likely to, be able to restore levels of investment to pre-recession levels.  There is, therefore, an obvious need for the State to step in.  The much vaunted 1,000 jobs a week growth in employment is beginning to tail off, according to the recent CSO figures; it is now not much more than 1,000 jobs a quarter.  Every job that is gained is to be welcomed.  The Minister may regret stalling on bringing forward this measure, as it is not likely to result in a practical benefit for more than 12 months, other than the raft of announcements similar to that which we had in the run-up the recent local and European elections.</p><p> Everyone agrees that the original intent with respect to the NPRF was a good idea - setting aside 1% of GNP annually to provide for public sector pensions from 2025.  In the run-up to the last budget, we warned that the Government was ignoring major long-term issues such as future pension provision.  While the Bill is welcome as an economic stimulus measure, a comprehensive plan is still needed to ensure the huge and growing future pension liability is met.  The performance of the ISIF should be benchmarked against similar investment funds on an annual basis in order that we can make an assessment of how it is progressing.</p><p> The legislation establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency to deal with third party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry.  In its role as the State Claims Agency, the NTMA also manages personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims brought against certain State authorities, including Ministers and health enterprises.  It also has a risk management role, advising and assisting State authorities in minimising their claim exposures.  Total legal costs for the agency increased by &euro;3.6 million between 2012 and 2013.  It had legal costs totalling in excess of &euro;39 million in 2012 and almost &euro;43 million in 2013.  Those figures are inclusive of &euro;21.9 million in fees to solicitors in 2012 to defend claims managed by the agency, which increased to &euro;24.3 million last year.  Public liability cases currently take an average of three years to complete, an increase from 2.4 years since 2011, while employer liability cases take 3.7 years, down from 4.1 years in 2011.  Third party property damage cases take 350 days, up from 335 days in 2011, while clinical claims take an average of four years, up from 2.9 years.  Clearly, the lengthy time period which it takes to deal with claims is contributing to the high legal costs that are being incurred.</p><p> While the Bill has no impact on NAMA, it is worth noting its annual report published this week.  When we voted to set the agency up five years ago, there was enormous scepticism about its operation, yet it is clear now that it will fulfil its mission, hopefully ahead of target.  The agency expressed increasing confidence that it will complete its work earlier than 2020, as originally envisaged.  Subject to the outcome of portfolio and asset sales currently under way, it aims to have as much as half of its senior debt repaid by the end of the current year, two years ahead of schedule.  As the chairman of the agency pointed out, this is an important achievement for taxpayers.  NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion for the loans it acquired and &euro;30.2 billion of this comprised senior bonds guaranteed by the State, which is a contingent liability on taxpayers.  When the agency was set up, many expressed outright disbelief that it would succeed and claimed it could cost the State additional billions of euro but it is likely it will not cost the taxpayer additional money and may well generate a surplus over its lifetime.  It must be acknowledged that when the agency purchased the loans from the banks, significant losses crystallised on their balance sheets and this gap was plugged by the vast recapitalisation of the banks by the State at the time.  NAMA looks set to at least break even in the context of its own liabilities and that has to be welcomed.</p><p> When the late Brian Lenihan passed away, the Minister for Finance generously acknowledged that his predecessor had done the heavy lifting on the public finances and the establishment of NAMA and its success to date will be a positive legacy of the former Minister, notwithstanding the issues the agency needs to address in the context of, for example, improving the transparency in the way in which it operates.  Along with others, I have raised many issues of concern regarding the agency's operations and will continue to do so but, overall, it is critically important for the State that the agency does well in its financial performance.</p><p> I refer to the Government's recently announced construction stimulus plan.  It seemed to be little more than an election stunt.</p><p>In any case it contained neither measurable jobs targets nor any real measures to tackle the housing shortage.  When one strips back the spin and takes a second look at the 75 actions in this document, it is plain that there are no details on how the shortage of new housing units will be addressed, there is no new investment in social housing and no apprenticeship scheme to help construction workers to qualify for new jobs in the future.  Indeed, the document bore an uncanny resemblance to the lofty promises in the NewERA document of some years ago, which pledged to provide 100,000 new jobs.  Three years later we are struggling to see any evidence that these jobs have been realised.  Just as the job promises in the NewERA document evaporated in a matter of weeks, it is legitimate to fear that the 60,000 jobs promised in this document will suffer the same fate.</p><p> The plan promises investment of &euro;50 million in social housing nationally, but Dublin City Council has been forced to halve its investment in social housing, reducing it by &euro;40 million this year, due to budget cuts imposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  If the social housing spend is down by &euro;40 million in Dublin city alone, the new investment of &euro;50 million in this document goes nowhere near what local authorities have already been forced to cut from their social housing budgets.</p><p> We support this Bill.  We believe in intervention by the State where there is an investment vacuum.  However, we must be both ambitious and careful in how we act.  That is a balance which is often difficult to achieve.  I reiterate my concerns about pension funding into the future.  Allied to this are projections for a massive jump in the number of Irish people over the age of 85 years and all that entails for care budgets.  While this Bill is welcome as an economic stimulus measure, we still require a comprehensive plan to ensure that the huge and growing future pension liability is met.</p><p> My final point relates to the directed portfolio within the NPRF, which includes our shareholdings in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Will the Minister address that point further in his reply to the debate?  Is it still the intention of the NPRF to sell those shareholdings to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as part of any retroactive recapitalisation deal concerning the Irish banks?  It is important that the Government clarify the role it sees itself playing for State companies generally in the future.  Currently, it appears to view the commercial semi-state companies as a cash cow to plug the gap in the State's finances, not as a long-term asset to be protected and nurtured.</p></speech>

It must be the most announced legislation this Government has introduced, but we can finally get down to the detail and cut through the spin now that the legislation has been published.  The creation of a strategic investment fund was first announced in September 2011.  It was re-announced a number of times, and again in June 2013.  Now, in May 2014, more than three years after the Government came to power, it reaches us for the start of the legislative process.  On the second announcement I said it was long overdue; now it is just very late.  Billions have been squandered from the National Pensions Reserve Fund on zombie banks in the intervening period.  This is not just a political point but a real criticism.  Three years have passed without any of the type of State investment that is required in the appropriate measure.  At a time of emigration and high unemployment the State needed to step in and invest, but the Government sat on its hands and allowed the economy to shrink, our young to leave and our public services to deteriorate.  We must compare how swiftly the Government was prepared to legislate to cut civil servants&rsquo; pay and remove the protection of the family home with how long this legislation has been in preparation.  That is the story of where this Government&rsquo;s priorities lie.  Investment is an afterthought, something to consider three years later.</p><p>  My party has always argued for, and shown how, investment in a stimulus package, coupled with a fairer way of adjusting the budget, could put us on the road to recovery and help us to reduce the deficit as required.  I therefore welcome this conversion to the principle at least, although the detail shows how the conservative hand means in practice that this new vehicle will be severely limited in how it can kick-start our economy.  Stimulus has always been part of the solution and I am glad the Government is coming around to that Sinn F&eacute;in position.  It must be a well-directed and effective stimulus, but I fear that is where this Bill is not as good as it should be.  We will seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to improve it and to make is as useful as it must be if the full benefits of stimulus are to be realised.  While this Bill marks a positive step towards sensible economic planning, it still bears the hallmarks of a conservative and austerity-addicted mentality in many ways.  It also bears the fingerprints of the troika squeezing out the potential for a positive State-led economic initiative.  I doubt it met much resistance from this Government.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has shown how we would leverage the available NPRF to make a real impact in the economy.  We would have had it up and running by now, investing on the necessary scale.  This Bill is frustrating for those of us who wish to see a real stimulus package put in place.  The concept of a strict adherence to the need for a commercial return is one with which we are uncomfortable.  It is a measure of how much we remain under the thumb of EU law that the act of investing in our economy has become such a tortuous exercise.  In fact, the rules are so fixated on proving a commercial return that the potential for real and immediate impact is blunted.  Where is the guarantee of actual benefits to the real economy if each project must be vetted through committees and must find a commercial partner in times of economic hardship?</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposals that would produce an economic return on investment, but these rules appear to be crippling the possibilities.  Simply put, building hospitals, schools and other infrastructure sometimes goes beyond a commercial return.  The fund&rsquo;s limits to economic activity and employment would appear to rule out social or environmental investments which in time would undoubtedly benefit the country.  How is this fund going to help ease the crisis in social housing, for example?</p><p>  The Bill lacks a vision.  It is not an ideal vehicle for the type of stimulus Sinn F&eacute;in has envisaged and championed.  The opportunity for a State&ndash;led strategic wave of investment is severely limited by the use of committees through which each project must be filtered.  The strict requirement for a private partner, possibly up to the point of being a 50:50 partner, will reduce the effectiveness of any investment from the State&rsquo;s point of view and, as we have seen previously, will benefit the companies rather than the State or society or those in need of work.</p><p>  Last week, the Government announced it was establishing a strategic banking corporation - that is, a company.  Those words are carefully chosen.  It is a strategic banking corporation, not a bank.  In a reply to me last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, admitted that the strategic banking corporation will not have a banking licence.</p><p>A bank without a banking licence is not a bank.  As such, when will the programme for Government commitment to establish a strategic investment bank be met?  One cannot simply set up a company and include the word "bank" in its name and call it a bank.  A bank has a banking licence.  That is the rule and as basic as it gets.  This vehicle will not have a banking licence.  Last week's plan amounted to a German bank paying into a fund from which money will be given to the banks in the hope that they will lend to the real economy.  However, there is no safeguard to prevent the banks simply soaking up this money as they have been doing or to prevent it being drawn down.</p><p> I have noted already the complex and perhaps too rigid tests that must be passed before any investment can be made in the real economy.  There is, however, a part of the Bill which allows the Minister for Finance to write a blank cheque.  Section 42 permits the Minister to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund to bail out banks once again.  If one wants to invest in the real economy, in broadband, housing, water or in the infrastructure our communities are crying out for, one must go through all of the rigorous tests and have a private investor in place.  One must pass all the different committees and undergo the various scrutiny processes and there must be a return.  However, if the banks come knocking on the Minister's door and, after consulting with the Central Bank, he or she deems the billions that have been raised by the Irish people should be squandered into this bank, he or she can direct the fund manager to do that.  Section 42 is an appalling section and requires greater scrutiny and a proper explanation from the Minister as to what the Government is doing here.</p><p> I note that when one looks at the accountability of the chief executive officer, one sees that he or she is required to come before the Oireachtas committee and answer questions on any issues members raise.  However, he or she is not allowed to make any comment on any policy or order from the Government or the Minister.  If the Minister had to turn around and say &quot;Listen folks, AIB or Bank of Ireland is in trouble and we need &euro;4 billion of the &euro;6 billion you were planning to invest in the real economy for the bank&quot;, the CEO cannot comment but must oblige the Minister's order.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to putting NewERA on a statutory footing.  We are opposed to what NewERA stands for.  It is a vehicle for the privatisation of profitable State assets, including Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB or Coillte.  Putting NewERA on the footing proposed in the Bill is further proof that the troika mindset is still very much being in place in Government Buildings, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</p><p> While we will deal in greater detail with many sections on Committee Stage, I wish to comment on the part of the Bill dealing with the State Claims Agency and the centralisation of claims made against the State.  Claims have been made in the past and claims will emerge in future.  They may result from institutional abuse, as happened in the case of the Magdalen laundries, or from tribunals of inquiry as we saw with the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals.  Some of the costs associated with those tribunals have not yet been dealt with as court challenges continue in relation to the level of costs awarded.  It is a matter to which I will return on foot of information I have received recently on the Moriarty tribunal in particular.  An early section of the Bill provides that any order under the legislation must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and there are then 21 days in which an order may be quashed by a vote in the House.  The section in the Bill dealing with the State Claims Agency allows the Minister for Finance, following consultation with the Taoiseach and Attorney General, to direct - not order - the State Claims Agency to cease paying claims in any directed area.  That is a matter of concern given our past.  For example, it emerged in October last year that &euro;635,912 had accumulated in third-party costs for the Fine Gael Party in relation to the Moriarty tribunal.  In the first quarter of this year, nearly &euro;110,000 was paid for legal costs for the Haughey family.</p><p> I raise this issue because the Bill provides the Minister of the day with the discretion to direct the State Claims Agency, with which direction it must comply, to cease paying any type of claim.  If the agency was to handle a tribunal in future, the Minister could direct it to stop paying any new claims.  That is deeply concerning given the involvement of the political parties, particularly Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, in benefitting from these costs in the past.  One would not want a situation in which, if Fianna F&aacute;il were, God forbid, in government again, it could say that payments should stop.  The matter would not come to the floor of the House.  We must examine this.  It should be an order at the very least, not a direction, as that would mean it would be voted on in the House.</p><p> I have outlined the many concerns Sinn F&eacute;in has identified with this Bill.  We recognise that it has the potential to act as an important element in an economic recovery.  While it differs greatly from the stimulus vehicle we would have designed, it must be progressed.  Enough time has been wasted by the Government.  Let us get on with stimulus.  The Bill at least marks a starting point in theory.  The danger is that it will not amount to anything more.  It may end up being a vehicle through which no lending occurs due to its strict nature.  We will deal with this on Committee Stage but I want to see where the Government is looking at this.  Will targets be set?  We have had targets that were placed on AIB and Bank of Ireland in respect of lending into the real economy but those targets no longer exist.  The banks did not meet them.  It does not seem that even targets have been envisaged by the Government in terms of the investment of more than &euro;6 billion, which will be at the disposal of the new agency, to help to kick-start the economy.</p></speech>

Mar ad&uacute;irt an Teachta, t&aacute;imid go l&eacute;ir ag fanacht len&aacute;r gcro&iacute; in&aacute;r mb&eacute;al le fada le rud &eacute;igin a chloisint maidir leis an infheist&iacute;ocht seo.</p><p>  The impending arrival of the Bill has been announced by Ministers with such regularity over the last three years that we had all been expecting big things on this side of the House.  Our disappointment when faced with the legislation before us can, therefore, readily be imagined.  The economy is entering the second half of a lost decade.  As he tried to explain the crushing defeat of the Labour Party in the local and European elections, Deputy Pat Rabbitte stated two days ago in the Chamber that the State is in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Famine.  One would imagine that the worst economic crisis since the Famine would necessitate the largest and most robust response by the Government to deal with it.  We have 400,000 men and women languishing on the live register while 90,000 families are on the housing waiting list.  Close to half a million of our people have been forced to emigrate since the start of the crisis.  These issues alone should have motivated the Cabinet to respond proportionately.</p><p>What we are getting is a lukewarm response.  Three years of the Government's term have passed and hardly 22 months are left.  By acting so late in the economic cycle, the Government has deepened the trough and lengthened the duration of the recession.  During the elections we listened to it promise a stimulus and during the fiscal treaty campaign the lampposts were festooned with promises of jobs.  Throughout Europe we heard that a new approach would be taken and that we would see a stimulus.  Sinn F&eacute;in has urged the Government at every point to tailor the response to match the size of the economic problem.  We hassled and harried it to act with speed, but it has not happened, which is shocking.  We did so for good economic reasons, including because investment in critical infrastructure increases productivity and investment opportunities.  Targeted investment would have increased efficiency and created a competitive advantage.  It would have made it easier for local businesses to survive the crash and thrive and made the country far more attractive to foreign direct investment.  Centrally, it would have reduced significantly the level of unemployment in the State.  It would have delivered a social dividend to the hundreds of thousands of families sinking into poverty.  That this has not happened, three years into the Government's term, is a damning indictment.  That we have had an insipid and inflexible response and investment mechanism is an opportunity lost for the people.  </p><p> In response to the strategic investment fund Social Justice Ireland has expressed its regret that the Government did not take a broader perspective to assist investment in public services to facilitates socio-economic benefits that would far outweigh their cost over their lifetime.  By deciding to limit the purpose of the fund to commercial investment, the Government is, in effect, excluding investment that would be of significant and immediate benefit to the people.  We understand the vast majority of the fund&rsquo;s investments are to be long-term, with the minority to be used to encourage employment creation.  From the outset, the Government has hamstrung the ability of this &euro;6.8 billion investment fund to provide the stimulus necessary to cause a significant number of people to go back to work in the short to medium term.</p><p> The CSO publication, Quarterly National Household Survey, communicated an extremely worrying picture showing that sentiment among businesses was not very strong.  Jobs growth is grinding to a halt and we saw a meagre increase in the past quarter - 1,700 jobs in total.  This shows that expectation and confidence are flatlining.  That the Government has not understood the reason behind it is shocking.  It is seeking to rifle the pockets of families throughout the country through water charges.  The retail industry is a good weather vane for expectations in the economy and in the past quarter the industry lost 5,600 jobs.  Representative groups of SMEs have made negative comments on the Government's plans, stating they are frustrated with the Government.</p><p> The Small Firms Association warned that &euro;500 million was a tiny fraction of the current &euro;27 billion business banking market.  ISME expressed concern that the bailed out banks would revert to form and divert loans to safer, larger businesses.  Chambers Ireland has expressed a worry that the timescale is vague and disappointing.  Real and ambitious stimuli are desperately needed and we have the Government tinkering around the edges.  It has previous for such tinkering when real change is needed.  We now have an ecosystem for funding small businesses that is going nowhere.  Micro-finance, loan funds, the credit guarantee scheme and the seed capital scheme are not meeting the objectives set.  They are not having the effect that we desire on the real economy.  That the Government has used these measures to tinker around the edges rather than going to the centre of the problem - a banking industry unwilling to function in the real economy - is an example of the mistakes it has made, yet this investment fund is a similar measure.</p><p> While the Government has announced it is intent on setting up a State bank, no one in his or her right mind has confidence that it will deliver it, especially as it has changed into being a lame duck Government in recent days.  Even if it gets its act together, the bank will be underfunded and lending will still be in the gift of banks that are desperately trying to deleverage.  Currently, Irish businesses are being hammered by a number of cost disadvantages, one of which is the cost of credit.  Under the Government's proposals, there appears to be no guarantee that the lower cost of funding or sourcing funds will be passed on to SMEs.  As the Minister noted, a fraction of the strategic investment fund is to be directed towards SMEs, with just &euro;375 million to be allocated to three new long-term funds providing equity, credit and restructuring investment for Irish small and medium-sized businesses.  Successive budget cuts to capital expenditure have put tens of thousands of people on social welfare payments and have stalled investment, making the capital supply in the country desperately in need of new investment.  To date, the Government&rsquo;s policy has been anti-stimulus.  The economist Mr. Paul Krugman recently described fiscal austerity as &quot;a negative stimulus&quot;.  He correctly observed that if European leaders, including the Government, had been right about the way the world worked, the austerity agenda imposed would not have had such a devastating effect.</p><p> In my three years as a Deputy I have learned that change is creepingly slow, but it does come.  Sinn F&eacute;in has pushed the Goverment in small steps.  It is welcome that it no longer sets its face against the concept of a State-supported stimulus.  Despite accepting the need for a State-sponsored stimulus, it has turned its attention away from labour intensive and regionally spread projects and those that would increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the longer term.  We need an ambitious social housing programme.  Increasing the social housing stock in Dublin is important to cool down the market, improve competitiveness and reduce rents.  We need to increase the level of employment and increase tax revenue.  If the grand plan had come to fruition, cuts to Government expenditure and the refusal to invest in a stimulus package would have been offset by rising private spending, but the opposite has happened.</p><p> Austerity has delivered stagnant employment figures, in real terms, and a fall in investment by the private sector.  The banks are still in difficulty, a fact borne out by the provision in the legislation to allow the fund to invest in banks should they need to be propped up again.  Not only has the Government failed to secure a deal in Europe on Ireland&rsquo;s legacy banking debt, it is also preparing to pump public moneys into bad banks.  Ireland is a small open economy and it appears the Government is looking to emulate the United States.  While the US Administration embarked on a state-sponsored stimulus programme, it was not enough.  In the short term an ambitious stimulus programme acts as a defibrillator for a stalled economy, while in the medium term it improves competitiveness and creates an environment in which recovery can be maximised.  What we have is a half-hearted, half-baked Government stimulus that is limited to a purely commercial programme.  It will not create jobs within the necessary timescale and not get the economy out of the doldrums.</p></speech>

Politics is a tough business.  It has been a hard few days and we wish the T&aacute;naiste well personally.  I know he is not retiring from politics <i>per se</i>.</p><p><i></i>The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Brian Purcell, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality yesterday.  Unfortunately, he would not and did not answer any questions surrounding the events of the departure of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  In effect, both Mr. Purcell and the Taoiseach are now hiding behind the Fennelly commission.  This is treating the Oireachtas and the public with disdain.  There is no legal obstacle as to why Mr. Purcell could not have come before the committee yesterday and answered questions about Martin Callinan's departure.  Similarly, there is no legal obstacle as to why the Taoiseach could not answer questions here yesterday on his role in that departure.</p><p>Following the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, we heard much about a cultural sea change we would see in the area of justice and about new openness and transparency.  It appears that all of that now amounts to little more than a hill of beans.  We are not seeing any evidence of that type of change whatsoever.  We have a farcical situation where the new Minister for Justice and Equality is not in a position to express confidence in her Secretary General.  In what company would it be acceptable for a CEO to say she could not say whether she had confidence in the head of operations?  This is not a tenable situation and it must be addressed.</p><p>We still have no answer to the fundamental question as to why the Taoiseach dispatched Brian Purcell to the house of Martin Callinan to do his dirty work for him and, effectively, deliver a P45.  Why did that happen?  We still have no answer to that question.  We read in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>that Sergeant Maurice McCabe has been forced out of work on sick leave and has lodged 13 separate complaints pertaining to bullying and harassment.  If that is true, it does not represent much of a sea-change or cultural shift.  Following everything that has happened, if it is true that this is how he is being treated, is it not a damning indictment of the State at this time?  Why is it the Acting Commissioner, Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, said yesterday at the committee that senior managers were in contact on a daily basis with Sergeant Maurice McCabe, but we hear the complete opposite from sources very close to him?  We need answers to that question.</p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept there are no legal obstacles preventing the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Brian Purcell, or the Taoiseach from giving this House or a parliamentary committee a full explanation of the circumstances that led to the forced resignation of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan?</p></speech>

I confirm I am not retiring from politics and plan on being around for a while.</p><p>  We all know that the issues in regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have required to be addressed for a long time, long before the current Government came into office.  In the course of a relatively short period of time this year, we have put in place a number of decisions which will radically change the way in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is managed and how it reports to the public.  The critical pillar in this is the establishment of an independent Garda authority.  This is something the Labour Party has been seeking for a long time and I am glad the Government has now made the decision to proceed with it.</p><p>  The issue of how to deal with whistleblowing is another issue.  We have had significant discussion here and in public on how to deal with whistleblowing and whistleblowers.  The Government is introducing legislation that will provide protection for people who draw attention to wrong-doing and this legislation will apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I believe that any member of the Garda who wants to report wrong-doing should be able to do that without fear of any kind of recrimination.  </p><p>  We have also established a number of means by which issues that remain can be worked through, such as the Fennelly commission which will address the issue of the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner and issues surrounding that.   The Deputy's question is essentially a legal one.  I am not a lawyer so I cannot give him a legal answer.  It is important that all of the issues which are being addressed by the Fennelly commission are fully aired and that everybody who has information to give to that commission should do so.  This obviously includes the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

The truth does not change.  There is no impediment, legal or otherwise, preventing Mr. Purcell or the Taoiseach from coming before the parliamentary committee or this House and providing answers as to what exactly happened and what led to the forced departure of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  That fact has not changed and we still do not have an answer to that question.  That answer must be forthcoming.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste outlined the policy response and I agree there has been positive movement in a number of respects.  However, a number of disturbing features have emerged in recent days.  First is the fact that Sergeant Maurice McCabe clearly feels he is not being properly treated within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If media reports are to be believed, he has lodged 13 separate complaints.  Why is that happening?  Why is it the Acting Commissioner was under the impression that Garda management was in daily contact with Sergeant McCabe when the evidence points in the other direction?  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, needs to contact the Acting Commissioner to get to the bottom of that matter immediately.</p><p>  Why are Mr. Purcell and the Taoiseach not willing to provide a free and open account of the events that led to the resignation of Martin Callinan?  That is not an issue that can just be buried in the Fennelly commission.  It is an issue of fundamental public importance.  If we are to restore confidence in the justice system, there is an imperative that these answers are forthcoming now.  There is no reason we must wait for the Fennelly commission to conclude its work.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath's party, Fianna F&aacute;il, was in power at the time and it took it two years to respond to those issues and to establish the Morris tribunal, which met over a long period of time.  When that tribunal reported, Fianna F&aacute;il effectively did nothing about the report.</p><p>  Problems in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not start when this Government came into office.  Problems in the Garda did not start six months ago.  The difference now is that the Government has acted in order to address the issues.  Within the space of a number of months, we have made changes to the management, the structures around the Garda, to the way in which it reports and to the establishment of means of getting to the bottom of issues that require to be fully investigated.  We have done this in a space of time that Fianna F&aacute;il did not do when in government.  If we set up a commission and ask it to do a job, it should be allowed to do its work.  I do not have any doubt but that the Fennelly commission will do its job and that anybody who has information to give to that commission will give the full information and there will be no question in regard to information or the truth being made fully available.</p><p>  It goes beyond the question of information and what is being told to a commission.</p><p>It is also about what we do about it.  We have had repeated investigations of one kind or another.  Tribunals have been set up here and tribunals have been set up there.  They go on for years and by the time they are finished nobody can remember why they were set up in the first place.</p></speech>

It is a very laudable plan that every Member of this House wants to see succeed.  We will work with the Government in trying to achieve that goal.  In recent months many councils in the State have faced an increase in the number of people presenting as homeless.  Part of the reason for this is down to Government policy on rent supplement.  As rents increase, particularly in urban areas, the cap on rent allowance means that many families can no longer afford the home they are renting privately.  Therefore, they are being forced out on to the streets and presenting to local authorities as homeless.</p><p>  The capital funding being provided to local authorities over the past three years has decreased under the stewardship of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  There was a 23% decrease in 2012, a similar decrease in funding for capital projects in 2013 and a 5% decrease in funding this year.  These are all contributing to the problem of many people now facing homelessness.  Under this Government and under the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the housing crisis has got worse.</p><p>  One of the solutions to that is for the Minister, Deputy Burton, to instruct local community welfare officers that a family at risk of being made homeless should be given permission to breach the rent supplement caps.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, as leader of the Labour Party and as a member of the Government, to ensure that directive is given to local community welfare officers.  Where a family in danger of being put on the streets because they can no longer afford their private rented accommodation, welfare officers should be allowed to breach the rent supplement caps.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the strategy that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced to end homelessness by 2016.  That is an objective that should be pursued by Government, by agencies working with homeless people and by local authorities.  It is clear, particularly following last Friday's elections, that this responsibility is now shared more widely politically, particularly regarding the governance of various local authorities.  I hope that over the coming weeks political parties, which have been successful and in many cases have become the largest party in local authorities and will be part of governing arrangements in local authorities, will ensure that the agreements they make with other parties for the running of local authorities for the next five years will commit to ensure that sites are made available and plans are drawn up for the provision of social housing to ensure that people's housing needs are met.</p></speech>

I can go through the detail of that if the Deputy wishes.</p><p>  The Deputy specifically raised an issue with the rent supplement.  As he knows, rents are increasing, partly owing to the supply situation.  The answer to that is not simply to raise the rent supplement every time there is an adjustment in rent because doing that leads to a never-ending problem with rents continuing to increase.  We know from previous experience that as the rent supplement increases the rents increase to meet it.</p><p>  The Minister for Social Protection has already provided arrangements for flexibility in the application of rent supplement, particularly where people are at risk of losing their home.  It is my understanding that arrangements are already being put in place to allow for flexibility to be exercised by community welfare officers in the application of rent supplement.</p></speech>

Unfortunately increasing numbers of people in the depths of despair are presenting to my constituency office because they are being forced out of their private rented accommodation.  I agree that raising rent supplement caps does not represent a long-term solution.  The long-term solution is for the State to provide local authority housing to those who are unable to purchase their own homes.  That cannot be done if the Government continues to cut capital budgets to local authorities.  It cannot be done if the Government refuses to give local authorities the necessary funding to refurbish the thousands of homes that lie idle and which should generate income for local authorities.</p></speech>

Raising the rent supplement limits is a temporary solution, but it is crucial for the type of people who present at my constituency office and have a demand from a landlord to vacate a property because he is increasing the rent which he knows he could get from another tenant.  The reality is that we have a housing crisis and &euro;100 million or &euro;50 million from the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan will not solve it.  It will be solved by proper funding to local authorities to provide the necessary accommodation for people who need it.</p></speech>

We need to address the problem of people at risk of losing their home because of increased rents that the rent supplement will not meet.  I know that the Minister for Social Protection is addressing that and I will ask her to ensure that the information trickles down.</p><p>  On the capital provision, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has already announced additional money to ensure that approximately 1,700 boarded-up houses that could be renewed are refurbished and put back into use as quickly as possible.  Additional money has been provided for the resumption of a social housing construction programme.</p></speech>

Part of its significance was due to the reaction of the ladies from the Magdalen laundries, who were present in the Gallery that day, to the apologies offered by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and others.  During his apology, the Taoiseach stated, "I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the Government and our citizens, deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them".  He also stated that the women deserved more than a formal apology and that he intended to put in place a process "by which we can determine how best to help and support the women in their remaining years".  Those sentiments were echoed by other Members.  There was a general feeling on that occasion that a process was going to be put in place and that all of the outstanding issues would be resolved.  One would imagine that, one year and three months later, all of this would have been done, particularly for those ladies of very advanced years.  It is most unfortunate that the reality is different.  I wish to highlight some of that reality and then pose a number of questions.</p><p>  As a result of the fact that inadequate records were kept in some places, an enormous burden of proof has been placed on some of the ladies involved.  One would imagine that a much more flexible approach could be adopted at this point and that the ladies to whom I refer could be given the benefit of the doubt.  However, the opposite is the case because it has been left to them to prove that they were in the laundries.  The effect is that some ladies are being excluded from redress, while others are being offered less than that to which they might be entitled.  There are those who feel so defeated by this extra burden they are being obliged to shoulder that it is like being back in the laundries for them.</p><p>  An issue arises in respect of the institution known as An Grianan, which was on the site of a Magdalen laundry at High Park.  There is no doubt that the women and girls at An Grianan did the same work as those in the laundry.  They were referred to it by the justice system - on remand and on probation - and the health boards for protection.  Some of them were as young as 11 years of age.  A number of the women to whom I refer are not being compensated.  I hate using that word because nobody can compensate them for what they endured.</p></speech>

Will they ensure that payments will be expedited and that the situation in respect of An Grianan will be examined?

If she wishes to provide details of particular cases to me, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality, we would be very happy to follow up on them.</p><p>  One of the issues which arose as a result of this entire episode is the retention of records.  The Government agreed that the Minister for Education and Skills would bring forward legislative proposals to allow for the retention of records by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and all of the issues relating to the Magdalen laundries, etc.  We are concerned about the fact that the destruction of any of those records would represent a significant loss.  The Minister for Education and Skills has been working on this matter, which the Cabinet discussed earlier in the week.  Legislation is being prepared to ensure that the relevant records will be protected.</p><p>  I completely accept that it would be desirable to ensure that the commitments made in respect of payments and the provision of health care and supports to survivors of Magdalen laundries are followed up on.  I acknowledge the Deputy's assertion to the effect that questions have arisen with regard to particular periods and what is and is not contemplated for consideration.  We would certainly be happy to investigate any matters in respect of which the Deputy can provide details.</p></speech>

The Human Rights Commission and the UN Committee Against Torture, UNCAT, repeatedly requested a statutory and thorough investigation into what happened in the laundries.  Preserving the records will ensure that this can happen at some future date.  In recent days UNCAT has indicated that the State should "take additional steps to ensure that victims obtain redress as needed, including in the case of the Magdalene Laundries".</p><p>  I take this opportunity to mention the case of Rita.  The latter is not her real name.  There is absolutely no doubt about the date on which Rita entered the laundry; neither is there any doubt about the date when she was not there.  There is a discrepancy in that there is no official proof of where she was for a very short period but there are people who are prepared to swear affidavits in order to prove that she was exactly where she says she was.  Rita approached the Department of Justice and Equality following the Taoiseach's apology in February 2013 and registered with the implementation team at the end of June of that year.  This lady is in her 80s and for the past six weeks I have been trying to obtain an answer for her from the Department.  I have continually been informed that it is awaiting a directive.  This has been going on for far too long.  As Rita has informed me, it is not the money but rather the principle of the thing.  The T&aacute;naiste is seeking details but the Department of Justice and Equality knows the real identity of the person to whom I refer.  I hope her case will be resolved by next week at the very latest.</p></speech>

On Monday, the report of the independent inspector in respect of the decision by Westmeath County Council to incorporate setback distances for wind turbines into the council draft development plan was launched.  Unfortunately, the council supported the contention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that the setback distances were not going to be adhered to.  This is of considerable concern to residents throughout the midlands.  The Wind Turbine Regulation Bill is currently on Committee Stage.  When will it be brought forward by the Minister to be discussed on Committee Stage?</p><p>  What is the position on the Protected Disclosures Bill relating to whistleblowers?

I am struck by the fact that a significant subset of those who are currently homeless in the State are women and children who have fled the family home due to domestic violence.  The Government has indicated a commitment to deal with this problem.  Given the commitments made in recent times about homelessness, does the T&aacute;naiste envisage that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will have to come forward with a Supplementary Estimate some time later this year to address the challenge of homelessness and the associated costs that will, inevitably, be involved?  Has the Cabinet considered the Istanbul Convention, an international convention that seeks to combat violence against women?  The matter is obviously linked to the homelessness issue in the country.</p><p>  My final question relates to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Part 4 contains a provision to disappear 77,000 people off the housing waiting lists.  Under the Bill the Government has promised and stated that 77,000 people out of the 90,000 people currently on the waiting list will be considered to have their housing needs met.  I am not at all surprised at such a proposal coming from Fine Gael but I am absolutely astonished that it would come from the Labour Party.  Can the T&aacute;naiste give us some sort of commitment that there will be a change in that legislation before it emerges on Committee or Report Stage?</p></speech>

We expected this to be one of the Government's first actions in getting projects up and running.  It is important that what is left of the fund delivers a return, given our pension time bomb.  The critical date is 2025, which is one of the reasons the NPRF was set up in the first instance.</p><p>  A substantial amount of the fund, some &euro;20.7 billion, was pumped into the banks.  Of that, only &euro;13.3 billion will be retained, signifying a direct loss of approximately &euro;7 billion, poking a sizable hole in the fund.  We must keep sight of this fact at all times when considering the fund's function and how to use it properly as an economic stimulus, particularly in terms of job creation.  One can have growth, but one can also have job-rich growth.  Although I have problems with this legislation, it is important that the money be used wisely.</p><p>  We do not have a good heritage of building institutions.  Many of the State's institutions are carry-overs, as it were, from the time before the State's founding.  Some of those we have created have not served us well.  The greatest example in this regard is the HSE.  As such, I have been considering who will control the NTMA.  It seems that its CEO will report directly to the Minister.  A board of six people, including a chair, will be appointed, but the Minister will make the decisions.  It is important that the Oireachtas have meaningful oversight of and input into decisions or, at least, the scrutiny thereof.</p><p>  Another issue relates to the payment of board appointees.  It appears to be at the Minister's discretion, but there can be wide variations in the amounts paid to people who sit on boards.  For example, board members in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, are paid twice as much as those who sit on the RTE authority.  There must be rationalisation of this situation, as the variations are not explicable.</p><p>  The NPRF was established in 2001 with a view to helping the social and private pension economies from 2025 onwards.  Given that it has been decimated, however, it is important that any investment be made in a way that gives a return.  The Government has advertised that &euro;6.9 billion is available for investment, but that is not the truth, as &euro;1.2 billion of it has been already committed, including as part of the &euro;250 million that has been &quot;invested&quot; in Irish Water, an amount that has come from many different sources.  In reality, there is only an approximate &euro;4.8 billion available, and it would have been more honest to say so.</p><p>  It is positive that this fund can be used to leverage financing from the European Investment Bank, EIB.  I have been arguing for a different type of housing programme, one that offers people the opportunity to rent their homes for the duration of their lives instead of relying on a rental sector that is based either on local authorities or private, short-term tenures.  A substantial amount of money is available from the EIB, but some of the charities cannot draw it down because they need to provide a certain level of guarantee.  Their governance does not allow them to make losses.  That said, houses are required and this presents an opportunity to provide a different option, one that is not exclusively for people who are financially dependent.  A mixed group would prevent ghettoisation on the basis of poverty.  Substantial work could be done in this regard, for example, through co-partner arrangements.</p><p>  A requirement of any potential investment is to attract matching investment from an outside source.  Many Deputies have been pointing out that pension funds in Ireland could be more productively used within the State.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, referred to the &quot;multiplier effect of targeted productive investment&quot; in terms of job creation.  An impressive number of people could find work if investment was targeted correctly.  This has led to a demand for the fund to be used instead of just being allowed to sit there.  In this way, people could be taken off the dole and other social protection payments and start doing something that is of some value to the economy and society.</p><p>  Short, medium and long-term investments are required, including in education and training.  One of the so-called bundles involves a partnership with the Department of Education and Skills in the provision of schools.  What return would there be from such a public-private partnership, PPP?  Some PPPs have been very much to the advantage of those on the private side of the arrangements.  We need only consider the shadow tolling of some toll roads.  It was almost like a lottery ticket.</p><p>There was a guaranteed return because the State had to provide sufficient numbers of vehicles, even though that was not a particularly sustainable approach.</p><p> On the issue of State claims, it is a bit like David and Goliath.  I hope there will be a difference in culture because I believe the State takes on issues it should not take on just because it can do so.  I recall that under a previous Government, between 2004 and 2007, &euro;20 million - I know that figure is correct because I asked a number of parliamentary questions at the time - was spent fighting parents in the courts who were seeking appropriate education for their children, when that &euro;20 million would have provided a substantial amount of what was required.  There should be an examination of the cases the State fights to determine whether they could be done in a different way that would save money, rather than always trooping down to the Four Courts to defend issues when it could make the necessary change.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this legislation.  We have been waiting a long time for it but I have concerns about the control and targeting of the investment.  I have concerns about the private sector doing particularly well out of it at the expense of the State.  If that happens, it will be a real problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900023#V00200"><p>I am glad to speak about this because there is probably no more important a subject we could discuss than strategic investment, which is the key to getting this country out of the economic mess it is in.  This Bill is long overdue.  The strategic investment bank the Government promised, which I presume is now this strategic investment fund, has taken a long time to come before us for this debate.</p><p>  The lack of a strategic plan for investment lies at the heart of the economic crisis we had, because investment flowed to the wrong places for the wrong reasons, creating a bubble economy and leading to a disastrous crash for which we have paid a terrible price.  Getting the question of strategic investment right is critical for the future of our economy, if that future is to be sustainable and if it is to avoid repeats of the sort of disastrous crisis we have just been through.  I hope that with all the exciting and interesting issues that often occupy the national media, some of which are important and exciting and others less so, some attention will be paid to this very important discussion, which will set the parameters for the future sustainability of our economy.</p><p>  In establishing a strategic investment fund we are starting with a much-depleted fund because of the decision of the previous Government and this Government to bail out private financial institutions and international gamblers in the financial markets.  The obvious point - which has been made many times, but which I do not believe we should be allowed to forget because it will be a feature of what is going on in our economy for years to come - is that this year over &euro;8 billion of money, which could have been in a strategic investment fund and invested in this country to create jobs, develop infrastructure and ensure a sustainable economic future for this country, is being sucked out of the country.  That is a tragedy.  The pot we have to engage in strategic investment is massively depleted because we will continue to pump out billions of euro for years to come to pay for the disastrous mistakes that were made in the past.  Those mistakes must inform our approach to strategic investment to make sure we do not repeat them.  I still believe - although I know I will not get any change from this Government on it - that we should be fighting with Europe to retain some, if not all, of that &euro;9 billion to reinvest in our economy in strategic ways.  If this Government or any other Government insists on paying back all that money, which we should not do because I do not believe we are obliged to pay it back, it should demand that it is paid out over a much longer term.  It should insist that some of the money we are paying out be retained for strategic investment on the basis that we can show that investment is capable of achieving a return which would allow us pay back the money over a much longer term.  I make that general introductory point.  I will not dwell on it but I believe it is critical and must not be forgotten.</p><p>  In terms of what this fund can do and where we should be investing strategically to create jobs and develop a sustainable economy, on the face of it, this Bill is saying the right things.  We need strategic investment.  It is a good approach to streamline the National Treasury Management Agency and move away from investing the national pension fund in international hedge funds that are being invested elsewhere, and to redirect the investment back into our economy, with a particular focus on job creation.  All of those measures, on the face of it, are welcome, and some of the sectors of the economy mentioned by the Minister with regard to this fund and that are in the legislation, such as infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, broadband and forestry, are key areas in which we must be thinking about strategic investment, because it can generate employment and real wealth for our economy, which can help us get out of the mess we are in and develop the economy on a sustainable path into the future.  </p><p>  However, what worries me greatly is the repeated emphasis the Minister put in his introduction on co-partnership with private investors, public private partnerships, and allowing for further State investment in private financial institutions - that is, bailing out banks - all of which are worrying.  In the case of NewERA, the Minister knows well that we are opposed to the State asset disposal programme because we believe it is the wrong way to go about making the best of our assets and resources that must be retained in public ownership and invested in to develop jobs and economic benefits for the citizens of this country rather than being given away to private interests purely to ensure a profit for those interests and, ultimately, at a loss to our economy and society.  Overall, there is a worrying emphasis on what is called commercial return, which, going on past experience, is often about short-term rather than long-term, sustainable investment directed towards the good of our economy and society.</p><p> It is also important that as well as a commercial return on our investment we get a social return, and that the return is regionally balanced so that the investment is spread throughout the country and among different sectors of the economy rather than concentrated in particular regions such as Dublin.  It is important that the focus is on balancing the need for a return with the social need of our citizens and the long-term needs of society as a whole.  I am concerned that this is not the direction in which we are going and that the focus is more on short term commercial gain for strategic investment.</p><p> An issue that has not yet been mentioned but that lies at the heart of the economic crisis we are experiencing and needs to be a priority in terms of strategic investment for all sorts of reasons is that of housing.  The manner in which NAMA, which comes under the umbrella of the NTMA, has dealt with and is dealing with this issue indicates that we are moving in the wrong direction.  I and others have repeatedly and endlessly pointed out that we are experiencing a disastrous housing crisis, that rents and property prices are going through the roof, that a property bubble is rapidly developing and so on.  NAMA, the biggest real estate company in the world, owned by the State and under the umbrella of the NTMA, is unloading vast amounts of property onto the market and into the hands of, to a large extent, private international investors who have no commitment to our society, its needs or our economy.  They are investing in Ireland for one reason only, namely, to make money, to profit from a property sector that is beginning to again spiral out of control.  A body operating under the aegis of the NTMA is handing this property over lock, stock and barrel to big international investors.  The Department of Finance has put in place incentives and tax breaks to encourage these vultures on the international markets to invest in and profit from the housing and property sector while at the same time we are experiencing a massive and spiralling housing crisis, with many of our citizens unable to afford to put a roof over their heads.  To me, that does not make sense.  </p><p> If NAMA's job is to make a short-term gain and put private developers back in business, then that makes some sense.  However, if we are thinking strategically about the long-term good of the economy, the maintenance of balance and regulation in the housing sector and, crucially, meeting the social needs of Irish citizens, what is being done makes no sense.  It is setting in place the ingredients for the same disastrous mistakes to be made again.  What should be done is that this property, in so far as NAMA still has it, should be put back into the hands of local authorities to house people in need and generate a long-term revenue stream for the State.  Whether property is taken from NAMA or constructed, the effect would be the same - namely, people would be returned to employment, a revenue stream would be created for the Exchequer and there would be savings to the State in moneys currently paid out in rent allowance, RAS arrangements and lease arrangements with the private sector, which, if this is not done, will continue to get this revenue stream at great cost to the State.  I do not understand it.  </p><p> In response to our calls for a housing construction programme or housing purchase acquisition programme for local authorities, the response of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has been to ask where the money will come from.  The money could be taken from the Strategic Investment Fund.  I will provide some data showing how this would make sense, not only for the people on the housing list in need of affordable housing but for the economy in terms of the revenue that would be generated.  According to the response to a parliamentary question I tabled some months ago, the cost of constructing 10,000 council houses - the cost might be slightly higher now because of the rise in inflation, although it would cost us nothing if property was transferred across from NAMA - is &euro;1 billion.  If 10,000 houses were constructed annually, the saving to the Exchequer in rent allowance payments to private landlords would be &euro;66.2 million.  Also, additional rental revenue of &euro;50 million would be generated for the State.  This means that approximately &euro;100 million per annum would accrue for every 10,000 council houses constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA.  If 50,000 houses were to be constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA, the saving would be &euro;500 million, or the same amount in additional revenue to the State.  In other words, if, via NAMA, construction or acquisition-----</p></speech>

That is what I am basing my calculations on.  I would appreciate it if Deputy Lawlor ceased interrupting me.</p><p>  This means that over ten years the scheme would pay for itself.  Following that, there would be a revenue stream back to the State - money that would otherwise be going to private investors such as LoanStar and other vulture funds.  In the context of the repayment of all debts to private institutions, even they would see that this guaranteed revenue back to the State.  Also, the construction of social housing would put many people back to work.  That is strategic investment that is sustainable, long-term and beneficial to the economy and society.  I do not understand why the Government will not do that and the reason all the emphasis is on partnership with the private sector.  We all know what happened to public private partnerships such as the one with Bernard McNamara in O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and so on.  They were a disaster.  Why would we do that?  It is a waste of money.  It is money down the drain, it is unreliable, it  does not work and it has had disastrous consequences in the past.  What I have proposed is the type of scheme in which we need to invest.  It would meet real social need, create employment and all that would flow from it and provide guaranteed revenue to the State.</p><p>  Another area that could be examined is that of forestry.  Despite the fact that we have the most favourable conditions in Europe for the growth of forests, we have spectacularly failed to meet our afforestation targets.  This country was once covered by forests.  Forestry is a safe investment.  It generates a lot of employment and so on.  I do not propose to go through all the data because we have already discussed it during several debates.  Forestry provides a guaranteed number of jobs for a set amount of acreage.  It is a long-term safe investment.  The value of timber globally is increasing.  A lot of international funds invest in forestry because it is a safe, good investment.  It is also good for the environment.</p></speech>

We need the reserve fund because it is a safe investment that will actually guarantee the pensions of citizens and deal with the pensions crisis that is looming for the country.  What I propose presents a win-win scenario.  There would be a benefit in terms of carbon credits and EU money.  These are the areas we should be examining.</p><p>A matter that was recently brought to my attention &mdash; I am not an environmental expert by any means &mdash; was that of geothermal energy.  My point on it may be very obvious to people from rural areas.  Everything that grows, including grass and scrub, can be turned into energy.  I refer to biomass.  While the Government's emphasis has been on building huge industrial wind turbines, attracting all of the associated controversy and major questions, a report issued recently claims that if we were to spend on converting the Moneypoint power plant into a biomass plant one tenth of what the Government is planning to spend on turbines in partnership with big private financial interests, we would meet our targets for carbon dioxide emissions reductions.  Should we not be considering this?  We could grow the trees and there would be an economic benefit in terms of jobs and the environment.  Revenue would be returned to us rather than go to private investors.</p><p>I do not have time to address all areas of strategic investment.  I worry deeply about the emphasis the Government is placing, through this legislation, on the facilitation of profit-making by private investors and interests who will drain away our resources and the revenues that could otherwise be generated to the benefit of citizens and the economy.</p></speech>

I would not dispute that to a certain extent, but I believe his point on the lack of a regional focus in this legislation is correct.  There is no such focus.  That two people might be diametrically opposed politically does not mean that they cannot both look at legislation and spot a flaw.  There is a flaw in this legislation and the Deputy has pointed it out.  I will now do so.</p><p>  Usually, when a Government Deputy speaks on legislation, he starts by welcoming it.  I cannot welcome this Bill because, in its current form, it has a massive problem.  While the logic behind the measure is understandable, the omissions from the legislation are a problem.  In other words, it actually has the potential to make matters worse economically in certain parts of the country.  This is because the distribution of investment across the country is massively imbalanced and there is nothing in the legislation to counteract that growing imbalance.  What is worse for me is that, after months of pointing this out on the floor of the House and at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere, no one in government seems to give a damn.  There are parts of the country that have seen almost no foreign direct investment or substantial State investment in the past ten or 15 years.</p><p>  We now have the legislative framework for a strategic investment fund for what is to all intents and purposes a national stimulus package that might amount to &euro;15 billion, if we are lucky.  It is structured without any consideration for the fact that cities such as Waterford and other urban areas, in particular, around the country are on their knees economically.  Today there will be an announcement of a further 200 job losses in the city of Waterford, to which I will allude.</p><p>  The problem that obtains is actually a lot worse than one that a government does not have any money and cannot spread it around.  In this case, the Government finally has some money, but it is choosing not to invest it where it is needed the most.  It is fair to say that while we may be experiencing an economic recovery of sorts, we are not experiencing an evenly spread recovery across the country.  Dublin has outpaced everywhere else in increasing economic activity, followed by Cork, Galway and, to a lesser extent, Limerick.  Outside these urban areas, ordinary businesspeople and taxpayers generally are of the view that the Government has resigned itself to the fact that this is just the way it is.  It is believed that as long as the underlying figures for the country as a whole are decent, it is acceptable.  The truth is that parts of the country are still in recession or, at the very best, stagnating economically.  All I have to do to confirm this is look at the CSO property figures published yesterday.  Prices in Dublin rose by 3.1% in April, while there was a fall of 0.3% in prices outside the capital in the same month.  It is the same old story.  A few weeks ago Teagasc produced a good report on the economic strength of rural towns, the upshot of which was that rural towns had been focused on much less in national development strategies in the past decade and a half.</p><p>  With regard to development strategies generally, the Government has correctly focused on regaining our international reputation by attracting outside investment.  A good job has been done in that regard.  The Minister for Finance has been central to this and has done a very good job.  However, if we are in recovery mode, our recovery has become imbalanced, perhaps through no one's fault.  Any new investment in the country has occurred exactly where it is needed least, namely, Dublin, Cork and Galway &mdash; three urban locations where 82% of foreign direct investment ended up in the past 20 years.</p><p>  When I read about the NTMA-controlled National Pensions Reserve Fund, totalling &euro;6.8 billion, being turned into a commercial investment fund to be matched by &euro;6 billion to &euro;7 billion in private investment, the obvious question is whether anybody considered that some of the money should have been earmarked for the areas worst affected by the recession.  The answer is a resounding &quot;No&quot; time and again, as the Bill confirms.  When I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this recently, he confirmed that there was no regional angle or perspective and that, as far as he was aware, no consideration of a regional impact.  He then said something very interesting, namely, that when his Department examined Exchequer funding and PPPs, it had regard to spread from the political world in which money was allocated.  My take on what he said &mdash; we all know it &mdash; is that nobody inserted regional considerations into this legislation, but, when it comes down to it, anything is possible if there is the political will.  The reality is that money is spent and things happen based on the location of Ministers' constituencies.  That phenomenon is alive and well under the Government.  It is fair to say money is still being allocated not on the basis of need but on the basis of political influence.  The Bill proves this again.  As far as I can see, no account is being taken in government collectively &mdash; I know this &mdash; of where money has or has not gone in the past and where it should or should not go in the future.  The Department of Finance should ascertain where the investment in State finances has occurred in the past ten or 15 years and where employment rates are at their lowest.  It should consider a policy of domestic investment in the areas that need most assistance.  The Government could start again with this Bill.  It is effectively a stimulus package, but it is structured in such a way that 90% of the &euro;6.8 billion in State money could end up being invested exclusively in Dublin.  That could make things a lot worse for other parts of the country.</p><p>  I raised this matter in the House a few weeks ago as a Topical Issue.  What I received in response was patronising palaver.  I have looked back at the speech made in response by the Minister of State who was here on the day.  The part that was particularly galling &mdash; perhaps its authors are in the Chamber today &mdash; was the statement that &quot;there will not be any parameters set for regional distribution.&quot;  The next line was: &quot;It must be said that no region will be excluded.&quot;  It was the kind of cute, smarmy terminology that I really detested.</p><p>The Minister of State proceeded to characterise my contribution as a "gross distortion" - he said it twice, but nothing I said was a distortion.  There is a massive imbalance when it comes to deciding where investment should be made in the country.  The Bill amounts to the first stimulus package the country has seen in six or seven years, yet it ignores completely the obvious imbalance.  Frankly, we have moved beyond whether people in the regions think there is an imbalance.  They know it.  Whether the Government thinks what I have said is a gross distortion is beside the point; in the local elections last Friday the people of my area registered what they thought about what I had been saying and what the Government had been doing about it.  Last week there were seven Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors in Waterford city; today there is one.  People in Waterford are living with the reality of the imbalance about which I am talking.  If the Department is going to respond to what I have said a second time, I suggest it not use the word "gross" or "distortion", or attempt to tell me I do not know what I am talking about.  It might consider that IDA Ireland has accepted that regional aid guidelines do not work and have not worked, that there is an acceptance that investment is even around the country and that Departments collectively need to consider ways to deal with this glaring economic fact.</p><p> The Bill needs to be amended.  Money needs to be earmarked or set aside from the figure of &euro;6.8 billion for the areas that need it the most.  There are a lot of action plans but very little action.  I am off to meet the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, for the second time today, with IDA Ireland.  The problem with IDA Ireland is that the concept of &quot;business as usual&quot; is not working.  There comes a time when we have to ask the question whether it ever will work with the existing personnel and approaches in the agency.  The people of Waterford were not saying last Friday that the Government was not working hard enough or that they had forgotten who had caused the economic mess.  All they were saying, in some respects, was: &quot;Hello.  We exist in the south east, but you have forgotten about us.&quot;  They want to know what the Government intends to do next.  This is emphasised by what has again happened today, with hundreds of job losses in Waterford city.  This legislation, unfortunately, demonstrates they have a point.  The Government needs to consider what I am saying and act.  A starting point would be to amend the Bill appropriately.  Money from the Strategic Investment Fund needs to be diverted to where it is needed most.</p></speech>

This comes from the mandate for the Strategic Investment Fund which, as the Bill states, will be to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  One of the key things we are lacking where I come from - we have been talking about it for many years - is housing, in particular social housing.  While I disagree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on from where he pulls his figures at times, I know that on the ground the people who come to my office regularly are looking to be housed.</p><p>  When I discussed this issue with NAMA and the local authority a number of years ago, when it was first mooted that NAMA would make properties available to the local authorities, it was found that many of the properties in Kildare that were in NAMA were not suitable to house families, most of them being apartments.  If Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett had done similar work for his own local authority area in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, he would probably have discovered the same thing, namely, only a small percentage of properties in the NAMA portfolio were suitable for families.  That is the problem.  What NAMA is now doing is dealing with the issue on a commercial basis, although it has also dealt with local authorities to try to transfer as many houses as possible to house those on housing lists.  The Strategic Investment Fund has to look at housing as a means by which it can invest some of the billions available.</p><p>  While Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to one incident in which a public private partnership did not work out, many of them did.  In addition, he never mentioned anything about Part V.  To my mind, Part V was disgraceful legislation, brought forward by a gombeen politician, Mr. Noel Dempsey.  It should never have been brought forward and has turned out to be disastrous legislation.  In the past five years under it, virtually nothing has been transferred to the local authorities to house people.  As a consequence, the housing lists have increased dramatically.</p><p>  When I consider what has happened with the pensions fund, I have to give credit to former Minister  Charlie McCreevy who set it up and had a long-term vision for where it was to be used.  Unfortunately, in my naivety, when the crash occurred in 2006-07, I always believed it could be used along the lines of what had happened in the United States under the New Deal, namely, to fund social projects to get people back to work again.  Instead, we threw it at the banks.  I still believe we will get some money back from them.  We have invested in shares in Bank of Ireland which are proving to be beneficial and also in AIB; therefore, it would be best not to sell our stake simply because it is rising but to wait a number of years.  Nonetheless, I strongly believe some of the investment fund has to be used in partnership to build houses, including with the local authorities.  That is why I advocate the removal of Part V of the housing Act.  The money should be transferred in partnership with the local authorities to build the houses required.  I have always argued that we do not just build houses, we need to build communities.  I would have opted for an alternative to Part V.  My view was that developers should hand over land and that councils could then decide whether it should be used for the provision of amenities, schools, recreational facilities or houses.  Part V only dealt with the building of houses, whereas I would look at building communities.</p><p>  I have looked at how the fund has been used heretofore and welcomed many of the investments that have taken place and how the fund has been used to leverage additional moneys.  From a jobs perspective - I am a member of the relevant committee - some of the measures are innovative.  I was always very much in favour of young entrepreneurs and other young people getting access and the fund has been used in that way.  My view has always been to look at it in an overall, holistic way.  As taxpayers, we actually provided the funding for the National Pensions Reserve Fund and we should benefit from it.  There is a certain sector of society who are struggling and my point is that there should be some social inclusion provision within the legislation to cover housing.</p><p>  I am concerned to ensure moneys will come back into the NTMA through the investments we have made in the banks.  While people might clamour for a repayment of our debt, we should put some of the money into the Strategic Investment Fund in order that we can use it to improve the economy further.  We must look at this issue on a long-term, not a short-term basis.  If we only look at it on a short-term basis, we will end up paying down debt.  However, over a long period, debt is written down slowly but surely.  If we invest in infrastructure with the funds we will get back from the investments we have made in the banks, the long-term returns will benefit the whole community.</p><p> I strongly advocate that we put forward some amendment to this Bill that would include some kind of social provision so that it does not simply generate income back to the State.  The State is made up of citizens who at this moment in time are crying out for housing, so it is important that we invest in that, because without citizens we do not have a State.  </p></speech>

I want to go back down to the Committee of Public Accounts so I am in a bit of a rush.  I welcome this Bill.  The NTMA has proved itself to be a very capable arm of the State and this should be recognised.  We should look at those factors that make it so successful in how it conducts its work.  They include how people are recruited, compensated and rewarded for performance in the workplace.  There is possibly a lesson that can be shared with other Departments and other public bodies.  Of course, there are different salary scales in the NTMA for various reasons, but it relates to the way in which it structures the pay scales, incentivises competition in the workplace and rewards achievement.  People are held to account and are held responsible for their actions.  It is possibly an interesting case study in respect of lessons that might be shared with other aspects of the State and how we do our work.</p><p>  A strategic investment fund for the State is important, but it must be strategic and profitable and operate as the NPRF did before we funnelled it into the banks.  Deputy Lawlor made an important point about recognising how important the NPRF was and the foresight involved in building up that fund.  Unfortunately, that fund was mostly lost in the economic crisis because of what happened in the banking collapse.   In taking the money remaining in the NPRF and creating a new fund with it, we must be strategic with those investments in the hope that we have that investment and funds should they be needed if there is another difficulty in the future, financial or otherwise.  Hopefully, they will not be needed.  The investments must be made on the basis of a decent financial return for the taxpayer.  We are not spending this money; rather, we are investing it.  We must not use it to curry favour with a particular demographic, region or interest group or for political reasons, because it would be disgraceful if we did that and a big mistake.  </p><p>  Many speakers have spoken about where the NTMA should invest and different ideas and proposals.  Deputy Lawlor spoke about housing, which is important.  One thing I wanted to touch upon is how the money is invested.  I will be tabling an amendment in respect of that along the lines of the ethical investment Bill I introduced last year and in keeping with other national investment funds, most notably Norway's strategic investment fund.  This fund is prohibited from making certain investments.  I would like to introduce that into our new fund.  There is already an ethical prohibition on the State's investing in companies that produce cluster munitions, and I would like to extend that to companies that produce nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon delivery vehicles.  The NPRF has already invested &euro;10 million in such companies, which is a disgrace.  As we divest and reinvest that money, we must not reinvest in companies that do such work.  This would be in keeping with our long-stated foreign policy objectives since our very first days in the UN.  It is incredibly important that we are not hypocritical in how we spend taxpayers' money.  If this country believes in the abolition of nuclear weapons, it is completely hypocritical for us to invest in companies that are building them.  I hope this amendment will be accepted by the Minister of State when I table it.  I intend to pursue it rigorously because it is important to me and to the people of this country.  It should be recognised at every point that it is their money.  </p><p>  While we are talking about the NTMA, when we exited the bailout last year, we decided not to take a precautionary line of credit from the troika because the NTMA had built up cash reserves in the region of &euro;20 billion, which was a smart move.  It is always important that we have such contingencies in place, particularly given the continuing fragility in the international markets.  However, I wonder if there is scope to take a portion of that &euro;20 billion in cash reserves - even as little as 7% - to reinvest in the domestic economy by way of a change in the tax bands.  If we were to increase the entry point to the marginal rate of tax by &euro;10,000, it would cost the State &euro;1.3 billion.  I am not sure whether we will have that even on the current growth forecasts for this year, in keeping with the cuts that must be made this year to bring the annual deficit down.  It would be a one-off payment, but such a one-off payment might prove to be the stimulus that we need, so that going into next year's growth levels it might carry over and become something more permanent.  I wonder whether it has been discussed at senior level, but if not, I ask that it be considered, because the arithmetic for the next budget is tight, and from what I have heard in certain quarters, I am concerned that we may not be sticking to the current programme, which has specific parameters set out in Irish and European law.  It is incredibly important that we reduce the deficit because we are legally obliged to, and for the continuing economic stability of the State.  At the same time, we must find measures that might help stimulate the economy.  They might not be directly in front of us in terms of the job creation that is taking place every month, which is welcome.  The measure about which I spoke might be worth looking at as a one-off measure to help carry us over into next year and to more permanent changes in the tax arrangements in this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900027#Z00500"><p>I have not had an opportunity to look into this Bill in great detail.  There is no point in trying to present myself as somebody who has looked into it in great detail, because I have not done so, but I will make some general observations regarding what has happened to the NPRF since the 31st D&aacute;il was formed.  In a development I viewed with alarm and regret, as I felt it was the wrong thing to do, the NPRF was raided very heftily in July 2011 to recapitalise the banks in an over-hasty and probably ill-judged view of the capitalisation requirements of the banks, the state of their financial assets and the funding of their balance sheets.  The amount of money that was invested in the two pillar banks was in the order of &euro;16 billion.  It was really the capitalisation of the banks plus the contribution to the troika funding needed to start the memorandum of understanding arrangements to manage the deficit.</p><p>  Hitting the NPRF at such a high level was reckless because there could have been at that point creditor capitalisation.  The euro system strong-armed the Minister for Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance into essentially insisting that the socialisation of Irish-owned banks' losses could justifiably go ahead.  That was wrong.  Having accommodated that strategy, we have been left in the very defensive and weak position of being unable to insist on or make any progress with regard to creditor participation in the recapitalisation due to the losses.  </p><p>  The loss keeps being referred to as a &euro;64 billion or &euro;65 billion loss and capitalisation, but that amount only represents those losses that have been acknowledged in that way.</p><p>There are further losses embedded in the banks that have not been recognised and that are causing the paralysis in the two main banks and preventing them from releasing their customers, households and businesses to a normalised level of liabilities funding.  Even the front page of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>reports on how the banks are being unreasonable in regard to restructuring to repayable amounts the legacy debts on the balance sheets of households and businesses on the basis of the incomes.</p><p>The Bill is a behemoth.  I glanced through it and it attempts to section off parts of the labyrinth of arrangements and operational management of agencies that are part of the State, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is heavily depleted, with approximately &euro;6.5 billion being put into the new division with new instructions and new boards.  That is fine but it presents an opportunity again to make the case supported by the evidence.  There are 385,000 people still on the live register; 250,000 people have emigrated; 170,000 households are in deep mortgage distress; SME liabilities amount to &euro;50 billion, of which &euro;25 billion is distressed and probably incapable of being repaid; 90,000 families are on housing waiting lists; and 5,000 people are without homes.  That amounts to approximately 1.5 million people and our so-called partners in Europe have not snapped out of their dream to understand it is a nightmare for these people and relief in the order of &euro;50 billion is long overdue to this country.  The promissory bonds that represent the losses of Anglo Irish Bank should be extinguished, torn up and mutualised throughout the eurozone.  That can be done.  It is a matter of will, insistence and fighting for our people.  Another &euro;20 billion or &euro;25 billion at a minimum is needed for the two main banks to snap out of their paralysis and deal with their loan books in order that the loans of families and businesses representing at least 750,000 people can be worked out properly and with dignity.  It will not be a free and easy ride for those families but it would put them in a position where they can just about honour their debts for the rest of their working or business lives.  This needs to be done and the Government parties have an opportunity to flex their muscles and fight for our people.</p><p>Deputy Eoghan Murphy conceded that he was grateful that I allowed him to make his contribution because he was in a rush to another meeting and I understand that but there was a rush, for instance, on 9 February 2013 to liquidate IBRC without due consideration and deliberation as to what that moment could have provided in terms of another opportunity to eliminate the promissory notes and consequent promissory bonds.  The Labour Party advertisements during the recent election campaign referring to &euro;30 billion less bank debt were misleading.  It is not the case.  Even &euro;20 billion less is not the case.  A sum of &euro;20 billion, which would have been the cashflow obligation over the next eight or nine years, has become a &euro;40 billion cash flow obligation extended over 40 years.  It has no business being on the backs of the citizens of Ireland.</p><p>The balance sheets of all the licensed deposit taking businesses, including banks and building societies, show without the need for a banking inquiry that at six monthly intervals between 2001 and 2008, liquidity and solvency ratios, loans to customer deposit ratios and the funding of senior secured and subordinated bonds, together with the aggregate of the credit loans advanced by the banks in Ireland, including foreign-owned banks, were six times our GDP by 2008 instead of the loan assets being three times our GDP.  What were the directors of each of those institutions doing during those seven years?  What were the banks' auditors doing?  The financial engineering of the balance sheets went way out of control.  The banks manufactured a credit bubble, which is the prerequisite for an asset price bubble.  That is a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, which is bound to collapse mathematically.  When it collapses, the residual is the loans to households and businesses.</p><p>The personalities on the boards of banks and running the banks have changed since 2001 and even since 2008 but we need accountability.  Let us gather them together in a place that would accommodate such a revelation, for example, the basketball centre in Dublin, line them up in sections alphabetically, starting with AIB, Anglo Irish Bank and on to Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank and Ulster Bank and so on, and have the people who were in charge of directing the banks explain their balance sheets for each year.  They were out of control and when the music stopped in 2008, Bank of Ireland had &euro;61 billion in loans on its balance sheet.  That funding in the form of senior secured bonds was short dated compared with some of the loans which had been extended interest-only on a roll-over basis.  It was crazy stuff.  Dynamite, matches and petrol come to mind.</p><p>It is not even the fault of a previous Government.  The boards of directors created the credit bubble.  There cannot be an asset price boom and bust without credit creation.  All the customer deposits were lent but that was not good enough for the directors.  They wanted more funds to make more loans and, therefore, they issued bonds.  Bank of Ireland had &euro;61 billion in loans on its balance sheet in 2008 and AIB had &euro;42 billion in addition to all the customer loans and the interbank money it had borrowed on a three, six and 12 month roll-over basis.  It was mad and it gives us the evidence for a banking inquiry.  Let us have the directors of these institutions in those years before us to examine their accounts and to have them explain them.  This led to 1.5 million people being affected, including 385,000 on the live register, 170,000 in deep mortgage distress, which equates to 500,000 because there are 2.7 people in each household, 90,000 on the housing waiting lists, who were squeezed out of the madness of the asset price boom and bust, and the 5,000 who have no homes to go to at all and are sleeping on the streets.  They deserve to see the curtains rolled back in the basketball centre and to be given explanations.  There should not be firing squads at dawn, decapitations, heads on battlements and so on but let us hear what they have to say.  Not one person on those boards has been asked to explain the balance sheets, which are the evidence of the creation of the credit bubble.  Is that not crazy?</p><p>Is it not crazy that the Government wants a committee of inquiry that will be politically balanced so there is Government control of it?  People might feel completely at sea at present as to where to begin, until they start boning up, but I have just said where to begin.  That would be the best lesson on how to avoid anything in the future.</p><p> Without the credit bubble everything else could not have happened.  When one creates credit like that, and only the banks did it, one creates the conditions and climate for greed.  When I read the newspapers, I read about greedy builders and developers.  They could not have been greedy if the greed ingredient, which is credit, had not been created by the banks.  Am I right, Deputy Ross?</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister would ask his colleagues on the Government benches to examine this and to start the banking inquiry along the lines I have just mentioned, because it could save a great deal of money.  Let us save some money for the taxpayer and let us share with the taxpayer the truthful, fair and even-handed opening scene.  Let us pull back the curtains and start from there.</p><p>  The guarantee only occurred when the bubble burst.  We all know what happened after that and that the lawyers had us shivering and afraid to do what was right.  Instead of that they became neurotic about the law and said that historical law provides that everybody should be protected equally, including the guys who had bought in the secondary market.  The bonds were originally offered in the primary market and the investors had the good sense to get out and sell the bonds to the secondary market.  That is when the bonds go up and down in price.  This morning, representatives of NAMA appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain how they hope to reduce the exposure of the Exchequer, which is us the citizens, by accelerating the disposal of the loan portfolios they hold.  They are probably right to do that at present because there is a huge amount of overloaded liquidity in the hands of hedge funds and other investment funds seeking to buy assets at lower yields than they otherwise might.  They are there because the cost of holding the bonds that NAMA issued to the banks in return for the rotten loans it acquired is currently low.  However, if NAMA holds onto the funding of the bonds and holds onto the assets because somebody thinks they might make a little more, given that it is a floating variable rate, the price of those bonds might rise and that could result in losses.  As the yields rise on those bonds, supported by the underlying property assets, the value falls and the underlying assets fall.  Perhaps NAMA is right, and I believe it is, to see if it can dispose of larger lumps of those portfolios, simply to reduce the exposure of the State and the people.</p><p>  I wish the Minister well.  He should simplify things wherever he can.  He should not add more law.  People's heads get wrecked and melt when trying to understand what is happening, so the Minister should simplify.  He should recruit people who are competent, experienced and as apolitical as possible to work these things.  He should not be afraid of any bad news that might be coming down the track.  Instead he should face it, measure it and then deal with.  He must keep things open and transparent.</p><p>  I urge the Minister not to allow any of his colleagues to do what has been done on a few occasions previously.  When the NAMA legislation was brought forward in October and November in 2009, it was not on the Minister's watch, but the IBRC liquidation and the promissory note issue were presented misleadingly and dishonestly, in my view.  There was a golden opportunity to achieve the cancellation of what are now the promissory bonds, formerly the promissory notes.  That could have been done.  I am deeply disappointed on behalf of the people who elected me and all the other Members of the House at what happened and that illusory and misleading language presented something other than what it was at the time.  That is not right.  Honesty is the best policy.</p></speech>

That is the reason I have chosen to speak on this Bill today.</p><p>  There are many aspects to the Bill but I will focus on section 22, in particular, which provides that the agency, in consultation with relevant Ministers, can develop proposals for investment to support economic activity and employment in energy, water, telecommunications, forestry and any other sector specified by the order.  I fully support the principle of State investment in infrastructure and to create jobs.  It is ironic that this runs counter to the neo-liberal philosophy that has been the mania of this Government, the previous Government and the European Union establishment over the last number of years, when the creed was privatisation and looking to the private sector to resolve all problems.  The failure of that is seen in the 25 million who are unemployed throughout Europe.  The Government is moving very late to invest strategically.  This is a tardy and insufficient measure in the face of the mass unemployment and mass emigration from this country in the last number of years.</p><p>  The Socialist Party is grateful to the officials in the Department of Finance for the briefing on the Bill which was given to my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins.  The core of the Bill is that &euro;6.9 billion in assets from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be given to a new body under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency, to be called the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  A total of &euro;2.4 billion is already committed elsewhere, leaving &euro;4.5 billion to be invested.  That sum of &euro;4.5 billion is insufficient in the context of the thousands who have emigrated from this country and the thousands who are unemployed.  Let us put it in perspective.  This year and every year &euro;8 billion will be paid by the State in interest on our national debt, much of which is due to the bank bailout which was dearly paid for by the Irish people.  Five years ago, the National Pensions Reserve Fund had &euro;20.7 billion in assets.  This was put into the banks and in 2013 it was worth &euro;13.3 billion.  Over &euro;7.5 billion was lost by the Irish people due to the chaos of the finance system of capitalism.  That puts the amount of money dealt with by this Bill in context.</p><p>  I wish to draw attention to a glaring omission.  There is no specific reference in the Bill to housing, which is the most important strategic and social need in this country at present.  It is conservatively estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 houses can be built for &euro;1 billion, so 40,000 houses could potentially be built if the money referred to in this Bill was used for housing.</p><p>That may sound fanciful but it is not.  In 1975, more than 8,000 local authority houses were built in a single year, to say nothing of what was built by the private sector.  During the Celtic tiger boom, up to 80,000 houses a year were being built.  The idea that the housing crisis cannot be resolved quickly and within a period of perhaps three years is not fanciful at all and only requires the political will to be there.</p><p> I challenge the Minister.  Is this going to happen?  Is any of the fund going to be used for housing?  Does he accept that could happen with the Bill?  I await a reply, as do the thousands who are stuck on housing waiting lists and suffering from the neglect of successive Governments.  It is not something that has happened under the current regime alone, but under the previous regime also.  A mother with an autistic son contacted our office yesterday to say that she is now homeless.  Through the kindness of charity, she is being put up for a night in a hotel.  These kinds of case are the order of the day.  A man contacted us who is sleeping in the van he used to use for work.  That is what people have been reduced to by the lack of housing, rack-renting and Government inaction over successive years.  All public social housing was devolved to the private sector.</p><p> Housing can be facilitated in the Bill.  Does the Minister agree that it is a glaring omission, given the countless stories that have come up in the last few weeks alone?  If it is not an omission that is to be corrected, will the Minister agree that this is another example of the Government's absolute removal from reality?  It is a removal from reality that saw the Government punished severely in the elections over the weekend.  Deputy Joe Higgins and I have been approached by countless people in Dublin 15 - in Dublin West - who are suffering because of the housing crisis.  They are now going to take action.  I caution the Government that there will be social unrest and activity over housing if action is not taken by the regime.  Many people have established housing action groups, which are seen as increasingly necessary by those on the housing waiting lists.  I await eagerly the Minister's reply to the effect that housing will be included in the Bill.</p></speech>

I regret the fact that she is supplanting her constituency colleague, but maybe we will find another constituency for him.  In light of what he said in his elegant speech in Irish, it would be a great pity if we were to lose him to a colleague for political and constituency reasons.</p><p>  I listened to what Deputy Joe Higgins had to say and it consistently alarms me that I find myself, once again, more in agreement with him than with those who promote this Bill.  That is not because I agree with the specifics that all the money should go into housing, which is a very direct message and somewhat restrictive, but because I am deeply suspicious of the motivation behind the Bill and I am extremely reluctant to believe the money is going to be as productive or as impartially and independently distributed as the Government parties lead us to believe.</p><p>  Once upon a time, over ten years ago, Charlie McCreevy had a bright idea.  The nation was booming and, partly to be prudent for the future into 2025, his idea was to set aside money for a national pension fund.  It amounted to 1% of GDP.  It was prudent because it was going to dampen a boom that was getting artificially large.  Charlie McCreevy had many faults and flaws but he knew that, if he set the money aside in large sums, politicians - himself and his party included - would see the fund growing, set their eagle eyes on it and try to get their paws on it for political advantage.  Instead of just setting up a fund, as most politicians would do, he set it in legislation that the fund could not be pillaged for political reasons and could not be used for politicians' constituencies or pet projects.  He seemed to have set up, not for eternity but for over 20 years, a fund to look after the needs of pensioners from 2025.  That was a sound idea with which few people disagreed at the time.  He did not take in the capacity of his successors, when faced with the first possible emergency, huge political embarrassment and a national crisis, to destroy the idea.</p><p>  As Deputy Peter Mathews spelled out so clearly, when the bank crisis arrived the fund was completely and utterly destroyed.  Legislation was passed in the Oireachtas to allow the Government to use the fund to prop up the banks.  The fund is down &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion, a figure that fluctuates a bit, varying with the price of Bank of Ireland shares, which are volatile at the moment.  The fund is all but gone, with only &euro;6.9 billion remaining.</p><p>  Today, we are debating what happens to the entrails of the fund.  The legislation does exactly the opposite of what Mr. McCreevy did.  It enables the Government to do exactly what it likes with what is left, masked with a few pretty cosmetic restrictions.  I do not like the legislation, although it has been well spun and well sold and is coated in the language of apple pie and ice cream.  The fund will be used, ultimately or pretty shortly, for political purposes and nothing in the legislation stops it from being used for that purpose.</p><p>  My first problem is the question of why the NTMA.  The NTMA is the universally acceptable face of Irish State capitalism.  It has supposedly done a fantastic job and has managed to capture most Ministers for Finance, almost all of whom sing its praises.  I am not sure the myth stands up to scrutiny.  Most of it comes from the NTMA and its extraordinarily well-paid spinners, some of whom are sitting for hours before the Committee of Public Accounts, from where I have come, spinning some smooth and unconvincing stories about NAMA.  They have done a very good job for the NTMA and have done such a good job that the NTMA empire has expanded over the years from being a debt management agency into taking control of the State Claims Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NewERA, the NDFA, NAMA and various other bodies, according to a briefing I received from the Department of Finance.</p><p>I wonder why the NTMA has been given this all-powerful, monopolistic role in the Irish economy and why Ministers are so consistently happy to pay tribute to its success.  It has had successes; there is no doubt about that.  The fact that it has been able to sell Irish bonds is a success by its standards, whether by luck or not.  It had success there and was good at marketing those bonds.  However, anybody who believes the NTMA has been some sort of stellar performer in managing funds ought to look at some of the critical pieces written by Professor Stewart of TCD and others, who conclude that the fund management performance of the NTMA is at best middling in terms of its competitors overseas.</p><p> In its early days, the NTMA very cleverly chose a benchmark which is always exceeded.  Every year, on 31 January, it comes out to an audience which is quite uncritical and not very knowledgeable, including successive Ministers for Finance.  Each year, the Minister is present and nodding wisely while the NTMA says it has beaten the benchmark again, a benchmark it set itself.  Therefore, let us not get too starry-eyed about what the NTMA does or let us not be too happy about the strategic investment fund going to the NTMA.  Let us look at this more critically and let us not blindly say it will be okay because it is going there.  The NTMA's performance is not particularly great.  It is not top quartile, and this we should bear in mind.</p><p> What is going to happen to this money, this &euro;6.9 billion?  We do not know.  However, we are being reassured that there are certain restrictions on its use.  First, it will go to Ireland, and second, it will go into commercial projects.  I do not believe these two restrictions are necessarily compatible.  It will not necessarily go to the most commercial projects available if it is restricted to the home patch.  This excludes so many options that it is not guaranteed to be commercial.  Restricting it to Ireland may have merits; obviously the Irish economy needs that money, but that restriction certainly does not mean it will go into the optimal commercial investment.</p><p> The second restriction, which is blandly bandied around by those who support this Bill, is that the money must go into commercial projects.  How in the name of God do they know the projects are commercial before they have started?  What they mean is that the money will go into projects they judge to be commercial, a purely subjective judgment.  When we leave decisions like this to subjectivity, we leave them open to the possibility of political interference.  With the best will in the world, politicians could maintain that the projects involved are commercial, but the danger is that there could be another agenda involved.  I suggest the Government, with only 18 to 24 months to go, will succumb to that danger for political purposes.</p><p> The proof of this is that the Minister has refused to allow this fund out of his political grasp or the political stranglehold in which it is held.  As I see it, the general government policy on where investments go is set by the NTMA, and the most specific direction of these investments is set by the new companies investment committee.  The NTMA is dominated by Government nominees.  It currently has an advisory committee which is nominated by the Government, and it will now have a nine-member board which will be nominated by the Government.  However, with the Government's record, there is little doubt that it will put in place people who are, at the least, safe choices, people who when the chips are down will do what they are told.</p><p> I have just come from a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which had NAMA before it.  I am not going to be unpleasant or personal about anything, but NAMA, which is part of the NTMA family, has just got a new director.  This has happened under the radar and there do not seem to have been any announcements about it.  This new director appointed to an important State agency happens to have a Fine Gael pedigree second to none.  That new director is also on the board of Bord G&aacute;is.  This indicates to me that the Government will not be in any way shy when it comes to making appointments to the new board of the NTMA, particularly to the investment committee, and that it will appoint its cronies and people who will send the money in the direction the Government approves.</p><p> In fairness, the investment is not directly decided by the Government, but the Minister has a veto.  Therefore, it comes to the same thing, although couched in language which offers a certain protection.  What I see happening here is something that always happens where politicians, elections and large amounts of money come together.  What I see happening is that money will be directed in a way that will be politically advantageous.  I do not see any problem with giving the money to housing projects, nor do I see the Government having any problem with that.  The problem I see is that the Government will probably give it to housing if it can, but only in specific places where it is politically advantageous to do so.  That is the kind of cynical operation I see at hand here.  If it were not the Government's intention to direct this money to its political advantage, why did it not detach it from the NTMA and from itself and give it to a truly independent body with a real commercial mandate and direction and which is free of political interference?  It could not do that because at the back of its mind it wants this cash and wants to be able to put it in a place that is important to it.  The history of Irish politics demonstrates that this is what always happens.  Otherwise, there would be far stricter limits and far more restricted investments.</p><p> I am not happy about this so-called commercial mandate, or the suggestion that the money must go to commercial interests.</p><p>There are many quangos that are patronised and ripped off in order to pay directors' fees to Government friends and they are called commercial semi-state bodies.  Some of them are not commercial at all.  CIE is known as a commercial semi-state body.  It is not commercial in the sense that it makes a profit; it never makes a profit.  It is subsidised to the amount of about &euro;280 million a year.  Will we be able to take some of this money and shove it into a body that is not making money because it needs it and say it is meant to be a commercial body or could be in the future?  If it goes to prop up a failing State body, that should be addressed in a completely different way.  "Commercial" is an abused and contaminated word.  There are real dangers.  I have serious doubts about setting up another jobs agency, if that is what it is meant to be, because such agencies tend to be subject to political interference and control and are not subject to commercial criteria.  While I do not want to say anything irresponsible, this bond is in serious danger of becoming a political slush fund.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but the wording of the Bill suggests I am right.  It will have a political board controlled by the Minister for Finance and in approaching a general election it will be used in a way that is not responsible and frittered away.</p><p> There is a shameful history to the origins of this money and it is shameful that so little is left.  Owing to the record of the Government and its predecessor with such moneys, I would be inclined to oppose the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-29a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900033#FF00200"><p>I have listened with interest to the contributions of other speakers as, unfortunately, I was otherwise engaged.  I welcome the Bill, as the purpose for which it is introduced is important.  Members on both sides of the House have made reference to its purpose.  It goes without saying that in the past the NTMA showed that it could perform miracles with the responsibility thrust upon it, even though at times very difficult tasks were given to it.</p><p>  We should mention the origins of the agency.  The NTMA was originally invented to pay for the 1977 Fianna F&aacute;il general election manifesto, which after two and a half years thrust the country into a very serious financial position.  The NTMA was subsequently set up to cater for and manage that debt - to rearrange investment in such a way as to be of benefit to the economy.  It did so admirably and is to be lauded for what it has done.</p><p>  A number of issues now present themselves to the Government.  Without doubt, at this time there is a dearth of available resources to invest in anything.  I will not go back and rehearse what we have discussed before and suggest it was the fault of somebody else.  I do not mind whose fault it was, nor does it matter at this stage.  The Government must run the country, meet its requirements and commitments in a way that was never asked of any previous Government without money.  On top of this, when the Government took office, it had an annual revenue deficit the likes of which had never been known since the foundation of the State.  It is a miracle that the country did not collapse and implode entirely, with everything going down the tubes, because that is what seemed likely just two and a half years ago.  A lot of work had to be done, as a result of which we arrived at the situation in which we now find ourselves.</p><p>  The housing issue that has been referred to is of critical importance.  It is not something that has just loomed on the horizon in the past year, two years or five years.  It has been on the horizon for several years and every local authority knew there was no investment in replacement housing, as a result of which eventually the entire rental market fell into the hands of the private sector.  There is nothing wrong with this, except that there is no control over the cost to the tenant or the leaseholder in any part of the country and markets determine the burden on the householder.</p><p>  Reference has been made to the approximately 100,000 families on the various local authority housing lists.  They are all dependent on renting houses in the private sector supported by the Department of Social Protection to the extent of &euro;450 million per annum.  That is a recurring event each year and has continued for at least ten to 15 years.  Unfortunately, nobody is willing to stand up and accept responsibility for what happened over that period.  What happened was that the temporary solution to the country's housing problem became the permanent solution.  In other words, temporary leasing and rent support became the replacement for what used to be the building of a reasonable number of local authority houses.</p><p>  I remember when most local authorities, certainly those in the greater Dublin area, built approximately 400 to 500 houses per annum and also offered local authority loans to another 400 to 500 people.  That amounts to 1,000 families each year catered for by the local authority system.  It was deemed to be much more effective and efficient to have the housing issue catered for by the voluntary sector, with which I have no problem.  The only problem is that nothing was done in that sector either.  Ironically, the voluntary sector had some considerable advantages over the local authorities.  I do not know if it was through negligence, but the local authorities allowed matters to slip from their grasp.  It is for them to answer, but the net result is that the people have nowhere to go.  It is the most appalling problem I have ever experienced.  It is not just me; I know every Member of the House is aware of this.</p><p>  People have not referred to the fact that approximately 30,000 other families are also renting private property.  These are families who do not qualify for local authority housing in the ordinary way because their incomes are too high.  However, lo and behold, what has happened?  Rents have increased - in some cases by 50% or 60% in the past 12 months.  As the Acting Chairman knows, this applies throughout the greater Dublin area and into adjoining counties.  In many cases, it is worse in the adjoining counties than in Dublin city.  Approximately 150,000 families are now dependent entirely on the whims of the market on the extent to which their investment in housing will depend.  That is wrong and very unsatisfactory.</p><p>In many instances, banks are exerting huge pressure on landlords to either increase rents or evict the tenants and replace them with people who can afford to pay.  For a number of years we have been encouraged to believe we should be leasing or renting residential properties as opposed to purchasing them.  The move in this direction is a colossal and fundamental mistake.  Traditionally, Irish people have always wanted to own their properties.  They see them as an investment in their futures or those of their families.  The land war was fought over people's right to own their own place.  Why was that?  It was because they had for too long been moved around from pillar to post at the whim of investors, landlords or whomever else.  There are many dutiful landlords throughout the country who look after their tenants very well.  They are happy to have good tenants who will look after their properties and pay reasonable rents for them.  Unfortunately, not all landlords fall into this category.  There have been many instances in the past year in which tenants have been asked to vacate properties with 24 hours notice, which is illegal.  As a result, a huge number of people have been placed in jeopardy and a great deal of hardship has been suffered by many.  All of this was unnecessary.</p><p> There is a need for strategic investment which must be targeted at the areas with the greatest housing need.  This investment must be made in a way which would ensure there would be no recurrence of what happened during the most recent housing bubble when the collateral for properties was used as a bargaining chip between banks and between investors and the banks.  As a result, there was massive inflation across the entire housing market.  Residential property in this country is much more expensive than in most other European countries, which is not good.  In the past the criterion which applied for those seeking mortgages was that two and a half times the income of the main earner and the entire income of the secondary earner would be taken into consideration by the banks.  That criterion fell by the wayside and the banks and local authorities brought forward a new formula.  I have still not discovered the nature of that formula, but suffice it to say it represented an intricate solution to a problem which there was never any intention of solving in the first instance.  As a result, many borrowed huge sums and the repayments were far in excess of their ability to meet them.  In that context, they committed themselves to making repayments over a period of 40 or 50 years.  Some parents have since sought to rescue their children or grandchildren from their debts and consequently doubled or redoubled their debts.</p><p> Let us consider what is required for someone to repay a mortgage of &euro;400,000.  Nobody should pretend that, even now, people are not paying such amounts for properties, although I accept that there is a difference between prices in Dublin and those which obtain elsewhere.  A person who borrows in the region of &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000 would need an income of approximately &euro;120,000 in order to meet his or her repayments under the old criterion to which I referred.  This level of income would certainly be required by single income households.  Those who are renting also require very large incomes.  It is obvious, therefore, that a greater proportion of the disposable incomes of people who are buying or renting is being spent on servicing their housing requirements.  Normally, the maximum repayment should be one third of the net income of the household.  In some instances the amount is almost two thirds.  Owing to a lack of housing, the level repayments is likely to rise further.</p><p> I cannot understand why people continually refer to slight overheating - 1% over six months - in the market.  The same comments were made when the previous property bubble was about to burst.  On the news each morning it used to be stated house prices had stabilised.  What was not said was they had stabilised following annual increases of up to 30% or 40%.  House prices were removed from the consumer price index in 1977, which is interesting.  The reason they were removed was they were affecting the rate of inflation.  They contributed to inflation because, as was the case in the most recent property bubble, they rose dramatically.  A means must be found whereby the cost of residential property to the consumer must be reflected in some register in order that the Government of the day might be alerted to the prevailing trend.</p><p> Deputy Shane Ross seems to believe the Government should have no input in this matter.  That is ironic, particularly as the Government is always blamed for deficiencies.  It is extraordinary that certain individuals are suggesting the Opposition should reap the benefit of the good vibes from issues being resolved and that the Government should accept responsibility for all that is negative.  That is a new one on me.  The Government should have control in this matter.  The fact that previous Administrations did not exercise such control is a sad reflection on what they did when they were in power.</p><p> As stated, strategic investment in housing is critically important.  For several years I have been stating such investment should be made.  If it is not forthcoming, much more serious issues are going to arise in six or 12 months time.  This problem is not going to go away.  It is not true to say we can solve it.  We cannot do so.  In the 1950s the population of this jurisdiction stood at approximately 2.6 million.  It has, as one would expect, increased considerably in the intervening period.  If the economy is going to grow and we expect - as we do - to have full employment in the future, housing that is affordable must be provided.  We should encourage those who are in a position to exert control over this matter - for example, the Government - to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing is available on the market at all times.  This would benefit two groups, namely, people who would ordinarily register their names on local authority housing lists and first-time buyers.  Those in the latter category would include young garda&iacute; and nurses.  The people to whom I refer must be in a position to access good quality, affordable housing as opposed to what I, for want of a better word, would describe as the high rise &quot;compartments&quot; that they have been obliged to purchase in recent years.</p><p> This morning the chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la stated that in the future housing would be provided in high density developments of sufficient size to accommodate families.  If that proves to be the case, the outcome will be interesting.  We have certainly failed in this regard up to now.  Some of the houses provided in the past fell far short of meeting both people's basic requirements and the relevant accommodation standards.  We are all aware of countless cases in our constituencies in which what can only be described as cramped accommodation was provided for those on local authority housing lists and those on a slightly higher income level who would normally have been expected to be able to afford to purchase homes in the ordinary way.</p><p> I believe this Bill is of considerable importance.  I hope it addresses the situation and I know it is intended to address the situation.  Many of us in the House have made numerous requests for something like this to be done as matter of urgency.  There are various ways and means of achieving the same objective.  I hope this works, but if it does not work and if we cannot achieve within a short space of time the ability to house the people in the two groups to which I have referred, then we will have a disastrous situation on our hands.  It does not matter two pins who is responsible for it, because these unfortunate people will be on the roadside, for want of a better description.  Many of them are on the roadside at the moment.</p><p> I mean no disrespect to the Opposition, but I have listened to Members of the Opposition making points to the Ministers sitting on this side of the House as if they were directly responsible.  These things must be planned five or six years in advance.  Otherwise, we have to introduce emergency measures to deal with them.  We do not resolve these issues overnight.  We must plan in advance, secure planning permission and go through the process.  Otherwise, we can use the infrastructural deficit legislation to speed things up.  One way or the other, the greatest single issue facing the country at the moment, apart from our indebtedness, is the housing crisis.  I believe we have the ability to resolve it and address it in the context of this legislation and I hope we do so.</p></speech>

With our State fund and matching funding, we could double the amount of money available.  That is what is rather attractive about getting private investment into everything we do.  At the least, it would double the fund.  Furthermore, any money that private enterprise matches to State funding is a big boon to the economy, and that is what this fund is for.</p></speech>

I listened with respect and interest to everything, particularly the points Deputy Boyd Barrett has made.  They were cogent and practical and I hope to reply to them constructively.  It is important that this is a constructive debate.  People on all sides of the House have welcomed the principle of the Bill, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, Deputy Higgins, Deputy Coppinger, the Sinn F&eacute;in party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  All have welcomed the principle.  This is a new step that we all agree on.  We all agree that this fund is important for the future of the economy.  Notwithstanding the criticisms expressed - there have been many from various political points of view - the fact is that this is a major step.  It is a stimulus package that we are bringing into our economy.  Basically, we are bringing the money home and making it work for us and for jobs.  This is about investment strategies and creating jobs.  It is not a political slush fund or a fund that excludes investment from anywhere in the country.  I emphasise that point strongly: this is for everyone and every business, whether small, medium or large.  If a person has a good idea, he should ring up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  It is already in business and has already committed significant amounts of money to employment.</p><p>  My speech was too long at the beginning and I wish to make some points that I did not make at the time but that were in my script.</p><p>  In consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies, the National Treasury Management Agency has developed an economic impact framework, and this is a key element of the investment strategy.  This framework seeks to identify targeted areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impacts and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland following the financial crisis.</p><p>  The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland by the National Pensions Reserve Fund during the second quarter of this year.  To achieve this, the agency has been developing capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on the economic impact of its investments.  It is clear and certain that this is the way the funding will be monitored and examined.</p><p>  Of course, the investment strategy will have to be approved by the board of the NTMA when the legislation is commenced and the new arrangements are in place.  It is expected that the investment strategy will facilitate the ISIF in continuing to invest in the public private partnerships included in the Government's stimulus programme agreed in July 2012 on an ongoing basis.  Such investments will not crowd out private investment and may include social and environmental projects, subject to the commercial mandate.  That is a key point from today's debate.  It is the kernel of the points made by several Members of the Opposition.  There was consensus on the issue of projects which are socially just, which make a good deal of sense and which are urgently needed.  The Government agrees and acknowledges that in respect of these issues there must be a commercial mandate.  How we do that?  We do it by going to the marketplace, coming up with proposals and matching funds.</p><p>  I will comment on social housing because several significant points were made in this regard.  Recently, we published a construction strategy, the core of which is that every citizen should have access to suitable housing.  That is a key policy goal of the Government.  We will continue to prioritise the delivery of good-quality social housing.  This will include: the return to mainstream local authority housing construction this year, a point well made by the Opposition; enhancing the role of the not-for-profit sector in the provision of social homes, an issue we all agree on; and continuing to work with NAMA, local authorities and approved housing bodies to maximise the delivery of units owned by NAMA or its debtors for social housing.  We will identify the best ways to deliver social housing in the years ahead as part of the development of a comprehensive strategy for social housing.  The estimate is that in the region of 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes.  This includes the completion of mortgage-to-rent arrangements, the continued transfer of units owned by NAMA or its debtors, the completion of existing building and acquisition programmes and transfers under the rental accommodation scheme.</p><p>Budget 2014 contained innovative housing measures and announced an additional &euro;30 million of investment in local authority housing.  This is expected to provide a substantial number of new and refurbished homes for people on housing waiting lists.  Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of developments in areas with the highest demand for social housing.</p><p> In March, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, launched a two-year, &euro;68 million local authority home building initiative, which will build 449 new social homes for families in need of housing.  This investment represents the first return to new, mainstream local authority house building since the beginning of the financial crisis.  The details of the &euro;15 million fund to bring vacant local authority houses back into use were announced in April.  This will bring 952 vacant local authority units back into beneficial use, providing both high-quality homes for people in need of housing and employment through labour-intensive activities.  This year will also see the completion of a three-year, &euro;100 million investment programme that will provide 800 units for older people, people with disabilities and the homeless.  We are in the process of rolling out a new housing assistance payment, which will help to remove barriers to employment for recipients and will contribute to the creation of a higher-quality private rental sector through improved standards.</p><p> The contribution of the not-for-profit sector to the provision of social housing will be facilitated by legislation regulating the sector.  The construction strategy stated that later this year we would publish a social housing strategy setting out the vision for the sector.  We will introduce legislation to regulate the approved housing body, AHB, sector.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, may have a role to play as long as the commercial investment is structured in a way that supports economic growth and employment.  The investment must be structured in a way that does not result in its being classified as expenditure on the Government's balance sheet under Government accounting rules.  Otherwise, there would be a need for compensatory expenditure cuts to be made elsewhere.  The key element is to get matching funds.  With those, houses can be built off the Government's balance sheet and the money goes where we want it to, namely, more and improved social housing.</p><p> The Government is focused on addressing social housing needs and I am informed that the ISIF is investigating how a suitable commercial investment in the sector could be structured.  I hope this will go some way towards acknowledging the points made on all sides of the House.  I assure Deputies that this element will form a key part of the debate on Committee and subsequent Stages.</p><p> I will refer to some of the comments made during this debate, albeit not necessarily in the order in which they were made.  Deputy Michael McGrath, who welcomed the legislation, raised the issue of the salary structure in the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  Information on the NTMA's salary bands are publicly available and are published in the agency's annual report.  There are significant advantages in the flexibility given to the NTMA.  For example, it allowed the NTMA to recruit specialised staff to resource the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, quickly.  This was essential in order to get NAMA up and running with the necessary speed.  The key point is that information on the full range of salaries and staff numbers is available and published annually.  Transparency is not an issue.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about directed investments - public policy investments - in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Directed investments will remain under the direction of the Minister for Finance.  When the time is right to sell them, the Minister can direct that the money be paid to the Exchequer or remain within the ISIF.</p><p> The Deputy referred to how the legislation had been announced in March 2011.  In anticipation of the Bill and as had been mentioned, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, has committed 20% of the value of the fund, amounting to &euro;1.2 billion, to investments in small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, public private partnerships, PPPs, and Irish Water.  We have not been standing still.  NewERA has also been set up within the NTMA on a non-statutory basis and has been providing advice to the relevant Ministers.  It is important that the Bill go through the proper due diligence and legal review process.  However, that process has not impeded the NPRF in making investment commitments in Ireland.  NewERA has made a valuable contribution since its establishment on a non-statutory basis.</p><p> Some of the &euro;500 million invested in the metering programme has created more than 1,000 jobs.  The vast majority of the people in question were previously unemployed, are new entrants into the job market or are apprentices.  Initially, 15% of those working in the programme were to come from these categories, but the actual figure is in excess of 80%.  It is an advantage to people who do not otherwise have employment opportunities.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty stated that Sinn F&eacute;in would already have had the ISIF up and running.  My points respond to that claim.</p><p> In anticipation of the establishment of the ISIF, the NPRF has committed to a number of investments in Ireland, including infrastructure, water, long-term financing for SMEs - both credit and equity - and venture capital.  The NPRF has already committed &euro;1.2 billion.  Included in these investments are &euro;375 million to three new long-term funds, which will provide equity, credit and restructuring or recovery investment for Irish SMEs; a collaboration with Silicon Valley Bank that will lead to $100 million in new lending commitments to fast-growing Irish technology, life science, cleantech, private equity and venture capital businesses over five years; a fund of more than $100 million established with the China Investment Corporation, CIC, which will make minority equity investments in fast-growing technology companies in Ireland that have a substantial presence or strategic interest in China; a financing facility of &euro;250 million to Irish Water; standby credit facilities for the delivery of two PPP projects, the N11 and schools bundle 3, with a combined project size of &euro;286 million; a commitment of &euro;250 million to the Irish Infrastructure Fund, a three-way partnership between the NPRF, AMP Capital and Irish Life; a commitment of &euro;125 million to Innovation Fund Ireland, a Government initiative led by Enterprise Ireland and the NPRF to attract leading international venture capital fund managers to Ireland and increase the availability of capital to Irish early-stage and high-growth companies; and a commitment of &euro;81 million to local venture capital funds.  In addition, the NPRF has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities in the areas of water, energy and broadband.  I can place further details on the record in this regard.</p><p> I acknowledge the serious developments raised by Deputy Deasy with regard to the high rate of unemployment in Waterford.  Like others, I am deeply concerned, and it is not true to assert that the Government is not concerned about Waterford.  I have knowledge of two specific matters in this regard.  First, a national water service investment programme worth &euro;1.77 billion was recently announced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  Nineteen full A4 pages of projects, large and small, are being addressed.  It is expected that between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million will be spent on improving wastewater treatment facilities at a number of locations throughout County Waterford.  This is more than the &euro;20 million to be spent in my county.  As such, it is not a political issue and, importantly, is being addressed across the country.</p><p> Second, and as Deputy Naughten is aware, the significant issues of boil water notices and the capital programme for water service improvement in County Roscommon have been raised repeatedly in the House.  They are being addressed by the Government in areas where previous Governments did nothing for the past ten years.</p></speech>
