I call Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100003#A00300"><p>Again this week we have had a very tragic situation.  I refer to the deaths of two babies in the same maternity unit in the space of a week and to the news of the tragic death of a mother who lost her life in Holles Street on 8 May last.  It has to be said that the vast majority of pregnancies in Ireland are safe and uneventful.  Nonetheless, the recent deaths will create further uncertainty.  It is clear that issues arise from them.  These deaths follow earlier deaths in other hospitals, including Portiuncula Hospital and the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  It is worrying that they follow four deaths in 2014-15.  It is of particular concern that we have not yet had sight of the four reports that were done.  In other words, we do not have a clear idea of what transpired because the reports in question have not been published.  That is unsatisfactory.  A former Minister, Senator James Reilly, indicated that he would ask HIQA to undertake an independent review into a death in Cavan, but that never happened.  I note that in the Holles Street case, just one external person is involved in the internal review that is taking place.  We need external reviews of these issues to provide certainty.</p>  <p>  I will explain why I am worried.  I have read the two reports that were published following the review carried out at South Tipperary General Hospital and the review carried out by a management consultant at Cavan General Hospital in July 2015.  I have also read the maternity strategy and the presentation made by Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith to the Oireachtas some time ago, in which he made the point that "Ireland had the highest birth rate in Europe between 2004 and 2013, yet we have the third lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the population, among 34 OECD countries".  All of the reports consistently refer to a lack of resources, to fundamental problems in the recruitment of clinical and managerial staff in the key obstetric centres and to fundamental manpower and resource issues.  We have had many warnings and reports, but no comprehensive action has been taken to deal with the resourcing of our maternity hospitals.  Does the Taoiseach accept that our maternity services are under-resourced?  Does he accept that there is a need for urgent intervention and transparent action on the part of the Government?</p></speech>

Obviously, the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley in the National Maternity Hospital was a very stressful time for her husband, Alan, and their extended family.  I am aware that in this case, the HSE has confirmed that the master of the National Maternity Hospital has commissioned a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley.  This is as one would expect.  I want to stress the importance of patient confidentiality and sensitivity to the needs of this family at this time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the deaths of two babies at Cavan General Hospital.  On behalf of everybody, I would like to express deepest sympathy to the two families involved.  The HSE has confirmed that the RCSI hospital group is conducting a review of both of these cases.  I assure the House that the safety and quality of maternity services is a priority and will remain so for the Government and for the Minister for Health.  Deputy Martin will be aware of the publication of Ireland's first-ever maternity strategy, which demonstrates a new and enhanced focus on maternity care at policy and service delivery levels.</p></speech>

I can also report that the draft scheme for the health information and patient safety Bill will provide for mandatory external reporting of serious reportable events that arise in the health service.  The Bill, which is currently with the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, will require health service providers to report such events to the State Claims Agency, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission.  The Department is aware of four infant deaths which occurred at Cavan General Hospital's maternity services between 2012 and 2015.  Each of those deaths is the subject of a review.  I understand that one of the reviews has been completed and two others are at an advanced stage.  The early completion of these reviews is obviously important for the families concerned.  It will ensure any lessons to be learned will be implemented in our maternity services.  I will deal with the recruitment situation in my follow-up reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100003#A01700"><p>The Taoiseach's response is unsatisfactory because it does not cut to the core of the question I asked about the under-resourcing of our maternity and obstetric services.  My understanding is that maternity services received just &euro;3 million in additional funding in 2016.  I always said that last year's budget was a false and fraudulent one in terms of public figures.  Adequate provision was not made for the implementation of the strategy.  I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a recurring theme in all the key presentations to the Oireachtas by those involved and in the various reports.</p><p>To quote Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith: "All of these factors combined have resulted in all hospitals having difficulty retaining and recruiting quality staff...resulting in an over reliance on locum and agency staff," and this is a key recurring theme.</p> <p> The Taoiseach made reference to the legislation and I put it to him that in situations such as this we should have independent reviews of the incidents rather than internal reviews.  Legislation is not needed to do that.  The Minister could intervene and ensure that it happens.  HIQA or an external independent review of the incidents would give certainty and confidence.  Does the Taoiseach find it acceptable that in the four deaths between 2012 and 2015 we have, as yet, no information regarding those and no published report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100004#B00200"><p>One of the reviews is complete, as I said, and two others are nearing completion.  I am just as anxious that these would be expedited.  With regard to independent reviews I believe it is important to first of all have the internal review completed under the systems that apply.  If an independent outside external review is then necessary, that can happen.</p>  <p>  By the end of March 2016 overall health service employee numbers had increased by 5,856 over last year, an extra 1,300 in the first quarter of 2016 alone, and most of those are front-line positions.  During the last 15 month period the numbers employed in acute hospitals increased by about 3,500 wholetime equivalents which represents a 7% increase in the workforce.  Deputies are aware that the expenditure in the area of health is over &euro;13 billion at the moment.  Numbers in the medical dental category increased by almost 600 wholetime equivalents, or 6.5% during that period and nursing figures rose by 1,700.  Yes there are shortages in areas like emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry but these are not specific to the Irish health system.  Alternative marketing strategies are being developed by the HSE for these hard to fill posts to encourage people to take up employment.  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants working in the public health service.  Since the establishment of the HSE the numbers have increased by over 850 to 2,761.  This is a matter of considerable focus by the Minister.</p>  <p>  A mediator has been appointed to look at the question of a difference of opinion between the National Maternity Hospital Holles Street and St Vincent's Hospital.  Money is in place, planning permission is in place and rows like this should not impede the provision of proper, high standard, quality care for mothers using maternity services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100004#B00300"><p>It is clear that the Government intends to continue in this term exactly as it did in the last.  Fianna F&aacute;il stands indicted for giving the Government an opportunity to do this once again.  Despite protestations to the contrary the Government clearly intends to ignore the real life crises faced by many people, just as it did before.  The Government's responses to the crisis in our health services and the housing crisis, to deficiencies in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to the NAMA scandal and to the plight of rural Ireland are exactly the same as they were for the last five years.  First of all the Government denies there is a problem and then it announces half measures wrapped up in fine rhetoric.  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of measures to tackle organised crime is a good example.  These modest measures, while welcome, do not go far enough.  Following the Regency Hotel murder, the Government line was that Garda resources were not an issue when it comes to tackling organised crime.  The task force announced yesterday would be welcome if it meant additional and extra resources, but does it? In north inner city Dublin there are 140 less garda&iacute; than in 2010.  Unless there is an increase in Garda numbers this task force will be made up of garda&iacute; brought off the front line elsewhere.  This lack of resources is not an accident and is not unique to Dublin.  It is an issue right across the State.  It is a direct result of the policies of this Government and of Fianna F&aacute;il before it and needs to be totally reversed.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the D&aacute;il when the new measures announced will be in place and will there be additional garda&iacute; and funding?</p></speech>

Five years ago we inherited a situation where there was not any money, Garda recruitment had come to an end and Templemore was closed.  There has been this festering situation in north inner city Dublin and in other locations around the country for quite some time.  Government began to put resources, where possible, into the security forces in both Defence and the Garda.  Templemore was reopened and began to recruit garda&iacute;.  In our programme for Government we set out an increase of recruitment through Templemore to have a real increase in Garda numbers to 15,000 and to cater for vacancies created by those garda&iacute; who have retired on age grounds.</p>  <p>  We have made it perfectly clear on many occasions that whatever the request made by the Garda Commissioner or the Garda authorities for dealing with gangland crime, those resources would be provided.  One can only do that with a strong economy and that is why it is important for the management of the public economy be kept very clearly in sight.  We discussed this at Cabinet having met with the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda personnel last week.  The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, made a specific request that the threshold which applies under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 should be reduced from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000 and we are going to do that.  By way of regulation, the Government decided on the advice of the Criminal Assets Bureau to reduce the prescribed sum under which cash suspected to have been the proceeds of crime can be seized from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000 under section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act.  Further proposals will go to Government to enhance and update legislation for the lawful interception of communications in respect of criminal activities.</p>  <p>  Last week I said this matter goes beyond mere party politics.  It affects the lives of innocent people and we understand the fear and pressure that these communities are under.  The Garda will have the task force on crime for all of Dublin.  We are going to respond with a task force for the north inner city.  I expect to have consultations with Deputy Adams and Members of different parties who might have ideas about that and then go and talk to the community leaders and public representatives in the north inner city to look at the social disadvantage, the unfairness and lack of facilities in those areas for very many years.  I am glad to see that the new primary care centre is about to commence in Summerhill and have a sod turned very shortly.  However, it needs so much more because this is not something that can be dealt with overnight.  There is a much longer term requirement for initiative and investment.  Consultation and working with these communities, where very good people are committed to giving the children of the localities a life of opportunity, is needed.  This means that whatever Garda resources are required, on the advice of the Garda Commissioner, will be provided.  The Government has made that money available and is following through with these actions which will not of themselves put an end to this but they will help the Garda authorities, the garda&iacute; on the ground and the communities to come to grips with this scourge.</p></speech>

I asked three questions.  When will the measures announced yesterday be put in place?  Will there be additional garda&iacute;?  Will there be additional funding?  The Taoiseach did not answer any of the questions.  It is crucial that additional garda&iacute; are on the ground and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is resourced properly.  However, this is not just a policing matter.  There is a need for increased investment in education, job provision, drug treatment and crime prevention.  Local communities are up for this challenge.  Many have battled for their kids for generations against Government indifference and now the Government has discovered there are disadvantaged communities within earshot of the D&aacute;il.  The Government now needs to deliver, go beyond the rhetoric and put real measures in place.  Last week I asked that a task force involving local communities be put in place, Government led but with full involvement of local activists and local people to carry out a comprehensive, multi-agency strategic plan for DubIin&rsquo;s north inner city.  When will this be put in place, how will it be resourced and what funding will be provided?  I remind the Ceann Comhairle that the Taoiseach has not answered my original three questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100005#C00100"><p>Let me reflect again for the Deputy.  We already had the capacity to reopen the Garda College in Templemore to train new garda&iacute; and dispense them around the country.  The Government has decided to increase the Garda force to 15,000, but we cannot do this without a strong economy or providing proper training for young garda&iacute;.  As the Deputy will have known within the past few days, probationary garda&iacute; are supervised in their training; therefore, we do not have situations which arose in the past when that was not the case.  An extra &euro;5 million has been provided to deal with the request from the Garda Commissioner in terms of the labour intensity of surveillance, dealing with gangland crime, interventions and the prevention of shootings or attempts to kill people.  This is something with which the Garda force, in particular the Garda intelligence unit, has been dealing for quite some time.  I accept that it is necessary for government as a whole to work with communities such as those in the north inner city to give them some chance and have a real opportunity.  We would not be able to do this if we did not have resources in the economy to make some impact.  In the past we have been blamed for being too focused on the economy.  Believe me - we will go there, but we have to know how to link all of the agencies together, what the purpose of the north inner city task force is, what resources are required and what it is the leaders in these communities want.</p></speech>

If it is to be a whole-of-government response, it should be so.  It is not only this party or the Government that wants to deal with this.  It is about the people.  Those in the north inner city are good people and should have the same opportunities as anyone else to live their lives in the way they want.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100005#C00400"><p>Dublin's inner city has had an horrific time recently.  While other parts of the country have, unfortunately, experienced murders, I think we accept that it has been unprecedented in the north inner city.  As Atticus Finch put it in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, one never really understands a person or a situation until one gets into their skin and walks around in it.  That is what I am asking for - that the Taoiseach get inside the skin of somebody living in the north inner city.  He or she looks out the window and there is no one on the street, yet, within two to three minutes, anything from 30 to 60 people are on it because the word has gone around that drugs will be available for sale.  He or she could be sitting at home in his or her flat or walking down the street, perhaps going to buy the messages, meet neighbours or the pub for a drink, and, suddenly, shots ring out and somebody is gunned down and executed in front of him of her.  He or she could have a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, who got caught up in addiction and owes a massive amount of money to the dealers and he or she hears a knock on the door and is told either to pay up or else do a deed, commit a murder or set somebody up for murder or the consequences will be worse for him or her.</p><p>Middle Ireland and wealthy Ireland have contributed to this also.  They have also fuelled the drug trade and thus contributed to the murders and mayhem.  We know that it did not happen overnight.  It is continuing and will continue.  As long as it continues, it will undermine the rule of law and democracy.  Tackling criminal justice issues, increasing the police presence and enhancing the Criminal Assets Bureau are welcome, but that is only part of the answer.  It will not resolve the more fundamental issues that have been neglected for decades.  The bigger reality, as we all know and the Taoiseach said, is that people face disadvantage and inequality, whether in education, job creation, service provision or the environment, yet, as the Taoiseach also said, these communities have shown great resilience, pride and humour.  I acknowledge the work that has happened.  In spite of cuts of 30% to 40% for community, youth and addiction services, the work has continued in schools.  There is also the role of the churches, as well as the community policing forum and community police officers.</p><p>Does the Taoiseach accept, as I am sure he will, that it is the duty of the State to protect its citizens?  Does he accept that everyone - individuals, families and communities, regardless of where they live - has the right to live in peace, free of fear, intimidation and violence, and to live in a place where the State does not just talk about equality of opportunity but actually puts strategies in place that are well resourced and make a difference?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100005#C00500"><p>I accept that, of course I do.  I understand, from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's experience as a public representative and citizen, that she knows more than most and knows many of the people involved in the north inner city directly.  I respect this.  The agenda she has set out is part and parcel of what we have to do.  It is, of course, the duty of the State to ensure citizens are protected.  It is a duty of the State to ensure citizens can go about their daily lives free of fear and pressure such as that experienced in the north inner city.  However, it also has a duty to connect all of the interdepartmental agencies together.  Whether it be in justice, housing, education, training, upskilling or apprenticeships, an opportunity has to be provided for young people and those who in the past might have taken a different route.  It is a major challenge.  When this was done in Limerick, the restoration projects took ten, 15 or even 20 years and required an enormous amount of money.  We have to start by resourcing garda&iacute; to do their job.  As the Deputy knows, arrests have been made and there are investigations ongoing into the unfortunate murders.  There is much more evidence on the streets and people have been warned that their lives are in danger because of the intelligence being made available to garda&iacute;.  We hope it can and will stop.  In so far as the Garda is concerned, its crime task force will be resourced and given whatever facilities the Commissioner requests.  The State, public representatives, community leaders and communities will need joined-up thinking, backed up by resources, to provide evidence that, for these communities, having hope is not just an aspiration but can becomes a reality in terms of facilities, opportunities, the provision of training, paths to employment and hope for a better life.</p></speech>

We are now talking about a new task force.  As the Taoiseach said, it needs to have key players from the statutory organisations, but they have to be key players with direct access to Ministers.  The Department of the Taoiseach also has to be involved, perhaps as the driver.  There must also be experienced voices from the community and voluntary sector.  Allied to this, to make a difference, there has to be an implementation, monitoring and evaluation team that will have specific short-term, mid-term and long-term objectives and timeframes.  We need better and more effective international co-operation, which is vital to target assets.</p>  <p>  We need a better understanding of addiction.  One of the unintended consequences of the police action is that the drugs supply for many with an addiction will be cut off.  Here is an opportunity for them to get into recovery programmes, if treatment and rehabilitation services are available to them.  There needs to be an increase in detox facilities, whether community or residential.  We need more garda&iacute;, but we also need more youth workers, community and outreach workers.  Education is vital, while prevention and education present a major challenge.  This means engaging young people, as we have done in the north inner city, in meaningful and non-judgmental conversations.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is both complex and difficult.  There are no quick-fix solutions and it is going to be a challenge.  Nonetheless, there is a real opportunity.  This issue is going to move from the media because they will have other stories.  However, we cannot afford to lose focus because, if we do, the trail of addiction and crime, including gangland crime, will continue.</p></speech>

I like to think the north inner city task force that will be put together will be different in the sense that I would like to see it modelled on what the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, brought forward formerly in the creation of jobs, where there was a timeline, it was action-proofed and responsible.  In so far as my Department is concerned, we will be very happy to work with it.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health explained yesterday that he hoped to be in a position, before the House rose for the summer recess, to bring legislation to the House dealing with prescriptive drugs, a matter mentioned by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall on a number of occasions and others.  Before the end of the year we will have a national drugs strategy, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will deal, in conjunction with other Departments.</p>  <p>  The points raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan are real and part of an agenda of opportunity for communities, but it is our job to make it happen.  I hope to engage with the Deputy and others, including members of the Government with their different responsibilities, to address the need for joined-up thinking and to show that, where the Government applies itself with resources, it can make a difference to the lives of people.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach just listed a host of issues the citizens' assembly will look into, including everything from fixed-term Parliaments to the ageing population but let us throw in the eighth amendment as well.  The best that some of the Independent Deputies, who when on this side of the House last year voted to repeal the eighth amendment, could do is on page 158 of a 160 page document.</p>  <p>  We know the Taoiseach will establish the citizens' assembly within six months but will he tell us when it will report?  Will it do so in the lifetime of this Government or will he attempt to push this issue aside and kick the can down the road yet again?</p>  <p>  I have an issue with the title of the assembly or committee.  This issue does not just affect citizens.  It affects non-citizens in quite an acute way because women who are pregnant in this country who do not have citizenship and who may have been working and living here for years do not have the same freedom of movement as other people and it is a very important issue for migrant women.  The title should be changed.  One in four of my constituents is from outside Ireland.  Some of them are now citizens but others are not.  It is quite a dangerous precedent.</p>  <p>  How will the fine upstanding citizens to rule on these issues be chosen?  How will the membership of the committee be chosen?  Will it have a majority of women of childbearing age to deliberate on this topic?  Will there be any bishops or religious representatives in the assembly?  How exactly will the Taoiseach decide who is fit to decide women's personal decisions over their own bodies and futures?</p>  <p>  Last year, when the referendum on marriage equality was taking place, many people really resented the fact a majority of people would make the decision over what would only affect a minority in society.  I have a problem with this also.  This should never have been put into our Constitution because these are personal matters.  It does not matter to me if a majority agrees as it will only affect a particular cohort of people and it is their personal decision to make.  The decision was taken 33 years ago at the behest mainly of a Catholic lobby as no other religious groups or people demanded it.  I have studied this, as have many others.  As that decision was taken, we are left with no option but to have a referendum.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the democratic issue here.  The only way a referendum can be triggered in this country is if a majority of Deputies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann decide it can happen.  This is not democratic either.  In the context of the democratic revolution the Taoiseach planned in the last term, he might reconsider this.  There should be some way the people of the country can petition for a plebiscite or referendum to be held because poll after poll has shown that anything from 78% to 80% of people believe there should be a referendum on this matter but the Taoiseach is preventing this from happening and he has now outsourced it to a committee.</p>  <p>  I have an issue with this outsourcing.  The Taoiseach is outsourcing water and housing and now he is outsourcing this issue.  Why are politicians to be excluded from it?  Is it because it is awkward for the Taoiseach because he bowed down to the so-called pro-life lobby a few years back and he does not want to make a decision on this?  We are elected by people to make decisions, including difficult ones.  Why should it be unelected people who decide how this issue proceeds?  It should be a majority of people who were recently elected, who stood before the public on this issue.  Many of us stood on a fully pro-choice platform and it did not inhibit us in any way from getting elected.</p>  <p>  I do not think the Taoiseach recognises there has been a sea change in attitudes on this issue but I can tell him that there has because I have been on the streets at a number of stalls with ROSA and other groups.  It is clear people have shifted and they recognise we cannot export women from this country any longer or deny the reality that every day in bedrooms throughout the country women take abortion pills which they ordered online because they cannot afford or are not in a position to leave the country for a very expensive operation.</p>  <p>  Why did the Taoiseach choose to do this?  Why are Independent Deputies Katherine Zappone, Finian McGrath and John Halligan, who stated they were pro-choice, willing to accept such a meagre recognition of this issue in terms of the citizens' assembly?</p></speech>

It has been raised on many occasions.  We have set out a clear process in the programme for Government committing that a citizens' assembly should examine the question of the eighth amendment and other issues.  Following the citizens' convention, which brought forward the proposition that there should be a referendum on dealing with the question of marriage equality, the process by which it came about was very clear and strategic and it brought about its own results.</p>  <p>  It is not true to say that it is only, unfortunately, women who have to contend with crisis pregnancies who have an interest in this.</p><p>This is about the people of the country having an interest in matters of life and death, and the Deputy is well aware that the Constitution belongs to the people, is created by the people, voted on or amended by the people and changed by the people.  Nor is it true for her to say that politicians here do not have a say on this.  When the citizens' assembly makes its recommendations and when they go through the Oireachtas committee and the expert group, it is the politicians here who will have to make a decision as to whether we proceed to have a referendum and what the nature of that referendum might be.  I have already said from our perspective that if and when that arises, it will be the opportunity for Members to vote according to their conscience and vote freely in whatever way they wish to vote on the question to be put before them.  It is therefore not true for the Deputy to say that the elected representatives of all parties and none here do not have a say on this because it cannot be put before the people, if a referendum is to be held, without a Bill to hold a referendum, and people here must vote on that.</p> <p> The Deputy is well aware that in 1983, the eighth amendment introduced the section in article 40.3 dealing with the question of "the unborn".  There were a number of court cases concerning the interpretation of that amendment and of the provision of information and referral to abortion services.  We had several referenda but the people decided what to put in the Constitution.  With the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill a number of years ago, the Government gave legislative effect to what the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution to mean, and that was not without its inherent difficulties either.  It is too facile to say we must have a referendum because one cannot change and amend the Constitution without the approval of the people, and one therefore must know what it is that one wants to do.  Yes, the question of fatal foetal abnormalities has arisen, and yes, the question of incest and rape has arisen, and these are very traumatic, sensitive, personalised cases for people.  The Constitution is what it is, and that is the reason why a citizens' assembly should reflect on the eighth amendment.</p> <p> The method of adoption of a citizens' assembly will have to take into account gender, location, age, geography and so on and would need to be chaired by a very competent person.  All of that can be arranged and made available through the commissioning of a polling company, as happened in the previous citizens' assembly, which was fair, regionalised, gender-balanced and age-balanced in the way it went about its business.  That will all be put in place within six months, as committed to in the programme for Government, but it is not as simple as calling for a referendum to be held.  It is much more profound than that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, when the very traumatic cases of fatal foetal abnormalities or other cases are brought to public attention, they are very traumatic, very sensitive and very heartfelt.  The Constitution, however, is the people's Constitution and cannot be changed without the people's consent.  That is why the people in the citizens' assembly should be able to give their reflection both on the eighth amendment and on a number of other issues which should not be sidelined either.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asks me when the citizens' assembly will report.  I cannot answer that for her until such time as the assembly is put together and begins its work.  The programme for Government is set out over the period of the lifetime of this Government, which is intended to be five years.  The Deputy asks me will the assembly report before the end of the period of Government.  It is provided for in the programme, so the answer to that question is that I expect that it should, but let us get it set up, with all the criteria that apply to it, let it begin its deliberations and let us see what the citizens say.  We will then bring those deliberations back to the Oireachtas, where Members will engage with experts on the views of the citizens and see what is possible and what is not.</p>  <p>  As I have said, it is not as simple or as facile as saying we should hold a referendum on the eighth amendment.  We need to know what it is that we want to do.  We need to know what it is that we can do or might do and we must have the support of the people.  I have no great regard or appreciation for polls that I see about these matters.  It is when they are being discussed in some depth that people begin to say just how profound the decision is.</p></speech>

I make the general point that I remain to be convinced of the model.  The Constitutional Convention was an interesting process, people involved liked it and there was a nice, touchy-feely sense about it.  In reality, however, a lot of what came out of it overall was left to one side.  Some ridiculous issues were put before it, such as whether to extend the right to vote to those under 17 or 16 years of age or whatever, which was hardly the burning constitutional issue of the day.  There are issues regarding the model as well.  My general point is that this House is the people's assembly.  The referendum on marriage equality is often referred to, but that was not actually an outcome of the Constitutional Convention.  All political leaders, bar the Taoiseach at the time, were in favour of a marriage equality referendum well in advance of the Constitutional Convention.  In fact, it took the Taoiseach-----</p></speech>

It should not be left to a citizens' assembly at all.  It will take six months to establish.  That is my point.  Given the complexity of the issue, I believe that it is not clear at all how a citizens' assembly could work on an issue so dramatically more complex than anything examined by the Constitutional Convention.  A simple repeal is not an answer, in my view, because we still face the core issue of what the law will be.  Any proposition to the people has to be legislative.  This means in the first instance that if one wants to delete it, one must bring something before this House, and the House must put it before the people.  We have freedom of conscience in our party and each individual member will make up his or her mind on the issue-----</p></speech>

I believe a judge-led commission initiative would feed into an all-party Oireachtas committee and would be the best route to deal with this.  Irrespective of one's views on this, an Oireachtas committee has the capacity, with legal backup, to go through all the scenarios.</p><p>There are legal, social, moral and ethical issues.  It is not a simple straightforward issue, as some would portray it to be, and people have different views.  Even the most liberal agree that there is a point at which a termination should be illegal.  Maybe others do not accept that point but even the most liberal accept that it should be illegal at some point.  There is no country without laws, be they constitutional or legislative, governing and concerning abortion.</p> <p> The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that the Oireachtas should be centre stage in relation to it.  I really would like an explanation from the Taoiseach as to how that core issue of what would replace the current law is to be addressed because, ultimately, whatever the citizens' assembly decides, it has to come back in here.  I do not know whether the citizens' assembly will be decided by pollsters with some sort of polling company again being recruited to conduct an assessment of what it thinks reflects a sample.  Polling companies and their samples have got it hopelessly wrong in the United States and hopelessly wrong in the United Kingdom.  They got our election hopelessly wrong as well.  I told everybody that for six months in advance and no commentator would listen but that is another day's work.  There are significant issues with polling companies around sampling techniques, etc., and that is something that should be factored in here in terms of how the citizens' assembly will be established.</p> <p> In terms of the eighth amendment issue, there is a legitimate question also of how can the process be run in such a way as to ensure that it is not just the loudest voices that get a hearing.  I attended a hearing of the Constitutional Convention and I am not so sure what transpired on the day I was there reflected where the vast majority of the Irish people were in terms of those who were to advocate, make submissions, etc.  A citizens' assembly is a wrong term.  There is only one citizens' assembly, that is, the one elected by democratic franchise - direct election by the people.  What tends to happen when such structures are established is that those who are selected - they are well meaning; I have no difficulty with that - very often become subject to the loudest lobby group or advocacy group of the day but the vast majority of people living in the country are going about their daily lives and are largely removed from the deliberations of it.  That can happen all democratic institutions or public fora where matters are discussed but there was a sense of that in the Constitutional Convention and there is an issue as to how one can ensure that it is not just the loudest voices get a hearing, particularly on an issue as sensitive as this one will be.  If it is ultimately dealt with through a proper process in the Oireachtas, at least everybody in here is answerable to the people.  The people can judge their elected representatives on how they speak, advocate and vote on an issue in this House.  On balance, I would be of a view that a complex issue such as this, an issue that is central to how our democratic system works, should be determined by the Oireachtas, and I would put that to the Taoiseach.</p> <p> I take it the Taoiseach is saying it will be six months before it is established.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Martin misjudged the mood a little but I admit that the Deputy said his piece at his party's Ard-Fheis.</p>  <p>  There should be no reason we should not consult with a representative group of people.  The company involved in selecting citizens for the Constitutional Convention was not setting out polls on this.  It was the method by which one would contact ordinary people from all over the country based on geography, age, gender, etc.  The Constitutional Convention had the participation of politicians and citizens and there were claims the politicians would outtalk others and tend to dominate.  This assembly will be citizens' only.  Of course, they will be free to make whatever conclusion or recommendation they wish but it is in here that the eventual decision will have to be made, namely, if a referendum is to be held, in what form and asking what question.  From that point of view, the commitment in the programme for Government is to set up the citizens' assembly within six months.  It will be overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach and I will see that happens.</p>  <p>  I cannot answer Deputy Martin's question on when the first report will come back because the citizens' assembly has not yet even been set up.  However, when its conclusions on this matter come back to the Oireachtas committee, which will engage with experts and whoever, it is its conclusions that will come back in here to a plenary session.</p></speech>

The point is that one engages with ordinary people around the country about an issue that is quite profound and it is in this assembly that Members will have to make their decision.

The key issue is a woman's right to control her own body and the men do not want to face up to that.</p>  <p>  I have been fascinated listening to this discussion.  We hear that the Constitution belongs to the people and it is up to the people to decide what goes into and comes out of that Constitution.  Does it every cross their minds that our bodies belong to us, as women, and that it is up to us to decide what we do with our bodies?  Does that cause some kind of a conflict for them?</p>  <p>  It is interesting that the women on this side of the House, who are pro-choice and who have the most to lose if a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment falls, are the ones who are advocating it the most.  The reason we are advocating it the most is because we have lived most of our adult lives without the right to control our own bodies.  We have lived with sisters, daughters, cousins, friends and all women across society who have been denied that right and very many of whom - in fact, 12 a day - have been forced to leave the State to procure abortions elsewhere.</p>  <p>  People now face the possibility of 14 years in prison for attempting to procure an abortion.  That is what the law passed in this House last year states.  It is draconian and the only way to end it is to move to a situation where the people to whom the Taoiseach refers and to whom the Constitution belongs make the decision.  If the Constitution belongs to the people, then let them decide and give them a choice to have a referendum calling for repeal of the eighth amendment.</p>  <p>  For 33 years of my adult life, I have lived with this amendment to the Constitution, as have other women and, indeed, lots of men in this country who are very dissatisfied with it.  Is it not time, given all the statistics and all the polling, that the Taoiseach just holds the referendum?  The Taoiseach does not have to decide what question is asked other than do people want to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  That is a simple question.  If the people say "No", then we are stuck with that decision.  If the people say "Yes", then there are consequences and we will deal with them.</p>  <p>  I want to put a case to the Taoiseach because he states there are a number of court cases that have looked at this issue and that have come up with various ways of looking at it and nuances to it.  All of those court cases emanated from crises for women - the X case, the Y case and other cases.  All of them emanated from serious crises in women's lives.  If there are to be more crises in women's lives - there will be because of this amendment of the Constitution - how does one deal with, for example, emergency situations?  </p>  <p>  The following is not a facile question, and lots of words have been bandied about here about whether it is facile, traumatic or sensitive.  The Olympic Games will take place in South America this year and the World Health Organization has just ruled that it will not postpone them because of the Zika virus.</p><p>The Brazilian Government is advising the female population of Brazil not to get pregnant.  What does the Taoiseach say to Irish sportswomen, participants and tourists who want to go to Brazil for the Olympic Games?  Do the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, advise them not to get pregnant?  If they get pregnant while in Brazil and are at risk of a deformed foetal abnormality, will they return to Ireland to be told they cannot have medical treatment here?  What advice will the Taoiseach give female participants and spectators in the Olympic Games?  It is very important.  While that amendment remains enshrined in our Constitution, such situations will be repeated and will be continually faced by women in this country, whether they are Irish citizens or not.</p> <p> The citizens' assembly of which the Taoiseach spoke sounds very nice, and he said the people chosen would be gender-balanced and age-balanced.  Who will pick them?  Will it be the Taoiseach, Fine Gael, the Independent Deputies who support the Government and who are against women having the right to choose?  Who will choose the citizens who will make the decision and return to the House with a recommendation?  A real decision can be made only by giving people a vote and putting the referendum to the people.  What is the Taoiseach afraid of?  What are the people who are against the referendum afraid of?  Are they afraid the people might decide, after 33 years, that the amendment is problematic, discriminatory and denies women their basic rights?</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach please answer my specific question on how he will advise our citizens who may attend the Olympic Games in the autumn?</p></speech>

What question does she want to ask them?  They have been asked the question before in respect of suicide as basis on which to narrow the eighth amendment and they rejected it.  There have been other referenda on abortion.  It is perfectly in order to consult with a broad range of people who will not be selected by any party in here or by a polling company, which might say the percentage in the polls is up or down.  They will be selected on the basis of objectively picking men and women in areas around the country on a very professional basis, putting together a citizens' assembly to reflect on this question and all the matters that arise from it.</p>  <p>  This assembly, to which the people have elected party representatives and representatives who do not represent any party, will deal with the question.  We do not have to accept the recommendation of the citizens' assembly, however if we want an analysis of what we might be able to do in respect of the eighth amendment, it must be decided here.  We will have to vote on whether we bring forward a Bill for a referendum.  The people elected must make the decision on a Bill to hold a referendum to ask the people the question or not.  It is not as simple as repealing the eighth amendment of the Constitution, as the Deputy said.  We speak as party leaders, and men, no more than women have an interest in the Constitution.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities, it is women who have to put up with the consequences of it.</p></speech>

The Constitutional Convention worked.  I attended many of its meetings and my only criticism is of the Government's refusal to implement the recommendations the Constitutional Convention made on many issues.  I also do not understand why the Taoiseach has changed the format and decided to exclude politicians from participation.  It was a useful experience and the proceedings were not dominated by any politician.  The people who attended were delighted to be asked to go.  They briefed themselves and were well informed on the issues they were dealing with.  I do not understand why the Taoiseach would change something which worked.  He should spend his time implementing the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention rather than experimenting with some other version of this.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is very clear that the eighth amendment must go.  Sin &eacute;.  It is up to the people to decide.  They must be the arbitrators on the issue and that requires a referendum.  We will all be bound by the outcome of the referendum.  Perhaps our position will not be supported by the majority of citizens.  The only question is when the Taoiseach will have the referendum and give the people their say.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has been here 40 years and was in the D&aacute;il when the eighth amendment was foisted on us.  It should not have been put into the Constitution.  There are issues that should not be in a Constitution.  This is health issue that affects women.  Many other issues are not in the Constitution.  The Taoiseach does not seem to understand that women must make this decision.  Nobody else can do it, given that nobody else will carry the pregnancy to full term, bring up a child, or whatever the circumstances are, whether the woman is too young, too old, does not have enough money or has health reasons.  Nobody else can make the decision but women.  All the Taoiseach is doing with this ban is forcing women to leave the country.  Whether or not abortion is legal makes no difference to the abortion rate.</p>  <p>  I thought I was listening to another party when I heard Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin talking earlier about how he led the movement for gay rights.  There is a strange phenomenon whereby people are boasting about how they championed marriage equality and yet they do not seem to see a contradiction when they suppress women's rights.</p></speech>

I find that really weird.  This is very simple.  The Taoiseach can complicate it all he likes but we need to repeal the eight amendment of the Constitution.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and I have said, what we want is a referendum to remove what should never have been put into the Constitution in the first place and which is now way behind where people are in this regard.  This D&aacute;il would then legislate for the conditions in which abortion would be allowed.</p></speech>

I was making the point that the Constitutional Convention was not responsible for the marriage equality referendum.  Many political parties here were in favour of marriage equality long before the Constitutional Convention had anything to say about it.  The Labour Party was very clear about it.

I put it to the Taoiseach that surely it would make far greater sense to establish a cross-party Oireachtas committee to deal with the issue because, ultimately, as I said earlier, regardless of whatever one's view is or whatever emanates from this, a proposition will have put to the people if that is what people want to do.</p></speech>

How long will he leave women, who want to be able to control their own bodies and have full bodily autonomy over their lives, waiting in this country?  What will be the consequences for them travelling, perhaps, to the Olympics Games or on holidays to areas where they might contract a virus, which would be unusual but which could lead to foetal abnormalities and crises pregnancies?  What is his message to citizens who are women and who want to travel and who may end up with crises pregnancies as a result of that?

I am been informed by both our Whip and party that there has been absolutely no consultation with anybody regarding the restoration of the Bills.  That has been dictated by the Government side alone in terms of what Bills are to be restored.  Given the spirit of the new D&aacute;il and what we are meant to be about, there should be consultation with all of the House as to what is to be prioritised.  The Labour Party has significant issues with the Admission to Schools Bill.  It has been unilaterally decided not to restore it.  That is fair enough if the Minister has his position on that but there should have been consultation on what Bills should be brought back and what ones should not be.  A business committee is about to be formed under D&aacute;il reform.  I would have thought it should have been brought together and that together the Members of the House would determine the priority as to what Bills should be restored and hear arguments as to which ones certain people may not want to have restored.</p></speech>

There has been much talk about ordering business in a different way and the agreement is that we are not going to do it through the old Whip system and that there will be a business committee which will set the agenda for the House.</p><p>There was no consultation with us in regard to what Bills were to be restored.  As a precursor to having the business committee, that would have been the normal issue.  We have tabled an amendment in the name of the Labour Party Whip to restore the school admissions Bill, but there might be other Bills which Deputies have in mind that have already begun the legislative process in the Houses.  It would be useful if prior to the Government Whip simply determining what should be back on the Order Paper, which will probably determine the business for next week, there were some consultation with other parties, as will be the norm when the business committee is extant.</p></speech>

I do not want to have a row about this.

He made that clear to our spokesperson ten minutes ago.  People are entitled to different perspectives on legislation and I do not have an issue with that.  It is legitimate, but we should be very straight up about it.  It should not just disappear off the agenda suddenly.  It was alerted to me about 25 minutes ago that there was an issue around the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  Generally speaking, the D&aacute;il and the business committee should be prioritising what Bills we think are important.  We only have six weeks or so before the summer recess.  It is 1 June now and we may have two months.  Realistically speaking, what Bills are we going to get through in the next two months?  Is it not within the capacity of the Oireachtas to decide three or four Bills that will definitely be progressed before the summer recess and take it after that?</p></speech>

The Minister has said that whatever responses are necessary, we will face down the activities of these ruthless gangs.  Will new moneys be allocated in respect of the announcements made or is the funding to come from within the 2016 allocation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  When can we expect misuse of drugs legislation in respect of the issue of prescription drugs which I have raised consistently over the last two weeks?  What is the timeline for the legislation to reduce the thresholds above which the Criminal Assets Bureau can intervene and take action?  I think it is to go from &euro;7,000 to &euro;1,000.  When can we expect that?</p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to build on North-South co-operation for the benefit of both sides of the Border.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and others have given mixed messages about free movement between North and South in the event that the people of Northern Ireland and Britain vote to exit the European Union.  Can the Taoiseach clarify his understanding of the implications for cross-Border controls and, ultimately, cross-Border co-operation?  Does he agree that if Britain were to exit the European Union, it would have a negative impact on cross-Border economic activity?</p></speech>

An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available on foot of discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the task force on crime will be up and running as soon as possible over the next couple of months.</p>  <p>  In respect of North-South bodies, I would not like to see the return of customs points along the Border in the event that the electorate in Britain were to decide to leave the EU.  However, I would not have any control over that, albeit it would be our wish not to see it happen.  I listened to the managing director of a company based in Monaghan yesterday saying that much of that company's machinery moves through Britain and that this would mean extra paperwork both into Britain and exiting through Britain which would be bureaucratic, inefficient and cost time and money.  Clearly, I have a difference of opinion here with the Secretary of State.  If the decision is to leave, it would be our wish in the subsequent two-year negotiation, which would probably be a preliminary period, to avoid that happening.  However, one does not have control over it in that the attitude of other countries in Europe towards Britain is unknown.  The agreement reached at the European Council on the propositions put forward by Prime Minister David Cameron was done on a one-off basis.  If the electorate in Britain decides to remain as a member state of Europe, those changes become effective immediately.  If they decide to leave the European Union, we are into a complex and long series of difficult negotiations the outcome of which is uncertain.  While I would like to think that we will not end up with border controls and customs points, I find it hard to see how, in that event, one could avoid having some measure of that applying.  It is not something the Government would be in control of.</p></speech>

Potentially, hundreds of council homes may fall victim to this.</p><p>The Government is insisting on Donegal County Council meeting what could be a major bill.  This would impact on the provision of other local services in that disadvantaged county.  Will the Government amend the terms of reference of the expert panel to cover publicly owned property?

Thank you.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise two matters, the first of which relates to the Revised Book of Estimates.  After the announcement of the budget, the Revised Book of Estimates for 2016 was presented to the previous D&aacute;il.  Is there to be a further Revised Book of Estimates or will individual Estimates be prepared?  Obviously, there must be a unified debate in the House on the overall Estimates.  When will the Revised Book of Estimates, if there is to be one, be presented and when will we see the individual departmental Estimates?</p>  <p>  My second question relates to Brexit and the worrying opinion poll findings yesterday that indicated that the margin between staying and leaving might be close.  Given that this issue is of such importance to us, will the Taoiseach consider tabling an all-party motion next week in the House, one that would be signed not only by all of the parties but by all Deputies also, calling on Irish voters and those with Irish connections in the United Kingdom who have an entitlement to vote, as well as UK citizens living in this jurisdiction, to vote in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union and explaining in a debate how that would be in our strategic interests?</p></speech>

Clearly, people in Britain do not like to be lectured by anybody else, no more than we would.  We have been very careful to say that because of our very close association with Britain for many reasons for many years, we have an interest in talking to our own people who live there.  Last weekend I asked and encouraged them to make sure they registered to vote by 7 June and to vote to stay in on 23 June.  I might just reflect on Deputy Brendan Howlin's offer.

It must be renewed before 30 June if the Government wishes to renew it.  I have tabled a motion which is on today's cl&aacute;r calling for its repeal.  On day one when it was introduced in 2009, we were told that we were in a state of emergency and that the Government needed to introduce emergency legislation to reduce public sector workers' pay.  I have just looked up whose was the famous quote, "Never let a good crisis go to waste," but it has been attributed to a few people, including Winston Churchill and Rahm Emanuel, both of whom stated one could do things in a crisis that one would not normally get away with.  One could argue that we were in a crisis in 2009, but the Taoiseach's party has been declaring since the general election that we are now in recovery.  That recovery is being felt by some but not by the majority and certainly not by workers.  The repeal of the FEMPI legislation would mark the beginning of what we believe would be payback for workers.  If we are in recovery, why do we need emergency legislation and why will we continue to penalise public sector workers after 30 June?  The penalties are significant and mean that many of them cannot afford to put a decent roof over their heads during what is an accommodation crisis.  There would be a major payback for the economy were public servants to have their pay restored, as they could spend it in the local economy and begin to generate activity.  It is important to know, therefore, whether the Government intends to extend this emergency and repressive legislation.  If it continues one of its hallmark emergency Acts that is punitive for the public sector while claiming that the economy is in recovery, it does not bode well in seeking to build confidence in the economy.</p></speech>

The programme for Government is very clear.  It states:</p><blockquote>We will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  We will support the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</blockquote><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this is already under way.  It is an orderly, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation.  I remind the Deputy that, because of careful and prudent management of the economy and not without difficulty, the unemployment figure yesterday was 7.8%, down from just over 15% five years ago, which represents a very significant improvement, but we need to do more.  Obviously, as resources come into the economy, one can spend and divert them into areas of disadvantage.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council has to put together a master plan.  The question the Deputy raises in respect of the anxieties or concerns people might have is for the city council to deal with in the context of the management plan.  Obviously, the Government has made its decision.  This is seen as a very strategic development that will improve the opportunities for business and the provision of accommodation, as well as life opportunities for people.</p><p>The city council will deal with both the strategic plan and the concerns mentioned by the Deputy.</p> <p> In respect of school transport, obviously a report has indicated a review is to be conducted in the next school year in regard to implementation, if applicable, in the following academic year.  People will say that just because there is a review does not necessarily mean certain outcomes.  School transport has been an essential part of the education system since its introduction back in the 1960s.  Clearly, the Minister will be careful in his review so students will continue to have the opportunity to travel to school and receive a proper education.  It is for some time in the future.</p></speech>

Large payments of VAT and other taxes due to the principal contractors whom the subcontractors work for are being delayed, in many cases for long periods, by the Revenue Commissioners.  The delay is rumoured to be caused by a shortage of staff in the Revenue departments.  This is causing a vicious circle whereby the smaller operator at the end of the line is waiting too long for his &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 to pay wages to staff or make other payments.  Such people cannot survive and are going under.</p>  <p>  New regulations from June 2015 mean that subcontractors cannot be paid until the principal contractor logs the details with the Revenue Commissioners.  How can one log in, in rural Kerry or other rural areas, when one has nothing to log in to?  There is no broadband available there.</p></speech>

Last week, the HSE indicated to pharmacists that it would no longer fund a drug called Camcolit.  This drug prevents manic episodes and it is a mood stabiliser for people suffering from bipolar disorder.  It arrests aggressive and self-harming incidents.  The HSE has recommended an alternative drug called Priadel, which it says is interchangeable.  However, eminent psychiatrist Dr. John Hillery stated it is not interchangeable due to the pharmacokinetic differences in the drugs.  This is a reference to how the body deals with, absorbs and releases the drug.</p></speech>

The message I heard loudly and clearly in my role is to put the benefits of economic success to work for people to deliver the services that matter to them.  However, the people also gave us the challenge of finding a new way of working together and responding to this challenge presents an historic opportunity.</p><p>The new D&aacute;il is diverse but need not be divided.  Together we can achieve one thing that has never happened in health policy, namely, a long-term consensus on its fundamental principles.  I am excited about this and grateful to everyone who has agreed to this motion.  I acknowledge, in particular, the role of Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall in liaising with me on the motion on behalf of the Opposition.  Opposition Members presented a motion on this issue and we worked together to arrive at this hybrid motion, if one likes.  </p><p>While members of the public and the people who work so hard in our health service have no lack of appetite for reform, they are certainly fatigued by piecemeal reforms that do not really change anything and the shifting priorities that often come with political change.  The work of the new committee will mean members of the public and those working in the service can have a sense of certainty that there is a long-term strategy agreed by political consensus and, I hope, societal consensus that will not change no matter what the make-up of the next D&aacute;il.</p><p>We all know the health service faces many challenges.  Moreover, the programme for partnership Government acknowledges that we have an ageing population who are living longer and whose needs will become greater and more diverse.  We also have the highest birth rate in Europe.  As citizens, all of us at some point in our lives will need to access health services.  Therefore, we have a common interest in finding a common way forward for improving and developing our health services.</p><p>The Government comes to this motion with a clear objective in sight.  As set out in the programme for partnership Government, the Government is committed to the goal of universal health care, a concept endorsed by the World Health Organization, United Nations, OECD and European Union.  As an overall goal to improve our health services, universal health care involves four main objectives, as set out by the WHO, namely, reducing unmet health needs; reducing inequalities in access to health goods and services; improving service quality; and improving financial protection, which means patients must not face catastrophic or impoverishing levels of health spending as a result of seeking health care.</p><p>The World Health Organization notes that no country fully achieves all the universal health coverage objectives for 100% of the population, 100% of the services available and 100% of the cost, without waiting lists.  However, it believes that every country can improve efficiency, reduce waste and increase value from its health spend.  By doing so, we can advance the cause of universal health care.</p><p>In striving for the optimal single tier health service for Ireland, there are inevitable policy trade-offs to be confronted.  These trade-offs often involve tensions between efficiency and equity or between comprehensiveness and cost control.  In all countries, not only Ireland, the trade-offs centre on three basic dimensions of the health service which must be confronted when designing a health service.  These are the proportion of the population to be covered, the range of services to be covered and the proportion of the total costs to be met.</p><p>We also know there are factors outside of the health service which affect universal health care, including housing, employment and education.  This requires a whole-of-Govemment, health in all policies approach and this is echoed in the Healthy Ireland framework.  There are, therefore, tough policy choices, trade-offs and decisions to be made, especially in terms of managing resources, addressing performance and ensuring accountability.</p><p>The previous programme for Government, 2011-16, committed to a major programme of health reform, the aim of which was to deliver universal health care, with access to quality services based on need and not ability to pay.  In April 2014, the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance, UHI, was published.  It proposed a competitive, multi-payer model of universal health insurance as the means to achieve universal health care.</p><p>Having reviewed the results from the UHI costing project, it was concluded that the high costs associated with the White Paper model of UHI were not acceptable and further research and cost modelling were needed before definitive conclusions could be drawn on the best means to achieve universal health care.  This is the current position and whatever approach we adopt, there is a need for consensus on the direction of health policy.  The new committee offers a great opportunity to try to achieve this consensus.</p><p>One of most important features of any country's health service is how it is funded, both in terms of the amount of money required and the manner in which it is financed.  These are difficult questions to answer and will clearly be central to the deliberations of the all-party committee.  Making changes to funding levels and financing methods takes time and requires careful management, not least to avoid disruption to what are vital existing services.  That is one reason it is important to take a long-term view of how the health service can be developed.</p><p>The 2016 health budget is &euro;13.1 billion and increases in the health budget have been possible in the previous two budgets.</p><p>It is the Government's intention to work with the Oireachtas to sustain these annual increases going forward, basing health expenditure on multi-year budgeting supported by a five year health service plan.</p> <p> One aspect of the motion we can all support is the need for a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care and the effective delivery of primary care in every community.  The more intervention we can have for patients at the earliest possible stage and as close to home as possible, the more likely there will be a better outcome for patients.  To do this, it will be necessary to build up GP capacity to respond to patient's needs and the expansion of chronic disease management in general practice.  We will continue to support the provision of mental health and disability services within the community where appropriate.  Developing primary care services and integrating primary and secondary care services is a vital component in any strategy to address the issues facing our hospitals, in particular emergency departments.  In developing models of person centred, co-ordinated care, we can draw on the work of the national clinical programmes, in particular the piloted integrated care programmes.</p> <p> While the new committee will have many health service challenges and difficulties to examine, which should not be underestimated, we should also acknowledge that the health service has been changing and it would be wrong not to acknowledge where success has happened.  For example, we have seen life expectancy in Ireland increase by two and a half years since 2004 to where it is now above the EU average.  We have seen mortality rates for circulatory system and respiratory diseases fall, an improvement in cancer care, a reduction in the in-hospital mortality rate following admission with a heart attack, a decrease in the average length of stay in hospitals and significant progress in reducing tobacco consumption.  Progress has been made in many health areas and it is important to recognise that progress along with recognising those who work so hard at the front line.</p> <p> There is much more to do, particularly in regard to prevention and integrated care.  However, there are important changes already under way on which we can build.  Universal health care is not just something to implement but is a direction and a journey.  Ultimately, how far and how fast we proceed in the direction of universal health care is a question of choices and how we make them.  I pledge my full support as Minister, and that of the Government, to assisting the committee in any way we can.  I passionately believe that if we can arrive at a political and societal consensus about our direction of travel for a universal public health service, we can provide a degree of certainty to citizens, patients and those who work on the front line.  I look forward to working with people on this.</p></speech>

We talk about universality and access to health care as a right and entitlement but we must acknowledge that the State's capacity to fund that creates difficulties in regard to achieving that goal and ambition. </p>  <p>  Previously, rather than talk about the delivery of health care, we have talked about structural reforms.  Our constant obsession with structural reforms, without knowing clearly and definitively what direction we intend to go, has undermined confidence and morale among those who provide health care services across the country and has sapped the ability of the organisation meant to deliver health care.  If we are committed to a public health service, we need a public service that can deliver health care.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to a national public health system.  Currently, the HSE has responsibility for delivering health care and while there have been many challenges in regard to its ability to manage and deliver health care, we must acknowledge that even if we change the name or structure, we will still require a national organisation to deliver health care.  I hope that following the discussions and deliberations of this committee, we will be able to come to a political arrangement as to what direction we intend to go in terms of delivery of health care.  I hope that once we have reached that consensus, regardless of political outcomes after general elections, there will be a single pathway towards our goal.</p>  <p>  We must acknowledge the huge demographic pressures beginning to build in this country.  I do not believe we are adequately prepared for these.  The demographics show there will be a major increase in the number of people over 65, 75 and 85 in the next ten to 15 years.  We must put clear strategies in place now to ensure we have the capacity, both in terms of physical infrastructure and clinical delivery, to cope with this in the years ahead.  To date, we have been unable to consider how to put these structures in place.  We talk about the issues but we have been unable to deliver.  Take for example our deliberations on primary care.  We have had a primary care strategy for more than ten years but as far back as 1988, when then Minister, Rory O'Hanlon, took on the health portfolio, he spoke about five key principles in the delivery of health care.  The overriding import of what he said then was the importance of primary care.  We have travelled a long way since then in terms of time but our primary and community care structures are not fit for purpose in terms of the delivery of modern, 21st century health care, medical and clinical outcomes.  We must accept that is the case.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the committee will discuss a ten year strategy and blueprint for how we will deliver health care.  This is an ambitious undertaking as we have provided just a six month timeframe to meet all the stakeholders and come up with an interim report on the direction.  The issue of how we will fund our health care service in the future will certainly arise.  Currently, half of our population has private health care.  Private health care and people who take out private health insurance make a significant contribution in the sense that they lighten the obligation of the State in regard to providing health care.  Without private health insurance, if those now willing to pay for health care were all dependent on the public health system as it stands, the system would collapse.  We must be honest and acknowledge that the public health system as it stands does not have the capacity to deliver health care for all 4.6 million citizens.</p>  <p>  We need to talk about a sustainable health service.  We should remove ourselves from ideological debate on the type of health service the various political parties and individuals want and focus on developing a clear pathway to universal health access and ensuring funding is put in place to provide that.  Currently, the State does not have the financial wherewithal to deliver on this immediately, so we need a stepping stone process.  Take for example the roll-out of free GP care.  We debated this issue on many occasions in the previous D&aacute;il.  I am not opposed to the concept of universal, free access to GPs.  However, we are going about it the wrong way if we prioritise one cohort over another and disadvantage those who most need health care in the stepping stone process towards that.  The rolling-out of free GP access should be based first on those in greatest need and means tested to the point where by some stage in the future, everybody will have free access to GP services.</p>  <p>  In talking about the capacity of primary care, we cannot expect a service to provide the best clinical outcomes when it is completely overwhelmed and incapable of delivering the care we wish to ensure.  We have talked about moving the focus from the acute hospital setting to primary and community care but at the same time, we have not bolstered the capacity of personnel and infrastructure in these areas to ensure we have proper primary and community care services that will lighten the burden on acute hospitals.  Day in, day out people are referred by GPs to acute hospitals throughout the State because they cannot access diagnostics in the normal course of events.  People are consistently referred to emergency departments for X-rays, radiography services and other diagnostics.  There must be another way to access diagnostics rather than through the acute hospital setting.</p>  <p>  We have talked about the grand plans of hospital groups and this Government has focused on hospital trusts, something we have major concerns about.  However, the practical changes we could make over the next number of months, which should not be too costly, could make a huge difference in regard to the capacity of the acute hospitals to deal with the issues they should be dealing with and the capacity of the primary and community care units to deal with issues they should be dealing with.</p><p>I hope the committee will not get caught up on addressing a strategy that has a ten-year outlook without first acknowledging that, in the meantime, we could make key structural changes, such as access to GP services for diagnostics without referral through the emergency departments.  We should enhance the services as this is the best way to deliver health care in the years ahead. </p> <p> I have been thinking about the fiscal rules for some time.  A focus on preventative care will require front-loaded investment but there are fiscal rules relating to budget deficits and I believe there should be some discussion with the European Union with a view to showing that by front-loading investment in preventative medicine we will produce cost savings in the years thereafter.  Within the strict budgetary parameters it will be difficult for any state to invest in preventative care without running huge surpluses.  With investment in education programmes about lifestyle changes to address areas such as diabetes, obesity, cardiac problems, COPD and many others, we can create huge savings, both financially and in human terms, in the coming years.  We have to look at this if we want to strategically invest in a preventative health care programme.  We have spoken about health and well-being as constituting the new emphasis of how we deliver health care.  In this context preventative medicine, while it comes with a front-loaded cost, does create potential savings.</p> <p> Mental health has been described as the "Cinderella" of our health services for many years.  We have to be honest with ourselves and question how much of A Vision for Change has been achieved.  We have to admit that we have not grasped the issue of mental health and well-being in society in any serious or meaningful way.  There are significant challenges in the area and the committee should also focus on them.  </p> <p> The other key area where society and policy makers have failed in the past few years is disability, especially in the case of getting people with disabilities into the workplace.  Even during the Celtic tiger era when we had 4% unemployment we failed to move these people into the workplace.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Shortall for her initiative in this area, which has been somewhat overlooked in some of the press statements, particularly those coming from the Government.  I acknowledge her efforts to bring all parties together.</p>  <p>  Everyone wants an efficient, fair and humane health service.  Politicians from every political party and none have called for this in every single election since the inception of this State.  However, what we have is a two-tier system in which individuals and families face years, if not months, of waiting for treatment or diagnosis.  Trolley numbers have spiked and it is only a few years since Senator James Reilly, the former Minister for Health, told us we would never again see 569 patients on trolleys.  The words were only just out of his mouth when the target was breached.  Waiting lists stretch into years and medical staff, nurses and health professionals trained at home are leaving in droves due to poor working conditions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to mental health services as the "Cinderella" of the health system but this is not a pantomime, it is very real.  The people who depend on the mental health services and the men and women who deliver them have reached breaking point.  Our health system is in a state of perpetual crisis.  We all know people who have been let down and failed by the two-tier health system.  We know people who cannot afford health insurance but have borrowed money to avail of private health care because they cannot bear to wait for as long as they are expected to.  We know people who can neither afford insurance nor borrow for health care and who have to wait in pain and in fear.  We have seen public patients with late diagnosis die where private patients survive.  The tragic part of this is we know that this is now the rule in the Irish health system and not the exception.</p>  <p>  This crisis can be boiled down to two key failings on the part of successive Governments.  First, is a fundamental inequality in how patients are treated, differentiated on ability to pay and geography.  Second, is the sheer incapacity of the system to deal with demographic pressures, evidenced particularly in our emergency departments and in maternity care.  No two patients are identical.  However, some pay more than others for the same care.  Families in one part of the country get access to necessary services denied to those in a different HSE region.  The less well off die younger and live less healthy lives.  This is not acceptable.  Inability to pay should not deny anyone the opportunity to lead a full, long, healthy life.  We need to increase investment in the health system, not simply to provide more resources and capacity but to directly challenge and eliminate these structural inequalities.  Building adequate capacity across our health system and eliminating the unequal barriers to access will require significant and sustained public investment.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care, accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation.</p>  <p>  The task we face in the coming period will not be an easy one.  The clock counts down from the moment of our first meeting and we only have six months to present a report, which is to be discussed in this House.  Politicians have never been able to agree on health across the decades.  If the members of the committee can agree a strategy in six months it will be a miracle but we in Sinn F&eacute;in will work hard to ensure that the committee does its work efficiently and in a spirit of co-operation.  The internal dynamics of the committee and the work it does are only one part of the puzzle.  What happens after we discuss the report?  What happens to the report, its recommendations, the stakeholder input, the expert opinions and evidence, and the possible funding models?</p>  <p>  It was said that many Ministers for Health commissioned so many reports that one could paper the inside and outside of Leinster House with them and we do not need another report.  We do not need another photo opportunity, another trip to the plinth to talk to journalists.  My concern with this process is that the report, the recommendations, the expert opinion, potential models and stakeholder engagement will all be discarded if they are seen to run contrary to the Government's policy.  Can the Minister assure us that this will not be a futile exercise in that regard?  Are we tying up members, stakeholders, academics and others into a process that will just consign the report to a library afterwards?</p>  <p>  There are very large parts of the programme for Government to which Sinn F&eacute;in cannot sign up.  I will not sign up to an agenda for privatisation, whether it be outright or through the back door.  This is completely at odds with the realisation of a universal health care system.  If the Minister is serious about this committee coming together to work collectively on a vision for the health service, we must be clear that any moves to privatise the health service in the form suggested by the programme for Government need to be shelved.  The committee cannot gain legitimacy and respect, or develop a comprehensive programme of work, if it is precluded from its work by contrary plans pursued by the Minister at the outset.  It is important the Minister make a full statement on this matter.  </p>  <p>  This issue will not be easily addressed within the six-month timeframe.  Many factors need to be considered, including the demographic profile of the population and its geographical spread, demand and what constitutes health spending.  When we talk about prevention and early intervention, we must be cognisant that this will impinge upon other Departments, and that there needs to be a whole-of-Government approach.</p><p>It is not clear how the ten year plan will work with other Departments.  There are broader social issues at play.  Will the Minister of State convene a ministerial committee to reflect on the work being done by the health committee?  Will other Departments be involved?  We will propose that the Minister for Health in the North, Ms Michelle O'Neill, be invited to discuss adopting an all-island approach to health care delivery.  I strongly suggest this be done.</p></speech>

I have met many stakeholders since my appointment as health spokesperson and there is one common thread - people talk consistently about the need for prevention.  It is welcome that the motion mentions prevention, early intervention, self-management and primary care.  It seems that across the service this is where we are falling down.  Too often we allow situations to reach crisis point, leaving personnel fire-fighting and doing nothing more.  We take our eyes off the bigger picture in terms of policy-making and budgetary processes.  In the race to reach fiscal targets or as the HSE struggles to stay within budget, we long-finger important interventions and initiatives that could prevent crises from occurring in the future.  It is easy to leave the health problems of the future to the politicians and decision makers of the future, but the committee should transcend that thinking.  We need to spend mention on preventive care services and it is not just a case of throwing money at initiatives.  How does one prevent children from needing multiple extractions under a general anaesthetic, given that they cannot access dental services while at school?  How does one ensure timely discharge from hospital in the absence of proper community rehabilitation services, sufficient home care supports or access to therapies?  In that context, it is welcome that we are discussing this motion.  I welcome the establishment of the committee.   </p>  <p>  As a package of reforms, including the establishment of a committee on the budgetary process, there is the potential to frame a new dialogue, but there needs to be a blueprint and a plan.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will not be just an exercise in electoral platitudes or photo opportunities.  I will play my part on it and will be advocating strongly for acess to health care as a right.  The model of universal health care Sinn F&eacute;in is working to achieve includes general practitioner and other primary care services.  Quality of care is essential and must be at the heart of the service.  Such a new comprehensive system will not be achieved over night, but a start must be made.  That requires political will and a fundamental change in the direction of policy, away from the piecemeal, inequitable, semi-privatised and crisis management approach that has perpetuated the many problems in the health service.  How this debate will be framed, how we move beyond the dominant political ideology of recent years which has seen public services starved of funding, how we report, present and act will be the litmus test of the success of this parliamentary exercise.  We need to be honest with ourselves.  When agency staff cost more than the staff directly employed, regardless of whether we have an ideological bent towards the market and market forces, we need to be able to say the use of direct labour is right, more efficient, cheaper and represents better value for money for the taxpayer.  It is not good enough to say a hospital can recruit if it has the money.  If it does not have the money, a moratorium is effectively in place in the health service.  That is happening and needs to be addressed. </p>  <p>  Six months from now the real work will begin.  The committee will deliver a vision for the health service.  Delivering on it will be the biggest task facing the Department, the Minister and future Governments.  Many people are depending on us.  We cannot let them down and should not sell them short.</p></speech>

I add my congratulations to those of others to the two Ministers and acknowledge Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall's singular vision in creating the motion.  We are in positive mode in relation to the potential of the committee and will engage productively with it.  I welcome the tone of the Minister's speech in that there appears to be a genuine willingness to engage with all parties and all Members in this D&aacute;il in seeking a meeting of minds on how we can figure out and instigate a proper vision for the provision of health care into the future.  If we are honest, we can reasonably assume that there is much common ground between us on the needs of citizens.  There has to be a particular focus on the continuum of care as between primary, secondary and tertiary care.  </p>  <p>  The one question I have on the creation of the committee is how it will dovetail with the commitments in the programme for Government.  Will it be a tool of Government policy into the future or what mandate will it have if it comes up with a set of recommendations that do not tally with the commitments in the programme for Government, of which there are many?  Given that approximately &euro;13 billion is to be spent this year alone in the health sector and considering the many commitments made in the programme for Government from primary care through to secondary and tertiary care, including mental health, the issue of resources will have to be addressed within the remit of the committee.  If we are to aspire to having a comprehensive continuum of care between primary, secondary and tertiary care, including community care and mental health service provision, it will cost a good deal of money and clear choices will have to be made.  To be fair to him, the Minister mentioned this in his contribution when he referred to the trade-offs between efficiency and equity and comprehensiveness and cost control.  This is something that will merit further interrogation.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the document Better Health because it provides a good template and sets out the parameters within which we are operating.  Some of the challenges in health care provision include the fact that the number of people aged over 85 years in Ireland is, according to CSO estimates, increasing by approximately 3.3% each year.  This presents a major challenge for all of us in the management of demographics.  Some 38% of Irish people over the age of 50 years suffer from one chronic disease.  Chronic diseases account for 80% of all GP visits, 40% of hospital admissions and 75% of hospital bed days.  </p>  <p>  The Minister speaks strongly about focusing on primary care and trying to intervene as much as possible at that level.  That is something on which we all agree.  The aim of such a policy should seek to ensure people are kept out of tertiary care facilities for as long as possible and that interventions are made at community level.  That would have a major impact in patient care and would also create the ability to reduce costs and be more efficient in the use of resources.  On the flipside, it would require a massive injection of capital into the primary care system.  If we are to manage the demographic challenges and the ongoing challenges in chronic care services, as I have outlined, in that paradigm primary care facilities will need resources.</p><p> Speaking as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, the last Government created a health innovation hub.  We created a demonstrator model whereby we sought to utilise the best research that exists from a geographical perspective in terms of medical devices and services.  We sought to inculcate the thinking that exists based on the research that is ongoing within our academic institutions as a means of seeking to ensure those greater efficiencies.  I am not sure where the health innovation hub stands at present now that there is a new Government formed.  However, I believe that innovation and engagement with stakeholders in the academic space is going to be vital.  We will need a proper analysis of population figures and a sense of inculcating some of the thinking that exists within academic institutions to determine how we are going to provide the vision that is necessary.</p> <p> I believe that the primary care centres are one mechanism by which we could link up with academic institutions to try to drive innovation and to ensure, as Deputy Kelleher stated earlier, that more diagnostics take place within the primary care settings so as to prevent people from presenting to secondary and tertiary care facilities and to keep them at home for longer.  The data that is used can then be analysed and partnered with medical device companies, innovators in the health care provision space or academics to try to analyse the data so that we can then produce policy outcomes that deliver the efficiencies that are necessary for the system.  We need more of that within the system.  It is a case of mainstreaming that into the system because currently it is peripheral.</p> <p> We need to have a greater interrogation of the relationship between the HSE and the Department of Health.  There is still some siloed thinking in how the HSE, this House, the Department of Health and the Minister interact.  We need a greater interrogation of that relationship to ensure that there is more transparency around it.  We also need to look at why there is a constant need for a Supplementary Estimate on an ongoing basis.  I say that objectively.  Taking this year for example, if there is provision made at the start of the year for &euro;13 billion, will this committee have a remit to examine and interrogate the deployment of resources more closely?  We need to look at it in terms of seeking efficiencies for the system in order that the citizen can have confidence that he or she will have access to the services that are necessary, whether he or she presents to a GP, a secondary care facility or a tertiary care facility.</p> <p> We need to look at the whole issue of health insurance and we need to talk to the health insurance providers.  We need to look at why there is spare capacity within secondary care facilities, such as Mallow or Ennis, where more elective surgery could be done.  We could take much of the constraints that are in hospitals such as Cork University Hospital and radiate more services out to secondary care facilities.  With regard to mental health, we need to have a proper discussion on how A Vision for Change is implemented and resourced.</p></speech>

I know Deputies have complimented the Minister for Health and I really would like to be positive, but I despair of such statements as "Universal health care is not just something to implement but is a direction and a journey".  It is not a journey or a direction.  It is a basic human right to have public health.  It is a basic human right to walk into a hospital and be treated with dignity and respect and not be sitting on a trolley for three or four days.  Even on an economic basis, it is nonsense to make elderly people sit on trolleys.  The research clearly points out that somebody over the age of 70 who is on a trolley for two days will inevitably spend a longer period of time in hospital and will therefore cost more.  Even on an economic level, we have no choice but to do something about our creaking health system.</p>  <p>  I have had the privilege in a long career in local politics of sitting on the regional health forum along with 39 other dedicated councillors from Donegal down to Tipperary.  I am more than familiar with the health service and its inadequacies.  Deputies could come in here in every debate and point out the long waiting lists.  I can tell the House that they are extraordinarily long in Galway.  At any given time, we have up to 30,000 patients on an outpatient waiting list waiting for basic health services.  On inpatient lists, the figure varies from 5,000 to 9,000.  One has to ask why our health service is creaking at the seams.  Why are we in the position of establishing a committee consequent on many reports up to now, yet we are still in trouble with our health system?</p>  <p>  I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Shortall for her initiative.  I have no difficulty in supporting the initiative with regard to the committee.  However, I have some concerns with the direction that the committee might take in spending time looking at models of funding for a health service rather than making the health service accountable and available to all our people.  In contrast to the Minister, I do not think funding is difficult at all.  Funding for our health service comes from our taxes.  When I knocked on doors, I did not meet a single person who wanted their taxes reduced.  They wanted a health service.  I do not know why we need to go down the route of looking at funding.  I hope that the committee will look at how to make the health service available as quickly as possible.  I hope it will listen to the people on the frontline, the nurses who have never been listened to, the cleaners, the porters and then the consultants on how to improve our health service.</p>  <p>  If I analyse what has happened in my time as a councillor on the regional health forum, there were cutbacks in 2006 during the height of the Celtic tiger.  Only the language was different.  The Government of 2006 talked about bed refurbishment measures to justify bed and ward closures in Merlin Park University Hospital and the regional hospital.  It talked about cost containment measures.</p>  <p>  We had many failed initiatives.  I despair when Fianna F&aacute;il champions the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  In my time, we have had at least four failed initiatives without any analysis of the fundamental problems.  We had the co-location of private hospitals on public lands led by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney.  It took all of our effort in Galway to fight that appalling initiative to co-locate a private hospital on public lands.  We then had the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which in effect channelled public money into private hospitals to keep the private for-profit hospitals making a profit while, at the same time, depleting our public health system.  On top of that, we had a special man in Galway for three years on a special salary to deliver the special delivery unit.  Again, that channelled public money into private hospitals, allowing waiting lists to build up and then paying public money to treat public patients in a private for-profit hospital.</p>  <p>  I apologise if I am parochial in speaking about Galway, but it is the microcosm of what is happening in the country.  Only last Friday, there was an announcement that two DEXA scanners were closed.  These are vital pieces of diagnostic equipment in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.  They were closed because there was no staff.  We had professors speaking out against it and we had the embarrassment of hosting a conference in Galway on that very topic when we could not use the DEXA scanners.</p><p>I have heard indirectly that some effort was made and that one of the scanners has opened again.  However, the fundamental problem in regard to lack of staff has gone unanswered.  While the Minister tells us there is no embargo, and in any speech he appeals to the HSE to employ further staff, we have the HSE making a statement that it cannot employ any staff until three leave, when one can come in.</p> <p> We go from crisis to crisis.  Again last week I put down a question in regard to a new public hospital in Galway.  I did not do this off my own bat but because the clinical director of the hospital in Galway, which serves the region, has said a new hospital is absolutely necessary and that we must begin planning for it.  Under the new politics and in the new atmosphere prevailing in the D&aacute;il, I tabled a question asking, in view of the clinical director's statement, what steps the Minister intended to take.  What I got back was Civil Service-speak, although, again, I place no blame on the civil servants.  The Minister is paid a very good salary to deal with the questions put.  He neatly sidestepped that question and continued on with the old politics in the guise of the new politics.  I find that unacceptable.  I am sorry he is not present in the House.  I thought he would have addressed the serious issue of the lack of capacity in Galway, which is the top risk factor.  It was a very serious statement in that the clinical director said the congested site in Galway is simply fire-fighting with each additional building.  I listed the buildings involved and he acknowledged the hospital is simply fire-fighting.  It is past time to plan for a hospital at Merlin Park, where there is 150 acres of land.</p> <p> There are very good consultants in the health service.  As he did not ask for his name to remain confidential, I am going to quote one of them, Dr. Peter O'Rourke from Donegal.  He took the trouble of writing a two-page letter to all Deputies and he then gave us a document highlighting how practical solutions can be used pending the decision of the committee.  That has not been mentioned by the Minister, who received a copy of the letter, as did all Fine Gael Deputies.  Dr. O'Rourke makes very practical suggestions in regard to medical day units, five-day wards, diagnostic services and access to simple X-rays.  If these measures were implemented, it would reduce the situation pertaining in Galway and in every other hospital throughout the country.</p> <p> I will speak later on the issue of mental health.  In Galway, every month 300 patients, including patients suffering from mental health problems, simply leave accident and emergency because they will not be seen.  They walk out, lacking the patience to wait.  Nobody could have the patience to wait the length of time they have to wait in Galway, notwithstanding the best efforts of the staff.  On a monthly basis, 300 people walk out of accident and emergency because no service is available.</p> <p> On top of that, people with mental health problems are trying to access a congested site and an overworked department of psychiatry by going through accident and emergency.  We need to ask ourselves a question.  Which of us would like to do that?  It is okay to make fine speeches in the D&aacute;il but which Deputy would like it if they, or their wives or children, were suffering mental health problems and had to go through a packed accident and emergency department?  Which Deputy here today has spent time on a trolley?  I have not.  That would guide the direction of the conversation and the urgency of recognising that universal health care is a right - not a journey, not a decision, but a right.  I will happily work with the committee if it is considering implementing that right as a matter of urgency, dealing in a practical way with the problems and listening to the people who know best.</p></speech>

It stated:</p><blockquote>Your new National Health Service begins on 5th July.  What is it?  How do you get it?  It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care.  Everyone &ndash; rich or poor, man, woman or child - can use it or any part of it.  There are no charges, except for a few special items.  There are no insurance qualifications.  But it is not a &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  You are all paying for it, mainly as tax payers, and it will relieve your money worries in time of illness.</blockquote><p>The National Health Service was introduced in Britain by a Labour Government, very different to the Labour Party of today, responding to pressure from a working-class majority population, determined after the Second World War never to go back to the poverty of the 1930s.  Today, nearly 70 years after the introduction of the British NHS, the Irish capitalist State has failed to introduce anything that might compare with it.  Here, with a health service which prioritises treatment for those who can pay and which dumps thousands of patients on trolleys in overcrowded emergency departments each winter, the State struggles to even provide free GP care for all of its under-sixes.</p><p>In what direction does the Fine Gael Government now aim to take the nation's health services?  The programme for Government tells a tale.  First it will seek to progressively dismantle the HSE.  Second, it will seek to establish hospital trusts with stand-alone finances and third, it will open the door to private finance for sections of hospitals and to outsourcing to private companies.  In other words, it is a programme of creeping privatisation and the continuation of neoliberal policies in the Irish health services.</p><p>The Minister praises the idea of a ten-year plan but if it is to be a ten-year plan going down the Fine Gael road that would be a disaster.  On the other hand, if it was a ten-year plan which started by breaking with the current health care model, quickly establishing an Irish national health service, and then strengthening it progressively through the years, that would be something very different.  In concrete terms, what would that mean?  It would mean the State becoming the provider of the health care needs of all.  This would be funded from a pool provided by the taxpayer within the framework of a progressive taxation system.  There would be free GP care for all, free dental care for all, free access to good mental health services for all, free operations and hospital care, and free prescriptions at the pharmacy.  In other words, there would be genuine universal health care, free at the point of use.</p><p>The Minister charged with overseeing the introduction of the NHS in Britain, Nye Bevan, said:</p><blockquote>The National Health Service had two main principles underlying it: one, that the medical arts of science and of healing should be made available to people ... irrespective of whether they could afford to pay for them or not [and] the second was that this should be done not at the expense of the poorer members of the community but the well-to-do.</blockquote><p>That is the way it should be done here.  The introduction of a 2% millionaire's tax would raise &euro;2.7 billion, enough to reverse all of the health cuts of recent years; a 10% increase in the effective rate of income tax paid by the top 10% of earners would raise the same amount again; and to cut corporate welfare by just 10% would raise another &euro;1.5 billion.  That would provide nearly &euro;7 billion with which to kick-start an Irish national health service.</p><p>The Institute of Obstetricians has recently expressed concern that the National Maternity Hospital will be governed by St. Vincent's Hospital when it transfers to the St. Vincent Hospital's campus.  St. Vincent's is owned by the Religious Sisters of Charity, there are nuns of the board of directors and doctors must sign contracts promising to adhere to the religious ethos of the hospital.  For example, St. Vincent's prohibits female sterilisation as it conflicts with that religious ethos.  This is a disgrace in a modern health service in a modern state in the year 2016.  Hospitals funded by the taxpayers must be owned, controlled and run by the people, in other words they must be State-owned and democratically controlled.</p><p>Hospitals funded by the taxpayer should not be run by religious orders.  We are for a national health service in this country but this can only work in the context of a genuine separation of church and State.</p></speech>

The perpetual crisis of our health system mirrors the glaring inequalities of society in Ireland today.  According to public health experts, health outcomes and our general well being are deeply affected by inequality in income and inequality in access to health services.  Access to health care when needed is a fundamental human right.  From the moment we are born, in the course of life's challenges, somewhere along the way we will all need a health system that takes cares of us at our time of need.  The Department of Health has been compared to Angola but even Angola managed to dig up its landmines and find a peace settlement to resolve the bitter civil conflict that ravaged that country.</p>  <p>  The recent report by the Irish Cancer Society that waiting times for life-saving tests for cancer patients are up to 25 times longer for public patients than for those paying privately is distressing and shocking.  The report highlighted striking differences between access for public patients and private patients, with GPs reporting that some public patients have to wait up to 480 days for an ultrasound.  That means waiting for well over a year for a cancer investigation.  The report also quoted an Irish College of General Practitioners report that delays in accessing diagnostics force many patients to pay for scans and tests privately to secure diagnosis and as a result, a patient's ability to pay is linked to his or her ability to access diagnostics used to detect cancer in a timely manner.  The report gets to the heart of what is wrong with our health system.</p>  <p>  I would go even further and state that this way of dealing with cancer patients amounts to negligence and a violation of a basic human right to health care.  In its crudest form, those with the ability to pay can skip the queue and access early intervention for cancer and a better life outcome.  Health care should not be about queueing for years.  It should not be about how big a person's wallet is.  It should be about the delivery of universal health care that is not based on someone's ability to pay or any discrimination based on income or social class.  If it was any other form of discrimination, such as based on ethnicity or sexual orientation, this health system loophole would have been quite rightly closed down by now.  It is no coincidence that successive right-wing Governments, led by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael, have created a two-tier health system.  Both parties have applied the logic of the market to water, housing, transport and health.  For them profit always comes first even if, such as in the tragic death of Susie Long, patients die waiting.</p>  <p>  Another example of Government failure in early intervention in our health service is waiting times for children with special needs.  According to the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled a number of weeks ago, the average waiting time in Dublin Mid-West for a speech and language therapist is 12 to 18 months and for an occupational therapist it is 18 months to two years.  These waiting times are only for assessment and do not include the further wait for treatment.  This is clearly unacceptable.  Children cannot be routinely expected to wait more than half their lives for intervention that needs to be made as early as possible.</p>  <p>  Inclusion Ireland has stated that Ireland is in breach of the recommended number of children who should be assigned to each speech and language therapist.  It commented that the recommended caseload size is 30 to 65 children per therapist but in Ireland the national average is an unbelievable 162 children per therapist.  To meet international standards, the number of speech and language therapists working in children's disability services would have to be tripled from its current level of 283 speech and language therapists to 800.  Inclusion Ireland and other agencies report that, increasingly, hard-pressed families are incurring financial hardship by having to pay for services they cannot access through the public system.</p>  <p>  It is good that we are having this debate about the Irish health service.  I hope that by adopting this motion we will make a start at abolishing the two-tier health service that is not fit for purpose.  I have worked in the health service for the past 16 years.  I know that the fault does not lie with the staff who are very dedicated and extremely professional in what they do.  Most people will say that when they use the health service, their experience of front-line staff is incredibly positive.  Having gone through numerous pay cuts and cutbacks in the past eight years, it is a testament to the dedication of health service staff that we have a functional health service.  Ireland spends more on our two-tier health service than any other European country but we do not get as good a service as countries which spend more on public health services and less on private services.  It is time to move away from profiteering and away from buying and selling health care for profit and follow the international evidence that one-tier publicly funded not-for-profit health care is best by far.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall for tabling the motion and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, for accepting it.  I also thank the 150 Members of the D&aacute;il who signed the motion.</p>  <p>  The Irish health service needs a long-term vision.  It needs a framework that can build an efficient, effective and functioning health service.  At present, unfortunately, in many areas our health service does not function properly.  Year on year planning is not delivering an effective acute service.  Our service tends to fire fight and respond to crises rather than anticipate crises and problems.  Every year, we have a trolley crisis with up to 500 or 600 people per day on trolleys.  This should be anticipated.  Unfortunately, our trolley numbers are not falling back to zero at present and we continue to have people on trolleys.  Today, 250 people are on trolleys but we are in the middle of summer.  Each year, this situation deteriorates and the number rises to 500 or 600 people.  We should build a service that can anticipate these problems and deal with them.</p>  <p>  The HSE delivers some very good services.  We have excellent acute cardiovascular services.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, feels there is a deficit in Waterford but throughout the country, and certainly in the mid west, we have wonderful acute cardiac services.  We have wonderful breast, prostate, skin and lung cancer services.  Our laboratory services for haematology and biochemistry are excellent.  Our medical and surgical assessment units work extremely well, provided they are not used as an overflow for casualty during very busy times.  These are very positive aspects of the HSE and we should recognise this.</p>  <p>  There is a huge deficit when it comes to communication and integration between community and primary care services on the one hand and casualty and hospital services on the other.  There should be a seamless transition between primary and secondary care and one of the most important areas the committee should examine is how we integrate primary and secondary care.  This is the view of major medical organisations, including the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners.  We are looking for solutions and accountability on planning decisions.  Quite often, decisions are made in the health service which are devoid of input from those who deliver the service on the front line.  This makes no common sense.</p>  <p>  We must think laterally and differently about how we deliver our health services.  In Ireland, 3% of the health budget goes on general practice.  This needs to increase to approximately 10% over the next ten years, in line with other European countries.  General practice is the engine which will deliver health care reform but, at present, general practice has severe capacity issues.  GPs have suffered severely as a result of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  They were affected disproportionately because of the manner in which general practice is funded.  GP incomes were hit but funding to support and develop general practices was reduced by 38%, which is unsustainable.  Many areas have lost GPs and many areas which still have a GP will find it very difficult to replace that GP when he or she retires.  New GP graduates are not going into general practice because our contract is out of date and not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

The objective of the works will be to safeguard the buildings, in so far as possible, until a permanent solution is identified.  In that context, I am continuing to examine the court's findings in so far as they relate to the Moore Street project and the general operation of the National Monuments Acts.</p><p>I am also examining, in consultation with other Departments, whether there are broader planning and development implications nationally, especially in terms of potential impacts on infrastructural projects such as housing, roads, broadband and other utility developments.

Many will be shocked, therefore, to hear that the arts and heritage have been added to this Frankenstein Department and that the investment in this Department is only one fifth of that in other European countries.  The battlefield site on Moore Street is an example.  It is nearly three months since the court ruled on this issue.  With regard to the disconnect between the Government and the people and the High Court, what plans does the Minister have to develop a new cultural and heritage plan for the battlefield site on Moore Street?</p></speech>

I must look at the site on Moore Street in the context of the judgment and I must also look at its wider potential implications.  I need to look at whether there are broader planning and development issues nationally.  I am still assessing the potential impacts and consulting other Departments.  I am also taking legal advice on the matter.  I am, therefore, not in a position to give a definitive answer on the issues around the legal case and until that decision is made, I will not be able to say what we plan to do in the wider area.  I understand this is an emotive issue, but we have made considerable progress in dealing with it.  This is the first Government to have acquired 14 to 17 Moore Street.</p></speech>

This is the centenary year of the 1916 Rising and public opinion on the issue is clear.  It is also important, being in a minority, that the Government consider the opinion of the D&aacute;il.  From what I understand, the positions of Fianna F&aacute;il and my party are close - that everything needs to be done to prevent the travesty of a shopping centre being built on one of the most important heritage and historical sites in the State.  This generation has an opportunity to preserve one of the central spaces in the 1916 Rising.  My other concern in this regard is that the loans of Chartered Land, the company which is proposing to build a shopping centre in this space, lie with NAMA.  If NAMA was to appeal the decision, the State, in effect, would be funding a second appeal against a decision of the High Court which fulfills the will of the people and the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I want to see us preserving the buildings which include the final headquarters of the 1916 leaders.  The intention always was to restore the buildings, 14 to 17 Moore Street, to their 1916 state in order that visitors would be able to take a step-back in time.  I am consulting other Departments and whenever the decision is made on the ruling in the court case and what steps we should take in that regard, I will be happy to sit down and have a conversation with my colleagues in the Oireachtas on the best steps forward.</p></speech>

However, since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year.  The allocation for the Arts Council in 2016 is &euro;60.1 million, an increase of 6% in the past two years.  The allocation for the Irish Film Board in 2016, at almost &euro;14.5 million, shows an increase of 3.6% from last year.</p>  <p>  In terms of capital investment, in January I announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focused on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.  The funding is being made available as part of the capital investment framework 2016 to 2021.  Significant refurbishment and expansion projects are also planned or under way at a number of the national cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government contains an important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I will be engaging with my colleagues in government and the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and budgetary processes.</p></reply>

I asked if she would support the Labour Party's campaign to ensure the capital allocation for the 1916 Rising commemorations, which involve important work at cultural institutions such as the National Gallery of Ireland, was maintained in future years as a national endowment for the arts.  I do not know whether she is aware that salaries, for instance, in the arts are low, particularly among women.  I am not sure whether she is aware that turf cutters receive more of a mention in the programme for Government than the arts sector.  Given that the arts are so important to us as a nation, will she support the Labour Party's campaign to have the funding maintained as a national endowment to promote the expansion of the arts?</p></speech>

It is something on which I am keen because there was significant investment in the arts during the recent 2016 commemorative programme.  The arts were very much at the centre of the commemorative programme which has done a tremendous job in getting people more involved in the arts, not only in the cities but across the country.  When one looks at the local authorities programmes, in every county there was involvement by the arts in the commemorative programme.  In fact, I had the pleasure of attending one launch at which young schoolchildren acted out Ms Grace Gifford's marriage.</p></speech>

The Minister has cited examples of good events which we all have attended, but we need a serious national endowment for the arts.  They suffered disproportionately, partly because a lot of the funding was diverted by the Minister's predecessor to deal with the issues around turf-cutting.  That is fine, but the funding diverted and the national endowment for the arts needs to be restored.</p><p>Recently, the Taoiseach attended a major event at the Kennedy Center in Washington where he praised the arts, given that it is our calling card when we go to the United States.  However, as Lenny Abrahamson said, the arts are not just a photo opportunity for politicians, they are much more important for us as a people and in how we present ourselves to the world.</p></speech>

She has a great interest in the arts, particularly given her role in the Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board, ETB, arts in education initiative which was very successfully piloted through the board.</p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.

It will provide a framework for considering a range of important issues, including improving access to culture, breaking down barriers in areas of social exclusion and disadvantage, and how culture is enriched by greater cultural diversity.  Another priority is the continued implementation of the arts in education charter and encouraging local authorities to strengthen the role of arts and heritage officers by building stronger links with local development groups.  This will also feed into my expanded brief covering regional development and rural affairs.  I will also prioritise opening the new capital grants scheme for applications to provide for upgrades of existing regional arts and cultural centres around the country.  There is &euro;3 million for the scheme in this year's budget and a total of &euro;9 million over three years.  Other priorities include boosting supports to regional museums and facilitating increased loans between the national cultural institutions and the network of regional museums, working with the Irish Film Board, Screen Ireland, to ensure Ireland is maximised as a location for international film production, and further encouraging strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and arts organisations.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>These priorities represent an ambitious agenda and I look forward to working with all partners and across all parties in this House to develop and implement these initiatives.</p></reply>

While I congratulate her, I am disappointed at what most of the arts community and I see as the demotion of the arts within the Department.  While I appreciate the priorities the Minister outlined, the former Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has been increased to include regional development and rural affairs and encompasses responsibility for the roll-out of broadband and the development of the An Post network.  We fully understand the need for a dedicated Department for regional development and rural affairs.  My colleague, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was Minister for just that from 2002 to 2010.  However, during that time a separate Department for the arts had a lead portfolio.  I am very fearful, like most of the nation, that the arts may be left behind and forgotten about in the Minister's miscellaneous responsibilities.  What reassurances can she give on this?</p></speech>

I am looking forward to taking up the new role.  To assist me, I have the Ministers of State, Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne and Michael Ring.  With a bigger Department comes more staff and resources which I can use for the benefit of the arts, given that they are part of a much bigger Department.  I am very committed to working to improve them across the country.  Culture is so important and so much part of what we are as a people and we must invest in it.

We believe the Government's downgrading of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht is wrong and the arts community is frustrated about it.  The arts constitute a very important industry which creates many jobs and has a major impact nationally, as we can see from the year we have just had.  Will the Minister assure us of her commitment and say the arts are a priority?  Until the portfolio is restored to the lead role it had for almost a quarter of a century, there are real doubts about the Government's commitment.

The Deputy will be familiar with the new, state-of-the-art Garage Theatre in Monaghan which is a very important amenity for the local community.  We also have the Ramor Theatre in Cavan and the wonderful Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Annaghmakerrig.

My Department has continued its considerable engagement following An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s consent for the Oughterard to Maam Cross section of the road project.  Some eight method statements have been received to date on the project, with initial statements approved within two weeks or less.  Recent statements received have been particularly complex and key information was omitted or the statements had not been approved by the council, as required.  Senior officials of my Department arranged a meeting earlier this month with Galway County Council to address these issues and this positive engagement will continue.</p><p>There is no doubt that the overall N59 development is a complex project.  It is incumbent on my Department to balance its regional development objectives and its environmental obligations in seeking to contribute to a positive outcome for the people of Galway West, Connemara and the region in general while seeking also to avoid the project falling foul of legal challenge.</p> <p> I remain available to meet, as necessary, with public representatives on this matter.

I insisted on the coastal secondary roads being included in it.  Since planning was given for the project virtually no progress has been made on the stretch from Oughterard to Maam Cross.  We will not have a rural Ireland with its unique cultural heritage if we do not provide basic infrastructure.  In view of the offer of the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to meet us on Friday in the Department's office in Na Forbacha to discuss the air service, could a parallel meeting be arranged that morning with the Minister's officials, the county council and the Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and the Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; for the area to once and for all discuss how we can collectively progress this project, which is of vital interest?

My officials have been working with the local authority to progress the matter and will continue to do so.  They are available to meet interested parties.

It would be very convenient for everybody to once and for all get around the table and resolve this issue.  Environmental heritage is important and nobody doubts it, but the road from Maam Cross to Recess was widened many years ago and a railway line was built through Connemara.  Despite that we still have this fantastic ecology that the Minister is preserving.  It seems disproportionate that after four years of negotiations between the Minister and the county council, we cannot resolve what we need to do.  The project is not the building of a new road but the widening of the existing dirt track into a road.  Many people in Connemara are tempted to put up big signs with the words "horses and carts from here on in" along the route.  It is ridiculous and I ask the Minister to organise a meeting for Friday.  This is now a matter of crucial importance.  The Minister of State will be able to brief the Minister on how offended are all of the preservers of the environment of Connemara who live there at the top-down attitude being taken by officialdom here and in Brussels towards their heritage.</p></speech>

It is about trying to work towards a solution and striking the right balance.  The European Commission has written to me on this project indicating a particular concern with respect to the pearl mussel and we cannot ignore that.  This is all part of the habitats directive.  My officials are prepared to meet the Deputy.  I give a commitment that they will meet him on Friday and they will work with the local authority to find a resolution.

Officials of my Department have been engaging with their counterparts in other relevant Departments to establish the precise details of the functions to come under the remit of my Department and to identify the associated personnel and other resources to be transferred.  This process is well advanced and I anticipate that the formal reassignment of the rural development functions from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will take place in the coming week.  This will include responsibility for the Leader programme; natural rural development schemes; rural recreation, including the walks scheme; implementation of the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, and the Charter for Rural Ireland; the town and village renewal scheme; the Western Development Commission, dormant accounts; social enterprise; and the Tidy Towns competition.</p>  <p>  Discussions are yet to be completed regarding the transfer of functions and resources in regard to the rural post office network and rural broadband.  I can confirm, however, that I am already working closely with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to advance delivery of key elements of the national broadband plan and to accelerate and prioritise the roll-out of the programme in rural areas.</p></reply>

It is more than three months since the election.  I understand it will take a number of weeks to centralise all these responsibilities in her Department, which means we will be up against the summer recess period.  Over that period, we, as opposition Deputies, cannot table questions to the Minister, therefore, it will be difficult for us to carry out our responsibilities in holding the Minister responsible for a period that may be up to six months duration following the general election. </p>  <p>  We live in a two-tier economy where much of  the State is suffering from below par economic activity, low incomes and poverty etc.  To rebalance that in terms of development, we will not be able to help reorientate policy possibly for months to come.

Most of the functions will be transferred next week.  The transfer of all the rural affairs functions from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will be done next week.  The broadband provision and rural post offices functions will be done very shortly, and probably the following week, but the transfer of the rural affairs functions will definitely be done next week.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question, I will not have responsibility for rural transport or school transport.  We will have responsibility for the CL&Aacute;R programme.  However, we will have an action plan for rural Ireland and a special Cabinet sub-committee will be set up.  I will co-ordinate the responses of all the Departments with respect to rural Ireland, and there will be a new cross-Government plan to drive investment and regenerate rural Ireland in terms of the action plan for rural Ireland.</p><p>This will ensure there is ministerial oversight and rural-proofing of Government decisions.

That is what it says on the can.  Will she tell me whether she will press for the reinstitution of the decentralisation programme which was so important to bringing jobs to the regions?

Rural transport is a tremendous benefit to rural Ireland.  We all have our local transport companies and one sees how successfully it regenerates small towns when people are brought in on pension day.  It is great for towns and we must continue to build on that.  In my county, work with the health service is being built on.  I want to impress on the House how important rural transport is.  We have the Leader programme but I do not have the part of the rural development fund that relates to farming, which belongs to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The intended works would have involved major underpinning and stabilisation of the buildings as well as re-roofing and a programme of comprehensive repairs that would have retained all pre-1916 fittings, fixtures and structures.  The intention was to have the project completed and the commemorative centre open to the public during the current centenary year.  The historical significance of No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor in the decision to place a preservation order on Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 under the National Monuments Acts in 2007.  Collectively, Nos. 14 to 17 represent the most original, complete and continuous section of substantially intact pre-1916 buildings on Moore Street.  This was also a significant factor in the Government&rsquo;s decision to acquire the buildings in 2015 and to initiate the restoration project in the absence of any other prospect of the increasingly essential and urgent conservation works being carried out.</p>  <p>  Following the High Court ruling, progress with the commemoration centre and conservation project in Moore Street has ceased and arrangements are now being made to have limited works, as approved by the court, carried out as soon as possible to preserve and protect the buildings for the time being.  The objective of these works will be to safeguard the buildings, in so far as this is possible, until a permanent solution is identified.  In that context, I continue to examine the court&rsquo;s findings in so far as they relate to the Moore Street project itself and to the general operation of the National Monuments Acts.  I am also examining, in consultation with other Departments, whether there are broader planning and development implications, especially in terms of potential impacts on infrastructure projects such as housing provision, roads, broadband and other developments.</p></reply>

We discussed this issue and my belief is that irrespective of the legal issue, which is a complex one we must park for today, there is a need for people to sit around a table, express the different views and try to build a consensus.  Will the Minister consider some process of engaging with all the different views, including the different views among the political parties, many of which do not share the Government's view on this, to see if we can move this forward in a way that satisfies the vast majority of people?  In my view, the Government has lost public opinion on this one.</p></speech>

Now that there is a new Government and the Minister has returned to the Department and given what she said about the significance of heritage, is there not an opportunity at this point to open the dialogue out?  As probably the only Deputy from the north inner city in the House at the moment, I note that from the point of the view of the Rising, much of what is between the canals is historic and significant in terms of the history of Dublin and locally.  I suggest to the Minister that there is an opportunity here to have an opening out to a concept of Dublin as a historic battlefield site in the context of the core areas affected by the Rising.</p></speech>

As Deputy Burton said, I have already committed to buying, and got agreement from Government to buy, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  I have committed taxpayers' money to this important and historic project.  As a Government, we were taking four buildings which were the national monument.  They are the ones that were designated as a national monument.  We spent &euro;4 million purchasing them and we are looking at between &euro;7 million and &euro;8 million to carry out the works to restore the four buildings.  To be clear, that is what we have been trying to do.  I was operating on the basis of the national monument at the time.</p></speech>

The Department believes it should preserve a small number of buildings and the public believes the block bounded by the two lanes should be preserved and developed in a sympathetic way.  My question is whether the Minister is willing to consider some process or forum or other way forward which is very inclusive to try to get common ground on how we resolve this issue.  In the absence of that, our next option in opposition is to proceed with the Bill we put forward by bringing it to the committee and, through it, to the pre-legislative process and then into the Oireachtas.  It appears that without a forum that is the only way forward.  As an alternative to that, is the Minister willing to consider an open dialogue with the interested parties, including representatives of the main political parties, so that we can try to marshal all the facts on every side and then find a common way forward?</p></speech>

Meanwhile, my Department will focus on establishing county-regional broadband task forces in which local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies will immediately engage with communities and the telecoms industry in order to eliminate delay factors in advance and enable effective rural broadband delivery once a contract has been awarded under the procurement process.</p><p>As committed to in the programme for a partnership Government, within the first 100 days a mobile phone and broadband task force will be established, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

Does she agree that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should stop messing about with 30 Mbps and opt instead for providing fibre to every home and business?  These are simple questions.  The Minister now has responsibility for rural development.  What part of the national broadband plan does not relate to rural Ireland?  My understanding is that urban areas are to be left to the market.</p>  <p>  Regarding mobile telephony, will the task force that the Minister is setting up be able to recommend to the Government that it should, if necessary, make money available to the telecoms industry, having taken much money from it via licences and required a low threshold of coverage, so that the industry ensures that every road and house in the State is covered by mobile telephony as is required and as is the case in Scandinavian countries, which have sparser populations than we do?</p></speech>

However, due to the changed economic circumstances, a decision was taken in 2013 to dispose of both airstrips and surrounding sites.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works, OPW, has undertaken a feasibility study at the Cleggan site of the possibility of developing a base there for an Irish Coast Guard station.  I am advised that the OPW intends to seek planning permission for a temporary Irish Coast Guard station, with the possibility of a permanent station being developed at a future date.  There are discussions between Galway County Council and the OPW on land for this purpose and land ownership.  Obviously, the Irish Coast Guard is important.  Only this week there was tragedy in the Connemara region with a death at sea and another incident today at Inverin consequent to which the Irish Coast Guard was called.  I fully support the development of the Irish Coast Guard station.</p>  <p>  Against this background, my Department has no immediate plans to complete the development of the airstrips with a view to making them operational, nor are there plans to provide funding for a regular service between Aerfort R&eacute;igi&uacute;nach Chonamara and the airstrips.  However, I have asked my Department to undertake a consultation process as soon as possible on the disposal of these two airstrips.</p>  <p>  Being new in the job, I asked the officials in the Roinn to engage immediately with the local communities to determine their wishes on the service.  Obviously, the airstrips have been built.  In his previous role Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had a large role to play in this.  I appreciate that.  Local business people and the community were also involved.  The long-term aim has to be to develop an air service between Cleggan and Inishbofin.  As I stated, I have no immediate plans, but that is not to say I do not believe it should be done, nor does it mean that I will not take up this issue in the very near future.  While waiting, I have asked my officials to start a consultation process that will take place quickly and not be prolonged.  It is to obtain the views of the locals, be they in business, members of the island community or the community development body on Inishbofin or other interested individuals, to ascertain what they believe should be done.</p></reply>

Since Inishbofin is a lot further from Galway, why would an air service to that island not be of equal benefit to the islanders?  Will the Minister of State assure me that there is absolutely no question of disposing this State infrastructure that was put in place with the people's money to provide a vital service to an island?  Would the Minister of State be willing to examine the potential cost of providing a reasonable service from Aerfort R&eacute;igi&uacute;nach Chonamara, where the project could be completed at a marginal cost because there are airplanes and an airstrip available?  There could be flights both to Cleggan and Inishbofin, perhaps three or four days per week initially.  This could be done at a marginal cost since all of the infrastructure is in place and pilots are available.  The Minister of State knows all of the arguments and Aran islanders would explain them to him.  Therefore, will he answer my three very specific questions?  I look forward to the answers.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have responsibility for providing services to all of them, including, for example, the helipad on Tory Island which has been in place for the past few years.  A decision was made in 2013 on the disposal of the airstrips.  As I said, I now wish to seek the views of the communities affected by it.  Obviously, any such decision would have to be agreed to by the Government.  Issue arises in the disposal of State assets.  There was a considerable investment in these projects and it is something that would have to be agreed to.  I do not believe Government approval should be sought until such time as we hear from the communities on what they want.</p>  <p>  With regard to having a reasonable service from Aerfort R&eacute;igi&uacute;nach Chonamara, that issue could be examined.  If it is part of the recommendations or the people's views in the consultation in which I am engaging, it can certainly be examined.  If there is a low-cost service that could be provided, it could certainly be considered within the budgetary constraints.  Obviously, the Deputy, with the rest of the Members, will have a role in the budgetary process on these matters.</p></speech>

Will he clarify whether he is ruling out or still holding open the possibility of selling this vital infrastructure to private interests?  He seems to be leaving the door open to the sale of the assets, which I obviously oppose.  Does he agree that depopulation is a challenge on islands?  As the population drops, it imposes a huge cost on the State, as he knows.  Does he acknowledge that the best way to keep people on islands is to provide very efficient infrastructural services for them?  They are provided at a minimal cost to the State compared with other transport services around the country.</p></speech>

Obviously, the better the service in any rural area, be it on an island or anywhere else, the more depopulation is prevented.  Aa part of the programme for Government, we hope to examine issues concerning a rural resettlement scheme.  I certainly believe - I have touched on this with my officials - the islands should be very much a place where it should be prioritised and implemented.</p>  <p>  On the sale, as I said in my reply, a decision was taken in 2013 to dispose of both airstrips and surrounding sites.  I have asked the Roinn to initiate a discussion on this matter with locals and those with vested interests.  Obviously, disposal was the decision made in 2013.  It would have to be examined and agreed to by the Cabinet were it to go ahead.</p>  <p>  On the question of costs, if the possibility of a service emerges from the consultation process, it will need to be examined in the context of our budget discussions and budget preparation.</p></speech>

If general practice is to be part of the solution to problems in the health service, and I believe it will be central to that solution, it needs to be supported.  Many areas have lost their general practitioner and many general practitioners who will retire in the near future may not be replaced.  Some 33% of general practitioners are aged over 55 years and 20% are aged over 60 years.  New graduates are not taking up general practice because the current GP contract is not fit for purpose.  A new contract must be urgently negotiated as part of any new framework for future health care and the cuts made under the FEMPI legislation must be reversed.</p>  <p>  Patients spend 99% of their lives living in their communities where they are cared for by their general practitioner, public health nurse, community intervention teams and community therapists such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists, and supported by community pharmacy colleagues who supply essential services.  If these services were to be fully developed, many patients could be looked after in the community and unnecessary hospital admissions avoided, thus taking pressure off overstretched accident and emergency departments.  This could be achieved by managing chronic illnesses and old age in the community. </p>  <p>  Ireland's demographic trends are frightening, with 20,000 people reaching the age of 65 years each year.  Furthermore, patients aged over 85 years account for 14% of bed occupancy in hospitals but only 1.4% of the population.  It is clear, therefore, that demographics are causing severe problems in hospital capacity.</p>  <p>  It is essential that bed capacity in hospitals is increased.  Hospital bed numbers are currently approximately 500 lower than what is required.  Hospitals work most efficiently when operating at 85% capacity and yet many of our hospitals are operating at 100% capacity, which causes inefficiency.</p>  <p>  We must also develop home care services and packages.  Despite being highly cost effective, these services are the first item cut when the Health Service Executive seeks savings.  This approach creates a false economy.  Cutting home care hours and packages has a negative impact because people end up as patients on trolleys or occupying expensive hospital beds.</p>  <p>  Services must be integrated.</p><p>We need ambulatory care and medical assessment units.  We should be investigating patients to ensure they will not be admitted to hospitals, rather than admitting patients to hospital to be investigated.  Many acute illnesses cannot be avoided and these are the ones that should be dealt with effectively and efficiently in our cluttered accident and emergency units.</p> <p> In order to build a proper health service we need to reverse the measures introduced by the FEMPI legislation and to support general practices in rural, urban and deprived areas.  A new flexible contract for general practice is essential.  If we are to introduce free GP care for everybody, we will need to double the number of GPs we have in our service.  If the service is to be efficient, we need to see an integration of primary and secondary care.  Increased access to diagnostics is essential.  Many of our diagnostic services operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m from Monday to Friday and close over the weekend.  This is inefficient.  Patients are staying in hospital over weekends waiting for scans which should be provided during that weekend period, thus allowing them to be discharged.</p> <p> We need to properly fund chronic disease management - diabetes, heart failure and chronic respiratory illness - and increased community supports must be put in place to help elderly patients with multiple morbidity issues.  Primary care needs to be the engine that drives major health care reform and I hope that will be part of the new committee's remit.  The bed capacity issue is exacerbating the accident and emergency unit crisis, but the emphasis in the proposed health reform must be to keep people out of hospital, thus freeing up accident and emergency units for essential cases.</p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.  Reform should be solution driven and should produce recommendations that centre on patients, are transparent and provide accountability.  Input from those who provide front line services is essential.</p></speech>

In total, 89 Members from the Opposition benches supported the motion and I thank them for doing so.  I also welcome the fact that once the new Government was in place, the new Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was happy to come on board, with some minor amendments to the motion.  He pledged the support of the Government,  Fine Gael and the Independents who support the Government.  Quite unusually therefore, we now have a motion before the House that is supported by almost 150 Members.  This unprecedented circumstance is an indication of the willingness of everybody to work together in a collaborative manner to try to find solutions to the many problems that dog our health service.</p><p>I will not take up time speaking about the many problems in the health service, because we are all too familiar with them.  Our wide-ranging health services cover a significant number of different areas, in most of which we find difficulties.  There are many reasons for this.  Historically, there have been funding issues, but the main problem is that we do not have any overall coherent plan for the health service, in contrast to what happened in the United Kingdom after the war when the Labour and Tory parties agreed on the National Health Service.  While there have been ups and downs with that service over the years, by and large people in the United Kingdom are proud of the NHS and would not contemplate its abolition.  This applies in the political arena also and although the Conservatives may have cut funding at times, there has always been agreement on the model of health service and nobody has suggested the NHS should be abolished.  The problem here is that we have no agreement on the model for our health service.  Down through the years, our health service has evolved in an <i>ad hoc </i>way, to the point where it is now quite dysfunctional.  There is no political consensus on the kind of model we need for the service.</p><p>This has resulted in a situation where every time there is a change in government or a change of Minister, each new Minister introduces a new plan.  However, that plan does not have political consensus and when the Minister begins to implement it, that causes an enormous churning within the health service.  Over the past 20 years therefore, the health service has been in a constant state of flux.  This is bad for the health service and for the patients who depend on it.  However, it is also very bad for those charged with delivering the service, because there is huge uncertainty about what the future holds.  By an large, people are not quite clear where they fit into our quite dysfunctional health service.  This is a major factor in regard to the ability of the State to retain staff in the service and to attract staff who have emigrated to return.  The service does not make Ireland an attractive place to live in and it is not a good model for the delivery of services.</p><p>We have an extraordinary situation where some 38% of the public are dependent on the public health service and they encounter long waiting lists for practically every service.  On the other hand, some 46% of the public pay thousands of euro every year in health insurance.  This health insurance amounts to significant additional taxation.  This kind of two-tier health system is unheard of in any other European country and would not be tolerated elsewhere.  It is unknown in any other European country that sick people would not get speedy access to proper health services.  Health services function in other countries and people have a right to expect their governments to take responsibility for basic health services and for ensuring there is a good quality health service in place that is available to everybody, irrespective of whether people can pay for it.  This is the standard in the rest of Europe and there is no reason we cannot have a similar high quality public health service here.  Any talking down of the Department of Health or description of it as a ministry nobody wants or as an Angola is a political cop out.  Irish people are entitled to a quality public health service that is available when they need it and there is no reason we cannot provide that kind of service.</p><p>It is important there is cross-party agreement on this kind of approach.  If people sat down together to design a health service, they certainly would not design the kind of dysfunctional service we have here currently.  That is the reason we now need to come together politically to identify the most important things we need to deliver in terms of our health service and decide how to go about achieving that.  The most important section in our motion is the recognition of the need to establish a universal, single-tier health service which treats patients on the basis of health need rather than on the ability to pay.</p><p>In setting out to achieve this ambitious objective - one realised in most other European countries - I hope the new committee will work on the basis of considering the high level issues that come into play in this regard.  Over the coming weeks, the normal Oireachtas committee on health will deal with day-to-day issues arising in the health area.  However, we need to have a high level debate and to reach agreement on what our health service should deliver and how we can achieve the kind of health service that will provide a universal, single-tier health service.</p><p>We must also consider how we can transition from the current system to the new single-tier system over a period.  How can we do that in a planned way so that, irrespective of whether there is a change in Government or of Minister, it will not all be thrown up in the air again?  We must work towards an agreed consensus.</p> <p> The other aspect of the motion deals with the need to reorientate the health service.  Our health service is very hospital-centric and provides care predominantly at the most expensive level, that of acute hospitals.  This puts an emphasis on preventative medicine and early intervention to ensure that, as far as possible, people can access the health service locally in their own community through their primary care services.  There is no doubt that an approach where there is a front-loading of primary and community care delivers the best health outcomes and the best value for money.  </p> <p> In short, the second high-level objective is to introduce a single-tier health service, to agree on the most appropriate funding model and on how we reorientate the health service towards primary and community care and to model that and phase it in over a reasonable period.  Everybody agrees there should be more emphasis on primary care as it will save money and there will be better health outcomes but we need to work out how we are going to go from the present system to the new system in a phased, ordered way.  We need to work out how we can do it in a way that ensures services are not diminished in any way and that we move smoothly so that resources are switched from hospitals to primary care.  </p> <p> It is a tall order to come up with recommendations within a six-month period but it focuses people's minds.  I would hope that all members of the new committee would approach this task on the basis of looking at the evidence, rather than listening to the many vested interests that have dogged our health services down through the years.  We need to look at objective evidence to see what works, what our experience has told us and what is best practice in other countries, from which we can learn.  We should do it in an open manner and in a way can keep the vested interests at the door.  We should use the resources available to us in the shape of the ESRI, the department of public health in Trinity College Dublin and a number of other experts in the field and there is plenty of expertise around.</p> <p> Finally, it is important the committee be resourced properly so that we have access to the best possible research and evidence to underpin the recommendations and so that we can move forward to achieve the single-tier health service that Irish people deserve.</p></speech>

How we fund, govern and manage our health services over an extended period of time may be the most useful initiative that has been taken by any government in the past 30 years, and presents us with a unique opportunity to challenge forever the way we address our health needs as a society.</p>  <p>  We have ten years to save a generation.  Devising cross-party agreement on the direction of health policy in Ireland will hopefully give us long-term clarity on funding, staffing, contracts and the hospital network organisation.  I hope it will also remove opportunities for political opportunism that prevent us from making good decisions about where to allocate resources.  It is vital that there is recognition of the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on health.  Now that we are finally entering a period of relative economic stability and growth, I believe that there is scope to address the inequality of access that exists for service users and that this committee will move to establish a universal, single-tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay.</p>  <p>  We are moving towards being the most obese country in the world if we do not change course.  We have an emergence of food poverty where there is an inability to afford or gain access to a healthy diet.  Low income households, due to a combination of lack of money, education and access, often have diets made up of cheap, poor quality, calorie dense foods with little nutritional value.  This is the root cause of the spiralling obesity epidemic.  Obesity is a risk factor in four of the five biggest killers in this country and it affects all sectors of society, but disproportionately the poorest people.  We have the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe.  We are witnessing a battery-fed population.  A generation is coming on stream that will, for the first time, live shorter lives than their predecessors if we do not intervene.  Cancer mortality is three times higher in disadvantaged areas and it is the second most common cause of death.  Patients in disadvantaged areas often struggle to manage these conditions whilst facing other social and financial pressures.  People who are the most likely to die have the least access to the health service.  This is fundamentally wrong.</p>  <p>  This happens when services are distributed according to number and not need.  If you have the same number of services, for example, per 1000 people, regardless of where they live, those in the most disadvantaged areas get effectively half the service as they are twice as likely to get sick.  In the case of primary care, there is not even the same number of doctors per head of population in disadvantaged areas.  The average number of patients per GP in this country is 1:1,600.  In the north west of Dublin, which has three times the cancer death rates of the most affluent area, the ratio is 1:3,600.  Public patients from that region wait 11 months for vital tests diagnosing cancer, whereas in south east Dublin it is two months.  I represent the south east of Dublin, and I consider two months an outrage, so what must the people and the Deputies of north west Dublin think?  </p>  <p>  As a student I worked as a hospital cleaner and ward aid in Tullamore Hospital in order to pay my way through college.  Upon qualifying as a pharmacist I worked as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the NHS alongside hospital consultants, nurses, physiotherapists and others to enable a clear pathway to recovery for each patient on a case by case basis.  Believe me, the NHS is by no means perfect, but we must look to it and learn from its successes and mistakes.  We have an opportunity here to replicate all that is good in other countries' health services while tailoring it to the needs of our nation.</p>  <p>  Everyone in the health system, from consultants to the cleaner, are working for the best outcomes and to deliver the service that patients require.  We have gone to great lengths as a country to set up hospital networks, yet these networks are not functioning coherently, either for emergency or elective care.  In a network where the primary care sector channels patients towards the major hospital in a region, that network as a whole should be responsible for the hospital-based care of its catchment population.  Unless they have a clear idea of whom they have responsibility for, specialists in the major hospitals cannot plan and then deliver their service.  Patients should not therefore have to cross network boundaries in order to access the care they need, other than in cases where the service they need is not available in their own network.  We cannot remain in a situation where we do not know what we have, where it is, and who is in charge.  </p>  <p>  We have ended up with a situation where the quality of outcomes has been compromised because patients from all over the country are arriving at hospitals that have neither the clinical nor the financial resources to deal in a timely fashion with the volume of patients coming through their doors.  In a recent conversation with a consultant surgeon, he described the dangerous deficit of theatre capacity to me in the major specialist centres, including in the Dublin children's hospitals.  He told me how common it is that young, healthy patients suffer needless long-term disability as a result of delays in access to theatre.  He described the service as irresponsibly inadequate.  Apart from the lifelong harm that individual patients suffer as a result of all these challenges, there is the economic cost that runs in tandem with the human cost.  As patients wait, occupying beds, waiting for delayed treatment, their conditions are deteriorating to a point where they then require extra operations to deal with the consequences of totally avoidable infection.</p><p>We need to accept that illness does not take the weekend or evening off.  If we are to provide the best outcomes for people, we need to recruit skilled staff.  A good outcome for a patient depends on the entire team being involved in his or her care in a routine, organised and regular manner.  This simply does not happen in Ireland.  There has been a noticeable loss of expertise in the system.  This has been accompanied by poor resourcing of hospitals, worsening terms of employment for staff and improper administrative planning.</p> <p> The cornerstone of any progressive health service should be the delivery of local and accessible health and social services in the community to a defined population.  We cannot continue to depend on the goodwill of health care professionals in the primary care setting to advance this objective.  Investment in primary care as a unique entity is required.  Those of us who work in the community setting currently see it as an add-on to our roles.  All evidence suggests every &euro;10 spent in the primary care area saves the State &euro;100 in the long run.  The introduction of a functioning and universally employed information technology platform would greatly enhance efficiency and communication, decrease the current paperwork load and speed up the process from the point of access to the point of delivery and on to aftercare in the community.</p> <p> Primary care remains under-utilised and under-valued.  Morale is on the floor.  When this new committee is formed, it will need to address the concern and confusion regarding the future of primary care.  Now is the time to create a vision for that future, while the wider health care community still has the willingness and the energy for health care reform.  In the past 15 years I do not think I have gone a day without speaking to multiple people involved in the provision of health care.  Everyone engaged in active health care provision wants the system to be fixed.  The passion among these professionals to deliver a world-class health service is driven by a fundamental desire to improve people&rsquo;s lives.  In the light of the recent tragic events in Cavan and Holles Street hospitals, it is imperative that the national maternity strategy be implemented as a matter of urgency.  The patient is the central focus in the delivery of maternity services under the strategy, which is long overdue.  If the patient is not the central focus of care, who is?</p> <p> I could stand here all day listing the inadequacies of the health service.  I could try to assign blame to those whom I believe contributed to getting us to this crisis.  Such political opportunism would neither be constructive nor of any benefit to the thousands of citizens who require adequate care right now, as we sit here fit and healthy.  I hope today we have a platform to a new dawn.  We have a chance to be part of something constructive, rather than destructive.  Collectively, we must face the challenges and save a generation.  It is with great hope that I support the motion that the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall have commended to the House.  I urge Deputies of all parties and none to unite in supporting it.</p></speech>

I welcome the proposal to establish an all-party committee to devise a cross-party agreement on a long-term vision for health care and health policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the motion which seeks to build a cross-party consensus on health.  We believe in a publicly funded and delivered health care service that emphasises patient care above structures.  We are also committed to making primary care the bedrock of the health system.  For too long, the country's health care system has been based on fire-fighting.  We welcome the intention to agree a strategic plan to address these issues.  The current health system is neither fish nor fowl.  It is neither public nor private.  We often hear about the two-tier health system, but we know that there are many more tiers.  There are separate tiers for medical card holders, GP-only card holders and the working poor who are not entitled to any kind of medical card or support, even though they cannot afford private health care.  It is important that this new committee is not used as an excuse for inaction by the Department of Health.  There are many obvious, acute and immediate failings in the system.</p>  <p>  Discrimination in service provision based on one's address is particularly insidious.  I will talk about the area I know.  Wexford psychiatric services are tied in with the services in Waterford.  A person in Wexford who has an acute psychiatric event is not allowed to go to the emergency department in Waterford, even though he or she is living in the Waterford-Wexford area.  He or she has to go to the emergency department in Wexford.  If this happens out-of-hours, the person in question will be seen by a triage nurse who will contact the service in Waterford by telephone.  If a psychiatrist in Waterford can be contacted, an assessment will be made over the telephone.  If the person is refused at this point, he or she will be sent home after spending three, four or five hours in the Wexford emergency department.  If he or she is accepted, he or she will have to travel to the emergency department in Waterford and spend another three, four or five hours waiting to be seen by a psychiatrist.  That psychiatrist will have to make a decision on the basis of whether the person's case deserves to be prioritised over those of others who need to be admitted, rather than on the basis of whether he or she needs to be admitted.  If he or she is not admitted, he or she will be sent back home into the care of his or her family if he or she is lucky enough to have family to take care of him or her.  Otherwise, he or she will just be cut loose.</p>  <p>  The admission of children to adult psychiatric units needs to be dealt with immediately.  The Mental Health Commission's reports on approved centres were released a few days ago.  The commission reported that nine children had been admitted to an adult centre at St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and were, therefore, placed at high risk.  According to the report, "the approved centre was deemed non-compliant as there was no evidence of required Children First training or any other relevant training for all staff".  This centre "was not suitable for the admission of children", but they were admitted nonetheless.  As far as I know, this was not the first time the centre in question was deemed to be insufficient.  We are continuing to admit children to high-risk facilities.  I accept that the parents of these children signed consent forms, but I suggest they did so out of desperation and under duress.</p>  <p>  I would like to speak about some other issues that have been highlighted in the reports on mental health approved centres.  Some hospitals have no toilet rolls.  Others have no shower facilities, or have facilities that are covered in mould.  All of these issues could be addressed quickly and readily without the need for a committee to report.  The lack of services for children with disabilities is another such issue.  There is a shocking lack of the availability of services for children who need speech and language therapy.  A significant part of mental health suffering is related to connectedness - people need to feel a connection to those who love them.  If they feel isolated, it can develop into mental health problems.</p>  <p>  Many young children cannot access the speech and language therapy they need to enable them to communicate.  I am talking about children who might have other issues.  If they could develop their speech and language facilities, at least they could communicate with their parents and families.  The same parents have to fight for everything.  People have to wait up to two years for needs assessments.  They might have to wait another two years after that to access inadequate services.  Bizarrely, they are the lucky ones.  There are many conditions the HSE simply refuses to recognise.  It seems to have a policy on health conditions that are treated with medicinal creams.  Children with rare conditions such as ichthyosis need significant care and support from their parents.  Many children and adults need to have medicinal creams applied to them three or four times a day.  In some cases, they have to sleep in bandages.  People in such circumstances have to go back to their GPs and the HSE every three months to beg for medical cards.  It seems that they are deemed eligible for short-term medical cards only.  DNA testing can be used to identify the conditions to which I refer.  It is easy to prove that someone has one of these conditions which cannot be cured.  Across the water in England, people with these conditions receive all the services they require as if they had any other medical condition.  We are refusing to recognise them in the same way.  Ultimately, any health system must be rights-based and have regard to availability and need while taking account of ability to pay.</p>  <p>  I would like to speak about the role of the proposed committee in the area of mental health.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes any attempt to devise cross-party agreement on a single long-term vision for health care and the direction of health policy in Ireland must prioritise mental health and well-being.  Our vision is built on five key principles.  First, public policy ought to ensure people with mental health problems are included in society and enabled and assisted to play their part in it.  Second, the recovery model of mental health care is the most appropriate in terms of the well-being of individuals and enhancing their ability to defend themselves as citizens of the country.  Third, mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health in the deployment of resources and other areas such as health and safety and planning.  Fourth, there should be an emphasis on early intervention and early action.  Most mental health conditions are readily treatable if there is early intervention.</p><p>Even when they reach crisis point, as I have outlined earlier, the supports are not there.<br/><br/>Fifth, mental health policy must be mainstreamed across society in order to promote mental health well-being and to lessen the risks to mental health.  There has already been a ten-year plan for mental health that had cross-party support but it has not been fully implemented.  As we all know, that plan was A Vision for Change.  Its time is nearly up but it needs to be fully implemented while a review is carried out as to what to do for the next ten years.  It needs to be integrated into the overall health policy.  Ultimately, we need to reach a point where mental health is not distinguished from health and is treated with the same respect.<br/><br/>Over the last number of years, community care teams have not delivered on the partnership approach and have instead moved the services that were provided in the hospital out into the community in a &quot;ward in the community&quot; approach, with treatments still being primarily limited to classic psychiatric-led treatments.  Mental health policy is in need of a reboot in 2016.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that Government should carry out a full review of what is still left to be achieved and commit to the reinstatement of a plan to achieve that in the period 2016-26, taking into account any deficiencies identified in A Vision for Change<i></i>by a review group.  The Government needs to ensure that the critical feature of that review will be the holding of a mental health summit of all key stakeholders and must direct the review group to consider placing particular attention on the need to stress non-medical approaches to dealing with mental health issues, including talk therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy.<br/><br/>The Government must ensure that the recovery model's ethos is placed at the centre of mental health policy as expressed in the policy document that will follow and build on from A Vision for Change.  It must re-establish the implementation review group to issue regular reports on the progress in delivering the 2016 to 2026 plan.  A Vision for Change envisioned a partnership model between health professionals and service users that would have an equality of respect at the heart of its approach.  This has not been followed through, with a regression from initial progress in that respect.  Service users need to be put at the centre of any future programme.  Access for 24-7 crisis supports for all ages needs to be delivered irrespective of geography.<br/><br/>My central point is that mental health must be a fundamental part of this new committee that is put together and not simply shunted to the side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100032#FF00200"><p>I welcome this motion to establish a special aII-party committee to develop a single, long-term vision plan for healthcare.  This is a positive step, albeit one that should have been taken a long time ago.  For too long, our health system has been in crisis.  This crisis can be boiled down to two key failings on the part of successive governments: first, a fundamental inequality in how patients are treated and differentiated on their ability to pay and their location and second, the incapacity of the system to deal with even demographic pressures, as evidenced particularly in emergency departments and maternity care.</p>  <p>  Universal health care, and not universal health insurance, is the solution.  I welcome therefore the reference in this motion to "the need to establish a universal single tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay".  Sinn F&eacute;in has long been committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation.</p>  <p>  As my party's health spokesperson over the past 14 years, I have consistently argued for such a system of health care delivery.  I am encouraged by the growing number of voices adopting this position and by the albeit slow but hopefully real movement by Government away from the health insurance model, whether multi-payer or single payer.  Welcome on board.  F&aacute;ilte ar bord.</p>  <p>  I hope that the new plan will have a particular focus on disability services and their prioritisation.  It was very worrying to hear yesterday that there are proposals, once again, to raise the age of those entitled to disability allowance from 16 to 18 years.  This, we will all recall, is the same proposal on which the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was forced to make a U-turn in 2013.  Once more, we see the most vulnerable in our society being used as easy targets.  This must not be allowed to happen again.</p>  <p>  Changes should be made immediately to ensure that a full medical card is granted to every child qualifying for the domiciliary care allowance.  My party colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, will be seeking the support of Members for the adoption of this proposal.  Despite the findings of the Keane report, the horror stories continue of seriously ill children being refused medical cards and the lengths to which distressed parents are being forced to go to secure a medical card.  The Government must urgently introduce and implement a schedule for the extension of full medical cards to people with serious illnesses and disabilities without a means test, working towards a universal entitlement year on year.</p>  <p>  I note and welcome the reference to the focus that needs to be taken on the changing demographics and on how best to re-orientate the health service on a phased basis towards integrated, primary and community care.  A greater emphasis on community-based care has the potential to reduce the number of older people requiring nursing home care.  However, this has not been quantified because, as the Department of Health report on the nursing homes support scheme makes clear, the further development of community-based care is dependent on new approaches.  I hope that is exactly what we are about here today.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in estimates that as many as 13% of nursing home residents, possibly as high as the 30% figure given by ALONE, would be able to stay at home if the appropriate services were put in place.  We are committed to the provision of health care services and social care services as a right, with equal access for all based on need and to the greatest extent that resources allow.  This right is especially relevant for older people and the provision of supports for older people is becoming increasingly important as our population ages.</p>  <p>  We should see improved health and longevity as an opportunity as well as a challenge, with older people contributing more and more to our society.  In the words of the democratic programme of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we are committed to the care and support of Ireland's older people "who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration".</p>  <p>  I wish to thank and congratulate all Members of these Houses, both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, who have openly demonstrated their support for the Green Ribbon campaign throughout the month of May.  The wearing of the ribbon is no longer required since it is 1 June, but our collective efforts to address and support the mental health needs of our population is a daily and yearly need.  I hope that the establishment of this committee will not simply provide a talking shop but rather a gathering of people with ideas, vision, and most importantly, solutions, to bring about the changes that are so desperately required in our health system today.</p></speech>

It amused me today to see Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock play political footsie with Deputy Shortall on the idea, given the fact that the Labour Party allowed Deputy Shortall to walk the plank in her battle with the former Minister for Health, James Reilly.</p>  <p>  Access to health care has to be key to this new committee because it has ground to a halt over the last number of years under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Let us take for example the ambulance service.  Just this week, a 75 year old person in my county had to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance to arrive to be brought to a hospital because the ambulance was in Cavan when it was needed.  That is not unusual because in the period of one year, 40 people contacted me in County Meath stating that it took over an hour for an ambulance to attend to their particular crises.  In seven of those cases there was a fatality involved.</p>  <p>  Access to health care can also be seen in the difficulties of getting a bed through accident and emergency departments.  Last year in the hospitals of Navan and Drogheda, 9,000 people spent time on a trolley.  That is the equivalent population of Trim, in our county, who were on a trolley in the last year.  We know that if one is on a trolley, one receives substandard treatment.  One receives delayed treatment, which is not as good.  Therefore, one has a sub-optimum health outcome.  That means that some people remain injured or ill for longer and, in some cases, lose their lives.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine stated that roughly 350 people a year lose their lives due to accident and emergency department overcrowding.</p><p>That is roughly one person a day and a startling indictment of Government health policy.</p> <p> There are 490,000 people on public hospital waiting lists.  That is equivalent to the population of the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford being refused access to the health service and made to languish on waiting lists.  In my constituency access to the doctor on-call service is becoming more difficult and sometimes it is not available during the night.  We have heard there is the possibility of a Skype doctor replacing the doctor-on-call service, with a doctor, from a distance of 50 miles, remotely diagnosing and treating a patient in crisis during the night, which is quite shocking.</p> <p> A common thread of all of these stories is that there is no capacity in the system to meet demand.  One would expect the capacity we have had to be maintained, but, unfortunately, that is not the policy of the Government.  I am cathaoirleach of the Save Navan Hospital campaign, probably one of the most successful campaigns in the State.  We have brought some 40,000 people onto the streets of County Meath in the past six years, in which time we have battled hard to ensure the emergency department will remain open.  However, it is stated Government policy, in its framework for small hospitals, that it will be made into a minor injuries unit.  I would love if that was not the case.  I ask the new Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who is from County Meath to publicly state it is not the case and that we will have a functioning emergency department in Navan hospital long into the future, as well as a full ICU, coronary care and anaesthesia service to back it up.  I will wait for the Minister of State to make that statement.</p> <p> Capacity is obviously dependent on a number of factors.  It is dependent on efficiencies, better management and keener input costs, but it is also dependent on investment.  This is the area which is going to be difficult for the new committee into the future.  This is the ideological fault line between my party and the likes of Fine Gael which believes private funds have a part to play in this regard, but private funds need profit and profits in health care provision create inequalities.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to ensure health care is funded with public money to ensure there is equal provision in public health care services.  That is why, at this stage, I am sceptical about the likelihood of success with this new committee into the future.  Nonetheless, I wish it well.  I hope the Government means business when it states it will adhere to the outcome of the committee's deliberations.</p></speech>

In so far as this new committee can contribute anything, its contribution will be to moving away from a failed policy that has been pursued for the past decade at least and pursued consistently by the last Government in pursuit of the mirage of universal health insurance, a policy it has finally abandoned.  If only it had listened to the criticisms we presented to that model right from the beginning, but finally, five years on, the previous Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, had to admit we were right and that it would cost more.  We had said in 2011 that it would cost more, but the Government just did not listen.  I hope, despite it having gone down that cul-de-sac, the new committee offers us some vehicle to look seriously at the problem and abandon failed policies.</p>  <p>  The list of ills and crises and the catalogue of suffering and failure to provide services for those who need them are simply too long to list.  I will just mention in passing some of the key areas that urgently need to be addressed.  They include, for example, the disaster in emergency departments, the latest manifestation of which is the figure of 50,000 people who walk in and then walk out of emergency departments.  Could there be a more severe indictment?  One can add to that number the people who did not even go in because they were afraid to do so, given that they knew how bad the situation was.  </p>  <p>  There are chronic waiting lists of people in chronic pain or in chronic need of hip replacements and of children waiting to see ear, nose and throat specialists.  There is a shameful situation in mental health services, where we do not have the 24/7 emergency services we need for persons who are suicidal.  In particular, there is the absence of sufficient resources to provide for individuals who go into emergency departments and say they are suicidal, only to be told, "Sorry, we are not treating you because you have alcohol and drink problems," which is in itself disgraceful when we need dual diagnosis and the resources to deliver such a service.  In contravention of European directives, children and young people are being placed in adult mental health wards.  There are outrageously long waiting lists to see occupational and speech and language therapists.  We hear about the deaths of mothers and babies in hospitals because of the lack of consultants and other staff.  I could go through the list, but I do not have the time to do so.</p>  <p>  Can we address all of these issues?  The only way we can address them, as we have been saying for five years, is by taking profit out of the equation.  When we talk about the need for a national health service from the cradle to the grave and funded through progressive central taxation, the other side often says it is a fantasy and asks from where we would get the money.  Of course, we have had the answer to this question provided recently by the OECD, when it revealed the fact that we actually spent more on health services in this country than almost anywhere else in the world; we spend way above the average.  Where is that money going?  Some &euro;13 billion comes directly from the Exchequer into the public health service which is in pieces, but another &euro;5 billion is also being spent on health services.  Where is that money going?  The CSO helpfully tells us.  Some &euro;2.68 billion is going in household, out-of-pocket payments, mostly in private health insurance which is going into the pockets of the private health industry.  Another &euro;2.7 billion is spent on pharmaceuticals and drugs.  Therefore, an extra &euro;5 billion is being spent on  unnecessary administration or going into the profits of for-profit health services, whether in the production of drugs or the private health care system.</p>  <p>  In a way, one can see this happening.  The two-tier system and the waste of money on private, for-profit health services are very obvious when, as I have said on a number of occasions in the House, patients go to St. Vincent's University Hospital or St. James's Hospital.  They find a war zone and are told they will be waiting 12, 24 or 36 hours, but they then hear on the radio an advertisement for the Blackrock Clinic: "Come here; you will not have to wait, as long as you can pay".  How many such private clinics are there?  They are all over the place.  We have the capacity, but, shamefully, only a tiny proportion of the population can access it, while we, the public, are subsidising it and lining their pockets.  What we need to do is take that profit element out of the equation and redirect the money into the public health service in order that we would have a national health system available all on the basis of medical need.  It is not difficult.</p></speech>

It sums up the problems people are experiencing in the health service which the new committee should examine and research.  Obviously, the Minister and the HSE also need to provide answers.  I have checked the details of the case with the constituent and they want to have this issue aired publicly.  People want to have such details aired publicly in order to get answers but also to ensure these things will not happen again.</p>  <p>  There was a catalogue of errors in the treatment of the woman in question, Mrs. Margaret Breen, who had a stroke in February.  Her husband, Felix, has raised these issues with the hospital and the HSE.  On Saturday, 20 February, Mrs. Breen suffered a stroke.  Her husband rang for an ambulance from Huntstown, Mulhuddart at 1.48 p.m.  The times have been confirmed by the National Ambulance Service.  Despite there being an ambulance and a fire station located nearby, the ambulance came from Maynooth, County Kildare.</p><p>It arrived at the house an hour later at 2.44 p.m.  According to reports on the ambulance service, it has eight minute and 19 minute response targets for ECHO and DELTA but this family had to wait an hour while the wife was clearly suffering a stroke.  There must be answers to this.</p> <p> To add insult to injury, the driver did not know the area, being from Kildare, and decided to go through Blanchardstown town centre on a Saturday afternoon, through the traffic and shoppers, adding to the journey time.  It was en route to Connolly Hospital when it was discovered there is no stroke treatment there at weekends.  The ambulance then had to make its way to the Mater hospital.  Obviously, it arrived very late.</p> <p> When Mrs. Breen was being treated at the Mater hospital, that was fine but in a specialist stroke unit, she suffered her second stroke on 23 February 2016 at approximately 6.15 a.m.  The HSE needs to explain to all of us and to her family why somebody in a specialist stroke unit would be left unaccompanied to go to the bathroom and not checked when she failed to return.  There was a 20 minute delay before anyone even noticed Mrs. Breen had suffered a second stroke in a specialised stroke unit.  There was a further delay in her examination by the medical team, who did not review her until 6.55 a.m.  These are all official times.  A CT scan was ordered at 7.06 a.m. but did not take place until 7.57 a.m.  Why does it take 51 minutes for a CT scan to be done on somebody who has suffered a second stroke in a specialist unit?  We also need an answer as to why there was a delay in the ambulance transfer to Beaumont Hospital.  Mr. Breen was telephoned at 8.10 a.m. to be told his wife had been transferred to Beaumont Hospital for an operation on her brain.  He was told an ambulance had been called but no ambulance call went through until 8.41 a.m.  A 999 call was made instead of a 2222 call and there were many other issues.  Mrs. Breen did not arrive at Beaumont Hospital for the procedure to begin until 10.15 a.m.  Four hours had elapsed between the woman having a stroke in a specialist stroke unit and being treated properly.</p> <p> Mrs. Breen has had intensive rehabilitation but she has lost her short-term memory.  We do not know what effect those delays have had on this woman's future quality of life and short-term memory recovery.  Why put out ads telling people to respond within minutes to a stroke if an ambulance will not arrive for an hour?  Why put out ads with taxpayers' money if ambulances cannot respond when people do notice a stroke?  There is an increased prevalence of stroke in society among young people.  This is a very serious issue and the committee, the Minister and the HSE must answer to this family with regard to why a woman waited four hours to get the treatment she needed.  Eventually, she had to have a brain operation.  There are real questions for the ambulance service.  I am running out of time.</p></speech>

It is past time some long-term structure was given to our health service.  I will refrain from criticising the HSE and its predecessors for not putting in place such a plan.  This is because for decades health authorities in this country have been chasing their tails fire fighting one problem after another rather than planning for the future.  This fire fighting was the result of, in a circular but predictable way, a lack of any long-term plan for the health service in this country.</p>  <p>  If a service is pared down to its most essential parts, as happened during the recent financial crisis, it becomes easier to see where the problems are.  This is for another day, however, and the committee has ahead of it probably one of the most important jobs in recent generations.  There is nothing more important where we stand now in 2016 than tackling our health problems.  What is required now is political maturity and an ability to work together and not stick rigidly to fixed ideological positions.  All that matters in any committee deliberations are patient outcomes and a process that leads to a modern, efficient and cost-effective service for everyone, notwithstanding their means.</p>  <p>  I wish to make one point in this debate which will resonate with Deputies whose constituencies cover rural areas such as mine, or areas of the country outside Dublin.  Yesterday, I saw a very interesting figure, that 41% of Irish people live outside urban areas.  An urban area is defined as one with a population greater than 1,500.  Dublin's population, city and county, is approximately 1.25 million.  Dublin, therefore, has just more than a quarter of the entire population of approximately 4.65 million.  I mention this because many Deputies in the House would feel the majority of the citizens of this country are playing second fiddle when it comes to infrastructural investment, particularly in health care.  Dublin is bursting at the seams in terms of transport, a lack of housing and other areas.  Billions can be invested in the cross-city Luas, an airport extension or new hospitals.</p>  <p>  While I did not agree with much of what the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, stated in a recent article, some of it made sense.  There is a huge lack of infrastructural investment outside Dublin.  This is simply a fact.  Health care is one of the most obvious areas.  University Hospital Galway is shoehorned into the middle of a medieval city, with no room to park or to expand and no plan for the future except for necessary but short-term replacement building projects.  It is supposed to be a centre of excellence but I would try persuading either the staff or the patients going through the accident and emergency department of this.  Cancer patients have to queue for hours or even days to be admitted.  I could go on and I am sure other Deputies have similar issues in their constituencies.  In Galway, we have all of this and an underutilised hospital campus of 150 acres of State-owned land at Merlin Park, a few kilometres away from University Hospital Galway.  This is an example of the issues the committee needs to examine.  We badly need vision in our health service.</p>  <p>  I do not for one minute advocate a one for everyone in the audience approach.  I fully realise that expertise in a given field has the best outcome for patients if centralised in a specialist centre.  I do not advocate a centre of excellence in every town and village in the country.  What I advocate is that the committee takes a good hard look at the services offered, how and where they are delivered and imagine our health system in ten years' time.  Imagine a system which does not have 90 year old patients endlessly waiting on trolleys, cancer patients endlessly waiting for admission or nurses and doctors at their wits' end trying to cope.</p>  <p>  Earlier I stated the committee has a hugely challenging task ahead but it is one with huge rewards.  This committee, and subsequently this House, have a generational opportunity to create a health service on which all our citizens can rely and of which they can be proud.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1331" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100034#HH00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and the establishment of the special all-party committee to develop a single long-term plan for health care.  As the Minister, Deputy Harris, has already said, now is the time to put the benefits of our economic success to work for the people so that we can help deliver the public services this country deserves.</p>  <p>  Today, there are still too many people on hospital trolleys in accident and emergency departments waiting for a hospital appointment or a surgical procedure.  With the make-up of the current D&aacute;il, we now have an historic opportunity to work together, take a cross-party approach and develop a long-term plan for health services that will deliver the services we all want for this country.  I firmly believe we should all work together on this and we can develop a plan with a vision of how health care can be delivered to the entire population.</p>  <p>  Coming from County Louth, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the health services.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is, unfortunately, regularly in the news for the wrong reasons.  Hardly a week goes by when we do not hear the number of people on trolleys in its accident and emergency department is among the highest in the country.</p><p>While I agree that one person on a trolley is one too many, I do not agree with the regular commentary which seems to judge Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital based on the number of patients waiting on trolleys as opposed to the services they ultimately receive.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the country and its staff are excellent.  I am basing this opinion on the views of people who have been treated in it.  I have met many people during the course of my constituency work who have been treated or cared for in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the overriding consensus is that once one gets past the initial admission procedure, the treatment received is second to none.</p> <p> In my home town of Dundalk Louth County Hospital has never been busier.  Last year alone more than 25,000 patients were treated.  This is despite the fact that the hospital was downgraded by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government and that at one stage it was feared that it would be closed completely.  Far from being closed, it is growing the list of services available, including the number of acute services.  </p> <p> In line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, the minor injuries unit in Dundalk will see its opening hours increase and the age at which patients can be treated extended.  </p> <p> One of the most significant problems I see in Dundalk with health services is the fact that too many people are still not aware of the many services available in Louth County Hospital.  Too many are still going to the emergency department in Drogheda when they could simply go to the minor injuries unit in Louth County Hospital.  By using the minor injuries unit in Dundalk as opposed to the emergency department in Drogheda, substantial improvements could be achieved in both hospitals.</p> <p> In the past few years I have worked closely with the previous Ministers for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar and Dr. James Reilly, to ensure a primary care centre is opened in Dundalk.  I now look forward to working with the new Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and his Department to ensure this much-needed primary care centre will finally open in Dundalk.</p> <p> Getting back to the motion, I firmly believe, as does the Fine Gael Party, that universal health care is the way forward.  It should also be noted that this approach is supported by the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the OECD and the European Union.  A successful universal health care programme, as described by the Minister, will have four main objectives: reducing unmet health needs, reducing inequality in access to health goods and services, improving service quality and improving financial protection.</p> <p> I fully support the motion on establishing an all-party committee to develop a single long-term plan for health care.  What I would not like to see happen is old-style party politics dominating the committee.  We have a unique and an historic opportunity to work together across the House to develop a plan that will shape the future of health care in Ireland.  We must not expect results to happen immediately; nor must we expect that simply throwing money at them will solve all of the issues.  For this vision and plan to be successful, it must consider all aspects of health care systems from the ground up.  We must consider work practices within the health service, what is working and what is not.  We must not be afraid to make hard choices if the end result will be a world-class health service that will be fit for purpose and service all of the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100035#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and wish to begin by congratulating the two Ministers of State and wishing them well in their new roles.  It is a sign of the times that we are having this debate and that the Government which is made up of Fine Gael Ministers supported by Independents, acknowledges that there is wisdom in all areas of policy formation other than that found on the Government benches.  We have lived through a period of five years when whatever was said by anybody on this side of the House was usually rubbished, when Opposition Deputies were accused of scaremongering and saying things for political advantage.  In fact, sometimes Members on this side of the House were merely raising awareness of some of the critical issues faced by men and women in the communities we represented.  To strike a note of caution, perhaps if Members on the other side of the House had listened to Members on this side a little more often during those five years, they might not be relying on Members on this side to ensure the adoption of policies into the future.  However, I welcome the new composition of the D&aacute;il and look forward, as the previous speaker said, to engaging constructively with the Government on how we can make the necessary improvements that will ultimately benefit the people whom we are fortunate enough and honoured to represent.</p><p>To strike another note of caution, I hope the new committee is not being set up ultimately to deflect responsibility if the necessary improvements are not made in the lifetime of the Government.  Unfortunately, when one looks back at what was promised in 2011 and what was delivered by 2016, many of the improvements in the health service were simply not delivered.  Elderly people are now waiting possibly three times longer for standard hip or knee replacements than in 2011.  Only last week an elderly person aged 81 years from County Longford contacted me about the severe pain he was in and looking to find out whether there might be any way his operation might be expedited.  I wrote to a particular hospital about this patient and stated he was quite visibly in awful pain.  To my surprise, on Monday the surgeon in that hospital rang me to tell me that he could not disagree with one thing I had written in my letter.  He asked me to use my position as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to say the hospital did not have the money to carry out operations and that he could be performing five operations a day but was currently only allowed to perform two.  I asked him innocently how long it took him to perform the two operations.  I remember that I asked him at about 11.45 a.m. by which time he said he had performed the operations to be performed that day.  I asked what he would do for the rest of the day.  He said he would have his lunch and probably read the <i>Medical Times</i>and then go home because he did not have any more work to do.  Surely no one in this House can say that that is appropriate.  Surely no one can stand over not giving highly qualified staff working in publicly funded hospitals and being paid from taxpayers' money the necessary funding to carry out the work that needs to be done, given that all the time people are suffering, in pain and on long waiting lists.  The two Ministers of State will need to address this issue speedily.</p><p>I wish to take the opportunity to speak about the disability sector.  It is yet another sector that needs radical attention.  In my constituency two people have been evaluated separately and had personal assistant hours approved.  One lady aged 43 years is practically confined to bed and totally reliant on her elderly parents to provide full-time care.  The HSE acknowledges that she needs assistance and has awarded her a number of hours but - wait for it - it does not have the funding to actually give a personal assistant for these hours.  It states, however, that if she wants to go into a nursing home, she can avail of the fair deal scheme.</p><p>In a similar case a 62 year old man had a stroke more than 15 years ago.  His wife provided full-time care for him.  Unfortunately, she passed away from cancer three months ago.  Who is to look after him now?  The HSE has been contacted and evaluated his case.  Again, it has confirmed that for this man to continue living in his own community where he has been cared for the past 15 years, he needs a home care package.  It has approved such a package, but, lo and behold, the patient has been told the necessary funding is not available for the package to commence.</p><p>If he wants to enter into a nursing home and apply under the fair deal scheme, he will be possibly looked upon favourably.  That is ludicrous.  There is no joined-up thinking.  Each department is working in silos where every department is looking at its own individual budget with no thought of the consequences on other budgets.  It makes sense to keep people in their home for as long as possible.  It makes social sense, it makes moral sense and, if one wants to look at it in brass tacks, it makes economic sense to provide the certain supports to keep people in their own home rather than putting them into institutions.  We must look at how the various elements within the department are working and how each section is utterly focused on its own budget and makes decisions on its own budget with no interaction with the various other sections within the HSE.  That is something that needs to be looked at by the committee.</p> <p> I take this opportunity to focus on the area of mental health.  I listened to the Minister, Deputy Harris, this morning on the issue of the &euro;35 million in funding transferred to other services.  It annoys me when people talk about time-saving measures.  The reason those people are not employed today is because somebody did not advertise in time.  They talk about the period of time it takes to advertise and go through the recruitment and that as a result, they will not be hired by the end of the year.  If they knew the funding would be there, why were the advertisements not issued in time, why did the process not start in time and why are the staff not recruited?  There was a conscious decision taken somewhere - it might not have been in the Department and it may not be the Minister's fault - that they would not start this process so that they would be able to peel off a certain amount of this funding and put it into another section within the HSE.  That is wrong.  From what I understood from listening to "Morning Ireland" today, the Minister stated that the decision was not set in stone and is under review.  I hope it is under review and I hope the Minister and the Minister of States use their positions of authority to ensure it is stopped and that, even if those necessary professionals cannot be employed by the end of the year, the money is spent where it should be, on the provision of mental health services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100036#KK00200"><p>This is a welcome and timely debate.  I fully agree with the motion.  If we can all sign up to changes and if we can sign up to a ten-year plan or a plan of whatever length in terms of the cycle of change, I do not have a problem but the changes I would like to see would not take ten years.  They would not take ten days, if we attach the importance to them that we should.</p>  <p>  The HSE is an unaccountable organisation.  It is accountable only to the Oireachtas committees and to the Minister for Health.  There is no accountability, to me and every other Deputy in the Louth-Meath Cavan-Monaghan area, other than by written request or by meeting an official.  Given the significant controversies that are arising, as we see in Cavan hospital, and as we see regularly in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and in County Meath, etc., we ought to go back to the system of accountability of the HSE at regional fora of Members elected to the Oireachtas.  That would be useful.  Such meetings should be held quarterly, where one could receive reports into the care provided by hospitals in one's region and could also raise, directly and publicly, the issues that arise as a result of those concerns.  That is something that is missing in the formula in terms of accountability.  If one could bring in before the regional Oireachtas Members the officials of the health board in a transparent accountable way and hold them to account for the issues that arise, it would be constructive for both sides.  One needs that creative tension between the administrators of the health service and the public representatives.  It would be a two-way process because the administers would be able to clearly identify to us directly the changes that they believe are necessary as well.</p>  <p>  Does it take somebody to be dying to get a medical card?  That is the question I must ask today.  In the past week I have had contact with two constituents who are terminally ill.  One of them has serious cancer and most of their bowel and stomach has been removed.  The other person has terminal heart disease and will be dead, the person tells me, probably within six months at the most.  In both cases, their income is higher than the limit for medical cards.  Both of them have been kindly turned down by the HSE medical card appeal system for a discretionary medical card.  It is a shame and a disgrace that somebody who is terminally ill should be deprived of the comfort of the concern of the community.  Such people should be given a medical card if they are terminally ill, regardless of their income.  It would recognise their importance as a human being.  It would recognise their battle to live as long as they can in the best way that they can.  It is a shame and a disgrace that constituents are telephoning me with those concerns in the past week.  I note, from listening to other Members in the Oireachtas, it is not unique to my good self.  We need to look again at the discretionary medical card applications.  The HSE needs to be much more empathetic towards families and the seriously ill.  It is unforgivable and unacceptable that the current system prevails.</p>  <p>  The other element missing in the health service is advocates for the elderly, for those who are terminally ill and for patients who are in hospital about whom families have concerns.  One telephones the hospital and leaves a message and perhaps the call will be returned or perhaps not.  One talks to the liaison staff and maybe they will or will not be sympathetic to the point one is making.  What we need in the HSE are advocates whose full-time job is to deal with the bureaucracy for and on behalf of the patients who lie in those beds who are not getting the treatment that their families feel they need or who need to be in hospital and are not, and who will be accountable to the patient and families.  I recognise and welcome the work that the patient liaison staff do but I am not convinced that they are on the side of the patient.  What we need is a clear, absolutely committed and fully funded advocacy service that will reach out and meet the needs of those people.</p>  <p>  Never is this more important than when people have dementia.  I and every Member of this House are aware of people who suffer from dementia, the problems in the families and in the homes, and the fear that people outside of the immediate family have about getting involved.  It is like the way cancer was treated many years ago.  People do not know what to do or what to say.  We need to reach out much more to people with dementia and to the families who support them.  One should not forget the family gives day and night support, 24 hours a day seven days a week, to keep them in their home.  If anything must change in society, it is the way we treat people with dementia and the way we interact and support the families who are caring for people who have that illness.  In particular, I welcome the nomination of a representative from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to the Seanad.  I do not know whether it was Fianna F&aacute;il.  Whoever made the nomination, it is a welcome place where the person can articulate views on what should be done in this area.  I would fully support such concerns and views.</p></speech>

We need to articulate their needs on a national level.</p><p>Returning to the wonderful HSE, it is more a hide and seek than a HSE.</p><p>For two years, I have been trying to get at the facts regarding a death in County Louth and find out what went wrong with the ambulance service that night.  For some reason, no ambulance turned up and the poor, unfortunate patient died tragically.  He was brought to hospital in a Garda car.  It was new year's eve, and a critical member of the ambulance crew had not turned up for work, which meant the service was one ambulance down.  The absent crew member went and worked in the private sector as a private ambulance worker on the night on which the man died.  I do not know how it impacted on the events in the Louth, Meath and Cavan area.</p> <p> I have been frustrated by the HSE and the system.  The case is before the Information Commissioner for the second time in an attempt to get at the facts of the case.  I am not seeking the name of the ambulance driver concerned.  I want to know what happened, and why and how we can ensure it never happens again.  It is unacceptable for somebody to leave the ambulance service and work in the private sector on the busiest night of the year.  I do not know why the young man died.  I do not know whether he could have been saved had an ambulance reached him in time.  The fact that concerns me most is that no ambulance came within the required period of time.  I want to get at the truth of it.  It has taken two years to get this far, but I will find out.</p> <p> It is a disgrace that we must go through this and that the transparency, knowledge and accountability of the ambulance service is the way this.  This is why I return to my point regarding accountability in the Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan region.  The old health board system was not bad in terms of accountability.  We are not talking about interfering in the process but about asking the questions.  At the health board meetings one could ask directly what was going on, which we cannot do now.</p> <p> I am very concerned about the treatment of the elderly in nursing home care, both private and public.  Shameful and disgraceful acts are still happening to our elderly in many institutions.  I will return to it very soon in the public domain.  We need more inspections.  HIQA is doing far fewer inspections than it should.  One is lucky if it visits a nursing home once a year.  HIQA must be far more active and involved in what is happening and we need much more transparency and accountability.  For whatever time is left to me in this House, I will push this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100037#LL00200"><p>I thank all the parties and Independent Deputies who have signed up to the motion before us.  There is much concern about the fact that we have a minority Government, and those concerns may, in time, prove to be well-founded.  While I hope they do not, they may.  However, the minority situation also provides the D&aacute;il with a voice it has not had before.  It provides the D&aacute;il with the opportunity to table motions and legislation and build cross-party coalitions for good ideas.  While the Social Democrats initiated the motion before the House, it is a motion of the D&aacute;il, supported by all parties and groups.  Hopefully, through this cross-party approach, we can achieve some important breakthroughs in health care.</p>  <p>  The motion calls for the establishment of a committee to examine four specific health care challenges, namely, the existing and forecast demand for health services; how to progress a model of health care that advocates the principles of prevention and early intervention, self-management and primary care services, and integrated care; the different funding models available, which I imagine the committee will spend much time on; and how best to reorient the health service from an acute-based system towards an integrated, primary and community care system.</p>  <p>  The motion outlines &ldquo;the need to establish a universal single tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay&rdquo;.  It is a very serious statement for the D&aacute;il to make.  It is a cross-party statement signed up to by all the Independent Deputies.  It is a major departure from today's health care system and I very much welcome the fact that the statement has got such agreement in the House.</p>  <p>  There is more that most, if not all, Members agree on.  They agree that our health care system should provide a high quality, modern and timely service which should be provided as close to the patient as practicable.  They agree our health care system should be cost-effective and should invest in prevention and early detection.  They agree our health care system should protect people&rsquo;s dignity, which our clinicians try to do every day but which, sadly, they are not always able to provide, for a variety of reasons.  They agree that our health care system should be a rewarding and exciting place for clinicians and non-clinicians to work in and that it should be open to change, responsive to concerns and accountable for its work.  I, and many Members of the House, would argue that this is not the case.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise some of the successes we have had in health care, including the great success and progress in paediatric leukaemia treatment during recent years.  However, the system is struggling.  International comparisons do not suggest Ireland does very well.  For example, the European Health Consumer Index ranks us 21st out of 35 countries, which puts us close to the bottom of the middle group.  The index also found that we have the longest waiting times for emergency care in Europe, which we must take very seriously.  Today, nearly 300 people are on trolleys.  In west Wicklow and Kildare, more than 1,800 people are awaiting speech and language assessments.  The vast majority of these are children, and the waiting time is 18 months to two years.  By the time some of those children receive care, much of the opportunity to provide help has been missed.  Over the weekend, we heard the bone density scanners in Galway University Hospital have been shut down.  We have two high-tech machines that had been running five days a week, and both have been mothballed due to lack of staff.  We cannot allow this.</p>  <p>  The Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital has seven operating theatres which used to operate every day and a surgeon in a given eight hour list could do approximately seven procedures.  Two of the operating theatres have been closed indefinitely and another two have been closed for refurbishment with no understanding as to when they will re-open.  Only three of the seven operating theatres of the Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital are being used.  It is worse than that.  A given orthopaedic surgeon takes one of the three operating theatres for a given day.  The surgeons are being told they can have a theatre only every second or third Monday, for example, given that only three are available.  They are also being told not to do as many procedures as they could.  For example, rather than doing seven procedures, they are told to do only four, and then go home.  The HSE will still pay the &euro;22 million it costs to run the hospital, and will pay the surgeons, theatre teams and all the costs.  The reason the surgeons must go home is that the only thing the HSE will not pay for is the implants.</p><p>We have a hospital, surgeons, technicians, operating theatres, wards, a car park and insurance.  We are going to pay for all of these, but we will just not pay for implants.  Therefore, rather than having seven operating theatres within which six or seven procedures could be carried out each day, we have three within which perhaps four procedures are performed each day at more or less the same cost.  We paid &euro;22 million for the hospital and some of the &euro;1.5 million for implants.  That is the what is happening in the hospital system.  Consequently, those who can afford it can avail of private care.  The waiting time to see a surgeon to whom I spoke recently was 18 months in the case of his public list but only six months in the case of his private list.  Therefore, there is a two-tier system.  There is health care for those who can afford it but not for those who cannot.</p> <p> What is frustrating is that it is not due to a lack of funding.  It is not that there is not enough money going into the HSE.  We have the second highest expenditure ratio on health care in the OECD.  We spend money, but we do not get the service we should for it.  The issue is not clinicians.  We have some of the best trained clinicians on earth, as well as some of the best doctors, nurses and surgeons.  We have the second highest expenditure ratio on health care, yet we are effectively telling the National Orthopaedic Hospital to close more than half of its operating theatres, not to carry out as many procedures as possible on patients with deteriorating conditions which will result in their ending up in wheelchairs because we do not have the money for implants.  That is what is happening on a daily basis.  </p> <p> There are many reasons for the low performance rate in the health system. There is a lack of local autonomy for hospitals and there is a poor level of accountability and transparency in the HSE.  There is little econometric analysis to show where we need to provide health care.  We do not have integrated ICT systems for the management of patient records.  In many places we have silos rather than continuous and holistic care pathways.  We have a deep culture of mistrust between clinicians and managerial staff across the health care system.  It is corrosive.  However, such a culture does not prevail in other countries in which I have worked.  There is little access for patients to clinical quality data.  Consequently, they do not know which hospitals are good and which are bad.  Some are good and others not so good, but we are not allowed to know which is which.  There are also poor working conditions for clinicians.  The list goes on.</p> <p> Each of these operational challenges is solvable, but they are not being solved.  Why?  It is because behind it all there is a lack of vision.  We cannot achieve success in health care because we have not agreed what it is.  We cannot give managers and clinicians the tools they need to succeed because we have not told them what we want them to do to succeed.  We need a unified strategy for health care, but for that we need to know what it is to achieve and right now we do not know what that is.  That is why the motion is important.  It will bring together a cross-party group to which we can all bring political ideas, but I hope it will not be used as a political football.  We can bring the group together to ask some of the following questions.  </p> <p> What are the health care services we need and where are they needed?  How do we support prevention and early detection programmes?  How can we move to an integrated primary care system?  How much money are we willing to spend on health care, as we can spend as much as we want to spend on it?  How will we raise the money?  If we can make progress on these questions, we can put a long-term system in place with agreement on what it is we are trying to achieve, how we are trying to achieve it and, critically, how we will pay for it.</p> <p> We need to be honest about some uncomfortable political truths which the committee will have to examine.  One is that a modern health care system requires an increasing amount of money because it is becoming more sophisticated and people are living longer.  Another is that a modern health care system is of a scale which makes it impossible for all services to be delivered everywhere throughout the country.  We will have to have a serious conversation about that issue.  Another truth is that some hospitals are simply better than others and that people have a right to know which are doing well and which are doing badly.</p> <p> We need a vision for health care for which we need cross-party support.  We must also learn to start trusting clinicians and managers in primary care centres, hospitals and hospital groups.  </p> <p> I wish whoever will serve on the committee well.  They will face some very difficult technical and political issues.  If the committee can succeed in bringing back to the House a vision for health care and real options in terms of how much it will cost and how we can fund it, we can start to move on and accept that if we are to spend more on health care than almost any other country, let us have the best health care system in the world for that money.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100038#MM00300"><p>I will speak first.  I am delighted to speak to this all-party motion to establish a committee to devise a long-term strategy for health care.  I hope it will be as successful as the Sub-committee on D&aacute;il Reform on which I served since the first meeting of the D&aacute;il and which was chaired most ably by the Ceann Comhairle.  All members of the sub-committee represented the Members elected to the House.  It was very constructive and positive and while its members held different views, they came to a consensus.  If we can achieve the same with the new committee that is being established with the Members who will serve on it seeking to achieve something positive for the population that will ensure the delivery of health services will be much improved, that will be a very good outcome.  I urge Members who have not thought of serving on it to put their names forward and to serve on the committee if they get the opportunity to do so.  It will be an enriching experience for them and I hope the outcome will one of which we can all be proud and that we can all look forward to implementing its recommendations.</p>  <p>  Much of the focus of the health service is on the difficulties that arise within it.  However, any of us who has had occasion to experience the health service has found that once one is in the system, one is looked after very well.  The front-line staff are fantastic and patients receive exceptional care.  The focus will be on whether there are delays in emergency departments and whether there are patients on trolleys to try to come up with strategies to reduce such delays.  </p>  <p>  The focus of the Government is on improving people's health and well-being to keep them out of the health system.  This is a positive direction to take.  We want to put strategies in place that will ensure people will take positive steps to improve their health and well-being and that of their children through schools and in communities and through taking responsibility for their own health helped by public information programmes, the HSE, Departments and cross-departmental efforts to ensure people will become more physically active and cut out or cut down their alcohol consumption and tobacco use.  Some of the figures are stark.  When we consider all of this, we note the importance of focusing on what we can do for ourselves, ably assisted by the agencies charged with responsibility of assisting us in that regard.</p>  <p>  The level of obesity is of great concern.  I am conscious of it as a parent who has reared children and I also see its high incidence among young people.  Unfortunately, one in four children and around 60% of the population are obese.  I will have to look into my own heart on this one.  I always thought I was curvaceous, but I have been told I am obese; therefore, I had better do something about it.  We are getting older and need to maintain our cardiovascular health to try to resist developing conditions that will leave us prone to having a stroke, a heart attack or developing cancer and to all of the other difficulties that we all know only too well having seen family members suffer from some of these conditions or bad health outcomes.  Obesity levels are, unfortunately, also higher among those in the low income bracket in society.</p><p>That is something we need to be concerned about.  We need to look at the type of food people are eating and to encourage them to eat better food and to avoid fast food.  Actions will be put in place in the coming months in terms of our obesity strategy which we will, hopefully, launch very soon.  There will be actions in terms of the public alcohol Bill which will address among other things preventing young children from being exposed to advertising and the marketing of alcohol.  There is quite a lot of action taking place.</p> <p> If we look at obesity again, "Operation Transformation" on RTE is partnered by the Department of Health.  There are also partnerships with the GAA in terms of getting young people active and moving.  All of these things are very beneficial because physical activity is good not only for one's physical well-being but also one's mental health.  Reading into my brief recently, I came across a figure on alcohol consumption and its impact on people's mental health.  As it is a depressive, people who are hoping for a lift might only get a temporary one.  In the long-term, however, they will not get any benefit from it.  In fact, the incidence of alcohol in relation to suicide shows that it is involved in more than 50% of cases.  That is something we need to take care of because it is of great concern to me in my new role.  The national physical activity plan, which I touched on earlier, is also of incredible importance.  It is something I urge everybody to have a look at to see how they can use the ideas contained in it to encourage those within their communities to engage also.</p> <p> There are many challenges but I am very optimistic.  If we can focus on a practical level on keeping people out of the health system and have them take positive actions in terms of their own health, it will cost a lot less and we will all have longer and healthier lives.  That is what all of us want for ourselves and our children.  I hope sincerely that when the committee is established, there will be a very positive attitude to it and that people will adopt a very constructive approach.  At the end of it, I hope we have something we can all stand over, be proud of and see delivered into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100039#NN00200"><p>I wish Deputy Simon Harris the very best in his new role as Minister for Health.  I ask him to take charge of all aspects of health to ensure that there is accountability in our health service.  I think back over the years and my time as a member of Kerry County Council and it seems to me that former Ministers for Health were not really accountable for health at all.  They threw it back to the HSE.  In reply to any question asked in the D&aacute;il, a Minister would say he or she would refer it to the HSE.  If one was at the HSE forum in the County Hall in Cork and asked the HSE to account for something, it would refer it back to the Department.  The buck needs to stop with somebody.  I ask the new Minister, who is a fit young man himself, to take charge of the Department of Health to ensure that the service is properly run and overseen.</p>  <p>  Are there too many officials in the HSE rather than front-line staff?  Front-line staff in the hospitals in Kerry, including nurses and those on the floor especially at night, are, and have been, under tremendous pressure.  There are clearly not enough nurses.  At University Hospital Kerry in Tralee and at Killarney Community Hospital, staff are visibly under pressure every day of the week.  If a nurse goes off sick on a ward, which happens, the rest of the staff are under severe pressure for the duration of the shift.  We need more nurses and that must be addressed.  There is a problem with recruiting GPs in rural areas.  I highlight Rathmore in Kerry where it is a real issue now.  Graduating GPs are not inclined to stay in our country.  They cost a great deal to educate but in one year - 2014 - 89 of the 91 who graduated left the country.  Something has to be done to rectify that and, as such, I call on the Minister to ensure it is.</p>  <p>  Every morning an account is given on radio in Kerry of the number of patients on trolleys.  It happens all over the country.  Why is that so?  Why can we not sort it out?  In Kerry, it appears the reason is that so many of our wards are closed.  At University Hospital Kerry, two or three wards were closed completely four or five years ago because they could not be staffed.  Staffing is the issue.  The new community hospital in Kenmare is only half open as is Dingle Community Hospital.  The grounds for the hospital in Dingle were given over by the landowner for free to build a community hospital for the people of the area and yet a lot of its accommodation is being used as office space for the HSE.  I deplore that because it is not why the hospital was built.  </p>  <p>  Turning to mental health, a new unit has been built at Deer Lodge on St. Margaret's Road in Killarney.  It has been completely finished for almost 12 months but there are no staff available for it.  Sadly, close to my home in Kerry, four people have committed suicide.  I am not saying the opening of this unit would have prevented that but the unit has been built for a purpose and is not serving one as long as it remains unopened.  I ask the new Minister to address that issue immediately because the unit in Killarney is needed by all of the people in Kerry.</p>  <p>  We had what we were told was a reconfiguration of the ambulance service two or three years ago.  "Reconfiguration" is a terrible word because I take it to mean a reduction in service rather than a reconfiguration of the service.  In Kerry, and I suppose it is the case nationally, the rule is that an emergency hospital ambulance cannot take a patient to a district hospital.  We had a case on the Muckross Road in Killarney where a patient could not be taken by the emergency ambulance to the district hospital in Killarney.  The man took his last drive in the world in the back of a builder's van when the doctor involved secured a wheelchair to put him into it.  We are supposed to have intermediate care vehicles to take care of that situation but in the south, sadly, there are no staff to operate them.  I ask that the issue be addressed.  There is no point having vehicles if there is no one to drive them.</p>  <p>  What is happening with home help is a serious issue for me.  Home help is vital to keep elderly and disabled people in their homes for the last years of their lives but it has been seriously cut.  A great many people are in contact with my office each day to ask about hours or to say that the hours that they already had have been cut.  In one case, an elderly woman of 88 years of age was getting five half hours over five mornings but that has been cut to two half hours.  The woman was born in 1928 and has given her life to the country.</p><p>After spending her life rearing her family and doing her best for everyone she met, this is how she is being treated.  Her home help has been cut from five half hours - a half hour each morning - to two half hours.  A blind man in another part of the constituency has had his home help removed at the weekends.  On Saturdays and Sundays, he gets up and tries to put on his clothes but because he cannot see, they are upside-down and inside-out.  He burns himself with water whenever he tries to make himself a cup of tea.  He lives alone and his neighbours are worried about him.</p> <p> It is not fair, as people do not get better at weekends or on bank holidays.  It is sad to think that on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and new year's day, when all of the world is operating under the guise of peace and good, or on any other bank holiday, there is no home help for some people.  This matter must be addressed.  Surely doing so would be cheaper and easier than putting people into nursing homes.  Some of them die after a few weeks of being in a nursing home.  If they could be helped to stay in their own homes, it would mean so much to many and save the country a great deal of money.</p> <p> Kerry has a separate issue and is under more pressure.  People are as entitled to live in Kerry as in any other county.  A few weeks ago, we had the case of a patient whose address was given as Ballydesmond, Mallow, County Cork.  While that is her correct address, she is actually on the Kerry side.  If she was on the Mallow side, she would get 20 hours of home help per week but because she is on the Kerry side, she only gets ten hours per week.  We are in the same country, so everyone should be treated the same.  All of the children of the country should be cherished equally.  This matter must be addressed.  There are no ifs or buts about it and I will not settle for anything less.  People who need home help should get as much of it as possible and it should be distributed equally to everyone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100040#OO00300"><p>I thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate.  It has been a valuable experience, as I have heard many good and different ideas and positive contributions.  A number of Deputies proposed solutions to a number of the problems in our health services.  The committee has significant potential to develop further solutions to some of the issues that have been raised in this debate and it can bring a clear plan to the House.  As many Deputies stated, however, any recommendation from the committee must be implemented.  Health is an important issue and must be placed at the heart of Government and Government policy.  I will do my best to ensure that this happens.</p>  <p>  The funding, reform and management of our health services are important matters.  As such, I confirm my support for the motion establishing the committee on the future of health care.  One of the motion's key aims relates to achieving the best health outcomes and value for money by reorienting the model of care towards primary and community care where the majority of people's health needs can be met locally.  This is of particular importance in supporting people with disabilities.  According to the motion, the committee will examine how to progress a changed model of care that advocates principles such as early intervention, self-management, greater use of primary care services and integrated care.  These are important principles for any health system.</p>  <p>  A key Government aim is to provide services and supports for people with disabilities that empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing services of their choosing and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the programme for a partnership Government and is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  As part of our commitment to equality of opportunity for all citizens, we will support people with disabilities in maximising their potential by removing barriers that impact on access to services, education, work and health care.  Particular focus will be placed on supports at key transition points, namely, going to school; progressing to further training or education; commencing employment; and moving into new homes.  These are key elements of our plans for the coming months.</p>  <p>  This is a time of major change in the delivery of services and the Transforming Lives programme has already been embarked upon.  I urge all Deputies to examine it.  Meeting the needs of the individual is at the heart of our disability services and the aim of the Transforming Lives programme is to put people with disabilities at the centre of everything we do.  Its implementation will mean a seismic shift in how disability services are funded and provided, moving choice and control from professional administrators to where it rightly belongs, that being, the individual with the disability and his or her family.  Services and supports will be delivered with greater efficiency, transparency and accountability.</p>  <p>  These issues are covered by the programme for a partnership Government but so is another important issue, namely, cystic fibrosis services.  We will endeavour to ensure that everyone with cystic fibrosis will get a top-class service.  Capital investment in emergency departments is also required.</p>  <p>  To speak more broadly, I will discuss children with disabilities and people with serious illnesses.  On page 56 of our programme for Government, we plan on extending medical cards to the approximately 10,000 children in respect of whom domiciliary care allowance is received.  A number of Deputies rightly mentioned mental health services.  We must bring further capacity to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS.  We need more 24-hour supports in primary and emergency care.  We must consider those in our wider society who need our help.  As such, the Government is examining the idea of increasing the disability benefit, allowances, carer's benefit and the blind person's pension.  As Deputies probably know, the &euro;1,700 respite care grant resumed this week after it was cut.  Some 17,000 carers are on the register for this grant but there are many other carers who are not.  My colleagues might highlight this fact.  I am also considering the introduction of a new mobility scheme and since we are discussing reform, it is important that we ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The programme for Government contains many other things that we all want to do.</p>  <p>  The new committee has the potential to cause a seismic shift in the long-term vision for health care and health policy.  I look forward to the committee's development of a political consensus on a long-term plan for health services and the health of citizens, especially the most vulnerable in society.</p></speech>

The issue is central and fundamental to us.  Mental illness is one of the most serious social issues facing our country today.  There is not a townland or housing estate that has not experienced the horrific, silent funeral that a suicide brings.  We all have attended funerals where the grief of the family is immeasurable.</p>  <p>  This D&aacute;il, the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, has a great responsibility to make meaningful progress on this issue.  It is generally accepted that the mental health service is the poor relation of the HSE.  This was brought home to us when the talks on the formation of the Government were taking place.  At the time money was diverted again from the mental health budget.  As Minister of State Deputy Finian McGrath said in his speech, the mental health service has to get extra resources.</p>  <p>  In 1950, 76 suicides were recorded in this country.  By 2011, this number had increased more than sevenfold.  From 2001 to 2007, there was a significant reduction in the suicide rate but, unfortunately, suicide has since increased very significantly.  This can be linked to the lack of funding being allocated to the mental health service.  We have the fourth highest youth suicide rate in Europe.  It is very hard for us as elected representatives to see young people looking for help and not being able to gain access to it.</p>  <p>  My constituency, Tipperary, feels it has been seriously hit by the lack of resources.  It is hard to believe that a county with 160,000 people has no psychiatric beds.  If one is in the south of the county, one has to go to Kilkenny to gain access to a psychiatric bed.  If one is in the north of the county, one must go to Ennis.  In my town, Thurles, there is a clinic that serves 34,000 people but it is a clinic only in name.  It has no occupational therapist and no psychiatric counselling.  Only medication is provided for the patients who attend.  If we are to be serious about mental health and access to mental health facilities, we must put the resources in place to ensure people can avail themselves of them.</p>  <p>  A decision was taken a number of years ago to close St. Michael&rsquo;s in Clonmel.  I hope that in the lifetime of this Government we can again have psychiatric beds available in our county.  In the past couple of weeks, the HSE took the decision to close Mount Sion in Tipperary.  It is a residential facility for people with mental illness.  At its peak, the facility was able to cater for 19 patients.  There are now nine patients domiciled there.  Recently, elected representatives and relatives of the patients in Mount Sion met representatives of the HSE, who gave us a commitment that they would re-examine the decision to close the facility.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the relatives and hear at first hand the good work the facility is doing.  If Mount Sion is closed, another part of the infrastructure in Tipperary will be taken away.  It will make our job of providing proper facilities for people with mental health problems all the harder.  I hope the HSE will reconsider its decision and keep the facility open.</p>  <p>  The HSE is telling us the larger units are not the way forward but the reality is that the facility has worked well.  It worked well when it had 19 patients and residents.  Now the HSE is saying the infrastructure is not up to HIQA standard but a very small investment would bring it up to that standard.  I appeal to the Minister to have the HSE revisit its decision.  I hope a positive outcome will emerge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100041#PP00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  That we are now openly talking about mental health is an example of how we are moving forward in society.  We are identifying that people&rsquo;s mental health is not always as good as it could be and that we should not be afraid to seek help.  If one sprains one&rsquo;s ankle, one seeks help.  One goes to the doctor or the physiotherapist until one is fixed, after which and can walk fine again.  For too long, people were afraid to speak out about how they were feeling.  Then the way they were feeling became normal and they probably did not realise in the end they were not well.  People around them may not have realised they were not well and needed help.  It is wonderful now that we can actually speak about this and ensure our loved ones are looked after.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the services required to help them, irrespective of their age, are put in place.</p>  <p>  I was serving as Acting Chairman when Deputy Troy spoke about his feelings on a previous occasion in this debate.  When he spoke, I felt I sometimes feel a little like what he described.  That weekend, I was speaking to some friends and my family and I said there was a very interesting contribution in the Chamber.  My friends and family said they also feel a little like what I described.  It dawned on me, having thought quite a bit about it, that we all experience anxiety, nervousness or depression at one level or another.  Some days one might be down, which is normal enough, but it is when one cannot get back up again that one could be getting into trouble.</p>  <p>  Post-natal depression is a big issue for women.  Sometimes women feel there should not be such a thing as post-natal depression and that they should be full of joy with their new bundle of joy that is creating such love in their family.  Perhaps they feel so bad that they feel so bad.  It is important that people begin to realise that not feeling great is quite normal and that one can actually do something about it.  They should not be afraid to do something about it and they should speak out about it.</p>  <p>  We need to be more careful with one another.  I hear people use the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; in a context that is a little facetious or in the wrong context.  The word &ldquo;bully&rdquo; has very strong implications, whether it is used in the school yard or workplace.  If the word is just thrown around and becomes commonplace, it does not receive the emphasis it should receive, and it is not recognised how wrong it is.  It is not recognised that actions need to be taken to deal with bullying.  I urge people to be careful about how they use the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  We should be leading by example in this Chamber.  We should be careful with one another also.  We have to mind our own mental health.  I find dealing with social media very challenging.  One should note the negativity, vilification and viciousness tossed at public representatives as if they were figures of stone, did not feel the same as everybody else and did not have a family the same as everybody else.</p>  <p>  During the general election campaign, I gave up looking at social media altogether.  It is hard to believe but my life was actually threatened on social media.  I do not believe the person who threatened my life had any intention of carrying anything out but, at the same time, it was not very nice to believe there was a man somewhere in the county who felt the world would be a better place without me and that he would be prepared to do time if I were removed from the world.  It is a horrible thing to take in as a public representative and a citizen who is free to move around.  It is entirely wrong that this type of behaviour from adults is tolerated.  We would not tolerate it in the playground from children.  Adults are leading by example on social media.  Children are on social media more often than they are probably in the playground.  Their screen time is enormous.  If they are looking at adults behaving in this fashion on social media, they will copy them.</p>  <p>  Social media has no rules and involves entirely new technology.  We are only learning about its potential and the positive and negative aspects of the Internet.  If adults believe it is okay to call one another names on social media, what will be next?  Will we start calling one another names on the television and in public debates or here in the Chamber?  Is that where we are going?  I feel very strongly that, as adults, we should be leading by example and show the children how to use social media in a way that is positive and constructive for them because it has so many benefits.</p>  <p>  This brings me to the topic of children, young people and the challenges facing them.  I believe there are children being bullied on social media in ways that we cannot even contemplate because we did not go through it ourselves.</p><p> We experienced childhood differently and were able to manage in the schoolyard and so on.  Social media is a whole new experience.  If I had a teenage child, I am not certain if I would be able to manage or even be aware of what he or she was experiencing.  In the past, the bully could be left behind in the schoolyard or playground.  Nowadays, the bully can follow a child into the bedroom of his or her home, supposedly the safest place we can be.  While parents need to be vigilant, society must also recognise that this issue needs to be addressed.  It is of critical importance that services are provided to support young people and that adults lead by example. </p> <p> Suicide was not widely discussed in society in the past.  The issue touches everyone, whether through extended family, friends or the local community.  Suicide is so devastating that people want to do everything in their power to prevent it from happening again.  We must reach out to people who are experiencing difficulties in life and let them know there are people who can help them.  </p> <p> According to the Central Statistics Office, men accounted for 391 of the 487 people who took their lives in 2013.  Men need to be able to talk to each other and should not be afraid to reach out.  Family and friends must also be sensitive to and support them.  </p> <p> Connecting for Life is an excellent strategy.  Launched in June 2015, it will be in force until 2020.  Empowering communities and individuals to improve their mental health and well-being is a good thing.  If the strategy is implemented over the 2015-2020 period, we will be in a stronger position to ensure people can live positive, healthy lives and will recognise that while not everything in life goes well, mechanisms are available to provide help in such circumstances.  Connecting with other people, physical activity and alternative practices such as meditation can be positive and should be encouraged. </p> <p> Funding for suicide prevention has been increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;11.55 million.  This is a significant increase which demonstrates how serious the Government and society is about helping people to overcome difficulties in order that they can have the positive and productive life to which we all aspire.</p></speech>

This problem requires a continuous national response by the Government and a local response by wider society and non-government actors, such as the community and voluntary sector.  Mental illness is widespread and there is not a family on the island which has not seen a loved one struck down by one of the conditions of the mind.  In too many instances, these conditions have resulted in the ultimate act of despair, namely, death by suicide.</p>  <p>  Suicide is not a choice.  It does not imply that a person has failed to adapt or has given up.  It is the terminal stage of mental illness.  My colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, bravely and movingly put into words the crippling physical and emotional symptoms of mental illness.  All Deputies wish him well in his recovery and thank him for the public service he provided in sharing his story.</p>  <p>  The way in which we conduct our political and public lives must become an example that will help create a society that is respectful of the truth.  Regardless of what walk of life we are in and what differences exist between us, we are all human beings on the journey of life.  Too often, I have watched news reports from the D&aacute;il showing supposedly adult politicians shouting insults at the other side as they engage in personal point-scoring.  While passionate debate is welcome and to be encouraged, all those involved in public life, particularly in politics and the media, have a special duty to engage in debate in a manner that shows respect for difference and informs fellow citizens of the complexities of our problems.  Debate should not be driven by shallow headlines.</p>  <p>  The mental health crisis is a symptom of the society we create and will become greater if we do not view prevention as equal to curative measures.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive must introduce a major mental health initiative and treat mental health on a par with cancer and heart disease.  It is only by having such a deep and broad focus that mental health will become the priority it clearly deserves to be. </p>  <p>  Modern society is too self-obsessed with perceived winners and losers.  We have too much black and white when shades of grey are much more common.  The pace of life is also increasing as we race to find the right school, children engage in the points race and people seek the right college and the perfect job, partner and house - in short, the illusion of the perfect life.  These aspirations are all sold by a consumer society that portrays a shallow view of perfection, one that is unobtainable and is a contributory factor to the strains being felt in the area of mental health.</p>  <p>  A positive and preventative approach is a vital pillar of delivering a coherent mental health strategy.  In this regard, young people and men must be targeted by a holistic plan which empowers them to be partners in the maintenance of good mental health.  I have been highly impressed by the Jigsaw project, which emanated from the Headstrong initiative.  Jigsaw is a network of projects designed to ensure that every young person has somewhere to turn when in need.  It does this by having centres in hub areas and pop-up clinics and centres to ensure hard to reach young people have relative ease of access to services.  It recently managed to provide a service throughout County Donegal.  I hope it will be able to provide county-wide services in counties Wicklow and Carlow.  While the Health Service Executive is the main funder, holistic and mental health programmes for young people must involve the Department of Education and Skills and all local authorities.  I am pleased to report that Wicklow County Council and the Bray Area Partnership are working to establish a Jigsaw service for County Wicklow.  Both bodies can be assured of my support, although I will insist on the programme being rolled out beyond the major centres of Bray and Greystones to reach into smaller towns such as Wicklow, Arklow, Blessington and Baltinglass as well as rural areas where mental health problems are escalating at an alarming rate.  </p>  <p>  Purposeful mental health services for everyone and the beginning of the end of the silent suffering of mental illness can be the lasting legacy of this D&aacute;il.  I hope that, as elected representatives who are in close agreement on this issue, we can achieve this objective early in the lifetime of the House.  This would send a strong signal to the naysayers and doubters that politics can be a force of real and positive change.  For my part, I will lead by example.</p></speech>

Today, I was appointed the Fianna F&aacute;il party spokesperson on old people, public health and health reform and I look forward to working with both the Ministers of State.</p>  <p>  Every year, thousands of students start a new chapter in their lives when they move to third level education.  This is a very exciting time for most students as it is probably the first time they have lived away from home.  For some students, however, reality sets in when the initial excitement of moving away from home and into new accommodation with friends without a night time curfew fades.</p>  <p>  The number of students in third level education seeking mental health services is mounting every year.  I recently met Professor Willie Donnelly, president of Waterford Institute of Technology, to discuss university status for Waterford.  I was shocked to learn that the institute of technology loses 20% of its first-time students every year.  Last year, for example, 400 students out of a total cohort of 2,000 left the college.</p><p>This cannot all be linked to mental health issues, as some students make the wrong choice or pick the wrong course.  Cuts to the number of career guidance counsellors can also be linked to this.</p> <p> Mental health issues for third level students have become more prevalent.  The waiting lists for counselling services are growing but these services are already over-prescribed and underfunded.  College life should be enriching and rewarding for all our students.  However, many students are struggling through their studies.  Many students find the transition to college life and living away from home extremely challenging.  This is having a detrimental effect on the mental health of students in colleges and universities around the country and often leads to problems with alcohol, drugs, body image, self-harm, bullying, anxiety, low self-esteem and difficulty coping with loss and grief.</p> <p> Colleges and universities offer services for those suffering with their mental health, including counselling services.  Unfortunately, this is not enough.  The student body is ever growing.  These students come from more diverse backgrounds and cultures, speak different languages and have different traditions, which can exacerbate the problem.  Despite the ever increasing student population, counselling services in colleges and universities have not kept pace with the growing numbers.</p> <p> Recent statistics have shown that in some colleges and universities, there has been a 16% increase in enrolments while the numbers attending counselling services on campus have increased by 33%.  Research has shown that over the past six years, the number of students presenting themselves to mental health services has steadily increased.  Anxiety disorder figure has increased from 19% to 32%.  The figure in regard to those suffering from depression has increased from 9% to 24% and there has been an increase in academic related issues from 19% to 29%.  Despite these figures, there has been no increase in funding.  Counselling services in our colleges are vital, essential and expected.  The lack of these services, coupled with waiting lists - in some colleges there is only one counsellor available, backed up by a pastoral care team - is having a severe impact on student's health and well-being.   Improved services are well overdue.  Counselling services in our universities and institutions must be increased and funded.</p> <p> It is time for us to take an active approach to students' mental health because if we do not deal with the issue at this level, we are only kicking the can down the road which will result in problems later.  The issue of mental health must be addressed.  It is no longer a stigma.  If people break an arm, they get the problem sorted.  The same approach needs to be taken for mental health issues.  These issues cannot be buried in the basement of a hospital as if they do not exist.</p> <p> In Ireland, suicide is a leading cause of death among young people.  The rate of youth suicide in Ireland is the fifth highest in the European Union.  That is 15 youth suicides per 100,000 15 to 24 year olds.  The suicide rate for teenage girls is higher in Ireland that in any other EU state.  That is a damning statistic.  There are not many Deputies here tonight to hear this but I will repeat that the suicide rate for teenage girls in Ireland is the higher than in any other EU state while the rate among young men is the second highest.  I was shocked when I read this.  This is a staggering statistic and the issue must be dealt with.</p> <p> I am pleased there is consensus among all parties on the seriousness of this issue.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State on the issue in the future.</p></speech>

I also congratulate Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy on her promotion to Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion.  I wish both Ministers of State all the very best in their new roles.</p>  <p>  As a Member of this House for more than nine years, I see it as very positive that every Member has had an opportunity to contribute to this debate and it is encouraging that so many Members have done so.  At this stage, virtually all Members have contributed.  Over the past number of weeks of debate, I have listened to many contributions.  Some constructive proposals have been made by Members from across the House and I have no doubt the Minister of State will take them on board and seek to have them implemented.</p>  <p>  It is essential that when people seek help, help is available.  In the area of mental health, it is vital that people are able to find good quality services and supports.  It is ten years since A Vision for Change was published but, unfortunately, the recommendations contained within that framework document have not yet been fully implemented.  There is little doubt that now, more than ever, there is an increased demand for mental health supports.  It is not acceptable that waiting lists are allowed to continue to grow.</p>  <p>  For example, the waiting list figures for mental health services for children, teenagers and young people in County Clare are stark.  The HSE recently confirmed the following waiting times for routine referrals.  Some 54 children are waiting up to three months; 31 are waiting between three and six months; and 18 are waiting between six and nine months.  In addition, 19 are waiting list for nine to 12 months; eight are waiting 12 months; another eight are waiting 13 months; six are waiting for 14 months; and one is still waiting 15 months on.  The HSE chief officer for community care in the mid-west region has recently confirmed that there is no waiting list for emergency cases, as children, teenagers and young people are dealt with on an emergency on-call basis.  However, every effort must be made to reduce the waiting lists associated with routine referrals for children, teenagers and young people as these waiting times are now stretching into years.</p>  <p>  Significant positive participation has taken place through community initiatives, such as the Darkness Into Light and the Cycle Against Suicide movements. These initiatives are primarily driven by young people.  In so doing, they are raising awareness about mental health issues.  I also want to compliment groups like Console and the Samaritans, which do marvellous work in County Clare and throughout the State.  It is important that people know that it is okay not to feel okay and that it is okay to talk about it.</p>  <p>  The biggest challenge in the battle to improve mental health facilities and services is presented by the shortfall of approximately 3,000 key staff.  If we are to tackle this issue and reduce the waiting lists, a dramatically enhanced focus on recruitment is required.  A root and branch review of staffing right across the mental health service is long overdue.  Funding for a new recruitment drive needs to be ring-fenced.  In this regard, I was very disappointed to learn that funding of &euro;12 million identified for mental health staff recruitment is to be used in other areas of health.  If the Minister of State takes one thing from my contribution to this debate, it should be that we must have a clear strategy in regard to the recruitment of key front-line staff, coupled with a budget that is ring-fenced to be used for the engagement of key staff, as identified in A Vision for Change.  I wish the Minister of State well and I look forward to working with her in dealing with the area of mental health in the future.</p></speech>

When it comes to mental health, prevention is better than cure.  That is the reason we need to equip children at a younger age with the skills that teach them self-awareness, self-worth and resilience.  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 recognises as a national aim that children should be "achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development" including "social and emotional well-being".  It also states that we should be working towards "rebalancing resources to place greater emphasis on prevention and early intervention".</p><p>Early intervention is not only cost effective in the long term, it is also the best way to mitigate risks in future behaviour and promote positive outcomes for children and<br/><br/>young people.  We have a duty to prepare children with the life skills to be able to face challenges in the future.  Education should be holistic so we need to look at a multi-strategy health promotion project which uses a whole-school approach to promote resilience in children of primary school age.  This strategy needs to link into the curriculum and one of the best ways to do that is to introduce health promotion as a compulsory subject in our schools.<br/><br/>In the Australian curriculum, students develop personal and social capability as they learn to understand themselves and others and to manage their relationships and lives while learning more effectively.  Effecting change at an early age is the best way to equip our children into the future with the skills to avoid mental distress, to recognise the signs of being unwell and to reach out for help when they are in trouble.<br/><br/>Adolescence is often described as the peak time for the onset of mental health difficulties with up to 50% of all cases occurring prior to the age of 14.  This relatively early onset points to the need for early intervention to prevent difficulties.  Using schools as health promotion sites poses difficulties.  The induction of teachers and professional development to deliver the curriculum in this process are paramount  but this in itself poses challenges.  We need to look at developing a compulsory curriculum that goes beyond the formal learning process.  Schools provide an important setting for this.  The evidence outcomes from the Australian model reflect this and it is something that needs to be duly considered for the Irish education system.  <br/><br/>We need to show immediate commitment in this area.  The cuts to counselling in our schools over the past number of years need to be reversed.  The spend on mental health as an overall percentage of our health budget needs to be brought in line with our EU counterparts at between 10% and 12%.  GPs are inundated with problems and often have to resort to short-term medication and, as a pharmacist, I do not see that as an ideal solution.  We need a holistic long-term approach.  Early intervention and a new curriculum in primary and secondary school are a long-term project that will require commitment and investment but will yield results and will benefit this generation and the next generation through their entire lives.  I ask the Minister to take this proposal on board in developing a new strategy for the future.  If he does, it will benefit the entire population.</p></speech>

We all face a challenge with regard to mental health.  Every day, Deputies meet people with varying levels of mental health problems and we have come across the ultimate situation where somebody commits suicide, leaving families devastated.  The question is what we can do about this problem and how we can reduce the numbers.  It is very important that we apply ourselves to this task as we applied ourselves in a previous time to reduce the number of people killed on the road, which we have done quite successfully.</p>  <p>  We must look at every facet of this subject.  One thing is certainly true, namely, that acute medicine has a much better ability to attract funding than continuous preventative medicine, which requires continuous investment without a very specific outcome.  This House has to support the ring-fencing of budgets for mental health.  We should also look at models of best practice.  Suicide numbers have gone through the roof in the past 30 years but there may be good reasons for that.  Some of it might be because of pressures in society but we must also take into account the much larger number of people who were locked up in psychiatric homes, although thankfully we do not treat these people in that way any more.  We have to see whether there is a third way that does not go back to the totally unacceptable first way nor leaves us with the present situation.  I have seen some examples of very good practice which are basically community based and very local.  All of these require funding and there is a tendency in the system to prefer money to be spent on a certain number of procedures rather than on continuous care.  The Minister has a major challenge in that regard but we also have a role to play.  If we insist on all the funding going into acute care, we cannot complain when it does not go into continuous care.</p>  <p>  I will touch on two other issues.  One is that we seem to be living in a world where bureaucracy is becoming more and more codified and where people have to conform to the code, whether that is in housing or in something else.  The code becomes more important than the personal or the individual circumstances.  There is an inability on the part of people to deal with all sorts of things in life, such as farm forms or housing, health and social welfare issues, while the system always wants things to be done its way.  Very little discretion is given to officials even when it is clear somebody has a health issue and this is something we have to look at.  We need to get back humanity and have discretion, particularly when dealing with people who quite clearly have health issues which mean they cannot deal with things in the way other people can.</p>  <p>  I believe in humanity and the benefits of dealing with people on their own terms.  One of the great shocks I had was finding out that one cannot legally get a medical card if one has no income, which sometimes happen on account of mental health issues.  Even when it is absolutely clear there is no cheating going on, people cannot get their card, which is bureaucracy gone mad.  It is inflexibility gone mad.  Students with problems who opt out of exams and want to go back to college are charged the full fees again.  If they can prove by a certain deadline that they had a medical issue, they can avoid this but people with a mental illness often do not follow all the rubrics, instead getting themselves into a total mess.  It is not just about the medical services but about society's attitude.</p>  <p>  The third issue is our large prison population as compared to 1950.  I raised this issue with somebody very senior in the Prison Service and he said the explanation is that we had a huge population in mental institutions at that time.  If the Minister wants to test this theory, he should go down to the female prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre in Mountjoy Prison, where he will find many people who should not be in prison because the issues that put them there are purely to do with mental health issues, in some cases allied to drug addiction.  To criminalise what is basically a medical problem is totally cruel.</p></speech>

I worked for quite a number of years as a guidance counsellor in a second level school and I also did a lot of training in counselling with the Cork social and health education project, so I have a personal interest in mental health.</p><p>As others have already said, schools have a significant role to play in this regard.  I suggest that guidance counsellors, in particular, have a fairly large role to play.  The power of a significant adult in the life of a young person cannot be under-estimated.  It is important to recognise that anybody - a parent, an uncle, an aunt, a teacher or a counsellor - can be a significant adult.<br/><br/>I am great believer in the role of youth services.  We should be supporting For&oacute;ige, Youth Work Ireland and other youth services, including the guides and the cubs, because they perform a huge function out there.  Quite often, a trained youth worker can identify a young person who is under pressure or stress and intervene to help him or her to get counselling or any other assistance that may be required.  The presence of a captive audience of children who might not want to be there, or who might be embarrassed, can sometimes make programmes in schools somewhat artificial.  Out-of-school informal education through youth services is very powerful and is something we should further develop.  The self-esteem of young people who are involved in sport and physical activity can be improved by the camaraderie and teamwork involved in such endeavours.  Similarly, we should encourage and help those involved with the President's award, Gaisce.<br/><br/>We must not forget that alcohol can play a major part in this whole area.  Alcohol is a depressant, as we know.  Unfortunately, it is a factor for many of the people I come across who are affected by mental illness.  Many, although not all, of those who commit suicide are drunk or hungover prior to doing so.  I would have a big worry and concern about the role of alcohol in this regard.<br/><br/>Loneliness can play a big part as people get older and are sometimes on their own.  That is why we should be supporting and encouraging organisations such as Men's Sheds, which can often encounter difficulties in finding premises and places to carry out their work.  It is said that men often help each other elbow to elbow or side by side.  They can talk when they are working on something together.  I think women can build up stronger networks, which is a strength.  Men often find it difficult on their own.  I think that is an area we need to focus on.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that mental health is a continuum.  We are all on that continuum.  Some of us are strong at times.  Every one of us can go down the other side when we are under pressure.  Politicians, in particular, can be very vulnerable.  We can get a lot of abuse.  It is hard to take.  It can be personal.  I detect far more camaraderie in this D&aacute;il.  There is not as much aggression as there was in previous D&aacute;ileanna.  I think we need to work together.  That is happening more and more now.  We are listening to each other a little better.  Society needs to try to cut down on the aggression.  The media have a role to play in this regard.  When politicians are in the media, it can be gruelling to deal with people who want to catch us out and say &quot;gotcha&quot;.  That seems to be the approach.  Rather than trying to find out what the issues are and having a proper discussion on them, some people prefer to take the &quot;gotcha&quot; route.  I ask the media to move away from that.  People need to try to move away from that.  We need to focus on the positive rather than on the negative.<br/><br/>William Glasser, who was involved in reality therapy some years ago, spoke about four areas of life that we should be strong on.  He spoke about the need to love and be loved, which is quite important for everybody.  If one is missing that, one is in trouble.  He also said we have a need for power.  This involves feeling worthwhile and achieving things.  Glasser's other two needs were the need for freedom and independence and the need to have fun.  He maintained that a person who was not having those four needs met was in trouble.  There are many different approaches to this issue.  Adler looked at the outcome of behaviour as a means of explaining why someone behaves in a certain way.  I could go on.  Durkheim was concerned about <i>anomie</i>and withdrawal from society.  There are many approaches to this issue.  As someone said earlier, counselling and talking therapies are very important.  Rather than going for the bottle and the pill all the time, it is crucially important to build self-esteem, self-worth and self-image.<br/><br/>As I have responsibility for equality and integration in my new job, I am conscious that mental health issues can feature strongly in debates on inequality and integration.  As we have seen, some of those coming here from abroad are experiencing trauma as a result of the unspeakable things they have seen and gone through.  Already this week, it has been reported that up to 900 people have drowned in the Mediterranean.  That is two 747s.  We are complaining about things here when these people are facing such trauma.<br/><br/>The high rate of mental health issues facing members of the Traveller community is of particular concern to me.  My Department is currently undertaking a three-phase consultation process with a view to putting a new Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy in place.  This will involve the development and implementation of a range of cross-cutting policy matters in order to address the issues facing the Traveller and Roma communities.  One of the key issues to have emerged so far from the public consultation on the draft strategy is the high rate of mental health problems experienced by members of the Traveller community.  In 2010, the all-Ireland Traveller health study showed that the suicide rate among Traveller men is seven times higher than the rate among men in the national population.  The reasons for this are multifaceted.  When the strategy is completed, it will address those mental health issues by way of specific actions to be implemented on a cross-departmental basis.<br/><br/>I would like to speak about the positive side of these matters as well.  When I attended the Traveller Pride awards earlier today, I was impressed, inspired and moved by the array of wonderful skill, talent and dedication in the Traveller community.  It was clear to me that Travellers have huge potential to contribute fully to Ireland if the barriers to their participation in society could be removed.  The overall winner at today's awards was a young lad of 14 - an amazing guy - who is a world handball champion.  I also met four young lads from Skibbereen who are going to do very well after making an absolutely fabulous model of one of the old Traveller barrel wagons and then deciding to mass-produce such wagons in flat packs to sell them.  They cannot keep up with the orders.  It is amazing.  The music played at today's event was absolutely inspiring.  Finbar Furey was there.  There is a great deal of work to be done in the Traveller community with respect to mental health.  Any group that is marginalised like that will have problems.<br/><br/>There is a huge amount of work to be done in this area.  I wish my colleagues well in their work.  We can make an awful lot of progress.  We can start here in this House by being a bit kinder to each other.  It does not cost anything to be nice.  It does not cost anything to listen to people.  Deputies should engage with people in a positive way rather than trying to put them down all the time.  If we start by adopting such an attitude here, maybe that can permeate outside.  Perhaps I am being naive or innocent but we should have a go.  I am already detecting or sensing that the new Members who have come into this D&aacute;il, and some of the older Members, are inclined to listen.  Maybe it is because this is a minority Government.  Perhaps we all have to listen now because we do not have what we had in the past.  We have to work together for the good of everybody because everybody can contribute in a positive way.  I am glad to have been able to speak in this debate.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and McEntee, on being appointed to their respective ministerial posts.  I also congratulate the previous speaker, my constituency colleague, Deputy Stanton, on his appointment as a Minister of State last week.</p>  <p>  In my constituency of Cork East, I deal on a daily basis with parents who are under great strain.  Many of them have children who are waiting to be assessed to see if they have Asperger's syndrome or autism.  Waiting lists for children to be assessed have spiralled out of control in my constituency.  It is clear that despite the great work of the child and adolescent mental health services, they are unable to deal with the current backlog of applicants who require assessment.  Parents have informed me that their children have been on waiting lists for assessment for up to 18 months.  This has placed many parents under a great deal of stress.  We all know that stress is one of the greatest causes of mental health illnesses.  The recurring message I am receiving from my constituents is that children and their families are being messed around.  A mechanism needs to be put in place to see how waiting lists for assessment for early intervention can best be reduced.  Many of these children require urgent assessment, which will in turn allow them to receive the best possible treatment.</p>  <p>  I recently spoke to a 47 year old man who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.  He told me it was as if he had been given his diagnosis and then wished the best of luck.</p><p>It is evident that the supports are limited to those who receive diagnoses, such as in this instance.  We now need to provide appropriate services for all ages so that people can receive the necessary care they require.</p> <p> It is high time the Government recognised that those who suffer from mental health issues do not stop suffering at 5 o'clock in the evening.  Parents and families who have children and siblings who require care will tell us that it is not a nine to five job for them.  Voluntary organisations throughout the country and in my own constituency do their utmost to be on the other end of the phone 24 hours a day.  However, many State services that are supposed to provide such support vanish after 5 o'clock in the evening.  As as result, many volunteer organisations now find themselves under great strain because of the ever-increasing workload and limited resources.</p> <p> We often associate the word "stigma" with mental health.  I pay tribute to the mental health awareness campaign that ran through the month of May.  We all had the green ribbon on and I see some of my colleagues are still wearing it today.  It was a good initiative that was put in place.  It is the 1916 centenary and we like to think that the words "stigma" and "mental health" do not have to be associated with each other.  However, the actions of some will mean that this will be never be the case.  I heard recently about a girl of 16 years of age who was taken into a hospital in Cork in handcuffs because she had tried to commit suicide.  The staff and garda&iacute; were quizzed by onlookers who were informed that it was a protocol for those situations.  What would anybody in the Chamber do if we witnessed this happening to one of our loved ones?  If this is the protocol, I suggest we devise a new one.</p> <p> We all agree that this D&aacute;il must find a new way of conducting business.  I firmly believe that on the issue of mental health, the way forward is something on which this D&aacute;il must, and can, form a cross-party consensus.  I have no problem acknowledging the work that my constituency colleague, Deputy Pat Buckley, does to raise awareness on suicide, nor do I have any problem in acknowledging the work that the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, did during her term of office with regard to mental health.  I am also aware of the good work that Adam Harris, brother of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, does in raising awareness for those with autism.  However, there is now an onus on us all in this Chamber to develop a mental health service that is fit for purpose.  I look forward to working with the Ministers to make my contribution.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate.  I already spoke on the issue of mental health in the debate on health which took place before this one.  I congratulate the new Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointments and I wish them well.  There is a huge job of work to do on this issue in both of their areas.</p>  <p>  We can all talk about what we each think is best in this sector but we must leave it to the professionals.  Some very important people who are hardly mentioned in the debate at all are the psychiatric public health nurses.  They do tremendous work and are certainly life-savers for some people.  They are at some people's beck and call.  That service is patchy throughout the country and it is one I would like to see improved on.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, mentioned guidance counsellors.  We have an agreement with Fine Gael to bring back ex-quota guidance counsellors and we want to see it implemented as soon as possible.  That is very important for students at that age.</p>  <p>  The implementation of A Vision for Change must be given leadership.  There are practical consequences throughout the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will know that a psychiatric unit is being moved from Navan to Drogheda, which has caused controversy.  I do not want to add to that controversy.  If someone tells me that it will actually improve the service for patients, I will accept it.  Unfortunately, with the HSE over the years, we have been told certain things, particularly in regard to the removal of doctors.  We were told it was in the best of patients but that turned out to be simply untrue.  I am sceptical of that move and it needs to be better explained.  Better leadership needs to be given on that issue.  If it will improve the service for people who are in dire need, it will be accepted.  Notwithstanding that, people parts of County Meath are worried that the move will have negative consequences.  It has to be explained, at the very least.</p>  <p>  I assure the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, that I am not going to ramp up political pressure on that particular issue if I am satisfied it is in the best interests of patients.  However, I am not yet satisfied as it has not been explained to me properly.  I would appreciate a written brief from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to explain exactly why it is happening or a meeting between the HSE and Members to explain the move and how it is in the best interests of patients.  That has not happened yet.  There are people who are happy to exploit any mental health issue but I am not going to do that in this case.  If it is not explained to me properly, I will do everything in my power to make sure that a better service is provided in case this is simply a cutback.  I note that it does involve a cutback to the number of beds in the north-east.  We are told that this is what A Vision for Change recommends but nobody has sat down with Members and explained that to us.  If that was done, it could alleviate the concerns.  The public will accept a better service.  Drogheda and Navan are not too far apart but it is a worry for people, particularly in the west of County Meath.  It is incumbent on us to look at these issues carefully and strategically and to deal with them properly.  We cannot always make political points, especially on this issue or on health issues in general, but nobody has made the case to me yet in regard to this move.</p>  <p>  I would like to address a number of other issues that have been addressed in the debate, which has been very useful.  As politicians, we have to make sure that the services are delivered.  We have had very helpful interventions from a number of well-known people.  Other people have come forward to say they were suffering in silence.  I suspect a number of people have been suffering in silence.  It is the very nature of the taboo in regard to mental health.  We all know many people who suffer in silence from mental health issues.  They will get the supports through their GPs, public health psychiatric nurses and, in some cases, through residential care in psychiatric hospital settings.  The funding has to be there to pay for that.  I do not want to see the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, having to deal with what the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, had to deal with over the past few years in constantly battling for money.  Fianna F&aacute;il has suggested a mental health authority.  The purpose of it would be to ring-fence the money and to make sure the cash is available for mental health services, as promised.  The money would then presumably be spent in the best way.</p>  <p>  Those are my thoughts.  None of us has a monopoly of wisdom on this issue but I suspect that practically all of us have experience at some level or other in this area.  Some people speak about it while others do not and that is their choice.  Each person's choice should be respected.</p>  <p>  I wish the Ministers of State well.  I am not speaking directly about the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is only in the job a week or two but in terms of the situation in Meath, leadership is needed to explain the move because otherwise, it will become another political football where the best interests of patients are forgotten.</p></speech>

If he arrives, he can take five minutes.  If not, I will continue.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and congratulate the Ministers opposite.  The fact we have Ministers with responsibility for mental health is indicative of the fact that this is an issue that has become much more prominent in the public mind and in the minds of politicians.  I recall growing up as a young man when mental health in Ireland was kept in a shrouded place.  People went to hospital but it was not discussed.  It was very difficult for people to be publicly acknowledged as individuals who suffered from mental health issues.  Fortunately, we are getting over that now.  People now recognise that mental health issues are as much a problem as any physical health issues.  We need to be open about it and must get away from the past of people being embarrassed about mental health issues in the family or in respect of themselves.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact there is a change in public attitude to mental health issues.  I suspect the prevalence of mental health issues is greater now than 50 years ago but that may be difficult to appraise accurately because people kept it quiet.  We have pressures in our society that previous societies did not have.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about pressures on a certain cohort of our people who I believe are subject to many pressures.  I am talking about people between the ages of 15 and 25.  The reason I refer to that group of individuals is because they are at a particularly important and consequential age in their development.</p><p>It is an extremely important phase in somebody's progress through life, for a variety of reasons.  First, people between the ages of 15 and 25, particularly at the upper end, begin to realise that life may not present the opportunities they thought it would present to them, and life may not be as productive or profitable as they thought it would be for them.  In many respects, as people reach their mid-20s, they are sometimes faced with a reality check about life which may not be consistent with what their ambitions are or were.  That is one reason I believe there are pressures on people between the ages of 15 and 25.</p> <p> Another reason was alluded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  It is the age when people start taking mind-altering substances.  As people get older, it is probably easier to deal with substances like alcohol because they have a stability in their life but the mental development of people between the ages of 15 and 25 is fragile and frail and they are vulnerable.  That is why taking mind-altering substances, consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or taking serious hard drugs that induce psychosis give rise to potential instability in people of that age.  It is something we must be aware of and it is why we need to concentrate on people of that age.</p> <p> A third reason I believe that group of people needs to be concentrated on is due to the pressures this society imposes on them.  It has now become accepted wisdom that, for example, every young girl has to be intelligent, beautiful and popular and have a fantastic boyfriend - that is the message we send out from society.  Similarly, every young boy who is becoming a man is supposed to be an outstanding sportsman, academically gifted and successful and is supposed to go on to become a millionaire.  That is too much pressure to put onto people of that age.</p> <p> As a society, we need to start telling people of that age that they do not have to be exceptional and they are perfectly entitled to be normal.  The norm in Ireland is that people are in the middle and are average and we need to respect that.  We must stop putting pressure on people by saying they have to excel all the time.  The reality of life, as we all know, is that the vast majority of people do not excel.  The vast majority have normal abilities and cannot achieve the ambitions and overcome the pressures put on them by our contemporary society.</p> <p> As a final point on mental health, I have recently attended funerals of people who have taken their own lives.  We have to send out the message that no matter how bad mental health issues are, that cannot be an option.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-01a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060100047#VV00200"><p>I take the opportunity to congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointment.  I spoke to each of them individually and I wish them well in the very important jobs they have ahead of them.  Others have referred to the work of the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, and I want to echo the support for the work she did.  In the previous D&aacute;il, the former Deputy for Laois-Offaly, John Moloney, also did excellent work as Minister of State.  He was particularly strong in advocating the need to implement A Vision for Change rather than just having it as a strategy.  He did very good work with the Oireachtas health committee at the time, with the support of colleagues on all sides of the House.  A Vision for Change, which is a 2006 strategy, now needs updating but, most importantly, it needs to be implemented.</p>  <p>  Mention was made earlier of career guidance and the unfortunate reduction in supports for career guidance services in second level schools some years ago, which I believe was a retrograde step.  We all know of the excellent work career guidance counsellors do.  In many instances, the first port of call for young, school-going students who are meeting particular difficulties is the guidance counsellor.  I believe it is a service that should not be reduced and, in fact, it needs extra support.  In our constituencies at the time the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, reduced the funding and the ex-quota allocation, all Deputies met with guidance counsellors who were really committed to their profession and were doing excellent work.  We knew this from the pupils who had gone through the various schools, from principals and from the wider school community.  It is an area that needs support and I hope the reduction in support can be reversed.</p>  <p>  I represent two very rural counties.  In the past two years, in particular, there has been huge pressure in regard to housing and, unfortunately, more people are coming to us every week who have lost or are on the verge of losing their home.  We all know - in many instances, we have heard this from GPs and those in the general health service - that the pressures on housing are causing huge mental stress for people.  At a time like this, we need to ensure there is access to counselling.  A number of constituents spoke to me at the weekend to outline the huge delays in regard to being recommended by a GP to a counselling service and this has not yet been provided.  The delay in being able to access that first assessment or counselling session is far too long and, unfortunately, in many instances, it comes too late.</p>  <p>  I refer to the whole area of alcohol and drug abuse.  Unfortunately, Cavan and Monaghan have a serious problem with addiction to heroin and other psychoactive substances.  I met the Cavan-Monaghan Drug and Alcohol Service recently.  It is a voluntary organisation which is given some support by the HSE but not enough.  A small number of people are doing excellent work in trying to provide a service with the support of some pharmacists and GPs.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be very familiar with east Cavan and part of south Monaghan.  I hope we have the opportunity to have a meeting in regard to the situation in Cavan and Monaghan because that area, in particular, is facing serious difficulties.  Unfortunately, it is an area that has not had the provision of a good statutory service to deal with drug and alcohol addiction.  I hope it will be possible to make some progress in providing necessary services, both in terms of personnel, such as the different clinicians that are needed, and financial support for the work of the different voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  What was clearly stated to me at the meeting by people who work on a voluntary basis as directors of the association is that heroin is a serious and growing problem in the region, as are new psychoactive substances, but the level of funding they receive is nowhere near commensurate with the scale of the problem.  They primarily see adults but they do their best to make a part-time counsellor available for those under 18.  They also cite the lack of residential homelessness support services and note that when they are trying to help a homeless person, they have to use bed and breakfasts and hotel accommodation.  This is not the most useful accommodation at such a time, when other residential services would be much more beneficial, if they could be accessed.</p>  <p>  These are the particular issues that need support.  We want to ensure the voluntary groups that are doing excellent work are given the support they need through additional funding and through the appointment of professional personnel.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;m gach rath orthu ina r&oacute;il nua.</p>  <p>  I wish to be positive and a Deputy on the Government side has asked that we be nice to each other, which is very important.  It is also vital to look at why we are in this state during these statements on mental health.  I have sat through all of the debates to date and I wonder why we are not holding the system to account because that is our role.  A Vision for Change was introduced in 2006 but, not alone that, it was based on "The psychiatric services - planning for the future", which was published in 1984.  The central recommendation at that point was a new model of mental health care but because of the slow progress over a 22-year period, it was necessary to re-look at the service, leading to A Vision for Change, which was published in 2006.</p>  <p>  Therefore, there is a history to A Vision for Change.  There were urgent reasons that it was brought in and there is a background to it.
