Project Ireland 2040 explicitly recognises that our culture, language and heritage are an essential part of the sustainable development of the country.  It was anticipated that I would launch this element of the plan with An Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe and Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh.  This launch has been postponed due to the sneachta.</p>  <p>  The plan acknowledges the centrality of culture and creativity to our national development.  It is unprecedented in this type of statutory planning framework, as is the commitment to investment in excess of &euro;1 billion in our culture and heritage over the next ten years.  Of this investment some &euro;725 million will be invested directly in our cultural infrastructure, in our creative industries and in enhancing cultural experience for our citizens.</p>  <p>  As outlined in Project Ireland 2040, &euro;460 million will be spent on the national cultural institutions investment programme.  Over the ten years of the plan, this will see: the renovation of the National Library of Ireland; significant enhancements at the National Archives of Ireland; investment at a number of sites of the National Museum of Ireland commencing with the Natural History Museum; the renovation of the National Concert Hall and Crawford Art Gallery; the completion of the National Gallery of Ireland master development plan; the redevelopment of the National Theatre and projects at the Irish Museum of Modern Art and at the Chester Beatty Library.  These projects will be sequenced and prioritised having regard to the outcome of the evaluation and planning processes in line with the public spending code.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;265 million has been made available under the national development plan for a culture and creativity investment programme.  This investment programme will be closely aligned with the Creative Ireland programme.  Key areas for investment under this programme will be a programme of investments in regional arts and culture facilities to enhance opportunities for communities to participate in Irish cultural life; investment in our creative industries with a particular focus on the audio-visual sector which represents an important economic opportunity for Ireland; a programme for the digitisation of our national collections; and investment in Galway 2020 for its year as an EU Capital of Culture.  I look forward to launching this element of the plan.</p></reply>

Project Ireland 2040 states that &ldquo;the aggregate level of investment in Ireland&rsquo;s cultural infrastructure over ten years is estimated at &euro;725 million&rdquo;.  This represents a mere 0.625% of the &euro;116 billion plan.  It is not clear how much of this money is new and how much is already accounted for in existing spending allocations to projects already in hand.  The plan indicates, for example, that &euro;15 million is being spent on the Natural History Museum.  This project is described as being in development.  Will the Minister indicate if this &euro;15 million was previously announced and allocated?  Will the Minister identify how much of the money announced in the plan is new money and not previously announced money?</p></speech>

It is important to say that the infrastructure project steering group, which will be set up shortly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will include senior officials from all Departments.  This will be a primary vehicle for cross-sectoral dialogue for implementation and will provide essential reports of progress under the plan within the Department.  The Deputy referred to value for money.  All investments under project 2040 will be subject to rigorous appraisal and evaluation in line with the public spending code.  All options will be looked at prior to committing any funding on the project.  There will be robust project management throughout the implementation phase and regular reports on expenditure and delivery against clear targets and milestones.</p>  <p>  In particular, 2018 will see us focus on the appraisal, planning and design of many of the flagship projects with a view to moving to the delivery phase in the following years.</p></speech>

The plan gives concrete budgets and completion dates for just three of those projects: the Crawford Gallery, the National Library of Ireland and the Natural History Museum.  Combined, these projects are to cost &euro;31 million.  Rather than giving any detail as to how the remaining &euro;411 million is to be spent on the national cultural institutions we have simply been provided with a list of those institutions.  This mirrors the vagueness of the capital investment plan 2016&mdash;2021 wherein it was stated &ldquo;there will also be investment in cultural infrastructure, including the National Cultural Institutions and Regional Arts and Cultural Centres&rdquo;.  Will the Minister outline how exactly she plans on investing in the national cultural institutions?</p>  <p>  Many of the projects referred to by the Minister are some of our most important cultural institutions but I urge the Minister to not forget about the regional arts and cultural centres that can be the lifeblood of communities outside the main cities.  I hope the focus does not remain on our urban city centres and that the Minister remembers rural Ireland and the more isolated regional arts centres that do phenomenal work in our communities in keeping rural Ireland going.</p></speech>

That &euro;265 million in effect implements pillar 3 of Creative Ireland in relation to a culture and creativity investment programme.  One of the key areas for investment is a programme of investment in regional arts and cultural facilities to enhance opportunities for communities to participate in Irish cultural life.  There will also be investment in creative industries with an emphasis on audio-visual and also digitisation of our national collections.  For example, the National Archives welcomed about 12,000 visitor during 2015, when there was 1.4 million hits online.  It is necessary that we bring services up to the 21st century and we will do that.  The list will be added to once we have got past the appraisal, planning and design phase to implementation phase over the next five years.  Understandably, what most of the cultural institutions will be doing now is setting out master plans as to how they will use the money in the future.

The thought that this location, which should be enjoyed by walkers, tourists, locals and others, might be bought by some international property investor sends shivers down my spine.  My stomach curdled at the thought that Denis O'Brien had expressed an interest in it.  It should be something that is available to everybody.  The question of whether the State will acquire this estate in order to ensure its availability to the public has been raised several times.</p></reply>

These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country.  Given the limited resources available for capital investment within the national parks and nature reserves, I recognise the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing parks and reserves' lands.  The estate at Luggala would be a significant addition to our stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands.  It provides a central connection between disparate parts of our Wicklow mountains' national park. </p>  <p>  My Department could only consider acquiring this property if the price fell to within a certain range, or in the context of a donation or bequest.  This is known to the vendors.  In this context, I also remind the House that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow mountains national park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of just &euro;800,000.</p>  <p>  Wicklow mountains national park and Glendalough are amongst our most beloved and popular heritage jewels.  The Luggala Estate has allowed a permissive access to a hugely popular walking route down to Lough Dan for many decades and I hope this would continue under any new ownership arrangements.  Furthermore, the estate has been an excellent neighbour to the national park, working closely with it on habitat management and the promotion of our stunning Wicklow mountains for tourism, film-making and amenity.  It is my wish that this close co-operation would continue too in future. </p></speech>

The idea that this beautiful walk which people currently are able to enjoy because Garech Browne of the Guinness family has allowed the public access to Lough Dan through the estate could be ended if some property investor or private interest takes the estate over and no longer allows access.  That is why we want more than expressions of concern or hope.  We think the Government should actively acquire the estate.  Given that the Minister says the Government is willing to consider acquiring the estate if the price is right, what direct negotiations has the State initiated with the vendors to see if we can acquire it?  The answer which the Minister just gave is exactly the same as we heard from the previous Minister of State when this question was raised last summer.  Has there been any progress?</p></speech>

We are open to further discussions on this.  As I said, there is a permissive right of way in the estate.  The price has to be right.  The door is open for negotiations in the future.  As well as the location, the estate is of architectural and cultural significance.  The estate is in the target area of where acquisition could be considered but it also falls within the core of the parks target area and encompasses some of the most iconic views of Wicklow outside Glendalough.  It would not have the same strategic significance to the national parks and wildlife service.  We did acquire lands in 2006 which were in close proximity but these were two unconnected pieces of land.  There are scarce resources in our Department and we are mindful of the need to focus on core responsibilities.  We could consider acquiring this property if it fell within a certain price range.  The vendors are aware of discussions which have taken place.  There may be further discussions in the future.  It is up to the vendors to discuss it again with the Department.</p></speech>

We should be setting out with determination to acquire this estate.  The Minister says it is not strategically important or a priority.  I do not understand that.  Has the Minister ever been up there?  It is absolutely spectacular.  Currently we can just walk past the estate to Lough Dan.  If we had access to the full estate, the investment that the State would put in in its purchase would be repaid many times over in future years.  Anybody going to Wicklow or considering travelling through that landscape would want to go down to Luggala.  It would easily pay for itself over the medium to long term.  There has been all this fanfare over Project Ireland 2040 and the investment in our cultural infrastructure but, God almighty, one could not get a more important piece of cultural, architectural or natural heritage infrastructure than the Luggala Estate which is important for its oak trees, deer, architecture and landscape.  It is absolutely spectacular and would be a tragedy if some property developer or private interest got hold of the estate.</p></speech>

Unless the property is in a price range that is acceptable to the Department, it will not be in a position to purchase it.  We are leaving the door open in terms of further negotiations and hopefully we will be in a position to proceed.  I agree that the estate is of high scenic value and the combination of the mountains, the lake and the woodland are particularly attractive.  Its wild aspect so close to a major city also adds to its significance.  It is an important example of a hunting and fishing lodge where the emphasis was more on short term accommodation rather than formal reception rooms.  It is a particularly striking house for its 20th century cultural connections which are both tangible and intangible.  Many noted artists, writers and musicians have stayed as guests and have contributed to a wealth of high quality artifacts.  These collectively give the property a quality that would be considerably lessened without them.  I accept all those facts.</p><p>At the same time, we have to allow reasonability in terms of spending taxpayers' money.  We are open to discussions if the Deputy wants to consider it further.</p></speech>

Millions of euro have been spent so far on consultants, reports, sexual abuse experts and High Court payoffs.  This, of course, does not include the very real damage that has been done to the lives of a large number of people who simply wanted to work in the premier heritage location in Ireland.  Is the Minister aware of any new allegations of sexual harassment and bullying in the National Museum of Ireland?</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot discuss individual cases.  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Museum of Ireland is a statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 and I have no responsibility for the day to day operations of the museum.</p>  <p>  While I cannot get involved in HR matters, which are a matter for the executive and the board of the museum, my Department has provided additional support, including sanction for three specific HR positions and two temporary positions for the corporate services area of the museum.</p>  <p>  The chair and the new board were appointed in July 2016 and are implementing change in the museum, as well as preparing new plans to improve the museum's services to the public over the coming years.  My Department and I are supportive of these plans.</p>  <p>  Separately, in light of allegations of abuse of power and sexual harassment elsewhere in the arts sector, my Department has identified a number of actions to be taken in relation to bodies reporting directly to my Department, including our national cultural institutions.  These include arranging dedicated workshops for board members and senior staff of bodies reporting to the Department dealing with governance.  There will be a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>  <p>  I consider that the support for the board, which I have outlined, is the most appropriate way for my Department to deal with issues of bullying and harassment.</p></speech>

Obviously she is new to the Department and she may not be aware of the deep and ongoing crisis that has engulfed the National Museum.  Significant damage has been done to a large number of women who have worked in a building 100 yards from where we sit.  These women were in the care of the State because the State had a role during that time as the Department was involved in those particular HR issues.  These women could not receive justice.  The only way they could do so was to go to the front pages of the national newspapers and tell their stories.  The most frustrating thing about this is that I have been told that at the start of these allegations a senior person in the National Museum of Ireland gave a report of what happened to the Department, and the Department did not carry out anything.  The report does not exist at present.  If that initial report had been acted upon none of the subsequent allegations made by those women would have happened.  Sitting on hands so far has only meant more people have had to suffer.  I urge the Minister to take a hands-on approach to resolving this issue.</p></speech>

I have the utmost sympathy for women and men who go through any bullying or harassment in the museum or any other cultural institution.</p><p>There is positive engagement with the National Museum of Ireland and a head of human resources was put in place, on an 18 month contract, on 26 February.  There are also two temporary HR staff in place.  In my role as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht I am in a position to support the National Museum of Ireland in ensuring these issues will not arise into the future.  A complaint made on 22 February has been submitted to the State Claims Agency which notified me by letter yesterday that as the National Museum of Ireland was the employer, not me, as Minister, it would be dealing with the matter internally.  Obviously, I cannot go into the detail of the case.</p> <p> As I mentioned, workshops for directors and boards are being held by my Department and the natural cultural institutions have been issued with reminders of their responsibility to follow through on their obligations under employers' legislation.  The Department also supports the provision of training for staff of the national cultural institutions and it is very important that that be done.</p></speech>

The deep ramifications of what happened in the National Museum of Ireland are still surfacing.  The Minister will be aware of the recently listed third third High Court case of bullying at the National Museum of Ireland.  There are still questions about a large number of secondments, one of which has been ongoing for the past four years at a cost of &euro;100,000 per annum.  I believe that what happened was, in part, the result of a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude on the part of the Department and previous Ministers.  Will the Minister continue that process or will she bring it to an end?</p></speech>

In 2017 a staff forum, consisting of representatives of management and the staff, was set up to promote and foster good relations within the National Museum of Ireland.  There was also a review of departmental documentation in 2017 which set out a number of recommendations, one of which was that we continue to support the chairperson and the board of the National Museum of Ireland in the introduction and implementation of measures to achieve enhanced HR capacity in the museum, which we have done.  The National Museum of Ireland is also adhering to the code of practice, which is important.  Also, an internal audit conducted in 2017 recommended the establishment of a dedicated HR unit at the museum.  The HR policy was reviewed and updated and there is continual HR training for line managers across all areas of the museum.  It is also proposed to develop a museum development plan setting out a long-term direction of travel for the museum.</p><p>I accept that there should never be a workplace in which people have to suffer the indignity of harassment or abuse in any form.  I will be taking any step I can in that regard.  </p><p>On Deputy Joan Burton's point about the Gate Theatre, I am working with it and the signatories to find solutions to all of the issues.  There is an initiative taking place on 21 March, of which the Deputy may be aware, through which we hope to move matters forward and ensure this culture will not continue into the future.</p></speech>

It has traditionally included the provision by RT&Eacute; of orchestral music through the National Symphony Orchestra, as well as the National Concert Orchestra.  Responsibility for RT&Eacute;, in the first instance, rests with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  However, as Minister with responsibility for culture and oversight of the National Concert Hall, it is important that there be strong provision of orchestral music in Ireland.  I am conscious that the National Concert Hall which does come within my remit has always been proud to call it the home of the National Symphony Orchestra.  The National Symphony Orchestra, in turn, provides the backbone of the National Concert Hall&rsquo;s orchestral music programme through its weekly concerts.  My Department and the Arts Council provide support for orchestral music in Ireland and I am fully aware of the premier role the National Symphony Orchestra plays in that regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to the review, I understand it is an internal review which is being carried out by RT&Eacute;.  My Department has not been directly involved in it.  However, officials from my Department have met officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the matter.  They have been informed that the review is to make recommendations on the best configuration of the orchestras.  They were also informed that RT&Eacute; had acknowledged that the orchestras were integral to its arts and cultural programming and formed a key part of its arts and culture strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department will maintain close contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on this matter and both Departments will consider the outcome of the RT&Eacute; review when it is complete.  I understand a final report will be delivered to RT&Eacute; shortly.</p></reply>

I have in my hand a copy of the very expensive national development plan, strategy No. 7 of which references enhanced amenity and heritage and the value of cultural heritage but nothing more in this area.  Given that the Government is spending at least &euro;1.5 million in promoting the plan, I thought that by now Ministers would know off by heart what is included in it.  The RT&Eacute; orchestras are being slowly and steadily eviscerated by reducing player numbers.  This year marks the 70th anniversary of the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra.  In 1948 the strength of the orchestra was 62, which figure rose eventually to a height of 93 in the late 1980s.  As I said earlier, its membership now stands at 68.  I am sure that in her role the Minister attends the National Concert Hall and that as such she will be aware that 68 players do not constitute a full strength orchestra.  Our young musicians are working around the world because they cannot find jobs at home.  Many of them would love to come home.</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; announced the review via a press release in November 2017.  Its overall funding position is well known.  It is incumbent on RT&Eacute; to consider and assess its role in the provision of orchestral music into the future.  In that context, the review will consider what current and future audiences want, how they will engage with us and how RT&Eacute;'s orchestral music will be heard in venues, on screens and radio across the country.  There is a difference between the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Orchestra in terms of size and audiences.  It is a matter for RT&Eacute; to decide whether it will maintain both orchestras.  Officials of my Department met officials of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on 12 January to discuss the issue.  The Deputy will be aware that RT&Eacute; has a statutory requirement to establish and maintain orchestras, choirs and other cultural performing groups.  I look forward to reading the report.  While I cannot anticipate what the outcome will be, I look forward to discussing matters further with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

Lots of small countries in Europe have four or five major symphony orchestras but the strength of our national orchestra has fallen to 68 players.  A number of people have retired, others have left and a complete hold has been placed on recruiting new players.  It is not that we lack musical talent in Ireland because we have many fantastic young musicians, qualified up to PhD level and beyond, who are now playing in orchestras and ensembles all over the world.  It is not possible for them to come back home because the RT&Eacute; symphony orchestra is not recruiting.  That orchestra is a major source of employment for musicians and is vital to the musical heritage of this country.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Minister has met the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to discuss this matter.  However, the Government has just launched a major report, part of which is about enhanced amenities and heritage.  How come the word "culture" does not feature in the new national development plan?  How come one of its objectives is not enhancing, maintaining, enabling and empowering our culture?</p></speech>

It held a celebratory event on 16 February last.  The concert hall is home to RT&Eacute;'s National Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Choir Ireland, the Irish Baroque Orchestra, the Music Network and Music Generation and hosts approximately 1,000 events per annum.  Its mission is to foster and celebrate the appreciation, knowledge, enjoyment and love of music as an integral part of Irish life.</p>  <p>  I would also add that my Department provides funding to many different orchestras.  In terms of music and ensuring that it is a vital part of cultural life in Ireland, my Department provides funding for the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland and the Peace Proms, while Culture Ireland also funds music-----</p></speech>

This right runs throughout people&rsquo;s lives, irrespective of where they come from, where they live, their religious beliefs or their economic or social backgrounds.  In line with these policy objectives, my Department's Creative Ireland programme continues to promote the Traveller mentoring programme and in 2017, through Cork City Council, funded the renovation of the Traveller culture exhibition at Cork Public Museum in 2017, with the refurbishment designed by visual artist and Traveller, Leanne McDonagh.</p><p>In 2017 the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, provided &euro;625,000 in funding for Carmel Winters' film, &quot;Float Like a Butterfly&quot;, which is due for release this year and is set among the Traveller community.  The Arts Council supports the Traveller community under the arts participation and the artist in the community schemes.  Managed by Create on the Arts Council&rsquo;s behalf, these schemes encourage artists to work in a culturally diverse context including among the Traveller community.  The work of artists from the Traveller community has also been recognised this year with the election to Aosd&aacute;na of playwright Rosaleen McDonagh and the awarding of the Arts Council&rsquo;s next generation bursary award for 2017 to visual artist Leanne McDonagh.</p><p>The cultural institutions are also active in this space.  In 2017 the Chester Beatty Library partnered with the National Concert Hall as part of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Dublin Culture Connects programme under which the poet Stephen James Smith is working with the Traveller women&rsquo;s group at Labre Park in Ballyfermot to look at shared stories.  The National Museum is planning a major exhibition with the Traveller community to be hosted in the Museum of Country Life from June 2018.  The exhibition will focus on the traditions, customs and history of the Traveller community over the years.<b></b></p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>My Department is also represented on the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which monitors the implementation and progress of the recently published the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.

I also note that 15 March, the national Traveller day of culture will see an important event on Traveller history and ethnicity at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  These are all positive things but actual participation in culture starts with the basics where, quite frankly, we are not moving forward.  While these are not directly within the Minister's remit, she should consider them as part of the project of making the formal acknowledgement of Traveller ethnicity a reality.  Accommodation is one of the most basic elements of Traveller culture but Travellers in this country are 11 times more likely to be homeless.  Against the background of disastrous homelessness generally, Travellers are disproportionately hit.  Indeed, politicians, including the Minister in the past, have played fast and loose on the issue of Traveller accommodation but we need to move forward on that.  In the area of education, we need to reinstate the visiting teacher for Travellers and to provide extra resource teachers in schools for Travellers.  We must also include Traveller history and culture in the school curricula.</p></speech>

Culture also has an important role to play in promoting tolerance, inclusivity and social cohesion in our increasingly diverse society.  It should be accessible to everyone, irrespective of origin, place of residence, religious beliefs or economic or social background.</p><p>I was here in the D&aacute;il when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, made a statement in recognition of Traveller ethnicity on March 1 last year.  The then Taoiseach also visited my constituency and met the Southside Travellers Action Group, who were absolutely delighted that their ethnicity would be formally recognised.  Deputy Kenny said that Travellers told him that it took 30 years for a government to listen to them across the table.  He went on to say:</p><blockquote>The representatives spoke passionately about how this strong message from the State would be a very important symbolic and positive step in acknowledging the uniqueness of Traveller identity.  They felt it would resonate strongly among the community and help counter the stigma and shame felt by many, particularly young people, and increase feelings of respect, self-esteem and inclusion.</blockquote></speech>

My point is that we have a long way to go.  The situation for Travellers in this country is truly shocking.  They are seven times more likely to commit suicide and one in 11 young Traveller men die by suicide.  Traveller men live 15 years less and Traveller women live 11 years less than their settled counterparts.  Infant mortality is four times higher and as I said already, Travellers are 11 times more likely to be homeless.  We need to address these issues in the areas of health and accommodation.  I would like to see movement on these issues and practical timelines put in place.</p><p>There is no budget and no timeline for the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy; therefore, it is aspirational rather than a practical policy.</p></speech>

They have difficulties, perhaps more than other groups, in dealing with many of the issues that confront them.  The Government must do all it can to assist them in reaching their goals in life.  I have attended many good events in my constituency aimed at dealing with this issue.</p>  <p>  From a broader perspective, the National Museum of Ireland exhibition will be hosted in the Museum of Country Life from June.  The idea of the Traveller journey exhibition which will run until May 2019 was originally proposed to members of the western regional Traveller health network who developed the concept at a social inclusion event co-hosted by the museum, Mayo County Council and the Mayo Traveller Support Group in October 2015.  A budget of &euro;100,000 is being allocated for the exhibition.  </p>  <p>  On other aspects of the work of my Department, the director of the National Library of Ireland will be attending a national Traveller ethnicity event this week, unless it is postponed.  It might have been postponed already.  It was due to take place tomorrow.  The director will speak on another occasion about genealogy and other source material the National Library of Ireland has available for the study of Traveller family histories.</p></speech>

In 2010 it was estimated that the cultural and creative industries contributed around 2.6% of the total GDP of the European Union, providing around 5 million jobs across the 27 EU member states.  In Ireland, in the same year, a report commissioned by the Arts Council estimated that the creative industries overall contributed more than &euro;4.7 billion to the economy, equivalent to approximately 3% of GDP, while the number of jobs supported in aggregate amounted to 78,900.This underpins the importance attached to culture and heritage in the recently launched Project Ireland 2040, the comprehensive national planning framework and associated ten-year national development plan which provides for a significant investment of in excess of &euro;1 billion in culture and heritage in the next ten years.  It also provides for an additional &euro;178 million to support the Irish language, a key element of our cultural identity, and protect our unique Gaeltacht and Island communities.  The level of this investment which is unprecedented under a national development plan will inevitably have a beneficial economic impact.  I will shortly launch this element of the plan.  I was hoping to launch elements of it with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Pashal Donohoe, and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Joe McHugh, but it has been postponed until a later date.  </p><p>The national cultural institutions investment programme worth &euro;460 million will see economic opportunities for the construction sector in the short run but will have a long-term economic benefit to Dublin and Cork from its tourism dividend, as well as providing much needed upgrades at these important national institutions.  As part of the culture and creativity investment programme under the national development plan and aligned with the Creative Ireland programme, we will be investing heavily in the audio-visual industry as a cornerstone of the creative industries and bringing an economic dividend for the sector and the areas in which audio-visual content, including films, is produced.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i></p><p>On the heritage side, we will invest &euro;285 million in a broad range of projects across the country, from enhancing visitor facilities at national parks and nature reserves and providing incentives for the restoration of the historic cores of towns, villages and cities to works to protect national monuments and inland waterways.  All of these investments will yield a positive economic impact from the jobs created from the works to the long-term benefits to local economies from the improved tourism offering, particularly in the national parks which are primarily on the route of the Wild Atlantic Way and present an opportunity for enhanced tourism development, as well as conserving the beauty of natural landscapes.</p></speech>

I will speak about that issue.  Suffice it to say it is a pilot project involving 150 schools.  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan spoke about education.  It is very important we bring forward the scheme.  We are investing &euro;460 million under the national cultural investment programme which will be really transformative in bringing many of the national cultural institutions into the 21st century.  Many of the projects are at appraisal, planning and design stage, while many are flagship projects.  We will be hoping to move to the delivery phase in the coming years and will be able to add to the list into the future.</p>  <p>  On the heritage side, some &euro;285 million has been allocated which will create employment and help us to invest in national parks and nature reserves.  The number of visitors has increased from 2.5 million to 4 million in just over ten years.  We need to have the infrastructure we require to ensure we can cope with the steady increase in the number of visitors.  It will also help in promoting tourism.</p></speech>

I once had the privilege of visiting the rock of Masada when its importance was emphasised.  We have many sites in this country that date back more than 5,000 years to the time of the pyramids.  To what extent does the Minister foresee opportunities arising to merge our cultural, heritage and historical sites in a package to attract national and international interest?</p></speech>

It is a &euro;285 million investment plan.  I have mentioned the national parks and nature reserves and how we need to be in a position to cope with the number of new visitors with better infrastructure.  We want to help our invaluable natural assets and have hubs for outdoor activities and to promote tourism.</p>  <p>  On the built heritage, to which the Deputy referred, it is the historical core of cities, towns and villages.  We must protect and try to regenerate it, where possible.  We must also protect castles, forts and mounds.  The inland waterways are not just an engineering marvel but also an amenity within the national tourism offering.  I intend to ramp up investment into the future, including in the restoration of the Ulster Canal.  The plan also provides for implementation of national guidelines for the protection of our unique landscapes.  We will be able to implement the national biodiversity plan into the future.</p></speech>

This pilot initiative is a vital element of the recently launched creative youth plan and a cornerstone of pillar 1 of the Government's Creative Ireland programme.</p>  <p>  Creative Schools is being led by the Arts Council, with support from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Up to 150 schools across the country will participate in the pilot project and work with Creative Associates to develop their own unique programmes of arts and creative work, connecting them to the full range of local and regional cultural resources and opportunities.</p><p>Creative associates are artists, creative practitioners and educators.  They are recruited by the Arts Council, which will support each school in the development and implementation of its plan and forge partnerships with the wider arts and cultural community.  In addition, all schools will receive a range of supports, including a once-off grant of &euro;2,000 and training for teachers in the school.  Interested schools can find information on how to register and apply on the Arts Council website.  This measure is one of 18 contained in the creative youth plan, which will be progressed over the next two years in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council.  At this plan's core is a firm belief that creativity and culture should be at the heart of education for all our young people.  I look forward to working with all our key partners to deliver for our children and young people.</p></speech>

Throughout the years arts subjects have often been seen as the Cinderella of subjects within the system.  Children who have difficulties with other parts of the school curriculum may find expression through arts.  I am not only talking about visual arts, but performance arts and music as well.  Arts education should be broadened into as expansive a programme as possible.  There are approximately 150 schools in the pilot scheme and I encourage schools to apply.  We should broaden this out because, as I said in the House before, the arts allow people, who may not be able to do so academically or through psychomotor skills, which involve the more practical subjects, to express themselves.  Having arts in their education also leads to the development of their emotional well-being.</p></speech>

The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton's Department and my Department did extensive work on this initiative.  It is a pilot project which I hope can be rolled out.  The closing date for applications is 5 March 2018.  The Creative Ireland team in my Department held 39 public meetings.  Both Departments felt that mainstream teaching of and learning the arts as a part of general education need to be intertwined in some way.  We are hoping that schools which apply for this initiative will benefit from learning through the arts.  As the Deputy said, the arts have been the Cinderella subjects in the past, although I hope that will change.</p>  <p>  The schools are selected using the following criteria: benefits for learning and development; capacity for participation; the voice of children and young people; and the need to include a range of schools.  There will be several different types of schools included.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-28a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022800011#J00400"><p>According to research, the creative arts foster the development of children's cognitive abilities.  Exploring and participating in creative play triggers the use of children's imaginations, which in turn stimulates and expands their mental capacities.  Given this insight and what has been recognised in schools, and coupled with the 300 hours of emotional well-being work which has been added to the education system, I ask that the arts remain a priority in the educational system.  This particularly concerns funding.  As we have seen in the past, if the country hits hard economic times, one of the first areas to be cut is the arts.  We need to reverse that trend and change this type of psychology in looking at the arts.  We need to give the arts the profile they deserve.  It is often difficult to explain the benefits of the arts.  Those benefits are enormous and very difficult to put into words.  The momentum is building, which I welcome, and we must keep that focus.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why this is not being rolled out to all schools in the country and, in particular, to DEIS schools where creative artistic work is absolutely essential to children's social and academic formation.  Can the Minister explain why many DEIS schools will have to wait beyond 2020 for this initiative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-28a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022800011#J00600"><p>In terms of impartiality, and this is a pilot initiative, the assessment team will seek to select a diverse range of schools.  That will include primary and post-primary schools and urban and rural schools across different geographic areas, including DEIS schools.  It is anticipated that every school will eventually get to participate.  However, the pilot will include DEIS schools, Irish language schools, Youthreach centres and special schools.  As I said earlier, the closing date is 5 March 2018.</p>  <p>  Alluding to what Deputy Neville said earlier about the arts in schools, the creative associate will support and be the liaison between the Departments and the schools.  The associate will be key to how this pilot project actually works.  The project will include many different activities.  One example might be developing young people's critical thinking skills by working with a theatre critic to respond to a performance at a local theatre.  It could involve a writer working with parents, teachers and children on storytelling, to improve their engagement with reading.  It could involve an animator and a coder working with disengaged young people on how to create video games based on their interests.  It could explore issues of transition from primary to post-primary education through the composition of music.  The scheme could involve a visual artist working with teachers to improve their confidence in using visual arts in the classroom.</p></speech>

I commend the front-line services on their work to date.  In particular, I commend Se&aacute;n Hogan and his team on the national co-ordination efforts.  I also pay tribute to Met &Eacute;ireann for the precision of its work.  I thank the media for broadcasting the guidance to people throughout the country.  I would like to refer to some aspects of this weather event.  At moments like this, we have to be particularly conscious of older people and families in poverty.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach was dismissive of calls to double the free fuel allowance for this week.  He said he could not "offer a blank cheque".  I am glad the Government has undertaken a U-turn on this issue.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has announced that the allowance will be doubled.  It is worrying that the issue was not anticipated earlier in the week.  We know that on occasions like this, cold weather and deep freezes can affect the elderly most of all.</p>  <p>  I ask the Government to consider advancing additional financial supports to non-governmental organisations that are dealing with the homeless and with families in poverty.  In a week when the latest figures from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government show that more than 9,000 people, including 3,267 children, are homeless, which is a record number, it is incumbent on the Government to support organisations like the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon Community and Focus Ireland that are working on the streets to bring the homeless in.  Heroic efforts are being made.  I have just listened to Pat Doyle of the Peter McVerry Trust saying that 81 homeless people were taken into a sports hall on the south side of Dublin yesterday to give them shelter on a very cold evening.  Additional supports should be given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations to keep an eye out for families who are in particular poverty and need for various reasons and will require support.</p>  <p>  I am surprised that decisions regarding school closures are being left to boards of management at local level.  I think there was similar indecision in relation to schools in advance of Storm Ophelia.  I mean it constructively when I say I think schools should close automatically when red alert warnings are issued.  It was confirmed this morning that school transport will not be operational in red alert areas.  That should mean de facto that schools should close.  If that happened, we would reduce the risk of accidents and traffic congestion.  Above all, it would represent an optimal approach to the safety of schoolchildren.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider doing that now.  With regard to public transport, will he give us strong reassurances that local councils have the equipment and the wherewithal to keep the main arteries open and to keep cities going and operational?  Although this is a matter for another day, it is worth reflecting that the entire country is coming to a halt, despite all the warnings, after one evening's snow so far.  We need to learn from other countries that experience far worse events than this.</p></speech>

School transport is not the main way people get to school in many parts of the country, where pupils are more likely to get to school by car or by walking.  I have asked the national emergency co-ordination group to provide a clear instruction on what schools should do tomorrow and on Friday and it will do so at the press conference after its meeting.</p>  <p>  I would like to respond to Deputy Martin's earlier comments on fuel allowance.  Two distinct suggestions were made yesterday.  First, it was suggested that we should instruct older people and others to run their heating 24 hours a day and that the Government should pick up the bill no matter what.</p></speech>

Second, some of the Members opposite were among those who made the constructive suggestion that we should pay a double week of the fuel allowance.  I did not dismiss that.  The record of the D&aacute;il will show that I said I would endeavour to speak about the matter to the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This was the appropriate thing to do and we spoke about it across yesterday.</p><p>We confirmed with the Department that it was possible to pay a double week and we confirmed this morning that a double week is being paid for this week.  In many cases, the payment will not be made until next week but a double week of &euro;45 is being paid.  This should give about 300,000 households some assurance that they can keep the heating going during this period.</p> <p> In addition, urgent needs payments may be available on a non-means tested basis.  Also, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is in touch with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, with a view to giving it additional supports to assist families who are in fuel poverty.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin correctly stated, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul often knows the families who are vulnerable or in fuel poverty and works with them already.  Additional resources will be available for the society in that regard. </p> <p> I acknowledge the Trojan and extraordinary efforts our homeless services made during the night, including people working for the Department, Dublin City Council, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and charities.  Food, shelter and heat are available for everyone who needs it.  Teams were on the streets last night encouraging people to come in off the streets and I am told only about a dozen people did not do so and everyone else came in and was given food, heat and shelter.  The Government is working with and funding NGOs, including Depaul and the Peter McVerry Trust to provide these services. </p></speech>

School boards of management cannot be summoned in the middle of the night or at 6 a.m., as a principal said today.  The Government is leaving the decision on whether to close schools up to individual principals.  In my view, this is not the optimal way to protect schoolchildren and prevent traffic congestion.  We all know how long it took to get to work in Dublin this morning.  There are schools at which only 100 pupils turning up and many have less than full numbers.  This is a serious issue.  When a code red alert warning is issued surely it should automatically dictate the closure of schools.  That would be the uniformly correct thing to do.</p></speech>

We have only had sight of the text in the past 45 minutes and we will have to study the precise detail in the coming hours.  However, having scanned the draft document, I welcome that the European Union now explicitly accepts that special arrangements are required for the North.  As the Taoiseach knows, since the Brexit referendum, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued consistently and vigorously for the North to be designated special status within the European Union.  We stated this was the only way to avoid the imposition of a hard border on this island and ensure the all-island economy and peace agreements are protected.  Special status means the North remaining inside the customs union and Single Market.  We now have a draft text that recognises that the North must stay in the customs union and I welcome that recognition.  I also voice concern at any prospect of the North exiting the Single Market and concerns remain for east-west trade and commerce.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, the British Government and Brexiteers engaged in their Brexit debate with zero regard for the impact on Ireland.  They showed no concern for our economy, the rights of our people or the peace process.  They now want to conclude their debate and make their exit by putting the Good Friday Agreement through the shredder.  The Tory-DUP axis is satisfied to treat the welfare of the people of this island as collateral damage so long as it can achieve a little Englander Brexit.  Its arrogance is best highlighted by the rejection of the vote of the people of the North to remain in the European Union and crystallised most recently in the juvenile and dangerous commentary of the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.</p>  <p>  The DUP has explicitly hitched itself to the Tory wagon.  It has put narrow political interests ahead of the good of the people of the North from all communities, our economic well-being and the political process.  The position of the Tory-DUP Brexiteers is that they want Brexit at any cost.  However, they will not foot the bill.  Rather, it will be the ordinary people of this island, North and South, who foot the bill and that cannot be allowed to happen.  The Tory-DUP wrecking agenda cannot prevail.  As Head of Government, it is the Taoiseach's job to ensure this does not happen.  There is no doubt in my mind that the British Government will attempt to undermine the text of the draft agreement in the time ahead.  In the context of the DUP's collapsing of the talks in the North, I asked that the Taoiseach convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  Today's development adds weight to the need for this to be done.  Will the Taoiseach convene the intergovernmental conference?</p></speech>

That is not to say that we are not in regular contact, however.  I have spoken twice on the telephone to Prime Minister May in the past ten days and we have also met in person.</p>  <p>  I recognise the constructive and measured approach taken by the Deputy's party to the Brexit issue in recent months.  What we have seen today is the publication of the draft withdrawal agreement by the European Commission.  The first thing the Government sought at the time of the Brexit referendum was a commitment from the UK Government that there would be no hard border and that eventuality would be avoided.  We got such a verbal commitment some time ago under the leadership of my forebear, Deputy Enda Kenny.  In December, we sought to have this commitment turned into a commitment in a political agreement and it was written down in black and white in the December text.  Most reasonable people will now accept, even though others said otherwise, that it was not over-hyped or oversold.  People will see the reality of that today in a legal text, a protocol to the draft withdrawal agreement, that sets out exactly in black and white how we can avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and how we can enforce that legally.  That has been done and the text has been published today.  A briefing will be available later today for Opposition leaders and spokespersons if they wish to have one.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that this is the only option.  This is the backstop and last resort, as Prime Minister May describes it.  There are alternative solutions.  The alternative solution is option A, which is our preferred option and the preferred option of the British Government, that involves us avoiding not just a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but also a hard border between Britain and Ireland.  I do not want a border between Letterkenny and Derry any more than I want a border between Larne and Stranraer or Liverpool and Dublin.  We want people and trade to be able to move freely.  Option A is still an option.  It is now incumbent on the United Kingdom Government, in particular, to put forward detailed proposals on how it can be achieved or put forward the detail of option B.  </p><p>The Deputy is correct that hard line Brexiteers and some politicians in Northern Ireland will say "No" and will be angry at what they see today but just saying "No" and being angry is not enough.  If people do not like what they see today, it is incumbent on them to come up with alternative solutions and to flesh out option A and option B, write it down in a legal form that can be enforced and then we can negotiate on that.  We have between now and October to make those decisions.</p> <p> With regard to the different messages that may be coming from UK Government, when I want to know what it thinks, I listen to Prime Minister May.  I have spoken to her on three occasions in the past ten days.  She tells me that her government stands by its commitment to avoid a hard border and it is steadfast in its support for the Good Friday Agreement.  I trust Prime Minister May on both of those counts.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of us, and it would be remiss of the Taoiseach as Head of Government, to miss those clear soundings.</p>  <p>  The best methodology to provide a backstop to protect the island as a whole and to protect the agreement is the convening of the intergovernmental conference.  The Taoiseach has stalled on his response to that.  In the absence of that, how does the Taoiseach propose to engage the British Government and the British system to ensure we get back to a position of unanimity regarding no border at all on the island of Ireland, and respect and protection for the agreement?</p></speech>

We engage the UK Government by meeting it all the time.  In the past ten days, I have spoken twice to, and met once with, Prime Minister May.  Last Monday, the T&aacute;naiste met Mr. David Lidington who is the <i>de facto</i>deputy Prime Minister.  We engage with them by meeting them face-to-face and talking to them on the phone and when we do not do that, our officials do it at official level, so there is regular contact.</p><p>When we negotiate with the UK on European matters and matters related to Brexit, we do so as part of the EU27 through the Barnier task force.  It is demonstrable to everyone now that Ireland is in a much stronger position when we negotiate as one of 27 and as a Union of 27 rather than isolating ourselves and being on our own, and we will continue to do exactly that.</p><p>As Head of the Government, I stand by the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is co-guarantor of the agreement and everyone in the House stands by it.  I have heard some of the hardline Brexiteers who are not members of the British Government questioning the future of the agreement.  These are the same people who say to us that we should respect the 51.8% vote in favour of their referendum for Brexit.  I remind them that the Good Friday Agreement was approved by the Irish people - 94% in this State and 71% in Northern Ireland - and they should respect our vote too.</p></speech>

The worst of Storm Emma and the Siberian wind is yet to hit.  While people are out and about today and at work, it is likely that from tonight they will be confined to their homes for some days to come.  That is, of course, those who have a home.  The homelessness figures for January were published yesterday.  Following a brief drop in December, the figures have continued to increase.  There are currently 9,104 people homeless in Ireland.  They comprise 5,837 adults and a record 3,267 children who are relying on emergency accommodation.  It is a sad reflection of our Government that the best excuse the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government could offer was that the extent of the increase was not anticipated.  Over the past week, the Government has been focused on spending &euro;1.5 million on propaganda to promote investment in a ten-year national development plan while more than 9,000 of our citizens are without a roof over their heads to call their own.  These are real people and real lives are being impacted by this crisis.</p>  <p>  Research by Focus Ireland published last November demonstrated the impact the crisis is having on children.  The deep negative effect on their emotional and mental health has been documented and the statement yesterday by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, that babies living in hotels are not reaching their development milestones is a shocking indictment of a failed policy.  The State will have to deal with the repercussions of this for a generation.  Rebuilding Ireland is not delivering the homes needed.  The Minister has asked the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to investigate the matter and to prepare a detailed report but that will not help a single family.  The problem is not enough social housing is being built and there is no co-ordinated effort to rapidly bring vacant housing back into use while there is no security of tenure for tenants as landlords seek to raise rents, refurbish or sell their properties.  Despite commitments by the then Minister to end the use of emergency accommodation by last July, it remains the first port of call.  It is an outrage in a modern, developed, wealthy country, such as Ireland, that more than 3,000 of our children are homeless.  Figures provided to me yesterday show that a total of 1,517 families were using emergency accommodation during January but, that month, 700 homeless families were recorded as staying in hotels and bed and breakfasts in the Dublin region, with 385 of them having been in them for longer than six months.  What new plans has the Taoiseach to address this?  Will he personally ensure rigid targets are set to reduce month on month the number of homeless children?</p></speech>

As the Deputy correctly pointed out, they are disappointing given that they had gone down in December.  Many of us hoped that was the beginning of a trend but it is certainly not possible to say that at the moment as they have gone back up again.  That says to us that we must redouble our efforts to increase the supply of affordable and social housing and all other forms of housing.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, that is the fundamental solution to this problem.  Following seven years of almost no houses being built, we are ramping up housing construction again - both social housing and private sector housing.  People moving into new homes frees up rental properties for others.  Project Ireland 2040, which was published two weeks ago, has housing all the way through it.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the efforts of the charity, NGO, council and departmental staff who are working hard, particularly in this bad weather, to make sure everyone who is sleeping rough is aware that shelter, food and heat are available for them.

What Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank or potentially AIB are proposing to do is entirely in line with Fine Gael policy in government over the past five years.</p>  <p>  Tens of billions of euros have been sold off to hedge funds, private equity giants and international banks.  The biggest seller in this was the State through the medium of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, facilitated the sell off of &euro;22 billion in loans in a matter of months.  This all started, appropriately enough, in Davos in 2014 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, met with representatives of American vulture fund, Lone Star.  They offered to buy all of NAMA's debt and was turned down.  When Deputy Noonan returned, he asked NAMA how it could tap into this international demand for distressed Irish assets.  NAMA moved from managing assets to a sell off agency - the very thing which NAMA was supposed to prevent.  A fire sale of distressed assets was actually initiated by NAMA under the Taoiseach's Government's watch.</p>  <p>  Tax breaks were also introduced to further entice the vultures.  Only &euro;20,000 was paid in tax by 24 different companies despite controlling &euro;20 billion in assets.  The use of section 110 allowed huge investment entities from the United States to pay between &euro;75 and &euro;250 in tax.  It is shameful.  Fine Gael policy, without a whimper of protest from the Labour Party in government, was to save the banks.  If people lost their homes or small businesses, that was just collateral damage.</p>  <p>  There is now talk of extending Central Bank regulations to cover the vulture funds.  The idea this is a solution for people with mortgage arrears will not stop repossessions or evictions.  It does not correspond with reality.  Yesterday, in my constituency, an elderly man in poor health was due to be evicted.  After our intervention the sheriff has agreed to postpone the eviction for a month.  We have been trying to find alternative accommodation for him for two years.  We have not been able to do it through the council.  That is the reality of people's lives.</p>  <p>  I suggest to the Taoiseach, as a key part of the solution, as per the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' charter for housing rights, that there should be no evictions without suitable alternative accommodation.  There can be no evictions to nowhere.  Evicting a family or an individual into homelessness must be prohibited by law.  That has to be the case because we know the resolutions are only voluntary with the banks and lenders.  People are facing evictions.  Immediate emergency legislation is needed to amend the Housing Act 1998 to give local authorities a statutory duty in this area and the resources necessary to back them up.  Will the Taoiseach do this?</p></speech>

It has struck a raw nerve with the people.  Many people raised it with me over the weekend.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is examining this matter.  We agreed to accept in principle legislation from Fianna F&aacute;il to extend regulation over investment funds.  We are bringing forward legislation proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to strengthen the courts in their requirement to take into account family circumstances such as the ones the Deputy mentioned when it comes to repossession.  We are looking at other options as well.  We are very much on the side of honest people who are making an honest attempt to pay their mortgage, to pay down their loans if they can and to settle their debts.</p>  <p>  In Ireland we have strong protections for homeowners, for borrowers and for mortgage holders.  If one looks at a the number of repossessions relative to other countries, it is much less likely that a home will be repossessed in Ireland than in many other countries, such as Spain, the UK and many others.  That is because of the strong protections we give to homeowners and borrowers in terms of property rights and the rights that apply to those individuals.  The number of repossession orders is going down.  We have been told on many occasions there would be a tsunami of repossessions.  In fact, the numbers have been going down.</p></speech>

We need to make sure that the courts are allowed to hear cases.  There may be circumstances whereby somebody can pay but is refusing to pay.  That is a different circumstance and we have a good court system.  People go into the courts, tell their story and their case is heard.  The courts generally make the right decisions and do not provide eviction orders or repossession orders without grounds for doing so.</p></speech>

It might seem that everything is fine.  Bank of Ireland made a profit of &euro;1 billion last year.  It is paying a dividend to shareholders for the first time since 2008.  The new chief executive is doing well too on &euro;1 million a year.  The European Central Bank, ECB, does not agree.  There are &euro;34 billion in non-performing loans in the system - the reason for the ECB pressure to resolve the situation.  This one size fits all European policy is not enough.</p>  <p>  I do not believe Bank of Ireland will be as generous in compensating those on tracker mortgages from whom it stole money.  On Monday night, there was an attempted eviction of a family in Balbriggan.  This family was engaged with the bank and was paying the agreed amount.  However, a move was still made to move the family out of its home.  The main point I want to make is that the Central Bank regulations, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, does not guarantee no repossessions if people engage with the lender.  I have experienced that as I am sure everybody in this Chamber has.  Some 10% of Members go to Mr. David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation looking for support.  We are all engaging in these situations with the bank.  I repeat the point that there is a solution and there is action that can be taken.  The Taoiseach should bring in a law, amend the Housing Act 1998 and try to attempt to stop evictions and make sure people do not go into homelessness.</p></speech>

There is a distinction to be made between people who are making an honest attempt to pay their mortgage, to settle their debts and pay as much as they can pay, and people who could do so but who are not.  There is a difference in that regard and any reasonable person will recognise that.</p>  <p>  In regard to what the Government is doing, in addition to what I have said, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is in consultation with the Central Bank to review the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That code of conduct already exists.  We want to examine whether it can be strengthened or whether it should perhaps not be voluntary.</p><p>I often hear people talking about this Government or a previous Government saving the banking system, as if that was just about bankers.

There is a huge distinction between banks such as Anglo Irish Bank, which was bailed out by a Government of which I was not a member, and banks such as Bank of Ireland and AIB, which were bailed out by this Government and for a good reason.

It is quite appalling to read about the level of lethargy and inaction in that regard, particularly the lack of implementation of previous reports in 2012 on this serious area of crime prevention.  The report showed a 64% increase in Internet-based offending yet there is no legislation to allow a garda, for example, to have the power to seek a password from an alleged offender to search his or her computer for illegal images.  It is exceptionally frustrating for everybody who is concerned about child sex abuse and child pornography to learn there is still a poor relationship between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The relationship is described as inefficient and worse.  That is unacceptable.  There are also recommendations on the lack of training of garda&iacute; in such situations.  In addition, sex abuse victims must travel to Dublin to be medically examined.  It is six years since recommendations were made on this issue and we are still at discussion stage.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to meet urgently to respond to this report.  It is a damning indictment of the State's response to vulnerable young children who are victims of sex abuse.  It is incredible.</p></speech>

It will involve people from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and will ensure we have an action plan that is time-targeted.

Nobody on this side of the House gave advice to the elderly to leave heating on 24-7.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, when he said that I took it that he meant it as a reassurance or an encouragement to older people to keep themselves warm.  The Taoiseach is being a little disingenuous and actually unfair to the Minister of State in suggesting that it was a concrete proposal to have heating on 24-7.  The public heard it in a different way.  In any case, I am glad the Taoiseach has agreed to that measure, that measure being the double fuel allowance not the heating on 24-7.  Can he clarify-----</p></speech>

People do not receive it in isolation.  It is a top-up payment for a number of schemes.  People in different schemes receive their payments on different dates.  Some scheme payments to be paid next week have already gone through the banking system and the Department's IT system so those people will not get their payment until probably the week after.  However, everybody will get a double week payment assigned to this week, but they will get it either next week or the week after depending on the day on which they receive their scheme payment.  The disability payments might be paid on a Tuesday and jobseeker's allowance might be paid on a Wednesday so there is no one date on which everybody will receive their payment, but everybody will receive a double week fuel payment in the coming week or two weeks.  That includes people who have chosen to take their payment in two lump sums, but they will get an individual extra week.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach give us an update on that proposal?  I ask that in the context of compacted snow on roads and footpaths which are quite treacherous, particularly in the eastern part of the country.  Is there an intention to deploy snow ploughs on all major bus and commuter routes in Dublin?  Will local authorities and possibly the Defence Forces be deployed to clear paths in urban areas, particularly in areas where there are shops, post offices and health care centres?  While there is salting and gritting, they do not deal effectively with compacted snow.  Many of the footpaths in Dublin today are like ice rinks.  What is the status of the programme for Government commitment and what will done on the footpaths and roads in Dublin?</p></speech>

Local authorities, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and many other bodies have snow ploughs and salt is stockpiled.  Nobody can say whether that will be enough because we do not know the amount of snow that will fall, how long it will last or what blizzard conditions there will be.  However, the equipment exists and the salt is stockpiled.  It may be difficult, however, given the amount of snow we expect to fall and the conditions we expect.  We must bear in mind that people's safety must come first.  We are not going to send soldiers or local authority workers out in blizzards to clear snow.  We must think about their safety as well.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commitment is being examined by the Office of Emergency Planning, but the difficulty arising is that having a rapid reaction force is not straightforward because all emergencies are different.  A storm is different from a flooding event or a snow event or a chemical-related disaster.  It is not as simple as just having a single rapid reaction force.  One would potentially need a different one for each different type of emergency.</p></speech>

We support the Bill as well.  However, regulation is not enough and must not be used as political cover to allow the sale of these loan books to vultures.  Ultimately, a regulated vulture is still a vulture.  If these vultures get their claws into people, the same aggressive behaviour that was seen at Tyrrelstown in Dublin and Leeside in Cork will be seen once again, adding to the housing crisis and people's distress.</p><p>Will the Government introduce legislation to block the sale of loan books to vulture funds?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the process of the privatisation of banks should be reversed and, instead, we should have a public banking system which can be utilised as a public utility with mortgage write-downs, as well as used as a lever to provide funding for public housing?</p></speech>

It will ensure we can provide loans to families and businesses, as well as ensuring deposits can earn a decent rate of interest.  Crucially, it will make sure the kind of link which caused such a catastrophe in our country in our recent past is firmly broken, namely, where the link between the taxpayer and our banking system is gradually reduced over time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, I do not have the legal power to intervene in the decisions made by the board of a bank.  We went through a period in which our regulators either did not have enough power or the power available to them was not sufficient.  All this conspired to create such difficulties for our economy and society.  Fundamentally, several of our banks are now being given guidance by an independent regulator to act in a certain way to improve the quality of their balance sheets and reduce their non-performing loans.</p>  <p>  The Government must strike the balance between improving the financial affairs of our banks to deal with potential difficulties which we could encounter in the future, while ensuring people are treated fairly and concerns are recognised.  We have been successful in doing that to date.  We have seen a huge reduction in mortgage arrears and non-performing loans while avoiding-----</p></speech>

We saw what happened in Balbriggan to the Smith family who were terrorised by people from abroad, ex-British soldiers.  The Taoiseach asked me to put it in writing.  I have two letters here, one for the Taoiseach and one for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  I will give them to the usher to hand to them.</p>  <p>  Ex-British soldiers beat this family.  We have a short memory.  In September 1920, Balbriggan was sacked and looted by the Black and Tans and two people were killed that night.  The local barber, James Lawless, and John Gibson were both beaten to death by the Black and Tans.  They are back again and this has happened under the Government's watch.  It is a shame on all of us to allow this go on last Monday morning in Balbriggan.  I have the information here and I want the Government to act on it.

Two of the 21 people taking part in a clinical trial of Respreeza died before Christmas when the HSE stopped funding the administration of the therapy.</p>  <p>  CSL Behring has agreed to continue to provide the drug free of charge until the new clinical trial begins in June or July 2008.  All 19 patients are back on the therapy, which has been administered, as before, by Point of Care.  After Marion Kelly's death, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, met with the family and committed to ensuring the negotiations would restart between CSL Behring and the HSE.</p>  <p>  As of today, Alpha One told me it has not yet received any update from the HSE as to when negotiations will start.

It is a summary of three meetings which we held on orphan drugs.  Orphan drugs are different from other drugs, yet the process of looking at them is the same.  They need to be treated differently.  The quality process of comparing cost-benefit analysis needs to change.  Undoubtedly, legislation will be required to change how orphan drugs are treated.  In the meantime, I believe the quality, cost-benefit analysis needs to change for drugs such as Respreeza, Translarna and Kuvan which is forphenylketonuria.</p></speech>

To fulfil the programme for Government commitment referred to, we have taken two distinctive actions.  The Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform led a process on behalf of the State where we reached a new drugs pricing agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA.  It will save the State a fortune in hundreds of millions of euro and it has pretty much stabilised drug prices.  We spend &euro;2 billion a year on drugs.  Two weeks ago, the Government agreed to formally join the BeNeLuxA Initiative group in terms of working with four other European countries in jointly horizon scanning, sharing information and, possibly, even procuring drugs with them.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> Regarding Respreeza, the Deputy is right.  I had a useful and informative meeting with the family of the late Marion Kelly.  I am grateful to the family members for their time.  I have asked that the HSE and the company re-engage and I have been informed that will happen.  I intend to meet the Alpha-1 Foundation shortly.  I will continue to make the point that the way the company ended the clinical trial without any consideration for its patients was unethical, disgusting and a breach of the Helsinki agreement.  The company should re-engage with the HSE and work out a way forward.</p> <p> Regarding orphan drugs, the Chairman of the health committee is correct.  When I spoke at the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, dinner a few months ago, I announced a process whereby we would work with industry, patient stakeholders and our procurement people on how to put in place a better system for procuring orphan drugs.</p></speech>

It is important legislation and I look forward to getting it under way.  I have decided not to proceed with the hospital's name.  I do not want the name to cause confusion or controversy in what is a major infrastructural project for our citizens.  I will outline a suggested process for deciding the name when I table the legislation.  For the moment, "National Children's Hospital Ireland" seems apt to me.</p></speech>

This has been replicated all over the country, but I will raise an example of something that is happening in the Chief Whip's constituency in Donegal where a Garda station, despite being scheduled for a &euro;2 million upgrade, which is on the never-never like so many other jobs, is going from a 24-hour station to a part-time service.  That area covers Inver, Frosses, Dunkineely, Killybegs, Kilcar, Glencolmcille, Donegal town, Drimarone, Ardaghey, Barnesmore Gap, Laghy and Ballintra.  This is against the backdrop of our launch of Project Ireland 2040 in Sligo, which cost &euro;45,000.  What message are we sending?  It is one thing wheeling everyone down for a &euro;45,000 Goebbels-style launch.  It is another thing when in reality-----</p></speech>

The President was accompanied by a delegation that included the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Angelino Alfano.  We had a very friendly and constructive exchange which covered bilateral relations, Brexit, migration and, more broadly, the debate on the future of Europe.</p>  <p>  Ireland and Italy have strong bilateral relations, with long-standing economic, cultural, sporting and tourism ties.  President Mattarella and I exchanged views about the future strengthening of this relationship in the years ahead.  We discussed the European Union&rsquo;s many achievements and agreed on the need for a positive, ambitious vision for the future based on our shared values and principles.  I noted Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to membership of the European Union.  I thanked President Mattarella for Italy&rsquo;s continued solidarity and support in our particular concerns arising from Brexit.  We exchanged views on the negotiations to date and outlined our shared ambition for a close and comprehensive future relationship with the UK.  I acknowledged the challenges Italy faces in migration and expressed our appreciation for the work of the Italian Government, local authorities and NGOs in dealing humanely with large numbers of migrants.  I also noted the importance of solidarity here and the need to assist front-line member states.  President Mattarella expressed appreciation for our support, including our decision to opt in to the EU relocation and resettlement measures agreed in 2015 and our provision of a series of fully crewed naval vessels to assist Italian authorities with search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

I suggest to the Taoiseach that this hospital be called after Dr. Kathleen Lynn, a veteran of 1913, 1916 and also the founder of the first infants hospital, St. Ultan's in Charlemont Street.  There are no women who were involved in the revolutionary period commemorated in any public buildings in the State that I am aware of.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-28a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022800021#S01300"><p>Unfortunately, I think it was the Taoiseach's decision not to have statements before or after last week's summit.  Having told us last year how eager he was to have a much greater public engagement on European Union issues this reluctance to engage with the House is surprising and somewhat disappointing.  It is also surprising that he is not willing to have any discussion on the European Union's budget.  I have tabled a question on that for later.  He was not willing to discuss institutional reform or any other issue before setting out Ireland's position at the summit.  Given that he briefed the media that they were important discussions he is not in a position to say that only minor issues were on the agenda.</p>  <p>  The budget is part of the third group of questions.  On reform, it is my understanding that the majority at the summit disagreed with the Taoiseach's willingness to sign up for the Spitzenkandidat system and the introduction of transnational Members of the European Parliament, MEPs.  These proposals significantly marginalise small countries and undermine the fair balance of powers and accountability within the European Union structure.  We need to discuss this seriously in the House. </p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm that he has agreed to reject the insistence of the European Parliament that the groups decide on the Commission president?  This process in 2014 had close to no impact on citizens but denied a proper debate between countries about the leadership of the Commission.  I note the Taoiseach has expressed his concern about the failure of the media to give enough coverage to his speech last year launching a so-called national dialogue on Europe.  It is important that we have a decent debate on these issues to do with institutional reform in this House.</p>  <p>  If the Taoiseach is going to maintain the position he adopted in Strasbourg he will at the very least seek some legitimacy and submit it to the D&aacute;il for a vote.  The Spitzenkandidat process effectively removes the ability of Ireland and other countries to have a say in deciding on critical issues.  The Taoiseach should acknowledge the right of the D&aacute;il to have its say before agreeing to such a move. </p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach tell me the current status of the digital taxation discussion?  Will he publish any additional information or impact assessments of it before next month's summit?</p></speech>

I cannot think of a more appropriate figure to name this facility after than Dr. Kathleen Lynn.  We could dispense with a very elaborate and long process if we could have agreement on that point.  The suggestion has been made quite widely and by many figures.</p></speech>

The initial responses from some are perhaps predictable but they are regrettable nonetheless.  It now seems that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, are rejecting this draft agreement as wholly unacceptable, constitutionally dubious and something that they are not prepared to tolerate.  Those are their words.  There is a job of work to be done in defending the interests of this island in its totality, in insisting on respect for the mandate of the people in the North to remain within the European Union.  Will our Italian friend, Sergio Mattarella, be an ally in this regard?</p>  <p>  If dialogue on the future of all aspects of Europe is to be successful it has to be genuine.  Very often we try to dress up something to do with European affairs as a debate but the insistence of the political establishment is that there is only one orthodoxy, one correct way to approach Europe and anybody who is in any way critical or questioning is "anti-European" or a "bad European".  If there is to be any kind of fruitful dialogue and it is absolutely essential at this juncture we have to dispense with that.  It is clear that we need a change of direction.  The direction of travel which suits corporate interests and the political establishment is one that has been deeply alienating for citizens on the ground and for people who care about Europe and who are proud to be Europeans, as I am, that is very worrying.  That has been the direction of travel for quite some time but it is brought into very sharp focus by Brexit, by developments in Europe and other member states where the far right and ultra-right has a very destructive grip on the political dynamic.  We need to address this collectively and honestly.</p></speech>

The programme of work of the unit is part of the Civil Service renewal programme, which is overseen by the Civil Service Management Board.  An assistant secretary delivery team has been established to lead the implementation of the unit's programme of work across all Departments.  This team comprises representatives at assistant secretary level from all Government Departments.</p><p>This team met on 8 February 2018 and is due to meet on the following dates through 2018: 12 April, 14 June, 3 September and 8 November.  Meetings with Departments are also held on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis as required in order to progress the work of the unit.  As an example, each Department has nominated project managers to oversee the migration of the Department to <i>gov.ie</i>and also the implementation of the new Government of Ireland identity.  These officials meet as required with officials from the unit to ensure progress on these activities. </p><p>A list of the tenders which were run and the successful tenderers will be circulated to Members with this reply.  Contracts are now in place with these tenderers to support the work of the strategic communications unit.  Procurement for five of these contracts was overseen by the Office of Government Procurement.  In line with public procurement, one tender in respect of identity was managed by my Department as the estimated cost for services was under the &euro;25,000 threshold.</p><p>Project Ireland 2040 was launched at the Institute of Technology, IT, Sligo on Friday, 16 February 2018.  Events of the day included a Government meeting to approve the plan, the actual launch of the plan and a number of media engagements carried out by myself and the Cabinet.  I also met Dr. Brendan McCormack, president of IT Sligo, who was our host for the event.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><table><tr><th>Provision of research and insight.</th><th>Awarded to Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes</th></tr><tr><td>Provision of digital creative services.</td><td>Awarded to Radical Digital now trading as CORE</td></tr><tr><td>Provision of integrated creative and digital campaign services.</td><td>Awarded to TBWA</td></tr><tr><td>Provision of media strategy planning and buying services.</td><td>Awarded to PHD</td></tr><tr><td>Development of Government identity system for roll out across Government Departments.</td><td>Awarded to Zero-G</td></tr><tr><td>Provision of marketing pitch specialist services</td><td>Awarded to Agency Assessments</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are worrying signs that he sees no difference between the State's interests and those of his own party.  He said yesterday that this is not even an issue about which we should be talking.  The reason this issue keeps arising is because it involves a personal initiative of the Taoiseach to radically alter established practice when it comes to the use of public money to promote Government rather than specific initiatives or basic public information.  It goes to the heart of distinguishing between the State, the politicians in government and the wider political debate.  In defence of himself, the Taoiseach has now adopted the incredible position that we have a new unit of 15 people in his Department initiated by him that does nothing new and is not responsible for the output for which it is paid.  Incredibly, we are told that it did not sign off on X, Y or Z.  The Taoiseach has continued the now weekly habit of completely misrepresenting others in his defence.  Of course, he has disgracefully attacked as false the work of a journalist who has had the temerity to point to inconvenient facts.  Is it the case that the Taoiseach, as the member of Government responsible for this public spending, thinks there is nothing wrong whatsoever with public funding resulting in the non-office holders and candidates of one political party being used in advertising?  I have not received an answer to that question to date and I would like one.  Is that acceptable?  Does the Taoiseach think it okay that candidates of one political party should appear in Government advertisements paid for by the taxpayer?</p>  <p>  Why is the Taoiseach so completely uninterested in the comments from editors and journalists to the effect that they were pressurised to present Government advertising as part of normal coverage?  It was a bit late to say yesterday that it should be clearly delineated and separate.  The Taoiseach should not pretend that he did not know what was going on for the past number of weeks in respect of this matter.  Will he stand over the fact that newspapers were informed that there would be more to come if they did as they were told?  Does he not agree that an independent review of practice should be established to ensure that proper party political boundaries and political boundaries are respected?  If he does not agree with this, could he indicate why?  If the Taoiseach is completely satisfied and fully confident that everything is fine, surely an independent review will simply say that.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach confirm that the strategic communications unit plans to place advertisements on every local radio station throughout the country?  How much money is to be spent on these?</p>  <p>  Lots of people have told me there are advertisements in cinemas at present at the end of which the Taoiseach is featured.  Could the Taoiseach indicate the number of cinemas in which the advertisements running?  People from Wexford and other counties, not just Dublin, have seen the advertisements as part of cinema advertising.  Could the Taoiseach explain to us now or later in detail if he does not have the details to hand the names of the cinemas and so on?</p>  <p>  I also want to ask the Taoiseach about section 41(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which prohibits an advertisement that is directed towards a political end.  This is presumably why RT&Eacute;, TV3 and national radio cannot carry these advertisements.  Two weeks ago and again last week, I suggested to the Taoiseach that this is essentially unethical and crosses a line for which political parties are funded as political parties.  We have no problem with every Fine Gael hopeful and would-be candidate being funded by Fine Gael.  We object to the Government of the day funding its candidates in advertorials or paid for advertising.  There is a gap in the law but I will ask the Opposition parties to have a look at the law so that in respect of the ban on political advertising, which has served the country well in a variety of contested spaces down through the decades, we would look at introducing the same measure so political funding goes to the parties and they spend it within the law as they see fit but the action of the Government is on behalf of the people of Ireland.  What the Government is doing is unethical and crosses a line.</p></speech>

If this was about investing money into promoting an important public policy, it would be fine.  For example, with initiatives on road safety or BreastCheck, everybody can see the absolute common sense and public value in investment of that nature.  What we are witnessing is not a comprehensive citizens' awareness programme, as the Taoiseach has previously described it.  Effectively, it is the promotion of an election and a political manifesto and agenda in the final analysis on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</p> <p> We are now confronted with a matter of very serious public concern.  I accept that much of the banter in the early days about the strategic communications unit might well have been understood to be - might well have in fact been - just party political banter and positioning.</p></speech>

However, it is now abundantly clear that we are dealing with something far more serious.  The Taoiseach can no longer brazen this one out or shrug it off.  These are significant sums of public money involved and we need a robust process and procedure to assure members of the public - not to assure Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party or Fianna F&aacute;il - that they are not being taken for a ride.  I suspect - in fact, I now know - that they are.</p></speech>

We may all be candidates but I am not aware of any plans for an election anytime soon unless somebody else does.  I understand from the newspapers - this may or may not be correct - that Fianna F&aacute;il has lodged a complaint with the Standards in Public Office Commission and another party has lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.  I have no doubt that those bodies will act professionally and appropriately in dealing with any such complaints.  That is at least two independent bodies already examining those complaints.</p></speech>

I agree with that and it has been.  I see the analysis that was carried out of the regional newspaper advertorials by <i>The Irish Times</i>today, which showed that 20 out of 20 contained a strapline stating that this was done in partnership with Project Ireland 2040.  On its Twitter account, Fianna F&aacute;il has stated that it has no problem with advertorials which have been around for 50 years.  Given that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin featured in advertorials, I understand why he could not have a problem with them.  Of course, we all agree now - this is a fact - that this is by no means the most expensive public information campaign run to date.  At least three were more expensive, including the climate change campaign-----</p></speech>

I note from the Deputy's comments that he does not have a difficulty with officeholders appearing in advertorials.  This, indeed, was done in the NDP advertorials - in fact much more frequently than any of these advertorials.  The complaint seems to be that some of the content - some of the advertorials - included people photographed who were not holders of office.  This has all been done at arm's length.  As I have said before and will say again, neither I, none of my advisers, none of the Civil Service staff has a role in this.  It was deliberately done at arm's length.  This is a Civil Service unit headed by a public servant.  The ads are put in on behalf of Government and it is done on behalf of Government in accordance with Civil Service principles.  I do not have any details or information about when or where ads or advertorials are placed, nor do I seek them.</p></speech>

As my Department has confirmed, when it came to the regional newspaper advertorials, all the communications unit provided was the content of what was in the Project Ireland 2040 plan.  No suggestions were made as to who should be interviewed.  No people were put forward for interview.  No photographs were provided.  The content in those advertorials, beyond the basic facts was determined by the media organisations and not by me, civil servants or my Department.  I note from the analysis carried out by <i>The Irish Times</i>that 18 of the 20 regional newspaper advertorials contained no names and no interviews, just a factual synopsis of what was in the plan.  Seventeen of the 20 have no photographs of politicians, other than those of Ministers who attended the event in Sligo.</p><p>The Leader of the Opposition has on a few occasions referenced a candidate who is not a Member of the Oireachtas.  The only candidate who is not a Member of the Oireachtas and who appears in any of the advertorials is a candidate who appears in an advertorial by the <i>Longford Leader</i>.  However, is it not the case that the owner-editor of the <i>Longford Leader</i>is, in fact, a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate?</p></speech>

Last week, we had a finding of defamation against RT&Eacute; after a Labour candidate made defamatory comments about a member of Sinn F&eacute;in with regard to their alleged connections with the IRA.  In the view of the courts, that was not challenged adequately by the RT&Eacute; presenter at the time.  We had a similar occurrence this week on this issue where the deputy leader of the Labour party, Deputy Kelly, compared my Government and civil servants in my Department to the Third Reich, to Nazis and to Goebbels, which was wholly inappropriate.</p></speech>

I want to put that on the record here.  I want to know from Deputy Burton - who has no difficulty going off topic in many questions, as was demonstrated again today - if she stands by those comments by Deputy Kelly.  Will she dissociate herself from them?  Will the Labour party dissociate itself from them?  I do not ask this for me because I have some sort of thin skin - I do not.  I am well capable of responding to blows with blows.</p></speech>

He is also entitled to be a candidate for a political party but Government money is not spent on him to promote him.  Fianna F&aacute;il will have to do that, as every other candidate in this country will have to do it.  I have never used the term &quot;Goebbels&quot; and I hate anyone using Nazi terms about anyone in a current parliamentary democracy.  I do not like it or endorse it and I disassociate myself from it.  Any Member of the House who uses such terms should reflect on what he or she has said and withdraw any assertion that any Member of this House or any Member of Government is engaging in that matter.  What we are discussing here is light years apart from what happened during the Third Reich.  I have never been under any illusions about that and I want to make that crystal clear.  I think, in many respects, that it was not the correct strategy for the Taoiseach to attempt to put me on a spot with regard to that.</p><p>All I would say with regard to Joe Costello is that it is still a live issue before the courts.  It is not appropriate that it be discussed here because the issue is not finalised in that respect and I do not think it merited reference.  On the more substantive point that I asked in my question, the bottom line is that the Government is responsible for the spending of taxpayers' money and how that money is spent.  If it transpires that that money has been spent on promoting Fine Gael candidates, then there has to be a review.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that it had nothing to do with it and that it is at arm's length.  One cannot be at arm's length from the proper spending of taxpayers' money.  That is the point.  The Government cannot simply say that it put a whole lot of money over somewhere and that people can do what they like with it.  Basic rules and principles should apply.  It has never been the case in the Civil Service code or the utilisation of taxpayers' money that it is spent on party political candidates.  That is what has happened.  It is not just the <i>Longford Leader</i>.  It is the <i>Limerick Leader</i>too.  There were three Fine Gael candidates on those advertorials.  The <i>Roscommon</i>-----</p></speech>

There is an onus on the Government to make sure that taxpayers' money is spent properly.  When it turns out that it has not been properly and procedurally spent, that should be acknowledged and it should be resolved that it does not happen again.  I asked the Taoiseach if he would conduct a comprehensive independent review.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, will have parameters to what it can do.  What does the Taoiseach have against establishing an independent review of this?  He set up this unit and he appointed the head himself.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Taoiseach referenced the change programme.  That is an outrageous, dishonest comparison.  That was about reducing carbon footprint in industry and a green procurement policy.  It was a whole societal change.  To be fair to John Gormley, the Green Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time, that was a five-year programme.  The Taoiseach did not present it in the D&aacute;il last night as a five-year programme.  It was a substantive part of the national climate change strategy of the State.</p></speech>

As somebody who has been the victim of the most atrocious assault and slander on social media, for the Taoiseach to suggest to me that I would countenance, for one moment, other people from any party or none behaving in an inappropriate way in the course of debate to other people, I can say that I do not do that and have never done that in my political career.  The Taoiseach and I have shared a constituency.  He is very familiar with those subjects on which I have contributed.  To throw around accusations of a general kind here is completely inappropriate and dishonours the Taoiseach's office.  When one becomes Taoiseach, one is meant to meet a higher standard.  The Taoiseach is clearly annoyed and irritated that something that has been, understandably for Deputy Varadkar as Taoiseach, a prize project has been subject to criticism here.  I would say to the Taoiseach that he is perhaps a little too thin-skinned about that in the context of his replies.  Deputies Mich&eacute;al Martin, Howlin, Adams, the new leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy McDonald, and I have all asked a repeated series of questions at different stages over the last month or so to which we have not received satisfactory answers.  If we received satisfactory answers, we would have stopped asking the questions.  Instead, the Taoiseach's answers have become more convoluted.  In fact, his answer there about departmental assistant secretaries meeting twice a week in answer to the question by Deputy Michael Moynihan sounds more like a theological answer that might come from a priest, bishop or lawyer than from a Taoiseach actually answering about the day-to-day concerns of people who are worried about the roof over their heads and the state of their health service.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and his Ministers should develop a sense of proportion on this.  There is a system in this country which has served us well, with direct funding from the State for political parties which allows political parties, within the rules, to spend that money on the promotion of the political purposes of their party and the promotion of their ideals.  There is then Government funding and when political parties take office there are potentially great opportunities for whoever has the honour to become Taoiseach or a Minister to promote ideas in that Government.  There is a strict division between party political and the Government position.  The Taoiseach is honoured to be in government and needs to carry the can and take responsibility for this.  What he is trying to do now is divert.  I would say that references in this House to Goebbels and the propaganda unit that he had are, in my view, inappropriate and I think anyone who has been involved in that should reflect and pause because it does not help our debate.  Equally, I think the Taoiseach is trying to distort what has been said.  I used one term about the Taoiseach's policy.</p></speech>

In the rough and tumble of proceedings in the House things are sometimes said that are unfair or unwise, but that should not be used as a pretext for not answering direct questions.  The expenditure of public moneys for political purposes is a public interest issue, with which we must get to grips.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government that it is not in their long-term interests to allow the matter to persist.  Whatever short-term gain or investment has been made in this process has now been brought into public disrepute.  This is not about the Taoiseach responding in a party political way to his opponents or reacting to language he might sincerely regard as intemperate because that would be to miss the point entirely.  We are dealing with an issue of ethics in the use of public moneys, which is very serious.  Can we have answers in that regard?  Is there an answer to the public concerns?  Can we find a methodology to assure all Members and the public that this is not a try-on?  The answers we have heard so far in that regard do not give the necessary assurances.</p></speech>
