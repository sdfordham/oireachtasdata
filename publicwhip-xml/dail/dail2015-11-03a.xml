The political stalemate and the wider political and societal instability it fosters must not be allowed to continue.  Every effort needs to be made by the participants, in particular the Irish Government, in its particular role of co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to put the peace process on a permanent and sustainable footing and ensure the all-party talks will result in a successful outcome.  I wish the Minister, the British Government and all the parties every success in these very important talks which should be nearing a conclusion.</p></reply>

The talks resumed in round table format on 21 September and are continuing in a constructive atmosphere.  I have worked closely with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, in encouraging all parties to continue to engage in a constructive manner in the talks process.</p><p>As well as round table sessions, the talks are taking place in bilateral and trilateral format and good work is also being done in discussions between the parties themselves.  The more inclusive the engagement, the better the final agreement will be.</p> <p> My current assessment is that the talks have now moved to an intensive phase and we are making good progress around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement as well as dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism.  The Stormont House Agreement, concluded in December 14, offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.  It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing new institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the troubles and their families.  </p> <p> It is essential that all five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two governments, urgently advance full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and address the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity.  While significant challenges remain, I am hopeful that with committed and collective engagement, we can make real progress on the critical issues in the coming days with a view to a successful conclusion of the talks.  An agreed outcome, supported by all five parties, would be an important step forward, not just for politics, but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The need for such a conclusion is evidently demonstrated by the report on paramilitary activity - which makes for stark reading - and the attendant problems for communities on both sides of the Border.  As the House knows, that report pointed out that individual provisional IRA members remain involved in criminal activity, such as large-scale smuggling and there have been isolated incidents of violence, including murders.  The report also points out the illegal activities and the unacceptable activity of other paramilitary groups which have no place in society either, such as the UVF, the Ulster Defence Association and the INLA.</p>  <p>  There is an urgent need to have all of these issues dealing with the legacy of the past and ongoing criminal activity dealt with in a comprehensive manner.  The Minister would be aware that last March, I brought legislation to the House calling for the establishment of an all-Ireland cross-Border forum.  This would comprise members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, our customs service, the Northern Ireland customs service, the Environmental Protection Agency and its counterparts north of the Border and other relevant statutory agencies.  I welcome the fact the Minister has indicated he is thinking along those lines.  Will he assure us that the establishment of such an agency, with a remit and focus to deal with criminality on both sides of the Border, will be a central part of the ongoing all-party discussions in Stormont and will he assure us that such a body will have an important remit to deal with the outstanding issues arising from paramilitary activity?</p></speech>

It states that all the main paramilitary groups operating during the period of the Troubles remain in existence, including the provisional IRA and a number of loyalist groups and organisations.  The assessment adds that the structures of the provisional IRA remain in existence, but in a much reduced form, and that the leadership of the provisional IRA remains committed to the peace process and the group is not involved in terrorist activity.</p>  <p>  In the context of the ongoing negotiations and talks, it is important that we read these reports, not only the report of the PSNI but also the report of An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na, in their entirety and not be selective in our quotes.  Nevertheless, I agree with Deputy Smith that the continuation of any paramilitary activity is unacceptable and unsustainable and must be ended.  We have the opportunity in the current talks process to ensure that all parties commit to that objective.</p></speech>

That agreement received over 94% support in the referendum in our State and well over 70% North of the Border.  It behoves all of us in public life on this island to work ceaselessly to ensure that its provisions and those of subsequent agreements are implemented in full.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that every effort is made in these talks to progress as many aspects as possible of the Good Friday Agreement and to implement measures contained in the other agreements without further delay.</p>  <p>  I am concerned by the legislation proposed by the British in respect of dealing with the legacy of the past.  I think it was Mr. Mark Durkan, MP for Foyle, who stated very clearly that the proposed legislation in its present form falls short of the commitments that were made in the Stormont House Agreement last December.  I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that such legislation will be adequate to ensure that the measures proposed in the Stormont House Agreement are implemented.</p></speech>

I am listening closely to what the Deputy has said in that regard.  Let me assure the House that it was always the intention that the current round of talks would be focused and intensive.  There is no doubt that in recent days the talks have intensified and I expect this to continue.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and myself will be in Belfast between now and the end of this week.  The urgency indicated by the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, in recent days reflects my own sense that an agreement can be reached within a very short timeframe.</p>  <p>  I must acknowledge that some challenges remain, with a number of crucial gaps which need to be bridged between the participants.  It is not just a question of timing or of bringing matters to an urgent conclusion.  It is also an issue of substance.  It is important that all elements of the talks - the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement on the one hand, including questions around finance and welfare reform, and dealing with the legacy of the past, with reference to what Deputy Smith has said, as well as the impact and legacy of paramilitarism - be fully addressed now while we have the opportunity.  These matters must be addressed in a meaningful way in advance of any agreed outcome.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, conditions in Palestine are among the worst faced since its illegal occupation.  We have all seen pictures on camera phones and cannot hide the reality of what is actually happening during the occupation.  We have also heard eyewitness reports.  Gaza is the world's biggest prison and the inhuman occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem negatively affects every facet of daily life.  Since 13 September, 73 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli authorities while 2,200 have been arrested and 2,250 injured, many by plastic bullets.  The international community has largely remained silent.  I have not heard any statement from the Minister on the recent human rights and international violations.  I know he is busy with the talks and so on but what are his plans in the face of such blatant violations?  Has he raised the issue with the Israeli authorities or with his European counterparts?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300005#C00600"><p>The clearly deteriorating situation in Palestine and east Jerusalem, which is now spreading to other areas, is a matter of very great concern.  The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process which might promise an end to this situation and, among Palestinians, the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and loss of belief in a political path forward.  Tensions have been increased in recent months by a provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long-respected <i>status quo</i>of the holy places and sites in Jerusalem.</p><p>To these now have been added a genuine alarm and fear among Israeli citizens caused by a number of sudden attacks, resulting in pressure for a tougher response by the authorities.  The risk of an escalating spiral of violence is now very obvious.  <br/><br/>In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by revenge or a sense of despair.  Any response by the security forces needs to be proportionate.  It is the job of local leaders on all sides to go beyond this and a mere security response and to address the underlying issues.  I again urge all sides to refrain from any provocation and call on Israel to make clear - in practice as well as words - that the <i>status quo</i>on the Temple Mount will be restored and respected.  I note that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have already taken some steps in this direction and I encourage them to continue.  <br/><br/>More broadly, these events underline the message I have conveyed at international level since I took office.  Political leadership, including from the international community, needs to address the problems of the relentless expansion of settlements and the absence of any process aiming at the end of the occupation.</p></speech>

We all want to see an end to violence but the reality seems to be that the Israeli Government continues its occupation, oppression and apartheid policies and Palestinians are subjected to extra-judicial killings.  This is the most extreme and right-wing government Israel has had and its promotion of hate and impunity continues to kill the hopes and aspirations of Palestinians.  In recent weeks, we have seen the spectacle of Prime Minister Netanyahu seeking to shift the blame for the crimes of the Holocaust from Hitler to the Palestinians.</p>  <p>  I want to hear what we can do as a small country and what Europe can do.  What will it take for Europe to finally act on these gross violations of international law?  When will Ireland take a principled stance and demand an end to the preferable trade association agreement Israel enjoys?  We can all see that it is getting worse.  What action will we see, particularly from ourselves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300006#D00300"><p>Many of us have seen the most disturbing video clips in recent times of civilians on both sides being killed.  Some Israeli citizens have been murdered in clearly sectarian attacks.  A greater number of Palestinian civilians have been killed, many of whom have not been directly involved in any attacks.  There are also concerns that so many of the attackers, despite lacking firearms, were shot dead rather than captured.  I agree with Deputy Crowe that if this spiral of violence is not stopped, these tragedies will continue to mount up.  I repeat my clear call for an end to attacks on civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to play a most important role at international level.  The EU has stated clearly that all violence against civilians must end and that both sides should avoid any provocation.  In addition, the EU has underlined that the lack of any clear political path is clearly exacerbating the sense of hopelessness that may have fuelled some of the recent attacks.  I ask the Deputy and other Deputies to read carefully the content of an address by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini following her visit to Israel and Palestine two weeks ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300006#D00400"><p>During the past ten years, more than 11,000 attacks have been perpetrated by illegal Israeli settlers against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties.  Does the Minister not agree that settlements are one of the biggest obstacles to peace?  Will he push for an EU ban on the entry into the EU of goods produced in illegal settlements?  If we cannot get this agreement, will he push for unilateral action?</p><p> I raised this with the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and there was talk at that time it would be seriously considered.  Would the Minister even consider the possibility of blacklisting illegal and violent settlers who want to enter the European Union?  That has been suggested.  The symbolism and impact of this would be very important.  This is a call for action today.  We can say we are concerned about what is happening and so on but unless we actually do something the call for calm, peace and dialogue will fall on barren ground and we will not achieve anything.  I appeal to the Minister to come forward with some unilateral action that Ireland can take on this matter.</p></speech>

It has been for some time and continues to be.  It also continues to be the objective of the European Union.  With particular reference to the settlements, the EU has consistently asserted that they are illegal and has condemned their continued expansion and all policies associated with that.  I had the opportunity earlier this year to visit some of the land adjacent to the expanded settlement area and expressed my concern in a meeting with former foreign minister, Mr. Lieberman.  I do so on every occasion when I have an opportunity to register a complaint on behalf of the people of Ireland.  I again assure the House that the EU continues to prepare guidelines to ensure that settlement goods may not be labelled in a misleading manner.  I raised this earlier in the year.  Following the intervention of the Irish Government on numerous occasions, this issue remains very much at the top of the agenda at European Foreign Affairs Council level.  I expect to see progress on the issue of settlement goods on 11 November, and will be happy to report to the Deputy on that progress.</p></speech>

It is one in which I have taken a very active role since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last year.  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to this citizen.  The key focus of our extensive engagement on this complex and sensitive case remains securing this citizen&rsquo;s best interests in so far as we can, working to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest opportunity and providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  I have had numerous discussions with my Egyptian counterpart about this case.  I and my officials have extensive contact with the Egyptian ambassador in Dublin, and there has been ongoing contact between our ambassador and embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities.  The Taoiseach has also raised this case with President el-Sisi, in September, in New York.  We continue to be in extensive contact with other international partners who have had citizens in similar situations.</p>  <p>  This exceptional level of action has been taken by the Government and by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because of the exceptional nature of this case: he was a minor at the time of his arrest and the group nature of his trial gives rise to particular concerns.</p><p>I will continue to take all appropriate action that I believe to be in the best interests of this citizen.  However, the reality is that any decision to release this citizen will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities, not by the authorities in Dublin.  Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government exercises care and caution to ensure its actions, bothin  public and private, will be well judged and not detract from our key goal of securing positive progress for this citizen at the earliest possible time.  I am aware that there are those, including some in this House, who do not agree with the Government's approach, but I appeal to all<font color="#004080"></font>those who have this citizen's best interests in mind to ensure their actions and public statements are not such that they could jeopardise our considered and concerted efforts to achieve positive progress for this citizen and his release at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

He is not just an Irish citizen in an Egyptian jail; he is, to my knowledge, the only European Union citizen in an Egyptian jail on a political charge.  Is it not clear that the Irish Government should demand action that will avoid a trial?  This is not a normal country with a normal judicial process.  It is a dictatorship where 400 or 500 people have been put in a cage and are being tried together on charges that carry the death sentence.  Has the Minister studied the case of the Australian journalist Peter Greste who was held on trumped-up charges but who was freed under law 140 of the Egyptian code which provides for the deportation of an accused foreign national in Egypt to be dealt with under the law of his or her home state?  Should the Minister not call for a presidential decree that this law be invoked?  The Minister said the Taoiseach had met President el-Sisi in New York on the margins of the United Nations.  Can the Minister tell us what was said and what the President of Egypt said in response?  This information has not been relayed to the family.</p></speech>

As an example of our ongoing interest in and commitment to this case, within the past hour I spoke at length to my colleague, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Sameh Shoukry.  I spoke to him on a number of occasions during the summer.  This afternoon my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sean Sherlock, will meet the Egyptian ambassador in Dublin.  We will continue at every level, including at the level of the Taoiseach, to raise this issue.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the family of this citizen are being and will continue to be kept fully informed of all developments.  We have made numerous visits to the citizen in prison, most recently by our newly appointed ambassador to Cairo earlier this week.  Every opportunity will be taken, both legally and politically, to ensure an earlier return.</p>  <p>  I have studied the case of the two journalists and assure the Deputy that we have addressed the issue on the international stage.  I have discussed it with my ministerial colleagues from the country of origin of the two journalists to whom the Deputy refers.</p></speech>

Has the Minister made any strenuous representations to those in the appropriate senior positions in the European Union that they should put pressure on the Egyptian Government for the release of Ibrahim Halawa?  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, is scheduled to meet President el-Sisi this week.  Has the Minister had the opportunity to raise this issue with the British Prime Minister?  To my knowledge Mr. Halawa is the only European Union citizen under unjust political detention in Egypt?</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister was in Cairo on 12 October to discuss funding for the people of Gaza, which I fully support, of course.  Has he brought back any first-hand report on the Ibrahim Halawa case from that visit?</p></speech>

However, on my visit to Cairo last year I certainly had an opportunity to raise the issue.  As recently as 1 p.m. this afternoon I had the opportunity of direct engagement on the issue.  On the specific issue the Deputy raised regarding the international journalist, it is very clear to me from all the contacts I have made and from studying the various documentation that the position of the Egyptian authorities is such that the current trial process must be permitted to take its course before consideration can be given to any application for presidential decree.  Any decision is ultimately one for the Egyptian authorities.  I assure the Deputy that I have raised the issue on the international stage and will continue to do so.  In particular I have raised it with High Representative, Federica Mogherini, high-level persons within the European Parliament and also with the Foreign Ministers of the countries of origin of the journalists to whom the Deputy refers.  Every effort will continue to be made until we see this citizen back on Irish soil.</p></speech>

In recent weeks High Representative Mogherini has taken part in meetings with the quartet and bilateral discussions with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and President Abbas.  Have any new initiatives arisen from these interactions to bolster the Middle East peace process at European Union level in light of fresh violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict.  We all know that stalemate in the peace process leads to increasing violence, despair and needless loss of life.</p></reply>

As I have previously reported to the House, I have consistently argued in the Foreign Affairs Council that the EU needs to retain a focus on the conflict in Israel and Palestine, and to do more.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged that High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has shared my concern, even in the face of many competing international crises.</p><p>In recent months the Foreign Affairs Council has begun to consider what more the European Union can do and I expect that discussion to continue at the Council in November.</p> <p> In her remarks to the European Parliament last week High Representative Mogherini listed twin priorities of action on the ground to reduce tensions and rebuild confidence and to build the conditions for renewed negotiations for the resumption of the peace process.  During her visit to the region in the previous week she stressed that message to both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</p> <p> We all know that we are at a most difficult point for the start of such an endeavour.  Mistrust and misunderstanding between the two sides are perhaps higher now than they have been for many years.  It is hoped the recent tragic events have opened the eyes of all responsible leaders to the price of the current inaction.  If a political path is not laid out to bring an element of assurance and the current unacceptable occupation to an end, we will continue to see a further deterioration in relations in what is a tragic situation.  I will have an opportunity to resume debate at European Union level at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which I understand is due to be held the week after next.</p></speech>

He is aware that violent clashes erupted in September between Israeli security officials and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in east Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, we have since witnessed once again a new wave of violence and a number of fatalities on both sides of the conflict.  The violence continues to put at further risk the viability of a two-state solution.  The Minister is also aware that one of his predecessors as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Brian Lenihan Snr., launched that policy and that this was the first European Union country to outline the policy and commit itself to it.  Will he inform the House of the efforts being made to de-escalate the violence and come to an agreement, in particular on the disputed holy sites which have become an issue in recent times, with the many other issues of conflict and the necessity to protect innocent people from further violence to themselves and their communities?</p></speech>

It is important, in the first instance, that a measure of respect be shown to the <i>status quo</i>on the matter of holy places and sites.  Full respect must be restored and maintained.</p><p>It is the continued view of the Government that a negotiated two-state solution is the objective and the most important goal of this country and the European Union.  It is important that we ask the question of what is the alternative.  There does not appear to be any convincing response other than the continued objective of a two-state solution.  That will involve vision and leadership which must primarily come from within the Israeli and Palestinian groups.  The international community has a role to play.  It is important that it continue to persevere and that we do not under any circumstances abandon hope as we have a strong and positive role to play in bringing the parties together around the table.  From our perspective on the island of Ireland, we may have a continued positive and active role to play in that regard.</p></speech>

I reiterate that together with colleagues in government, the Minister must take every opportunity in every forum available, be it at the United Nations, the European Union or other international fora, to continue to highlight the injustice being perpetrated on innocent people in that region, as well as the need to move that peace process forward in a meaningful way.  While all Members are committed to the two-state solution, the continuous annexation of lands by the Israelis makes that particular solution even more problematic.  To conclude, has the Minister engaged recently with either the Palestinian or Israeli representatives in Ireland regarding the present tensions in that region and in particular, its escalation since September?  Is the Minister aware of new initiatives being taken by the international community to try to progress some of the measures contained in previous agreements that would have brought some progress to different aspects of the conflict?  Are efforts being made by the international community to advance or to bring into being the aforementioned agreements that were signed some time ago?</p></speech>

I believe it is important in the first instance that measures be taken to de-escalate the violent activity in Jerusalem and the region.  The expansion of the settlements continues to narrow the window of possibility of bringing together both sides in an atmosphere of constructive engagement.  I have raised these issues consistently in the context of my discussions with Israeli representatives and interlocutors.  I keep in contact with both representatives of the Palestinian mission in Dublin and of the Israeli embassy.  It is important the international community continues to show engagement and I expect fresh initiatives in the coming months.  I expect the matter will be high on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, after which I will be happy to report to the Deputy and to the House.</p></speech>

I asked whether the Minister was concerned about the lack of security services to protect citizens attending peaceful and democratic rallies, especially during the run-up to the election.  I note that three months earlier, there was a bombing in Suru&ccedil; after which the Turkish Government rounded up 2,500 people, the majority of whom were Kurds, who had been the victims of the attack in Suru&ccedil;.  In addition, 114 members of ISIS are supposed to have been lifted as part of that response.  However, this has moved on to the question of the election itself and the next question I will ask the Minister is whether he is concerned about what happened.</p></reply>

I wish to reiterate my condemnation of this attack, which the Turkish authorities believe was carried out by individuals linked to Islamic State.  In a statement, I expressed my condolences to the families of the deceased, to those who were injured, and to the people of Turkey.  I personally visited the Turkish Embassy and signed the book of condolences.  I offer my condolences once more today in the House.  The ambassador of Ireland in Ankara was among a group of EU ambassadors who visited the site of the attack on 12 October and laid flowers in tribute to the victims.</p><p>I also condemn the earlier terrorist attacks, including on a People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, HDP, rally in south-eastern Turkey on 5 June and a Kurdish youth centre in southern Turkey on 20 July.   It is worrying that the terrorist attacks have largely focused on HDP-related events.  I regret the resurgence of violence in Turkey.  The integrity of the democratic process must be respected at all times.  There is no place for violence in this process.</p> <p> The Turkish authorities have strongly committed to doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of all Turkish citizens, including by increased security measures.  In this context, it is welcome that the elections which took place on Sunday, 1 November, were held in a largely peaceful manner.  The breakdown of the PKK ceasefire is regrettable.  I reiterate my call that all sides exercise the utmost restraint.  Ireland is very supportive of the peace process between the Turkish authorities and the Kurds.  Through the work of the conflict resolution unit of my Department, financial assistance is provided for an international NGO which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs, journalists and advisers working for peace.</p> <p> Officials in my Department and at our embassy in Ankara will continue to monitor developments in Turkey closely.</p></speech>

On Monday the elections observer, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, observed that the Turkish elections had been unfair and overshadowed by a climate of fear.  This echoes the claim made by the HDP that it had been unable to campaign effectively because it had been busy trying to negotiate an end to violence in the predominantly Kurdish south east.  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE, went further and denounced the entire process as unfair.  I have also heard reports that electricity was cut off in certain parts of the country and of the removal of ballot boxes by army personnel.  There were a number of difficulties surrounding the elections, in the run-up to which thousands of people were arrested, many of whom had been the victims of violent attacks.  Is the Minister concerned that these statements on how unfair the elections process was contradict his that the election campaign was relatively peaceful?  As an outsider looking in, I would have the opposite view.</p></speech>

It faces internal and external challenges.  It is an extremely important partner of the European Union, in particular, as we frame our collective response to the current migrant crisis.  The Turkish elections held earlier this week which followed the inconclusive result in June, therefore, took place in a particularly difficult and sensitive context.  The fact that they were held in an open manner is, I believe, not unimportant.  I welcome the peaceful conduct of the elections on Sunday and look forward to working with the new government in an open and constructive manner on many issues of mutual concern, both on a bilateral basis and in the context of Turkey's importance as a partner of the European Union.  It is important that the elections have taken place in an open and free manner and in accordance with the norms of democracy.  The preliminary OSCE report and assessment highlights that election day was largely peaceful, that the elections were organised in a professional manner and that the count process was transparent.  However, I accept that there has been robust criticism of the lack of media freedom and that the incidents of violence which characterised the campaign period were real.  Nevertheless, it is important that we continue to work with the new government in a spirit of positivity.</p></speech>

Also, there was an increasingly volatile political climate.  Last Wednesday Turkish police raided the offices of the main opposition media company and forced two television companies to close, yet the Minister said there was relative calm.  It may appear that there was relative calm from this side of the Irish Sea, but what seemed to be happening in many communities was far from calm.  Also, from what we saw on our television screens and reports coming back, clearly there was  a problem.</p>  <p>  The main focus of the last European Council meeting was on the issue of refugees.  Many European governments are seeking to use Turkey as a bulwark against refugees seeking to reach the European Union.  Is it now part of the narrative that for some reason we ignore Turkey's deplorable human rights record, especially against the Kurds, and its permanent role in the Syrian conflict in dealing with the issue of refugees?  Many of the refugees fleeing Turkey are Kurds and sending them back would lead to the creation of even greater human rights violations.  Is the Minister saying we are rewarding the Turkish Government for acting as a bulwark against refugees seeking to reach the European Union?</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to visit Turkey earlier this year and also through the European Union.  I assure the Deputy, lest there be any doubt, that Ireland continues to be a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the Kurdish Workers' Party.  We have been encouraged by the ceasefire which has been in place since 2013 and by a number of positive signals in the meantime.  This only makes the recent breakdown of the ceasefire and subsequent violence all the more regrettable.  I again urge all sides to exercise maximum restraint and work towards the reinstatement of the ceasfire as soon as possible.  Ireland continues to believe a fair and lasting solution to the conflict can only be reached through democratic and peaceful means.</p></speech>

I Iistened to the Minister's earlier response to Deputy Brendan Smith's question when he said the talks had entered an intensive stage.  There was concern about the lack of engagement.  As the Minister knows, there is a crisis in the political institutions in the North which is being facilitated by the failure of the British Government to honour commitments made in previous agreements, the failure of the Unionist political leadership, particularly to face up to loyalist violence, and the British Government's refusal to provide the North with a workable budget.  Given the fact that this impacts on the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements, has the Minister discussed this aspect with his British counterparts and urged them to live up to their commitments and provide the North with a workable and sustainable budget?</p></reply>

The talks resumed on 21 September and are still continuing in a constructive atmosphere.</p>  <p>  I have worked closely with the Secretary of State in encouraging all parties to continue to engage constructively in the talks process, both in round table format and the various bilateral and trilateral meetings.  My current assessment is that the talks have moved to a more intensive phase.  There is a good measure of progress in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, as well as in dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism.  The Stormont House Agreement offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially in financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the budget, the Agreement contained a commitment of close to &pound;2 billion sterling in additional spending capacity for the Northern Ireland Executive.  It also included specific financial commitments by the Irish Government in respect of the A5 road to Derry and the reconciliation work of the International Fund for Ireland.  While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their differences for the sake of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic stability and the sustainability of public services.</p><p>The British Government has a key role to play in this area and its engagement will, I hope, continue to recognise the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society still addressing the legacy of conflict.</p> <p> It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed to ensure justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families.</p></speech>

We would argue that the Tories have no political mandate in the North.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, we have also seen the British Government attempt to breach the Stormont House Agreement on legacy and victims issues.  Last week, a group met with the Good Friday implementation committee on this.  The Stormont House Agreement clearly sets out a need to provide justice and truth recovery mechanisms for the families of the victims of the conflict.  This needs the Irish and British Governments to pass legislation.  The draft legislation put forward by the British Government on dealing with the legacy of the past would allow it to regulate the handover of what it terms &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; to historical inquiries, however.</p>  <p>  We believe this is a clear breach of the Stormont House Agreement.  It is a blatant piece of stroke politics designed to hide the British State&rsquo;s role as an active and central participant in the conflict, in particular its collusion with loyalist death squads, including those who planted the Dublin-Monaghan bombs.  Elements of the British security establishment, with a political oversight that ended up in Downing Street, armed, trained, supplied intelligence, directed and controlled many of these death squads.  Considering the British Government is failing to meet its legal responsibilities on dealing with the past, will the Minister urgently raise this issue with the British Government and tackle this latest attempt to narrow the options for truth recovery for families, victims and their representatives?</p></speech>

While significant challenges remain, I am hopeful that with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress in the coming days on the issues raised by Deputy Crowe and others.</p>  <p>  We are currently debating the contents of the Stormont House Agreement Bill.  I believe that and other areas are moving to a stage where we can, hopefully, be in a position to reach agreement shortly.  An agreed outcome would be an important step forward, not just for political parties but for everyone in Northern Ireland.

However, on the legacy issues and the draft legislation put forward by representatives of the British Government, has the Irish Government had any input into that legislation?  Is the Minister concerned about this whole area of sensitive security information that the British are putting forward?  I know many of the victims&rsquo; groups which I have been talking to are certainly concerned about this element of the legislation.

The Bill will be introduced in the Commons in the coming weeks with a view towards having the institutions established in the course of 2016.  However, aspects of the status and functions of the legacy institutions are the subject of discussions among the parties.  The outcome of these discussions will have an impact on the final shape of the Bill.</p><p> I understand the point raised by the Deputy in so far as there are certain concerns over aspects of the detail of the legislation.  I, along with my officials, am following the discussions closely and we are contributing to the facilitation of the parties in overcoming any difficult issues that might arise as regards the setting up of these institutions.  It is important that all parties continue to focus on the Stormont House Agreement, the promotion of reconciliation, upholding the rule of law, acknowledging and addressing the suffering of victims and survivors and facilitating the pursuit of justice.  In the context of the current talks, it is important that all aspects of the Stormont House Agreement are implemented in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I agree it is important that we do everything we can to avoid a further escalation of the situation into a full-scale conflict.  The surrounding region offers a salutary lesson of how much worse things could be.  It is important in addressing the situation not to focus on the sufferings or shortcomings of one side because civilian deaths continue to occur on both sides.  The address to the current violence must involve the leaders on both sides reacting responsibly and with restraint and reducing rather than stoking up the temperature.</p><p>Measures by the international community need to be carefully considered at such a sensitive time lest we ourselves contribute to the heightening of tension in the region.  High Representative Mogherini, in a recent visit, stressed to both sides the need to de-escalate and avoid provocative actions on the ground as well as to re-open a perspective for political progress.  A commitment by Israel to respect the <i>status quo</i>in holy places is clearly one essential element of this process. </p><p>Ireland has consistently argued for a stronger engagement by the international community, including the European Union, on the issues on the ground which we believe continue to heighten tension and thereby undermine the real prospects for peace.  These centre, in particular, on the settlement enterprise.  The EU has begun more clearly to follow a clear policy of differentiation between the settlements and Israel, including, so far, action on settlement goods and investment in the settlements.  I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to see soon the promised EU guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods and I wrote last Friday to High Representative Mogherini in this regard.  I expect the matter to be on the agenda for the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  It is essential that such pressures continue beyond the current crisis.  In the immediate future, it is important that measures be assisted by the international community to de-escalate the violent activity in Jerusalem and beyond.</p></speech>

Unfortunately the response puts blame on both sides for the escalation in violence in the area.  This is the typical response of the Government and shows the failure of diplomatic efforts.  There is no doubt but that any reasonable person looking at the context of what is happening will see that 42 Palestinians, including children, have been killed by the Israelis in recent weeks.  Ten Israelis have been killed and more than 1,300 Palestinians have been injured.  An Eritrean national was shot dead by Israeli security forces because he was mistaken for an Arab.  The violence is disproportionate and I believe the onus to be on the Israeli side to engage in the peace process.  Rather than publicly trying to derail the peace process, the Israeli side should engage in it.</p><p>That should be the focus of European governments' and of the Irish Government's objectives in dealing with this process as well.  The Palestinians have called for restraint and Palestinian security forces have been instructed not to participate in any of the protests, yet the Israeli armed forces continue to kill Palestinian civilians.  The onus is on the Israelis to engage in the peace process.  The Palestinians want the peace process and they want to talk, but the Israelis do not.  Unfortunately, the European Union and the Irish Government through their stance are supporting the Israelis and ignoring the prospects for a peace process.</p></speech>

The Irish Government and the European Union continue to state clearly that all violence against civilians must end, that both sides should avoid any provocation and that both sides should respect fully the existing<i>status quo </i>in respect of holy sites and places.  In addition, the European Union is underlining that the lack of a political path is clearly exacerbating the sense of despair which may have fuelled some of the recent attacks.  All parties should recommit themselves to a renewed effort to work for a political solution to the overall conflict.  Only two weeks ago the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, visited Israel and Palestine to underline these messages in person.  Earlier this year I, too, had the opportunity to visit the region, and last Friday I committed myself to writing on the matter of having this issue high on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 16 November next.</p><p>I urge Deputy Pringle to read the High Representative's address to the European Parliament on 22 October last, in which she elaborated on the approach of the European Union.  She stated clearly that two goals must be pursued in parallel - first, de-escalation on the ground and, second, perspectives on a political process.  These two must go together.  This issue continues to be more urgent than ever.</p></speech>

There is certainly despair in the individual who attacks civilians with a knife in the face of armed soldiers and armed police.  That is the side where the despair is.  Unfortunately, the European Union is building and contributing to that despair by continuously kowtowing to the Israelis and not forcing them back to the table and to the peace process.  That is where the despair originates.  The Israeli soldiers, armed to the teeth and standing at checkpoints and in the streets of Jerusalem, are not despairing.  They are relishing the fact that they can take violent action on the Palestinian community.  The Minister must stand with the people who are despairing and strongly reinforce the policy that the peace process must take precedence.  That can only be done by talking to the Israelis, not by urging calm on both sides on the streets.</p></speech>

However, we must also look to the medium and long term.  It is important that we reiterate our goal and objective.  A negotiated two-state solution remains the objective of Ireland and of the European Union.  It is also important that we acknowledge what some commentators have argued, that the continued expansion of the settlements means that a viable Palestinian state is heading beyond reach.  As I said earlier, there is no alternative to the two-state solution, and certainly not one that has been advanced by way of any form of convincing response.</p>  <p>  I believe viability in the future depends on the parameters and the detail of negotiations in terms of land swaps and other arrangements.  A two-state solution is possible but it will require vision and leadership.  That leadership and vision must come from, primarily, the Israeli and Palestinian sides.  However, the international community continues to have a role to play and Ireland has an important role to play in that context, having regard to our experience of conflict on our island.</p></speech>

This commitment was reiterated by the Taoiseach at the UN Summit in New York in September which adopted a new set of sustainable development goals to guide international development policy and action for the next 15 years.</p>  <p>  Our track record in support of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is clear.  Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty.  In that time, we have provided over &euro;3 billion for ODA.  We have stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target, once economic conditions allow.  Now, as our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can begin to make good on that commitment.  On budget day, the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years.  For 2016, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 level.  We estimate this will entail a small increase in our ODA-GNP percentage from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016, so we still have a long way to go.  The challenge now is to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented humanitarian crises throughout the globe, especially in Europe&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger.</p></speech>

The 0.7% of GNP target is proportionate, whether we are in good or in very challenging economic times.  The highest level of assistance provided at any time was &euro;920 million in 2008, which was 0.59% of GNP at that time.</p>  <p>  Very respected non-governmental organisations, such as Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL, Oxfam and D&oacute;chas, have been advocating very strongly on the need for the Government to outline the roadmap to achieve the 0.7% target.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  We are aware the Irish commitment to overseas aid has widespread public support and a survey last year indicated that more than 75% of the public were very strongly in support of increasing ODA, if at all possible.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State satisfied that ODA is going to countries where there is proper accountability and that the programmes are reaching the people most in need in the many countries where there are crises and disasters and where people are in need of practical, day-to-day assistance?</p></speech>

The issue the UN and the multilateral organisations are trying to grapple with at present is the major challenge of how, globally, governments are going to be able to fund the commitment into the future.  To answer the Deputy's question, one of the issues we are now looking at is that of how we manage the dynamic between long-term development goals, such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the numerous humanitarian crises that are breaking out, for example, in the Mediterranean, as well as how we manage the interoperability between long-term development goals and humanitarian crises.  There is also the question of how we leverage the opportunities within the global private sector.  The private sector has a role to play and, within the Department, we are trying to get a greater degree of traction in that relationship which goes beyond mere corporate social responsibility.  At the multilateral level, through the UN and other organisations, Ireland has an important role to play.</p></speech>

A substantial part of ODA goes to international agencies such as the UN, the World Health Organization and so on.  I read a report recently which suggested that GOAL was able to use the funding provided by our State as leverage to draw down very substantial funding from the British Government, the United States Government and other global players.  As a result, there was an exceptionally good return on the seed funding the State provided to GOAL.  Is the Minister considering giving momentum to that type of policy and perhaps reducing the assistance we give directly to the international statutory organisations?</p></speech>

We would really like to see a greater degree of consolidation of effort and we do not want to see any duplication of effort.  Irish Aid has a track record, through its relationships with organisations like GOAL, of providing the seed funding that then allows GOAL to leverage the opportunities, such as in its response in Syria.  If we can encourage a greater degree of that kind of leveraging effort and bring in the private sector, as I said, beyond mere corporate social responsibility, then I believe that pitches Ireland onto a greater global stage.  We advocate that policy and we are working towards trying to get a greater degree of traction in that regard.</p></speech>

Throughout the year, month by month, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is quoted as saying he will bring an end to rent instability, he will bring rent certainty, he will bring proposals before Cabinet, he will tackle spiralling rents, which are now his No. 1 priority, and he expects legislation by the end of the year.  In June we read that he wanted to tie rent increases to inflation and to bring in temporary rent controls to assist families which are under huge pressure and which are being made homeless on a month by month basis.  In September, we had leaks and headlines from Fine Gael sources, with senior Cabinet Ministers saying it will not happen and that they are against the Minister, Deputy Kelly's plan.  Worryingly, in a Jose Mourinho-type response, he then went into the third person and attacked the "anonymous cowards" who are briefing against him.</p></speech>

The indecision of the Government is creating further instability in the rental market, with landlords shoving up rents to get in ahead of whatever proposals emerge from the Cabinet.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, states well designed rent certainty proposals could bring stability and a degree of certainty to the market and that it is somewhat concerned by some of the leaks from the Fine Gael side in regard to the rent certainty and rent control agenda.  The commitment last February was that we would see rent certainty by the end of the year, but there was nothing proposed in the budget announced recently.  Will we see legislation shortly that will bring about the rent certainty on which the Minister has staked his reputation, saying its introduction is his number one priority, or is the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today correct, that his plans are dead in the water?</p></speech>

A number of issues need to be dealt with in respect of housing generally, including homelessness, whether of rough sleepers or those who do not have a place to stay because they are being put out of their accommodation.  A great deal of work has been done on the issue.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had a very good meeting yesterday when they discussed a number of issues that needed attention in both the short and longer term.  The real problem is the lack of housing supply.  The Government is looking at a range of options to supply the many houses needed, but they cannot be put in place overnight.  Yesterday we made progress in our discussions on modular housing, the number of voids being returned to habitable accommodation, the targets set for the social housing objectives of the local authorities -the Minister has called on them to get on with the task of meeting them - and the renovations taking place, particularly throughout Dublin.  I expect the progress being made in the case of rough sleepers will help us to meet the need in a bad winter.  An extra 130 beds have been opened this year and a further 130 are to be opened.  The money is in place to deal with this issue and I expect the issue of rough sleepers, particularly in Dublin, to be dealt with.  I hope the two Ministers will conclude their discussions this week on what needs to be done in the short, medium and longer term to deal with the issue of housing supply.</p></speech>

We have had the budget and the situation is chaotic.  What is going on with the two Ministers is chaotic.  They had a good meeting yesterday and we are all supposed to breathe a sigh of relief, after all the leaks, counter leaks and antagonism of the past two months.  This goes back to what happened in February.  I asked the Taoiseach a simple question.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said legislation would be introduced in September to deal with this issue.  He said he would link rent increases with the CPI, to the rate of inflation.  We are almost at the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corrie by which the D&aacute;il was appalled, as well as by the issue of homelessness.  However, all that has happened in the past 12 months is that the position has got progressively worse.  Many Deputies have seen in their clinics young families who have absolutely no certainty about where they will be housed.  This is a shocking indictment of the Taoiseach's leadership-----</p></speech>

All we get is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government calling Fine Gaelers a load of cowards and, in turn, them calling him "Calamity Kelly".  That is what we are getting in the media each week, yet families are coming to us to ask us to do something for them.  They are spending three nights in a hotel, followed by three nights in a self-catering apartment, and the welfare officer only has &euro;700 to pay out.  The position is that bad.  Rents have been increasing and are spiralling out of control, which means that families are being evicted.</p></speech>

They will deal with a number of matters in the shorter term.  Arrangements must be put in place to deal with the provision and supply of housing in the medium to longer term.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed the regulations for the housing assistance payment, HAP, programme, which allows for an increase in rent through subsistence from the Department of Social Protection.  This gives certainty of tenancy to a category under serious pressure.  The provision of modular housing is under way, with a start on sites identified in Dublin.</p>  <p>  I accept the point made by the Deputy.  I am aware of many examples of people who are under serious pressure owing to rents being increased by landlords.  Not all landlords are putting pressure on people; I am aware that many landlords show their humanity.  The situation is not what we want it to be.  There was a total collapse of the housing sector, with the figure falling from 190,000 units to less than 8,000.</p></speech>

He told a Fine Gael fundraiser in October, &quot;The head of the Central Bank came in on a Wednesday and said, I have to tell you Taoiseach that it is probably likely that you will have to put the Army around the ATM machines on Friday.  We may well have to print money.  We may well have to introduce capital controls.&quot;  On 20 October the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il a similar story.  Two days later he repeated this tall tale to a meeting of the European People's Party in Madrid.  We all know that there were contingency plans in place.  We have read about them in Pat Leahy's book, <i>The Price of Power - Inside Ireland's Crisis Coalition, </i>while the banking inquiry was told by the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance that they were developed before the Taoiseach's time in office and continued to be developed during his time.  However, what the Taoiseach is claiming is something very different.  Both inside and outside this Chamber, he is claiming that, in the estimation of the Governor of the Central Bank, a moment had come when he thought it necessary to suggest to the Taoiseach that he should put these plans into action.  The Taoiseach has given the impression that somehow within 48 hours, he had thwarted disaster and saved us all from catastrophe.  Before we start erecting statues to his glory, will he finally clarify some matters for the D&aacute;il and citizens?  What was the event that led Professor Honohan on that Wednesday to suggest to the Taoiseach that he should deploy troops on the streets of the State on that Friday?  What week is the Taoiseach talking about and how was this issue resolved?</p></speech>

That work was carried on in secret by a small number of officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency.  Given the scale of what might have happened, which I am thankful did not happen, the full resources of the State would have been mobilised, including the Garda and the Defence Forces.  It is always clear that in the change from one currency to another currency, or in a changed currency, these issues, including capital controls, are always discussed.  It would have been necessary to pass emergency legislation providing exceptional powers to the local authorities.</p>  <p>  While it is not appropriate to give the details of the contingency plans, the issues considered would have clearly dealt with producing, supplying and circulating a new currency, supplying essential supplies of fuel, electricity and medicines and so on - the normal running of any country.  It was absolutely appropriate that those discussions around those contingency plans took place.  At the end of all of that, had it happened it could have happened very quickly.  As the Governor of the Central Bank said, we do not talk about the details of discussions that took place here but there were those discussions that took place between the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Central Bank and the NTMA about very serious indications that it might have been necessary to introduce those contingency plans.  I am glad it did not happen and we are now in a very different spot from those days of early 2011 and 2012.</p></speech>

I made the point that it is not about the contingency plans.  We already know that such plans were drafted.  We questioned Professor Honohan on the contingency plans at the banking inquiry.  The specific question is the Taoiseach's claims, made at Fine Gael fund-raisers, at his colleagues' meeting of the EPP and in the D&aacute;il on 20 October, that the Governor of the Central Bank, somebody who sits on the General Council of the ECB, came to the Taoiseach on a Wednesday and told him of the need to execute this plan on the Friday.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that any discussions of a contingency plan were in the context of the breakup of the euro.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Taoiseach clarifies the statements he made on three occasions in the last month.  Did the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, walk into the Taoiseach's office, as the Taoiseach claims, on a Wednesday and say that the Army needed to be deployed on the Friday?  Did he say to the Taoiseach that he believed the euro was about to break up, or was this a fantasy of the Taoiseach?  Was there a dose of reality in these conversations or in what the Taoiseach was saying at the Fine Gael fund-raisers, at the EPP and to the D&aacute;il?  Does the Taoiseach believe he needs to correct the record of this House?  Did this conversation happen?</p>  <p>  It is not about the contingency plan.  I ask the Taoiseach not to insult my intelligence by referring to contingency plans and the need to have them in place.  The question is very clear.  The Taoiseach makes the claim that Professor Honohan said to him on a Wednesday that he would need to deploy the Army on the Friday and introduce capital controls.  I sit on the banking inquiry.  The State has spent close to &euro;5 million getting to the guts of what happened in the crash and also examining the policy responses and the aftermath of what happened when trying to restore the credibility of our banking sector.  It is crucially important that the Taoiseach clarifies the situation.  Were we within 48 hours, as he claims, of seeing the breakup of the euro and introducing a new currency in the State?</p></speech>

What I did say was that the context of these discussions took place against a background where there was a very serious set of economic circumstances applying right through 2011 and 2012.  The discussions that took place within those circumstances warranted putting in place a strategy that would deal with an eventuality where the euro might collapse.  Those discussions took place on a number of occasions and the participants in those discussions were officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and the Central Bank.  We referred to that in the past.  That is where the discussions took place and against that background.  As I say, I make no apology for having to deal with the clear warning signs that were there about the economic collapse and the collapse of the euro.</p></speech>

Around this country every year, 13.7 million miles are being clocked up in vehicles when people go for dialysis.

I ask the Taoiseach whether they were given the option of treatment abroad.  Some 18 children in the last few years were given kidney transplants.  From what I believe, that has dropped to four this year but the number of children requiring a transplant has not dropped.  Sadly, because of a clash of characters we have lost two consultants.  Mr. Zimmermann is gone to a foreign shore.  William Shields has gone to England and Mr. Hickey has resigned or has so-called retired.</p>  <p>  The best advice from talking to those involved is that if we are to get on top of the transplants we need 300 to be done per year.</p><p>At the moment, we are struggling to get 150 kidney transplants.

It is a matter for people who may wish to supply organs for transplant, which is a very good thing to do.  Not everybody has the courage or mentality to do that but it is something which is being constantly promoted and which I support.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the situation concerning Dr. David Hickey.  The pancreatic transplant service has been transferred to St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin with support from Edinburgh.  This is a specialist area.   I do not think anybody who has been treated or has had a family member treated in centres of excellence for cancer can complain about the professionalism that applies in a centre of excellence.  The new service for pancreatic transplants in St. Vincent's University Hospital will go live this month.  St. Vincent's University Hospital has appointed a number of new consultants and the service will start in January.  It is anticipated that heart and lung transplants will be up this year but kidney transplants will be down.  It is important to say that the transplant programme requires the support of people who wish to be organ donors.  The Minister has indicated that the new service in St. Vincent's University Hospital will be structured differently from that in Beaumont Hospital and will not be dependent on any one individual.  It is expected that this new service in St. Vincent's University Hospital will be exceptionally high-level.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has also informed me about Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, which is led by Professor Jim Egan with additional staff to identify suitable organs for transplant, and the living donor programme, which aims to get even more people to donate and involves the Department and the HSE covering the expenses involved.  There is encouragement there for people to consider becoming donors.  It is has always been difficult and requires specialist centres.  What the Minister has done in transferring this service following the retirement of Dr. David Hickey to St. Vincent's University Hospital with consultants appointed and a first-class operation will add greatly to the comfort and health of those patients.</p></speech>

Let us not forget that Dr. David Hickey was pushed.  He was forced to retire.  The Taoiseach has now admitted that since 1 January, and we are now talking about next January, there have been no pancreatic transplants in this country.  Is it not serious for the Taoiseach to say that the Minister has done nothing for a full year to resolve this issue?  Dr. David Hickey pioneered transplants in Ireland, is recognised worldwide and has offered to help the next generation in a voluntary capacity, which is unusual.  Why will the Taoiseach and the Minister not meet this man and drive this forward for the betterment of the people of this country?</p></speech>

If the Minister for Health wishes to give the detail of an issue raised by the Deputy here, it is only right and appropriate that he does so.  I am well aware of the change from Beaumont Hospital to St. Vincent's University Hospital and that the new programme is due to commence very shortly.  There are difficulties in recruiting transplant consultants in Beaumont Hospital.  The Minister, the Department and the HSE are working to make that situation more attractive.  If the Deputy has an issue with Dr. Hickey being, as he said, pushed out, he should raise it directly with the HSE and the hospital management by way of a parliamentary question or Topical Issue matter.  What is important here is that a new transplant situation applies in St. Vincent's University Hospital where consultants have been recruited and the programme is to start in January.  It is expected that the pancreatic transplant programme will go live in advance of this.  The projected date is mid-November subject to patients on the list being assessed by a multidisciplinary team, which will meet next week.  I understand that arising from this meeting, seven patients who are suitable for pancreatic transplants will be listed.</p></speech>

For some time but certainly over the past four months, the European agenda has been dominated first by the negotiations over Greece's financial situation and now by the migration crisis which has seen such dreadful human suffering as people flee war and insecurity in search of a better life.  It is no surprise that these two themes were the main focus of the European Council meetings in June, September and October. The Greek issue also necessitated three European summits - one in June and two in July.  Of course, the European Council also discussed other issues on which I have reported to the House and which I will recall in this answer.</p><p> Going back to the first of those European Councils, I recall that I reported to the House on 1 July in some detail on the outcome of the European Council of 25 and 26 June.  At that meeting Heads of State and Government had urged Prime Minister Tsipras to make every effort to conclude an agreement and put an end to the instability which was having such a detrimental effect on the Greek economy and people.  At the time negotiations were being taken forward with the institutions and by Finance Ministers through the Eurogroup.  However, following the breaking off of negotiations by the Greek Government, the holding of a referendum on 5 July and the radical deterioration of Greece&rsquo;s financial position, it was felt the situation in Greece required a special European Summit meeting on 7 July.</p> <p> It was agreed that the Greek Government would on Thursday, 9 July at the latest present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup considered these proposals at meetings on 11 and 12 July prior to the European Summit.  I attended the special meetings on 7 July and 12 and 13 July.  After lengthy and difficult discussions the European Summit reached agreement on a series of measures that enabled negotiations on a third programme of assistance to begin between Greece and the institutions.  Satisfactory progress in these negotiations and the implementation by Greece of a number of very demanding conditions allowed for political agreement to be reached at Eurogroup level on 14 August and for a first disbursement of additional support on 20 August.</p> <p> Throughout all of the European Council and European Summit negotiations I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that would take account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I stressed our determination to ensure Greece could continue as a member of the euro area.  At both of the European Summits in July I intervened along these lines and participated in the summit&rsquo;s negotiations on the texts of the conclusions.  The negotiations were, undoubtedly, very difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures continue to be taken forward swiftly in accordance with the commitments made, there is a real basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which all countries have worked and will continue to work.</p> <p> The issue of youth unemployment was not specifically discussed at the European Summits.  However, the importance of supporting growth and job creation in Greece as part of an overall agreement was fully recognised and is reflected, in particular, in the final paragraph of the 12 July European Summit conclusions which deals with the funding of investment in Greece, in drawing on up to &euro;35 billion from the EU budget.</p> <p> I have had no scheduled bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Tsipras.  I did, of course, see and speak to him at the European Summit meetings and the European Council meetings and sent a letter of congratulations following his re-election on 20 September.</p> <p> The extraordinary European Council meeting on 23 September was entirely dedicated to the issue of migration.  The meeting of the European Council on 15 October dealt with several issues of importance to the Union but the discussion focused, above all, on migration.  Over the course of both European Council meetings Heads of State and Government agreed to take a number of further steps as part of the European Union's comprehensive response to the crisis.  These focused on co-operation with countries of origin and transit, particularly Turkey, strengthening the European Union&rsquo;s external borders, managing the influx of refugees to Europe and addressing root causes, including through seeking to resolve the conflicts in Syria and Libya.</p> <p> There were also short discussions at the October European Council on the five Presidents&rsquo; report on completing economic and monetary union and on the UK proposals for EU reform, with an understanding the European Council would return to both issues in December.  President Hollande made a presentation in advance of the Global Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, which will open in November in Paris, and the European Council also noted the publication of the international and independent report on the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine.  I delivered a comprehensive statement on the October European Council to the House on 20 October.  </p> <p> To turn again to the issue of migration, people have been shocked and saddened by the human consequences of the deepening crisis.  The European Council has worked hard to meet the political and organisational challenges it poses.  The Irish response to the migration crisis has been prompt and active and we continue to be engaged across a number of fronts.  We have consistently emphasised the need for a compassionate, practical and comprehensive approach to tackling the crisis, aimed at achieving a Iong-term and sustainable solution.  I set out the details in my recent statement on the October European Council.  There is broad agreement that a comprehensive approach is required to this complex issue, one which addresses immediate humanitarian needs and the various factors which contribute to the huge flows of people.  Progress is being made on many of the measures agreed at the June, September and October meetings, including in reinforcing internal solidarity within the Union, reviewing practical measures that can be applied to strengthen the European Union&rsquo;s external borders developing "hotspots", that is, specific locations for the processing of asylum appeals and increasing co-operation with, or support for, those countries from which most migrants originate or through which they pass.  </p> <p> As ever, Ireland stands ready to play an appropriate part in the collective EU response to the crisis.  Although we are not a participant in some areas such as Frontex operations which consider the external borders, we will complement these efforts with our own national initiatives consistent with our common travel area with the United Kingdom and our non-membership of the Schengen area.  For example, Ireland intends to provide six liaison officers to work on the issue of relocation from within the European Union.  </p> <p> The question of a possible future European border guard system was discussed at the emergency meeting of Heads of State and Government in September and again at the October Europe Council.  This is, of course, for Schengen member states to consider in the first instance.  It is clear, however, that much more remains to be done.  The situation on the ground remains extremely challenging.  </p> <p> Follow-up work on the decisions already taken and the commitments made is being taken forward by Justice Ministers, in particular.  There will be a further special meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 November.  In addition, in Brussels on 25 October there was an emergency meeting convened by President Juncker of leaders from the countries, EU and non-EU, particularly affected by migration through the western Balkans route.  </p> <p> One of the central components of the European Council discussions was co-operating with third countries.  Turkey is paramount in this regard.  The October European Council in its formal conclusions expressed its condolences to the people of Turkey following the Ankara bomb attack and pledged its support to fight terrorism.  The Commission has accelerated co-operation in recent weeks and on the eve of the October European Council negotiated an action plan aimed at supporting Turkey in its current challenge of hosting over 2 million refugees from Syria and enlisting its assistance in reducing the migration flow.  The European Council gave its support to the Commission by welcoming the action plan and signalled its openness, in return, to helping Turkey to work within existing frameworks towards visa liberalisation and a range of enhanced political and economic co-operation measures.  It was recognised that the accession process needed to be re-energised in accordance with the negotiating structures and relevant Council conclusions which set out the procedures and criteria which had to be respected.  </p> <p> The European Council underscored that this comprehensive co-operation agenda had to be based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery on both sides.  No one is under any Illusion about how challenging it will be to achieve the substantive step-up in relations now envisaged.  At the same time, Turkey plays a geographically and politically central role in its region and as an EU neighbour and candidate country, it is hard to imagine solutions to the current crisis which do not involve it very substantially.  Therefore, we hope rapid progress can be made in the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan.  </p> <p> Discussions also touched on the upcoming Valletta Summit.  This summit will aim at finding agreement with African partners in a fair and balanced manner on tackling the root causes and supporting development, as well as on an effective return and readmission and dismantling the criminal networks that are exploiting the situation and putting lives in danger.</p><p>The European Council discussions in September and October touched on the wider Middle East region, where seeking to end the conflict in Syria and creating conditions to allow for those in exile to return home obviously remain fundamental.  The shared view of the Council that the Assad regime bears the greatest responsibility for the more than 250,000 deaths from the conflict and the millions of displaced people was clear.  It was also made clear that the only path towards a solution will come through a political process on the basis of the Geneva communiqu&eacute; of 2012.</p> <p> There were no formal items on other specific countries of the Middle East on the agenda of the European Council meetings in June, September or October.  However, the situations in Lebanon and Jordan, as well as those in Israel and Palestine, in particular, were briefly mentioned.  This was the case in June when there was a progress report on the development of the new European security strategy for the future and again in September when the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, briefed Heads of State and Government on his visit to countries of the region.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the deteriorating situation in Israel and Palestine, in particular in East Jerusalem, is a matter of very great concern.  Violence will not bring a solution to the long-standing challenges facing the Israeli and Palestinian people.  I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians and urge all sides to refrain from any provocative actions.</p> <p> The October European Council did not discuss the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, report, but Ireland participated fully in the BEPS process and is committed to implementing those aspects which are classified as minimum standards.  These relate to country-by-country reporting, tax treaty changes and transfer pricing.  Budget 2016 already began making provision in line with some of the BEPS minimum standards and Ireland has now joined the working group tasked with designing the multilateral instrument which will give effect to many of the measures.</p> <p> The European Council did not discuss homelessness in Ireland.  I had no scheduled bilateral meetings in the margins of the euro summit meetings or in the margins of the European Council meetings in June, September or October.  However, I did speak with several counterparts, including Chancellor Merkel, at those meetings.  I met separately with the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, in Rome on 10 July.  During that meeting we reviewed a range of issues on the EU agenda, including the situation in Greece and the migration crisis.  We also discussed proposals to enhance our bilateral co-operation.  I also discussed a range of important issues with President Hollande during our bilateral meeting in Paris on 3 September.  These included the migration crisis, climate change and energy and development relating to Greece, as well as bilateral issues.  I met with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, in London on 18 June.  Our discussion focused on migration and bilateral co-operation.  Of course, we also discussed the UK-EU relationship.  </p> <p> There is no doubt that the continuing effects of the economic and fiscal crisis combined with the ongoing challenges of globalisation and demographic change have had consequences for public confidence in EU institutions, as is also the case for national institutions in many countries.  However, I believe that a large majority of Europe's citizens still look to the EU as indispensable in ensuring that Europeans can work together to face common challenges.  We should also recognise that the current migration crisis has arisen in part because of the EU's success.  The EU has evolved to become a beacon of security, stability and prosperity, so much so that people are prepared to risk their lives to seek sanctuary here.  The European Council, the Commission and the Parliament have recognised that we must focus relentlessly on the key issues which affect citizens' lives and their futures and I believe that this is reflected in the policy and legislative priorities the institutions have set for themselves, most recently in the Commission's annual work programme which was published on 28 October.  I am sorry for the long reply.</p></reply>

Such a number of questions creates logistical issues and many of these questions were tabled as long as three or four months ago, perhaps even six months ago in some cases.  Question No. 1 on immigrants from Africa and the whole migration crisis was tabled when that issue was at its peak and families were travelling across the Mediterranean to seek refuge from war on European soil.  Since then, Europe has witnessed the appalling vista of families leaving war-torn Syria, with enormous consequences for instability across the Middle East and creating huge issues for Europe.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the members of the Irish Navy for their outstanding work, their bravery and their courage in saving hundreds and hundreds of lives.  They have spent many months away from their families on behalf of the State and they have done us proud.  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether the Irish Navy's time on that mission will be extended?  Will additional allowances for members of the Navy on those expeditions now be paid out?  The Government has been very quick to bask in the significant afterglow of their achievements but people would like to see a concrete manifestation of that in terms of the claims that have gone in.</p>  <p>  After years of an unprecedented financial and economic crisis, this is without question the largest humanitarian crisis faced by the European Union since it was formed.  Can the Taoiseach outline the number of migrants Ireland will now accommodate from war-torn areas?  There has been a lot of hype and publicity and people have spoken in terms of thousands of migrants.  Germany received up to 1 million migrants during the summer.  Ireland received approximately 100 at the beginning of the year and we are to take in a further 100 by the end of December.  Comparing those figures with the headlines makes a mockery of all the hype we have heard over the past number of months.  We need a realistic framework and some degree of certainty as to what will actually happen in the next 12 months.  Are we really only talking about 200 migrants next year in addition to the 200 this year, or is there a schedule to help people fleeing war-torn areas, specifically the horrors of the Syrian conflict?  I commend the efforts that have been made to broker a peace agreement in Syria but we must never forget what Assad has done to his own people, particularly in the most recent bombing campaigns which were quite horrific.</p>  <p>  In the context of Question No. 2, the Greek leader, Alex Tsipras, was elected and the Taoiseach extended his congratulations to him.  He said he was looking forward to working with him but I hope the Taoiseach took the opportunity to apologise for publicly lecturing him and telling him we did not have to increase taxes or VAT to bring down our deficit.  That was clearly not true and was one of the Taoiseach's fables, one of the many stories he makes up from time to time.  Many economists were surprised and tweeted accordingly when the Taoiseach gave Mr. Tsipras his advice so I hope the Taoiseach put his comments in context when he spoke to Mr. Tsipras.  Has the Taoiseach met Mr. Tsipras since his election?</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment is still very high in Greece, as it is in Ireland where 20.6% of 15 to 25 year olds are without jobs, according to the September CSO figures.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report on youth unemployment in Ireland, published today, does not make for pleasant reading either.  PricewaterhouseCoopers found that Ireland was still in the bottom rankings of the OECD in how we are tackling youth unemployment.  Was youth unemployment dealt with at European Council level and in the meetings covered by this series of questions?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the EU, on a pan-European basis, is doing enough to deal with youth unemployment?  It is still very high in Ireland, Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom.  We compare very badly indeed with Germany, Switzerland and Austria within the OECD framework.</p>  <p>  In Question No. 31, I asked whether the Taoiseach had been speaking with the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, recently and if he would make a statement on the matter.  He was very supportive of the Chancellor in her attacks on Greece and in German intransigence towards Greece.</p><p>Did the Taoiseach speak to her about his claim that the Army would be needed to guard Ireland's ATMs in 2011?  If he met her recently, I presume he met her at the European People's Party meeting.  At that meeting he spoke to a European audience and said:</p><blockquote>The Governor told me, it looks like this weekend, a few years ago, you&rsquo;ll have to put the Army around the banks and around the ATM machines [he used his hands and everything to graphically illustrate what was going to happen] and introduce capital controls like they had in Cyprus.  So we&rsquo;ve pulled back from that brink.</blockquote><p>The Taoiseach was subsequently interviewed and was asked when it happened.  He said, &quot;shortly after coming into office&quot;, which was in 2011.  It is not the euro crisis of 2012 which was about Italy having difficulties or the bigger countries being an issue and Europe not being in a position to backstop any implosion or difficulties in terms of the bigger European Union countries.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach made those remarks very much in an exclusively Irish context and he spoke about a very specific meeting with the Governor where he said the Army would be needed.  He came in on a Wednesday and he said, &quot;You know, by Friday you might need the Army.&quot;  I think the Taoiseach let the Irish people down when he said that to a European audience.  The Irish people never needed an army to restrain them at any stage of the financial crisis.  An army is not needed to guard ATMs; they only need to be switched off.<br/><br/>The bank guarantee had been agreed prior to that, as had the troika deal which guaranteed moneys for three years to the Exchequer and to the banks.  That is why many people have been scratching their heads over the Taoiseach's remarks.  The banks and the sovereign were funded in 2011 - all that had been agreed.  When the Government came into office, the troika deal was done and dusted.  The guarantee was in place and the Government carried on with the guarantee, bondholders were not burned and so on.<br/><br/>There is no context for this alleged specific conversation between the Governor of the Central Bank in 2011 or in an exclusively Irish context, which is how the Taoiseach pitched it to his audience.  He pitched it very much in an Irish context.  Subsequently, I believe the story has been reinvented and to get the Taoiseach off the hook, people are now talking about the euro crisis of 2012, as if that was the context for his remarks.<br/><br/>When he was interviewed afterwards, he said, I think, that there was no specific conversation between him and the Governor on this issue.  He can correct me if I am wrong in that.  I read afterwards that there were denials that there was any specific briefing to the Taoiseach by the Governor regarding the Army.<br/><br/>Sources in the Department of Defence and the Central Bank are puzzled by the Taoiseach's remarks.  I do not know about the audience in Europe.  I do not know if the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, believed him.  Did she say she believed him when he said that to the audience?  Did she actually believe that in 2011, the Army would be called in that weekend?  Did he alert her at the time when the Governor told him that we would need to call in the Army that weekend?  Did he telephone her colleagues in Europe to advise that we were facing a crisis?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach made it up, for whatever reasons.  That specific conversation never took place.  Will the Taoiseach confirm I am right in saying that he made it up?  That might be the easiest way around it - that there was no specific conversation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the situation around the table at the European Council meeting was one of great seriousness in respect of what has been happening here in recent years.  When we saw the first evidence of people losing their lives because of illegal trafficking across the Mediterranean, the efforts made by Italy in particular under the Mare Nostrum programme to save so many people spoke for itself about the flight from Libya and other countries in Africa and from Syria.</p>  <p>  I accept the Deputy's commendation of the Defence Forces.  Three of our naval vessels have rescued several thousand people from the waters of the Mediterranean.  I have often made the point that this is part of our own history, having lost thousands to the Atlantic off Grosse &Icirc;le and Ellis Island.  While Ireland is not part of the protocol, I welcomed the Government decision that we should send a Naval Service vessel to assist in this humanitarian relief work.  The personnel on those vessels have performed heroically and professionally in the course of their duties.</p>  <p>  It is the first time in many years that Iran has been involved in investigating the possibility of bringing some conclusion to the war in Syria.  As has been pointed out on many occasions by the Carter Foundation in America, unless Russia and Iran are involved in whatever solution can be brokered, this will not end.  With more than 1 million people having been assimilated into a small country in south Lebanon, which the Ceann Comhairle visited, more than 1.25 million in a major camp in Jordan and more than 2 million in Turkey, it speaks for itself of the extent of the flight from Syria.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Prime Ministers of some of the smaller Balkan countries who pointed out that 150,000 people have passed through their borders in a very short period of time.  Given that they are supposed to be part of the Dublin Convention and the Schengen Agreement, the resources available to many of the smaller countries just do not stand up.  It is an horrendous problem that the European Union has not been able to address successfully and practically and it has taken a long time to try to catch up.  That is why these so-called "hot-spots" for registration and assessment of people who are coming into Europe are of great importance.</p>  <p>  If a similar situation were to apply in Ireland where exceptional numbers of people came here for that purpose, the Deputy can imagine the kind of difficulty it would cause here.  Obviously, others are now stretched to the limit in terms of the incessant flow of people wanting to come to the European Union.  The majority of those in the camps would like to return to their own countries but that will not happen given the continuing war there.</p>  <p>  As I said in my response, all the meetings since the early part of the summer have been taken up with migration issues and reports from the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Mogherini, in regard to the situation in Syria and Libya and the very disturbing reports about the horrendous conditions in a number of camps in the Horn of Africa.</p>  <p>  The issue of youth unemployment was not addressed directly but it is a follow-on from other meetings that have been held.  I am glad to say that the employment figure is improving in a number of countries, including youth employment.  The rate of unemployment is still too high, in particular among young people.  In our country, we need a changing analysis at all times as to the circumstances ahead where opportunities, training, apprenticeships, upskilling and appropriate courses for young people might be concerned.  That is why the Minister of State, Deputy English, has introduced, through the new apprenticeship council, new areas for apprenticeships, new methods of connecting with business and new communications systems for young people in secondary schools to advise of the ever-changing opportunities that exist in the digital world, the IT world or in any other area.</p><p> I have dealt with the question of talking to other Prime Ministers.  I dealt with the question from Deputy Pearse Doherty about the crisis in the eurozone.  I say to Deputy Gerry Adams that I am sorry, as I took his name in vain.  I said he was on his way to America.  I withdraw that remark.  I did not know that he was around.</p> <p> It is true to say the troika was here when the Government was appointed in 2011, but throughout that period and in 2012 there was a crisis of confidence in the eurozone; this country was blocked from entering capital markets-----</p></speech>

However, he did accuse me of being disrespectful to the D&aacute;il in going to the United States and he did not withdraw that accusation.  However, I will move on to more serious matters.  </p><p>Most of my remarks will be about refugees.  I have often discussed the difficulties in dealing with so many questions and such a range of subjects in such a time.  </p><p>I refer to the work done by the crews of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, the <i>LE Eithne</i>and the <i>LE Niamh</i>which have rescued 8,000 people, the population of a town.  It is a huge number of people.  This year there have been at least 3,350 confirmed fatalities, which surpasses the entire death toll in 2014.  The number of deaths off the Greek islands has surged with the advent of cold weather.  Almost 500 men, women and children have died in the past three and a half weeks.  The problem is that we have become fatigued by and numb to the number of deaths.  We hear in passing that six children or a number of adults have drowned.  The Taoiseach has referred to the millions of people fleeing from Syria and those living in horrendous conditions in refugee camps.  He acknowledged there had been a drop in public confidence in EU institutions, which is important, but he then went on to say the success of these institutions had partly accounted for the numbers fleeing Syria.  They are fleeing war and poverty.  I am sure they would tell the Taoiseach, as would Irish people abroad, that they would rather be at home.  Those whom I have heard interviewed have said this.  In the past two months 250,000 human beings have made their way on foot through the Balkans into central Europe.  It is one of the greatest mass movements of population in modern history on the European continent.  I met Prime Minister Alex Tsipras in September and he told me about the significant difficulties his government had in facing up to the challenge, given the numbers of refugees arriving in Greece.</p><p>I offer my commendation to the Naval Service.  Has the Taoiseach discussed an extension beyond December of the very worthwhile humanitarian mission?  Second, has the issue of allowances for Naval Service personnel been resolved by the Government?  I raised the matter at the time.</p><p>On the decrease in public confidence in EU institutions, the Slovenian Prime Minister warned that the European Union risked falling apart.  The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the European Union risked disintegrating but failed to produce a comprehensive programme.  On the very day she gave that warning, Austria announced its plans to build a fence in an effort to stop the flow of refugees and it did not inform the European Commission before it made its decision.  There have been rising tensions over many of these matters and how individual states have responded to them.</p><p>A big issue was made of the decision to increase co-operation with what are referred to as &ldquo;third countries&rdquo;, in this case Turkey.  An action plan was agreed with Turkey.  It seeks to provide financial support for the Turkish Government in its efforts to cope with the 2 million refugees from Syria in camps along its border.  It is to stop people from making the journey to Europe.  In return, EU leaders agreed to discuss visa-free travel arrangements for Turkish citizens and to resume negotiations on Turkey&rsquo;s EU membership bid.  All of this ignores Turkey&rsquo;s deplorable human rights record, especially against the Kurds, Turkey&rsquo;s role in the Syrian conflict, its illegal occupation of northern Cyprus and the recent decision of the Turkish Government to launch a military offensive against the Kurdistan Workers' Party.  All of these issues must be judged in the round.  In Turkey we see widespread attacks on journalists, while dozens of Kurdish media outlets have been gagged.  Instead of building the peace process, in which some progress was being made until recently, the Turkish Government has put narrow political concerns first.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the carrot being offered to the Government of Turkey and the stick being offered to the refugees.</p><p>It strikes me this is not a morally sustainable position.  As some media sources claim the agreement is stalled, can the Taoiseach shed light on this?</p> <p> I am pleased the Taoiseach mentioned the question of the deteriorating situation in Palestine, to which I wish to return.  The death toll in that region is rising and Israel continues to seal off neighbourhoods in occupied East Jerusalem.  When I was there recently, the local people showed me where this would develop in the future and they were right, as one can now see.  I looked at a map on television the other evening and one can now see that Palestinian people are being evicted and are then being denied the right to travel in areas that are being placed under Israeli control.  Moreover, there definitively is a shoot-to-kill policy on the part of the Israel Defence Forces.  Some 61 Palestinians have been killed by these forces, whereas ten Israelis have been killed by Palestinians, mostly in stabbings, and the Palestinian Authority appears to be on the verge of collapse.  While I was there, some older people who were long-standing community activists told me the younger people were no longer listening to them and again, unfortunately, that also has come to pass.</p> <p> This D&aacute;il passed a motion of support for the recognition of the Palestinian state on which the Government has failed to act.  Were the Government to act on it, it would be a clear signal that we support, on a basis of equality, the rights of the people of Israel and the rights of the people of Palestine.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit today to so doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300025#X00200"><p>I thank Deputy Adams and did not wish to infer that he was in any way disrespectful to the D&aacute;il.  All Members can agree regarding the response of the naval personnel on the three naval vessels that have been deployed in the Mediterranean, one of which is still there, in which more than 8,000 people have been rescued.  I have listened to the accounts of some naval personnel who rescued men, women and children and considering what has happened to those people, it has been an extraordinarily emotional engagement for them.  One hears the High Representative indicate the trafficking of people in inferior boats, for which they are charged, simply means certain death in many cases.  Would one overload a small rigid-inflatable boat, RIB, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and state one was going to Holyhead in any kind of weather?  One would not do that.  In many cases, what happens when a large boat appears is the smaller RIB may be destroyed deliberately with the consequence that people end up in the water to either drown or be saved.  This is going on between Turkey and within the proximity of the Grecian islands on a regular basis.</p><p>As for the pictures one sees of the flow of people, in many cases middle-class, well-educated people such as engineers and so on - coming from Syria but now mixed with economic migrants from some Balkan countries - who wish to make their way to Austria, Germany and Sweden, this has placed an unprecedented strain on the capacity of many small countries to process them and to deal with them as one would expect.  Deputy Adams has raised the issue of lack of confidence in the institutions on the one hand while on the other hand, people wish to come to Europe in the first place because of confidence in the institutions.  The latter is true in the sense that the perception and image of Europe as being a place of order, prosperity and opportunity has meant that in the case of civil war, conflict or destruction, people wish to leave.  When one considers the extent of the numbers of people who have moved from Syria in an Irish context - a couple of million people simply upped and left - it is extraordinary and one tries to imagine, in a family sense, what this means when one sees such people carrying their children, babies, buggies and elderly people.  The overwhelming weight of numbers has meant that smaller countries have been unable to process these in an acceptable way and that is why it has taken the Union quite a while to catch up.  While the image of Europe is as a place of work, opportunity and prosperity, its success has been undermined, if one likes, by its inability to deal with the numbers that have turned up.</p><p>One either has the principle of freedom of movement within the European Union or one does not.  If one has freedom of movement within the countries, one then must protect one's external borders.  This has not happened in the past, which has meant there have been many opportunities for people to enter the European Union by various routes.  As the principle of free movement is fundamental to the treaties, the question now of dealing with FRONTEX and external borders was taken to the limit by Hungary, which has erected a serious fence.  There are also pressures from other countries further east in which economic migrants may mix with the numbers coming from Syria who are asylum or refugee seekers and this is causing great problems.  However, the last couple of meetings at EU level have genuinely have tried to focus on what needs to be done in this regard.  Progress is being made but with the onset of winter and the serious cold, snow and poor weather in eastern Europe that many people from Syria and north African countries have never experienced, there is a great urgency to provide suitable accommodation for people.</p><p>Ireland has taken the view that while it is not part of the protocol, it wishes to play its part in a compassionate and practical way, as well as seeking to deal with the root causes of all of this, which in this case is the war in Syria.  Ireland has made an important contribution on a number of fronts.  The Government agreed that Ireland would accept approximately 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees under the resettlement and relocation programme, that is, well in excess of any sort of notional quota that might be allocated by the European Commission.  This includes 520 refugees the Government has offered to resettle from existing refugee camps in Greece and Italy.  Some of these, who have already been assessed, have now started to arrive in Ireland.  The implementation of the decisions to relocate 600 people from Italy and Greece under the initial Commission proposal and a further approximately 2,200 people under the subsequent Commission proposal is work in train.</p><p>Ireland is on course to take an initial tranche of 20 asylum seekers from Italy or Greece before Christmas.  Initially, persons coming to Ireland on relocation will be from Syria and from Eritrea.  The remaining approximately 680 people will be taken on resettlement or on relocation with the final breakdown between the two yet to be decided.  I have already dealt with the question of the<i>LE Eithne</i>, the<i>LE Niamh</i>and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, with 8,066 persons saved or rescued as of 28 October.  I do not wish to comment on the question raised by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA; this is a matter that is the subject of arbitration and work is under way in that regard.</p><p>In addition, the Government has provided from the Irish taxpayer financial supports to areas that are badly affected by instability, conflict and war.  A total of &euro;41 million will have been provided by the end of 2015 towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis, including through the regional development and protection programme in the Middle East, while &euro;36 million has gone towards humanitarian funding in Somalia since 2008.</p><p>Furthermore, we recently committed to doubling, from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million, our annual contribution to the World Food Programme over the next three years.  All of these have been supported by a swift response from the Irish Government.  The announcement on 10 September of the establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and, particularly, the efforts of the interdepartmental task force, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, are important steps in the Government's contribution.  The Irish Red Cross is working closely with the Government on this programme and is accepting offers of accommodation and other services through its website.  Early in 2016 it is proposed to establish a series of emergency reception and orientation centres which will allow Ireland to receive approximately 100 migrants per month.  It is worth noting that the number of people applying for protection through normal channels has also increased substantially.  That figure, which was just under 1,000 in 2013, is estimated to increase to 3,600 in 2015.  <br/><br/>In regard to the Deputy's question about what more can we do, we have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to solidarity within the EU and externally.  As already stated, we offered to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers and are advancing plans in that regard.  The scale and complexity of the crisis is such that it cannot be addressed as quickly as member states would have liked.  Ireland is one of the world's most generous donors of humanitarian aid on a <i>per capita</i>basis and we have not been found wanting in respect of this particular situation.  <br/><br/>In regard to the 2 million people in Turkey, the position, in terms of political bargaining, is that there will be an assessment of the opening of some pre-accession chapters for Turkey and a request of &euro;3 billion in financial assistance from Turkey to the European Union.  Most of the people in Turkey would prefer to return to Syria if the situation there can be dealt with.  I will respond later to Deputy Adams's question on Palestine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300026#Y00200"><p>I have a couple of questions for the Taoiseach.  He will be aware that across the world there is a growing chorus of voices outraged at the continuing persecution of the Palestinian people by Israel, including its continued seizure of Palestinian land, which is supposed to be designated for Palestinians as part of the so-called two-state solution, its demolition of Palestinian property in east Jerusalem, the three cruel assaults on Gaza over recent years, the siege and so on.  The Taoiseach will be familiar with all of that.  He will know also that those of us who believe this cannot go on are asking at what point will the European Union impose sanctions on a state that systematically and routinely violates the basic civil and human rights of the Palestinian people and has been accused, and is evidently guilty, of crimes against humanity.  At what point will the European Union impose sanctions, say this is not acceptable and that it will not continue to treat Israel as a normal state?  Is that possibility ever discussed at the European Council, particularly given the current escalation?  In other words, is there any discussion at all about sanctions on Israel, including, for example, suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement on trade or suspension of military trade sales with Israel?  Is this ever discussed as a possibility given Israel's routine breaches of human rights, civil rights and war atrocities?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may be aware that those of us who feel enough is enough believe that there should be a boycott of Israel.  While he probably does not agree with that, I hope he and the European Union will agree that people should have the right to know where goods are coming from, such that they can choose whether they want to buy goods from states in which they believe routine and systematic human rights violations or war crimes are being committed.  One such item, about which I feel the Irish public has a right to know, is diamonds.  The largest export from Israel is diamonds.  Will the Taoiseach raise this issue with the European Union as part of its involvement in what is known as the Kimberley Process, which relates to the regulation of the diamond industry around the world?  At the recent World Diamond Council, it was proposed that the current definition of "conflict diamonds" be expanded to label as "blood diamonds" or "conflict diamonds" diamonds which originate in or - this is very important - were polished or processed in a state which was found guilty of human rights and civil rights violations.  That proposal from the World Diamond Council was shot down by the Israeli representative on the council on the basis that it would be a disaster for Israel.  I am sure Israel believes it would.  Will the Taoiseach support, and raise with the European Union, the need for it to support, within the Kimberley Process in which it is involved, the expansion of the definition of "conflict diamonds" or "blood diamonds" to include diamonds from states guilty of civil and human rights violations and, similarly, the establishment of labelling for diamonds in this country such that people in this country purchasing diamonds would be able to determine not only where the diamonds originated but where they were polished and processed.</p></speech>

The Palestinian attacks appear to be unco-ordinated at this point.  A major concern is that the attacks on the security response could spiral out of control.  There is no visible prospect of a de-escalation.  The current wave of violence was prompted by rising anger among young Palestinians in occupied east Jerusalem.  There is a growing fear that the Israeli Government might support attempts by radical Jewish groups to overturn the long-standing practices governing prayer rights at the shared holy site of the Temple Mount, Haram al-Sharif.  We all deplore and utterly condemn attacks, in any shape or form, on religious sites.  This is an issue that the European Council will have to consider.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's other question, I cannot recollect any discussion at the European Council on possible embargoes or restrictions on European trading links with Israel, although the issue may have been discussed at other Council meetings.  I cannot recall any situation where it arose in the context mentioned by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It details in an horrific way the circumstances in the emergency department in Tallaght hospital in terms of how senior citizens are being treated.  It states that on one particular evening 79 people were in the emergency department.  It refers, in particular, to the treatment of elderly people and how one elderly individual who was over 90 years of age was on a trolley for 29 hours and how painful and sore that was for the individual concerned.  He was on a trolley in a conduit between the psychiatric rooms and some cubicles.</p></speech>

This relates to legislation.  The consultant stated this man, like others in non-designated patient conduits, had no privacy and no dignity, had been subject to constant noise and light torture, resulting in major sleep deprivation and pressure effects causing pain from lying for a prolonged period on a trolley which had not been designed for that purpose.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may remember the case of the 101 year old patient.  No. 42 in the Government's legislative programme is the health information and patient safety Bill.  This represents an appalling indictment of the Minister for Health.  The Government needs to respond urgently to situations such as this that are occurring in emergency departments across the country, particularly Tallaght hospital, where the consultant said all of the HIQA protocols were being breached, particularly in terms of patients not being put in isolation rooms when required.  It is a very serious matter.  When can we expect the health information and patient safety Bill to be introduced?</p><p>I take it that the Taoiseach has read an article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Guardian</i>- it may have been brought to his attention - on undocumented workers, how they are being treated on certain vessels in the Irish fishing industry and allegedly being paid half the minimum wage.</p></speech>

There have been cases in the past when we brought forward legislation.  The Government's legislative programme provides for the introduction of an international protection Bill.  I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that there is a need to accelerate this legislation and for the Government to take this report seriously and liaise with the International Transport Workers Federation and labour agencies to ensure very basic and minimal standards of protection and rights are afforded to migrant workers and particularly to ensure they are not undocumented.  There seems to be a very sorry tale in this context.</p></speech>

If the letter has been sent to the Minister for Health, I am sure he will respond directly to the Deputy.  The health information Bill is due for publication next year, but as I said, we do not need legislation to know that there should not be a situation like the one the Deputy described.  The Minister with responsibility for the marine has responded initially on the report in <i>The Guardian</i>which took a year to put together.  He intends to form a working group on Thursday to respond to the issue.  It will involve a number of Departments.  This situation applies to a number of other countries, particularly Scotland, where the human slavery Act 2015, which is very modern legislation, has dealt with the matter in a very comprehensive way for those involved.  There may well be problems in some parts of the pelagic fleet.  The Minister will respond to them in a very determined way and will announce the forming of a working group involving a number of Departments which have various responsibilities to deal with the issue of migrant workers.  The Garda has a very active unit which deals with the trafficking of people.  Obviously, it will have a central part to play if the allegations contained in the report in <i>The Guardian </i>are true.</p></speech>

As it may have slipped his mind, I am giving him an opportunity to answer it now.  It would send a clear signal if the Government acted on this important issue.</p>  <p>  On the misuse of drugs (amendment) (No. 2) Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is quoted as having said in a speech made in London that he was confident the Cabinet would agree to legislation that would allow for the provision of medically supervised injection centres for use by intravenous drug users.  It is a source of wonderment for me why he goes to London to make these statements, but leaving that aside, he has also indicated his support for the decriminalisation of the personal use of small quantities of drugs.  Has this matter been discussed by the Cabinet and when does the Taoiseach expect the misuse of drugs (amendment) (No. 2) Bill to be published?</p>  <p>  On the issue of rent certainty, we were promised legislation.  On 28 September the Minister involved, Deputy Alan Kelly, made such a commitment on the back of others.  The Ceann Comhairle will know that since the Government took office, rents have increased by 35% but nothing has been done to tackle these increasingly unaffordable rates.  He will also know that there are 1,500 children living in homeless accommodation in this city.</p><p>We are told the next election will be a choice between stability and chaos.  How much chaos can a family put up with?  What amount of chaos must there be in the Cabinet that it cannot settle its mind on such an urgent and important crisis issue?  When will we see the Government&rsquo;s emergency legislation to tackle homelessness?  When will the Government publish its promised and proposed legislation on rent certainty?</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Government have done a great deal of work in respect of rough sleepers and homelessness in general.  The HAP, housing assistance payment, regulations have been changed, along with proposals for modular housing, the return of voided units to habitable condition, targets set and moneys put in place with regard to over 200 sites opened around the country for social housing to deal with the fundamental issue of housing supply.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government are talking about several other immediate responses, as well as medium and long-term proposals.  I hope they can conclude these discussions this week.  If legislation is necessary out of that, the Government will obviously give it consideration.  I will come back to the Deputy on the work that follows through in respect of the motion passed on Palestine and what it actually means.</p>  <p>  The misuse of drugs (amendment) (no. 2) Bill is due for next year.  However, there is a court case, the outcome of which I cannot determine, which may have a bearing on when this particular legislation may apply.  We cannot do anything about it until that decision is made by the courts.  The matter of legalising small quantities of heroin has not been discussed at Cabinet.  In the past, there was reference to the supervision of needles for drug users but the question of the legalisation of small quantities of heroin for personal use has not been discussed.</p></speech>

I can assure the House that the two governments in Dublin and London remain steadfast and determined to support the parties in the North to reach agreement on critical issues.</p>  <p>  With the conclusion of the Stormont House Agreement in December 2014 after months of talks, it was hoped that a way forward was agreed on resolving the difficulties in the Northern Ireland Executive around finance, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.</p><p>Unfortunately, implementation of the Agreement ran into difficulties, creating major challenges for the Northern institutions.  The resulting political impasse was further compounded by the murder of Kevin McGuigan and the attendant implications for trust and confidence among the parties participating in the Northern Ireland Executive.</p> <p> I made the Government's position clear when I spoke at the British-Irish Association in Cambridge in September and reiterate that, 21 years after the IRA ceasefire and ten years after decommissioning and the IRA announcement of cessation of paramilitary activity, it is past time that it should carry any capacity for threat.  Statements to the effect that the IRA has gone away or left the stage are simply not credible.  It is the responsibility of Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular its leadership, to address these issues and help to restore the trust that has been lost.  We have become used to incredible statements, be they about past activity, current activity, murder, robbery or child abuse.  There may have been a time when living with constructive ambiguity helped the peace process but that time is now past.</p> <p> It is not for Sinn F&eacute;in alone to help to make progress.  All of the parties and both Governments have responsibilities to shoulder.  The shadow of the gunman and the poison of paramilitarism are not just confined to so-called republicans; they are still deeply embedded in loyalist communities, often with nakedly criminal agendas.  Paramilitarism, in all its vestiges, must be removed.  We need clear, not blurred, lines between constitutional politics and criminality.  There must be no shared platforms or strategies and no shady grey areas between right and wrong.</p> <p> The peace we now have was built by the people of these islands through their commitment to non-violence and reconciliation.  The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement were created by these same people through their democratic vote.  Political representatives are elected and thereby duty bound to protect the peace and the democratic institutions the people have created.  These words are as true now as they were when I first spoke them in Cambridge in September.  We must face the truth that an event such as the brutal and savage murder of Paul Quinn in 2007 illustrates most graphically and awfully the very worst effects of the scourge of paramilitarism on individuals, families and communities.</p> <p> Devolution in the North is facing hugely significant challenges.  That is why, on 2 September, the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and I agreed that the seriousness of the political impasse warranted the urgent convening of talks in Belfast involving the two Governments and the parties that had subscribed to the Stormont House Agreement.  It was envisaged that these talks would be short, focused and intensive and advance implementation of the Agreement, as well as addressing the trust and confidence issues arising from the impact and legacy of paramilitary activity.  While the talks got off to a reasonably encouraging start, progress was delayed by several developments that further compounded the situation.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, worked closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to facilitate the return of all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland to round table talks.  They resumed in round table format on 21 September.  Talks have intensified in recent days and, while significant challenges remain, good progress is being made across the main issues.  I remain hopeful that, with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress in the coming days on the critical issues, with a view to a successful conclusion of the talks.</p> <p> I have kept in close contact with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and we last spoke on the telephone on 20 October.  I expect to meet him again when in London next week to address the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry.  I am hoping that at that time we will be able to discuss significant progress in the talks process.  I have also been keeping the US Administration informed of progress, most recently in my meeting with Senator Gary Hart on 14 October, when I expressed my gratitude for the continued US engagement in, and support for, the peace process.  Of course, our No. 1 priority is to facilitate and encourage the Northern Ireland parties to find an inclusive agreement on these issues, a task to which the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, have dedicated much of their time in recent weeks.</p> <p> In response to the concerns raised about the activities of paramilitary groups, the British Government commissioned an assessment of the various paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland to be carried out by the PSNI and the British security services.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, had also asked An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for an assessment of the status of the Provisional IRA in this jurisdiction.  Both assessments were published on 20 October.  In the first instance, the British Government's assessment makes for sobering reading.  While acknowledging that the paramilitary organisations no longer represent a terrorist threat, it nonetheless presents a complex and challenging profile of unacceptable residual activities by various groups in Northern Ireland which are damaging to communities and which must be addressed.  The assessment underscores the critical importance of the political talks process under way.</p> <p> There is substantial common ground in the findings of both assessments and both raise deeply troubling issues about the Provisional IRA and the legacy of paramilitarism.  Both communities continue to be affected by the so-called dissident republican groups and their ongoing campaigns of terrorism.  While these groups are separate from and at odds with the Provisional IRA, they have their origins in the Provisional IRA.  These things have no place in our democracy and never did.  As I have said before, the future of the peace process depends on their being removed from the life of this island, completely and forever.  All participants in the Stormont House talks have a duty of care to the people of this island to bring an end to the remaining blight of paramilitarism in communities and agree outcomes that will provide lasting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland.</p> <p> A second aspect of the Provisional IRA's brutal legacy is the involvement in organised crime of a significant number of people who have been associated with the Provisional IRA and who, as the Garda Commissioner points out, are involved in organised crime and make full use of the reputations they acquired as members of the Provisional IRA and do not hesitate to use their previous terror tactics.  The Garda Commissioner has made it clear that the close relationship and the successful record of co-operation with the PSNI will remain the cornerstone of tackling the cross-Border crime that harms communities, North and South.  In that regard, both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland have my full support and that of the Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly committed to tackling crime of whatever sort, whatever its origin and whomsoever is involved.  There was not, is not and cannot be any question of a blind eye being turned to any criminality and the Government is determined that there will be no hiding place for whatever manifestation of the IRA might be involved in it.  Since the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996, a total of &euro;28 million has been remitted to the Exchequer arising from proceeds of crime actions and tax assessments in respect of over 50 individuals who have had connections or associations with the Provisional IRA in the past.  Other investigations and proceedings are ongoing.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently met the Justice Minister in the North, Mr. David Ford, to discuss what more could be done to tackle cross-Border crime.  The two Ministers jointly hosted the annual cross-Border conference on organised crime which took place in Sligo on 30 September and 1 October, with over 100 delegates attending from the North and the South.  It is one demonstration of the close and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in this regard.  There is extensive operational co-operation to tackle smuggling and other Border-focused criminal activities.  This co-operation involves the police and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions, with the inter-agency, cross-Border enforcement groups on fuel and tobacco fraud being two examples of this joint work in action.  We are looking at ways to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area and want to see an overarching and enhanced structure in place to support it.  It is the joint working of all of the law enforcement agencies involved on both sides of the Border which will be crucial in tackling these issues.  As a Government, we will support them in any and every way we can.  The Government will maintain and intensify its focus on combating paramilitary activity and organised criminality, whatever its aims or origins, and will continue to work in close co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard.</p> <p> Dealing with the past is also a key element of the Stormont House Agreement and the implementation of these elements is an important part of the current talks.  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events occurred.</p><p>The impact of the many atrocities perpetrated North and South lives long in our memory and is felt to this day.  Last July, this House adopted an all-party motion on the Ballymurphy massacre and only last week, we learned of further developments in the ongoing inquest into this case being carried out by the Coroner's Court in Belfast.  I take this opportunity again to reiterate the support of the Government and this House for the Ballymurphy families in their quest for truth through an independent panel of inquiry.</p> <p> I know the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement also met recently with several representatives of victim and family groups and I am grateful to its Chairman, Deputy Feighan, for his initiative in this regard.</p> <p> I have always said there is no hierarchy of victims.  They come from all sides of the community and from all strands of society.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new, comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.  We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, with the support of his officials, is working intensively with the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland political parties to ensure the rapid establishment of these institutions within the context of the ongoing round table talks.  The Government is committed to ensuring full co-operation by the authorities in this jurisdiction with any new investigative body in Northern Ireland with appropriate policing powers and I have reiterated this at recent meetings in Northern Ireland, including with the Kingsmill and Ballymurphy families.</p> <p> Finance and welfare reform is primarily a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  However, the Government here fully recognises the importance of finding an agreement on these issues for the economic well-being of Northern Ireland.  The British Government has a pivotal role to play and I hope in playing this role, it will recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society still emerging from decades of debilitating conflict.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, we have seen important progress in North-South co-operation, through the work of the NSMC and the North-South bodies.  I look forward to attending the next meeting of the NSMC in Armagh on 13 November and taking further stock of our progress across all the areas of co-operation.</p> <p> This Government's recently published capital plan clearly states our ongoing commitment to investing in infrastructure to support North-South co-operation to help unlock the full potential of the island economy.  This commitment is, of course, predicated on a stable political environment in the North with all of the institutions and cross-Border agencies operating to full effect.  In our capital plan, we have reaffirmed our support for the EU PEACE and INTERREG programmes and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that funding opportunities are maximised, with almost half a billion euro available from EU sources from 2016 to 2021.</p> <p> In addition, there will be a renewed focus on investing in a number of key transport corridors, including ongoing review of the scope for building on the current commitment to the A5 road project, which is of major strategic importance to the north-west, and the Dublin-Belfast rail line, which is critical to the development of the Dublin-Belfast corridor and is currently in receipt of an &euro;18 million upgrade package.  The Government remains committed to the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge, which would provide a valuable North-South link between counties Louth and Down, with potential to provide jobs and a significant boost to tourism in the area.  The Government will also continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueway cycling, walking and water leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal.</p> <p> In considering Northern Ireland's economic future, it is also important that we recognise the European Union's strong support for, and positive influence on, the peace process and the importance for Northern Ireland politicians of engaging on the EU-UK debate.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the bad news today in respect of the closure to come of a major plant in Northern Ireland, with the loss of over 800 jobs.</p> <p> This Government has clearly set out its vision for a Northern Ireland free from the grip of paramilitarism and organised crime.  We want to see a shared society governed by efficient, effective, representative devolved institutions which co-operate to build the island economy through overseas investment and joint efforts in trade and tourism.  The people of Northern Ireland deserve political institutions which work to build a world class infrastructure and focus on delivering high quality citizen-centred public services, including an education system that promotes integration.  The current talks have the capacity to move Northern Ireland forward towards that brighter future.  Now is the time for the parties to step up to mark and show that they know how to make real and mature decisions about the future, rather than rely on the possibility of a return to direct rule.</p> <p> The outstanding issues can only be successfully addressed by the Executive parties and the two governments working together to resolve the issues of trust, confidence and of political and financial instability that threaten the continuation of devolution and of course by implementing the Stormont House Agreement in its totality.</p></speech>

I fully support the talks that are under way and hope they conclude successfully.  I am encouraged by the updates from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for North-South co-operation, Deputy Sherlock.</p>  <p>  To be a fully peaceful and democratic society Northern Ireland requires a functioning Assembly and Executive, but in order to be truly successful, the talks must be ambitious, comprehensive and robust.  They cannot simply be about another quick fix.  That approach has been tried and has failed far too often.  All issues dealing with the past, welfare reform, paramilitarism and criminality must be dealt with once and for all.  This brings me to the recent reports by the British Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding paramilitary organisations.  These reports arose from the murder of Kevin McGuigan in August and ongoing criminal activity by a range of paramilitary groups.  The assessment by the British Government of the IRA indicates it is clear the army council continues to exist and exerts control over Sinn F&eacute;in.  It asks fundamental questions about our democracy if a party that is in government in the North and aspires to be in government in the South continues to operate in this way.  It is vote Sinn F&eacute;in; and get the army council.</p>  <p>  There must be a break from all forms of paramilitarism and criminality.  This does not just mean words, but requires action.  It means allowing relevant authorities to investigate, co-operating with them and ending paramilitary activity in all its forms.  When I became T&aacute;naiste, I emphasised the need to tackle crime by paramilitary organisations in the joint statement of priorities with the Taoiseach.  We must now recommit ourselves to doing this.  This means escalating and expanding co-operation and developing a specific strategy for addressing crime in Border areas.  An organised crime task force already exists at ministerial level and there is much North-South co-operation between relevant agencies.  The Labour Party supports the position outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to establish a new cross-Border task force to move to tackle more comprehensively organised crime in the region.  If Sinn F&eacute;in is similarly supportive, it should not only endorse the proposal but also the national crime agency in Northern Ireland.  That would be the biggest step it could take to demonstrate a real commitment to ending criminality.</p>  <p>  I want to speak on the upcoming centenary of the Easter Rising.  Commemorating the events of Easter week, as the State is doing, is both appropriate and natural.  We have put in place a commemorative programme which reflects not just the events, but the differing perspectives on them.</p><p>We have come a long way since 1966.<br/><br/>We should also consider addressing some of the legacies of 1916.  One of those is partition.  The politics of this country up to 1916 revolved around attempts to arrive at a solution to the national question on an all-island basis, albeit within the United Kingdom.  Following the Easter Rising and subsequent events, a partitioned island emerged creating two separate states.  I am proud to be the T&aacute;naiste of an independent Irish State, yet I also believe that the people of the island North and South suffered from the creation of what were and became two sectarian states for much of the period.<br/><br/>Close to 100 years living in separate jurisdictions on a partitioned island has also had its own impact.  During the first half century, the two states largely ignored the issue and existed in splendid isolation from each other.  The next 25 years were spent coping with the horror of a bitter and brutal sectarian conflict and the last 25 years have been about managing a peace process to ensure that the previous quarter century never happens again.  Over that period, the most radical and effective new thinking on partition came from John Hume, the SDLP and people like Seamus Mallon.  They restated the problem as being the division between the people living in Ireland rather than the contemporary malfeasance of the British State.  Their outlook forms the basis of the Good Friday Agreement and the structures that flow from it.  That analysis is challenged by those who assert the idealism of the 1916 Proclamation while ignoring the political reality on the ground.  That divide continues to this day.  It is why, for example, Sinn F&eacute;in members, who are self-styled republicans, have no visible strategy to bring about a united Ireland.  Winning a Border poll is no answer to the question posed by John Hume, unless we simply wish to create the same problem in reverse.<br/><br/>One recent example highlights how the contradiction of the republican position can lead to nonsensical situations.  I saw a Sinn F&eacute;in representative being involved in a minor row about the IRFU being west Brits for using &quot;Ireland's Call&quot; as a representative anthem of the all-island rugby team, which has been doing all of us proud during the world cup.  Surely somebody genuinely interested in bringing Unionists and Nationalists, North and South together would be supportive of an all-Ireland institution like the IRFU.  In fairness, Sinn F&eacute;in has come a long way in recent years.  We are now talking about all of us, Sinn F&eacute;in republicans included, laying wreaths at memorials, not blowing them up.<br/><br/>There are over a million people loyal to the UK living on the island of Ireland.  That is not to ignore the strong relationship that the rest of us continue to have, 1921 notwithstanding, with our nearest neighbour and sister island.  After partition, undoing the Border rather than ameliorating the factors which gave rise to it became for many the sole goal of Nationalists.  As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising, we might do well to consider these issues again.<br/><br/>It is over 30 years now since the New Ireland Forum first met.  We have come a long way since then.  The principle of consent remains paramount yet I remain of the view that the long-term future of the people of this island would be better faced together.  Were that possible, it would not be on the basis of the domination of one tradition over the other.  It would involve all of us who are republican and Nationalist recognising the essential British identity of Unionists, and Unionists I would hope embracing a greater sense of their own Irishness.  In the context of the 1916 commemorations, we should set ourselves the challenge of convening a new forum or body, one that is separate from but supportive of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, specifically to discuss our island's future.<br/><br/>The men who fought in 1916 were idealists.  The women who fought in 1916 and were involved in it were idealists.  Those who died on all sides were victims.  We have tragically had many more victims since then.  What better tribute to all of them than to have a sensible discussion about our common future?<br/><br/>I was involved in the Royal Irish Academy last night in launching a book about 43 of the major figures involved in 1916, many of them household names and some of them relatively unknown.  What stands out from the biographies and the <i>Dictionary of Irish Biography</i>, a seminal work of scholarship for this country about the people of this country, is that they all had a vision of an Ireland which was for all Irish people.  Somehow in the course of the 1916 celebrations and the commemorations of the Somme, we have to really begin to embrace the other as we would ourselves and to reach out on both sides.<br/><br/>We are all here republicans and descended from proud traditions in respect of 1916.  My own party, the Labour Party was founded by James Connolly.  The first person who was shot was a Labour Party councillor, Richard O'Carroll, on Dublin City Council.  We all of us are and have the right to be seen as republicans but we have to embrace that other strand that runs deep in our island, particularly in the North, and that is the issue of unionism.  We have to create an island where all of us can live in peace.  We have to see an end to paramilitarism.  Paramilitarism in a democracy is a step on the road to fascism.  That is where paramilitarism leads to.  We have to put it away and see it off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300033#FF00200"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for sharing her time.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan will set out to the House the developments regarding the all-party talks in Belfast in which he and I have been involved over the past several weeks.</p>  <p>  Beyond the talks, the work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across Government.  Nowhere is this more evident than in our work to promote and develop North-South co-operation.  Through this work, we are building the lasting relationships between North and South which will help to copperfasten peace and stability and deliver prosperity for all our people.  The success of North-South bodies like Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland demonstrate what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas.  Building on these successes is now our focus. </p>  <p>  In line with the Stormont House Agreement, a report on new economically-focused priorities was brought to the North-South Ministerial Council this year.  Priority areas of co-operation for the Government include higher level education, agri-food, energy, climate change, creative industries, sport and other joint initiatives.  The overarching aim is to ensure the most effective use of scarce public funds on both sides of the Border to promote economic growth and create jobs in all our communities.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to North-South economic co-operation therefore remains a priority.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has stated, the recently announced infrastructure and capital investment plan has a dedicated section on North-South infrastructure.  In the Stormont House Agreement, the Government agreed to a financial package to support North-South work programmes as well as measures to promote reconciliation and INTERREG programmes, including the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge project and developing the Ulster canal.</p><p>In this agreement, we also reaffirmed our commitment to provide &pound;25 million in 2015 and 2016 to the A5 project.  This was the source of some discussions in Stormont as late as yesterday.</p> <p> Research and innovation, one of the key drivers of economic growth and employment, has been a key area for North-South co-operation.  For instance, the development of the North West Regional Science Park, co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, has delivered new hubs for the development of innovative businesses, creating jobs and strengthening the cross-Border links which are so vital to the economic development of the Border region.  There has been very good progress to date in terms of North-South collaboration under the EU's &euro;80 billion research and innovation Horizon 2020 programme, which was negotiated during the Irish Presidency.  The first year has delivered over &euro;19 million of EU funding to support North-South projects.  We need now to build on the excellent collaborative progress to date and to work on our allied strengths in areas such as ICT, health and agri-food research to create and deliver more successful partnership projects.</p> <p> The expansion of Science Foundation Ireland's remit to fund researchers in the North will enable further work together on an all-island basis and will create a further leveraging opportunity.  North-South co-operation also brings real day-to-day benefits to people on both sides of the Border.  For example, when open next summer, the &pound;50 million radiotherapy unit at Derry's Altnagelvin Hospital will provide access to radiotherapy services to over a half million people across the north-west region, sharing services and maximising limited resources.  This co-operation also extends to the field of sport.  As one Rugby World Cup ends, we look forward to 2023 when, hopefully, Ireland will be hosting this great tournament on an all-island basis.  This joint North-South bid has tremendous potential to drive tourism.  Speaking personally, I am hopeful that all of the stadia will be ready when the time comes.  I refer to P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh in that respect.</p> <p> It is clear that North-South co-operation is crucial and indeed a central plank of the Good Friday Agreement.  I hope we continue to fulfil our obligations both North and South in respect of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a date for Armagh.  It is important all political persuasions would sign up to that and that the Executive in all its forms would ensure that we continue to give that the energy it deserves.  The current political difficulties should not get in the way of vitally important North-South co-operation.  Now that DUP ministers have returned to their desks in Stormont, I hope the North-South Ministerial Council can resume its work, which has delivered so much benefit for citizens across the island.  Whatever the difficulties, this Government will continue to work to support North-South cooperation and to help unlock the full potential of the island society and economy.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt ama chun ceisteanna an Tuaiscirt a phl&eacute; agus ruda&iacute; &aacute;irithe a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute;.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, a pattern has been established in recent years where we are only allowed to discuss Northern Ireland when a new crisis emerges.  This tends to be the pattern.  We will hopefully get through this latest crisis in the very near future and the immediate threat to the Northern institutions will be addressed.  However, let no one be in any doubt that unless we see a major change in how the parties and Governments have been behaving, the cycle of instability will continue.  Much worse than this, we may well lose the opportunity to embed peace, to begin overcoming sectarianism and to tackle deep social and economic problems.</p>  <p>  The enormous advances secured by democratic leaders in bringing others into legitimate politics have been taken for granted.  Opportunities for growth and reconciliation have been missed repeatedly.  A culture of sectarianism and underlying conflict is not only unchallenged, it is becoming worse in important ways.  The cult of paramilitarism is alive in different communities and while it exists at a time of growing alienation and sectarian discord, it remains a destabilising force.  The one thing which should by now be blindingly obvious is that if you take peace for granted and if you fail to continue the work of addressing the underlying causes of division and alienation, you are taking enormous risks.</p>  <p>  By every available measure, the Governments and parties have by their neglect and behaviour allowed core public trust to be undermined.  This is not a political assertion.  It is a fact established repeatedly in surveys, elections and events.  It is there to see for anyone willing to open their eyes.  Too often the challenge in these negotiations has been about how we get through the crisis and get the parties to start working together.  Yet the people of Northern Ireland are increasingly asking when the parties will get around to working on their behalf.  Northern Ireland has gone from having one of the highest levels of participation in elections to one of the lowest on these islands.  Much of this fall is found in marginal communities and among the supporters of parties who see themselves excluded from all policy discussions.</p>  <p>  The economic and social situation in Northern Ireland has deteriorated in a manner which should cause real concern.  The austerity agenda being implemented is already causing disproportionate harm to vital public services such as education without which progress is impossible.  Rates of poverty and child poverty in particular in Northern Ireland have continued to worsen and the gap with the UK is expanding.  Nearly half - 46% - of children in west Belfast are today living in poverty.  Pensioner poverty in Northern Ireland is one third higher than it is in the UK.</p>  <p>  As we have seen, many of those who participated in the illegitimate paramilitary campaigns continue to operate as a caste apart and pose an ongoing threat and yet the institutions established with unprecedented hope and popular legitimacy are constantly diverted to dealing with breakdowns in trust and general party political manoeuvring.  Two parties which rode to power by overcoming those who risked everything to secure and sustain a peace settlement have been unwilling to show the bravery needed to challenge their own or to accept the logic of peace in everything they do.  Their willingness to attack inconvenient actions by independent institutions and to show loyalty to their movement before the public interest has been corrosive.  After nearly two decades, the demand of the Irish people both North and South is to move on, to end the cycle of crises and to focus on the real agenda of challenging division and delivering growth which benefits all communities.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il strongly supports the effort to achieve a robust agreement.  Where we differ from others is that we do not just want a return to business as usual.  We want the parties and governments to understand the need to change radically the way that they have been working in recent years.  More of the same will not work and if that is all we get, we will be back for another crisis session sooner rather than later.  If parties continue to assert that all problems come from the behaviour of others, how will anything change?  If they will not recognise their own failures, what is to stop another crisis and yet more wasted time?</p>  <p>  The recent reports concerning paramilitary organisations are a cause of major concern.  The vast majority of Irish people believe that 20 years into a process, there should not even be a suspicion that these organisations are still active in any way.  Any level of activity is destabilising because of what these organisations represent and the threat which is kept alive by the cult of paramilitarism which they seek to legitimise.  We must not forget the full context in which this report has been produced and the fact that the growing dysfunction of the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in control of the institutions was not caused by the most recent revelations.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes the settlement which we played a central part in securing remains the best hope for a shared future for all parts of our island based on reconciliation and progress.  It involves an approach to deciding the most important constitutional issues which has been agreed by all communities and gives a transparency and certainty which has never been in place before.</p> <p> The spirit in which that settlement was first agreed and then, albeit slowly, implemented is the spirit which we need now to return to.  We need the Heads of Government here and in London to give the deep and real personal commitment to Northern Ireland shown by their predecessors.  We need the sort of commitment which recognises that this is not just any issue but one of enormous and historic importance.  We also need the leaders in the North to show the sort of courage demonstrated by the former leaders of parties who put the public interest ahead of party and sectional interest.</p> <p> In this House and in all of its work, Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the ever more arrogant approach of attacking anyone who challenges its actions.  In its view anyone who criticises it is an enemy of peace.  Too much time is given to the ridiculous political posturing of people who want to wear the garland of peace but continue to justify and honour the bloody, illegitimate and sectarian violence they perpetrated.  There is, however, a need to respond to the latest Sinn F&eacute;in campaign of attacking me and my party.  Implemented with Sinn F&eacute;in's usual efficiency, it is as empty as it was the last time it was rolled out, in the service of a now abandoned denial that child abuse was systematically covered up within the Provisional movement.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in's so-called new personalities have played a central role.  Their empty attacks have claimed that we are challenging them only because of the coming election and that we would not say anything if Sinn F&eacute;in were lower in the polls.  This is the type of empty nonsense which is being used to avoid answering substantive points.  It is also the same tactic Sinn F&eacute;in has used unfailingly for 17 years.</p> <p> Anyone who looks back through the records will see Sinn F&eacute;in claiming that the only reason decommissioning was being demanded was a coming election; the only reason the Northern Bank robbery was being talked about was a coming election; and the only reason the brutal murder of Robert McCartney was being highlighted was a coming election.  For Sinn F&eacute;in there is never an issue too serious that it cannot be dismissed by attacking others for just being interested in elections.  No matter how comprehensive the evidence of financial irregularities, child abuse, murder or criminality by those involved in the Provisional movement Sinn F&eacute;in never responds with anything but blanket denials and abuse of the accuser.</p> <p> Let me be very clear about something: no party in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has worked as hard or as long as Fianna F&aacute;il in the cause of a lasting peace and reconciliation on this island.  We took risks when many were attacking us for talking to paramilitaries and their political parties and we never stopped engaging and working to push the process on.  I and my colleagues have spent countless hours in negotiations to get parties to accept actions which should be automatic in a democratic society.  When we went into opposition after the last general election, I said to the Taoiseach in this House that peace should never be taken for granted and that he and his Government had our goodwill and support in respect of Northern Ireland.  We began to express concern when it became clear that real damage was being caused by a policy of drift and neglect by the Governments, combined with the growing dysfunction of the Sinn F&eacute;in-Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, approach to government.  When we said in 2012 that a crisis was inevitable unless policy changed, I was attacked by Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson, both of whom fell over each other to say that everything was great.  Events have proven our analysis to have been correct.  I and Fianna F&aacute;il spokespeople have been consistent in repeating our concern in speeches, interviews and meetings in all parts of this island.  Every time we have spoken the inevitable press release has issued from Sinn F&eacute;in either denying that there was any problem or denying it had anything to do with it.</p> <p> We have also been consistent in calling for a reinvigoration of the North-South dimension, the creation of a Border economic development zone and a range of other actions which would rebuild trust and show concrete action to tackle growing poverty and alienation.  We have met with a wide range of groups and listened to their concerns and to their proposals.  For the past year, we have constantly called for a cross-Border crime agency to be set up and our spokesperson, Deputy Brendan Smith, has published a Bill on this.  Given yesterday&rsquo;s announcement that the Government is committed to setting up a cross-Border crime task force, I hope the Government will accept this Bill when it is debated in this House on 27 November.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in and those who fall for its propaganda can keep claiming that the only reason anyone criticises it is electoral politics.  The more they do this, the more they confirm that their arrogance and their actions are standing in the way of badly needed progress.  After years of attacking people for supposedly not paying enough attention to Northern Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in has started attacking those who do as being "hurlers on the ditch".  In an act of supreme irony, it has fallen into the partitionist mind-set of demanding that anyone who is not on the ground has no right to express an opinion.  This is very similar to the approach of some Unionist politicians towards the Irish Government.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s arrogance has extended to claiming ownership of the word "republican".  Its Deputies, new and old, have been united in recent weeks in claiming that Sinn F&eacute;in is the only republican organisation currently active.  In doing this, they confirm yet again that there is nothing republican about them.  Irish republicanism has its roots in an inclusive ideology.  All of its great leaders earned and retain the respect of the Irish people because they were committed to a republicanism defined by the people and not by a party.  The sectarianism seen in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s north Belfast campaign, in Deputy Adam&rsquo;s comments about equality being a Trojan horse and in the awarding of jobs by a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister can be described as many things but republican is not one of them.</p> <p> In order to avoid addressing the substance of the recent report on criminal activities by paramilitaries, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s leaders have focused solely on the point concerning the Provisional IRA army council.  In doing so, they have avoided addressing the evidence that the core network of the Provisionals is in place and that there are significant links to criminality.  The assessment that the Provisional IRA supports the peace process and is unlikely to return to a political campaign is welcome.  What this does not do is remove the right of others to question the remaining activities of the Provisionals and the impact of them.  The link of senior Provisionals to organised criminality can be seen in a number of high profile cases.  Just as important are the large number of Criminal Assets Bureau cases which are not open to public scrutiny but which show a serious pattern relating to organised criminality in the Border region.</p> <p> In maintaining its core structures and discipline, the Provisional movement maintains the idea of loyalty to the movement being superior to all other duties.  It remains a fact that people associated with this movement do not engage with the policing and judicial system in the way that citizens are obliged to.  A constant theme of crimes linked to the Provisional movement is that an absolute discipline is enforced.  Sinn F&eacute;in goes out and calls on people to co-operate with the police but no one ever does.</p> <p> Eight years after the ceasefires, a pub filled with 70 Sinn F&eacute;in members and supporters looked on as a man was brutally beaten and stabbed in front of them.  They did not even call an ambulance as he bled to death and sat quietly as a Provisional squad forensically cleaned the scene of evidence.  Why this Mafia like silence to protect men whose vicious crime was gangsterism at its worst?  There was nothing political or noble in this.  It was a cruel murder of an innocent man and the murderers have never been brought to justice.  Two months after the murder, the Provisional IRA said it had investigated it and that two of its members were directly involved but the loyalty to the movement came first and still comes first.  We saw exactly the same situation in the murder of Paul Quinn of Cullyhanna, on a farm in Monaghan in 2007.  I met his mother, Br&iacute;d, and his father, Stephen.  The mother keeps saying, and her words would haunt one, that they broke every bone in his body and his screams could be heard for miles.  The scene of his murder was also forensically cleaned by a Provisional squad and no one has ever been convicted.  Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople, including Conor Murphy, tried to suggest that Mr. Quinn was a petty criminal and that was why he was murdered.</p><p>That is something that deeply upsets the family even today and yet no one has been convicted.  The same is true in relation to child abuse within the provisional movement.  Crimes with no political basis whatsoever have been covered up long past the ceasefires and decommissioning.  No one has yet been brought to justice even though leaders of the movement have acknowledged the crimes happened.  All of the punishment beatings, murders and criminality must end, as there is a political and moral obligation to do so.  </p> <p> As to the issue of the control or otherwise of Sinn F&eacute;in by the army council, we should remember one basic thing which is undeniable.  Throughout most of the major negotiations of the past 20 years, Sinn F&eacute;in's position was that it could not agree anything until it had sought agreement from the Provisional IRA.  It often claimed to want to agree things but it needed to talk to the Provisional IRA first.  What matters today is that Sinn F&eacute;in is unwilling to distance itself from the Provisional IRA.  Sinn F&eacute;in continues to honour the Provisional IRA without reservation.  It sells mugs and T-shirts emblazoned with "Undefeated Army".  It stills refers to its members as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, in defiance of the people of Ireland who recognise only the Army of this State as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  Since 1998, in every illegal action linked to the Provisional IRA, we have seen Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s loyalty to that organisation is absolute and it will not allow criticism of it.  Ultimately, this goes to the heart of why we need a genuine commitment to end the cult of paramilitarism.  If one honours a 30-year dirty campaign waged in the face of the overwhelming and repeatedly expressed views of the Irish people, how can one deny the same legitimacy to others?  If one says that campaign was the only legitimate expression of republicanism in the last half century, how can one say that now only constitutional republicanism is legitimate?  The cult of paramilitarism is a curse which is holding back progress on this island.  In the North, it is vulnerable communities on both sides which are suffering the most.  The local big men, who claim to police but are really enforcing silence, must no longer be sheltered by parties which lack the bravery to put the public interest ahead of the interest of their comrades.</p> <p> If we are to rebuild trust and have sustainable progress, we need a number of new initiatives.  A permanent process for monitoring and publicly exposing paramilitary organisations, active or dormant, is clearly required.  Unless we have this, we will remain stuck in the cycle of denial and attempts to politicise legitimate security activity.  We need a more open approach to the past.  There must be an end to the situation where Sinn F&eacute;in and the British Government demand openness of others but show none of it themselves.  Victims have the right to know why and how their loved ones were killed.  In the institutions in the North, we need a return to the principle of inclusivity.  The Sinn F&eacute;in-DUP stranglehold on all processes must be ended.  The civic forum, which is an obligation of the Agreement, must be restored and the exclusion of other parties from discussions cannot be allowed to continue.  </p> <p> The Dublin and London Governments have to understand and accept the need for their continued high-level engagement in Northern matters.  Linked to this is the need for them to commit to recognising the priority needs of Northern communities.  The extension of British welfare policies to Northern Ireland will cause immense social damage and it should be stopped now while there is still time.  We also need a genuine all-island development plan, one with the ambition and scale required to overcome the lasting damage of the conflict on both sides of the Border.  The six-county plan developed by Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and London is nowhere near good enough.  Finally, we need a renewed commitment to developing the North-South dimension in other areas.  There are many services which would benefit from joint planning and delivery.  They threaten no one's political beliefs but they offer the prospect of practical progress in the spirit of the Agreement freely entered into by the people of this island.  We need to move on from a process focused on parties and movements to one focused on addressing the needs of people.  There is no more time to waste.  The cult of paramilitarism has no positive role to play and it represents a real threat to sustainable peace and reconciliation.  If we want to end the cycle of distrust and crisis, then we have to demonstrate that paramilitarism will not be tolerated in any form.</p></speech>

However, it takes great patience to sit and listen to some of the rubbish and the lies which are peddled here, thinly disguised as a serious contribution to the resolution of the problems facing the people of this island as a result of partition.  N&iacute; bh&iacute;onn go leor d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; anseo againn n&oacute; go leor ama againn ar chor ar bith chun na ruda&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha seo a phl&eacute;.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently proposed that there be a monthly D&aacute;il debate on the North and I again urge the Taoiseach to agree to this proposal.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement marks the most significant political development on this island since Partition.  An international agreement, it involved the two Governments and Nationalist, republican and Unionist political parties in the North.  It has provided a peaceful and democratic way to deal with contentious constitutional and political issues.  It has opened up a new and peaceful path to the realisation of Irish unity and ending the union where none presented before.  However, the political process has been held back by continuous phases of instability since 2010.  This stems from the negativity, disengagement and mismanagement of both the peace and political processes by the present British Government.  Tragically, this approach has been mirrored by the Irish Government's semi-detached approach to the North.  Both Governments have failed to honour their commitments to ensure full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements since 1998.  A commitment made at Weston Park to investigate the murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane has not been honoured or implemented.  In the St. Andrews Agreement, a commitment was made to Acht na Gaeilge.  This has not been honoured or implemented.  There is no bill of rights or all-island charter of rights.  There is no civic forum.  </p>  <p>  In the period from 2010, the two Governments have stepped back from their responsibilities and political unionism has refused to properly support power sharing in the North.  That has contributed directly to the serious political difficulties and ongoing instability, particularly around dealing with the past, disputed parades, flags, symbols and cultural identity.  Despite intense lobbying and advocacy by Sinn F&eacute;in, there has been a failure to implement the equality, parity of esteem and mutual respect elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  This impasse led to the convening of talks by Richard Haass and Meghan O'Sullivan in late 2013.  British Government and Unionist rejection of the Haass-O'Sullivan proposals and further political instability led to further political negotiations in November and December 2014 at Stormont House.  Bealach nua chun tosaigh a bh&iacute; ann i gComhaont&uacute; Theach Chnoc an Anfa agus t&aacute; d&oacute;chas le f&aacute;il ann go f&oacute;ill.  However, this difficult political situation has been exacerbated by the austerity crisis caused over recent years by the British Government's reduction of the North's block grant by &pound;1.5 billion.  This has had devastating consequences for public services, jobs, social welfare protections and economic growth in the Six Counties.  With the election of a majority Tory Government in May, worse is set to come.  Another &pound;1.4 billion will be cut from the block grant.  An estimated &pound;120 million per year will be taken from the pockets of working families as a result of Conservative cuts to tax credits.  British Government austerity policies have deepened political instability in the North.  Cuireann polasa&iacute; na Tories an pr&oacute;iseas agus na hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; i mbaol.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, political unionism has contrived to create a real crisis following the murders in Belfast of Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan.  This crisis was facilitated when a criminal investigation into Kevin McGuigan's murder morphed into an assessment of the status of the IRA by the PSNI leadership.  While the PSNI chief constable may argue that this was not a political intervention, it is the responsibility of the PSNI to investigate criminality and to make those responsible accountable in the courts.  It should do this by following the evidence and it is assured of the support of Sinn F&eacute;in in so doing.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in will strongly resist any efforts to bring what should be operational matters for the PSNI into the political processes.  We reject totally and will resist any efforts to undermine the rights of our electorate or any other section of voters.</p><p>This was the background for a cynical electoral power play between the two main Unionist parties which brought these talks to an effective standstill pending the publication of a report by the British Government.</p> <p> Some elements of the British report, and a parallel report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, were seized upon by opponents of Sinn F&eacute;in, including the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, and misused for narrow, party political agendas.  There has been a deliberate effort to criminalise and demonise republicans, Sinn F&eacute;in activists and other citizens, especially those in cross-Border communities in places like south Armagh and north Louth.  Contrary to the Wild West image portrayed by some elements in the media and others in this Chamber, the people of the Border region are decent law-abiding citizens.</p> <p> Let me also hold up to ridicule the absurd notion that there is a twilight zone in which the Garda colludes with republicans involved in fuel smuggling and so on as part of the peace process.  This is patent rubbish.  Let me repeat once again that Sinn F&eacute;in is totally and absolutely opposed to criminality of all kinds and we stand with communities across this island and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in opposing criminal gangs and criminality in all its forms.  As a consequence of this, Sinn F&eacute;in members and our homes and families have been attacked.  Despite this, Sinn F&eacute;in will be to the forefront of any future initiative to tackle paramilitaries or criminality on this island.  No other party has done more to build the peace, reach out to others and robustly face down violent loyalism and so-called republican dissidents.</p> <p> I have also made it clear that Sinn F&eacute;in members are only accountable to our electorate.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no fear of the electorate.  We respect them.  They are the people, after all, who gave us our mandate.</p> <p> Despite the political opportunism and cynicism which was evident in the efforts of the Taoiseach to get the Assembly adjourned and the entirely ham-fisted call by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader for the suspension of the political institutions - this cynicism is again evident the D&aacute;il today - talks have recommenced in Belfast.  This is very much to be welcomed.  Ach t&aacute; an baol ann go gcuirfidh daoine isteach ar an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta, sin daoine at&aacute; agus a bh&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; in aghaidh an phr&oacute;isis ar fad.</p> <p> I spend at least two days a week if I can in the North and I spend most Mondays in Stormont.  There is a widespread conviction that some elements within political unionism have pulled back from the political process and are not seriously committed to power sharing.  I always make the case that this is understandable because if they have other options, they will take the other options.  If governments keep to their obligations and responsibilities and implement agreements that have been made, then this old guard has less room to manoeuvre.  The British Government position lacks credibility and there is no genuine intent to resolve the impasse.</p> <p> The very people in MI5 and in the old guard of the RUC, who produced the recent report, have also brought in a veto to stop the families of victims of British terrorism from getting the truth about what happened to their loved ones.  These folks are locked into the conflicts of the past.  They are the same people who directed agents, informers and paramilitary organisations that killed hundreds of citizens, including citizens in this city, with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and stirred sectarian violence and colluded in murder.  They are prepared to put the peace and political processes at risk in an effort to stop the growth of Sinn F&eacute;in, North and South.  These are the people some in this D&aacute;il choose to believe.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader does not believe the Garda Commissioner but he believes MI5.  MI5, some in the PSNI and the British Government have also attempted to use the new legacy legislation to elevate British interests above those of victims and their families.</p> <p> Victims&rsquo; groups are seriously concerned about the British Government attempting to row back from commitments on dealing with the legacy of the past.  They are anxious and upset following a meeting last week with British Government representatives called to discuss the progress of legislation on this issue.</p> <p> The British and Irish Governments agreed at Stormont House on the need to provide justice and truth-recovery mechanisms that would give disclosure to families of victims of the conflict.  The British Government's legislation is in clear breach of this agreement.  The legislation is all about hiding the British state&rsquo;s role as a central player in the conflict and its collusion with Unionist paramilitary death squads.  This is unacceptable.  People there - I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has met some of them - look to this Government to stand up for them.</p> <p> All measures to deal with the past, including any legislation, must reflect the commitments made at Stormont House by the parties and the two Governments.  Given of the serial crises in the political institutions in recent years, their reputation and public confidence in them has been severely undermined.  It is the responsibility of the Executive parties to repair this.  The responsibility of the Irish Government and of the parties in this D&aacute;il should be to support the efforts to make progress and not to place narrow self-serving party political objectives and opportunistic untruthful propaganda above the necessary process of change and progress.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s priorities have been to ensure the efficient functioning of the power-sharing institutions while endeavouring to create jobs, reduce unemployment, protect the most vulnerable and bring forward working budgets that ensure delivery of front-line services.  I commend the patience and fortitude of the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA, in this regard.  He has played a consistently positive role.  In particular, he has demonstrated an extraordinary willingness to reach out to others whether within unionism or in the British royal family.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in wants the political institutions to work and to deliver for citizens.  Despite all the difficulties, the Executive, the Assembly and the all-Ireland institutions have worked better for citizens than the years of direct rule by unaccountable British Ministers and decades of one-party rule by the Ulster Unionist Party. </p> <p> The British Government needs to accept the reality of special circumstances in the North.  I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts this; I am uncertain if the Taoiseach does.  The North is a society emerging from decades of conflict.  It has always been a dysfunctional society; partition has that effect.  Both Governments must accept the need for an economic dividend to the necessary process of peace building and political and societal change.  Both Governments must fully implement the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  The Irish Government needs to play a more constructive ongoing consistent role in the North and I have made this point many times to the Taoiseach.</p> <p> Citizens in this State expect their Government to proactively pursue and promote the peace process.  Citizens in the North, even those within unionism, expect the same.  All of us in the D&aacute;il must work to break down partitionist mindsets.  This is a particular challenge for the Taoiseach and other leaders here.  This D&aacute;il itself needs to break out of a partitionist mindset.  It was an interesting experience to hear the T&aacute;naiste mention partition in an otherwise unremarkable and barely coherent contribution.  The Government needs to move beyond its occasional rhetoric about republicanism.  Any government that truly wants to unite all the people of this island, including those who see themselves as British, in peace, equality and harmony, needs to work diligently and in an effective way towards that end.  There is also a constitutional imperative and obligation on the Government to do so.</p> <p> This means pursuing every avenue to promote greater all-Ireland co-operation and working to build relationships on the basis of equality between all our people, regardless of their background or tradition.  It is through the building of all-Ireland sectors as part of a single-island economy, including the environment, health, energy, education and agriculture, that peace and unity will be established.  We must use every available opportunity to utilise the goodwill of our international friends, including those in the United States.</p><p>It also means proactively reaching out to Unionists.  Crucially, the Government must end the practice of playing junior partner to the British Government when it comes to the peace process.  The Government must see itself as a co-equal guarantor and deal with the British Government on that basis.  Anything else is a recipe for failure.  The British Government cannot be allowed to set the agenda, the pace of negotiations or the scope of discussions.</p> <p> I have urged the Taoiseach here many times to prioritise his engagement with the British Prime Minister with the objective of stabilising and sustaining the political institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement but also to deliver on the separate responsibilities and obligations of both Governments.  A 15 minute phonecall and an occasional meeting on the margins of other meetings with the British Prime Minister is not good enough.  The process needs a consistent, strategic involvement on an ongoing basis.</p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will have noted, as I did, the positive contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  I am sure the former will vouch for the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in is currently working positively with all of the political parties and with the two Governments.  However, as a co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and other agreements, the Taoiseach must engage with the British Prime Minister with greater focus and consistency.  We must accept that the peace process is bigger than party political point scoring or narrow electoral considerations.</p> <p> As I have said here previously, this is a time of change for the British union and that has major implications for the North.  That situation in itself is destabilising elements of unionism.  The issue of Scottish independence has not gone away and remains a live political issue with obvious implications for the North of Ireland.  The Government can rest assured that unionism is watching that space very closely.  While Sinn F&eacute;in is highly critical of elements of the European Union, including the lack of democratic accountability, the narrow ideological pro-austerity focus and the failure to deal with the humanitarian crisis faced by refugees, the prospect of increased or full withdrawal by the British state from the EU or the significant erosion of human rights protections also have major implications for Ireland, North and South.</p> <p> All these issues argue in favour of the Government to be fully and consistently engaged in a strategic manner, in keeping with its constitutional obligations, as well as its responsibilities under a series of agreements.  There is a clear onus on the Government to contribute fully to the development of the A5, the Ulster Canal, the bridge at Narrow Water, as well as other capital projects.  That has been made clear by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  The British Government must also face up to its economic obligations.  It is not clear whether the British Government will ever accept its role as a participant in the conflict but the Government must insist that it does.  British political and economic policy towards the North must change if we are to see political stability and proper commitment to real power sharing and to sustaining the institutions, which requires a workable budget.  Let us have no doubt about that.  Without a proper budget, the Executive cannot deliver the economic dividend that is required.  Today's bad news about the job losses at Michelin show the challenges that face working people.</p> <p> Important contributions that are being made by civic society should not be ignored.  They include Punching Above Our Weight by the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, Growing the Economy and Living Standards by the Unite union, the substantive Irish Congress of Trade Unions submission to last year's Stormont House negotiations and the content of the recent Equality Coalition conference in Belfast.</p> <p> Our opponents here lecture us on the need to build trust.  At the same time, they patronise, insult, engage in the most vile, offensive and untruthful invective against us and our party.  Let me assure the House that Irish republicans need no lectures from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  We will work with them.  We know the business of building peace is challenging but that is our priority.  In the short time available, we need to see energy, vision and inspiration.  In short, we need to usher in a new phase of the peace process and that is Sinn F&eacute;in's focus.</p></speech>

The two recent reports on the status of Northern Ireland paramilitaries and criminality have thrown into focus public concerns that paramilitarism remains in existence.  As the previous speakers have indicated, there can be no tolerance by this Parliament for violence of any kind.  I am not altogether comfortable with any suggestion that a violent campaign was necessary to force a peace process into place in the first instance to improve life for the citizens of the North.</p>  <p>  Between 1968 and 1994 more than 3,500 people died and another 35,000 were injured in Northern Ireland as a direct result of what is called the Troubles.  Society in the North is still embittered and segregated and the quality of life for many has not changed at all.  A united Ireland, which so many believed they were fighting for, is further away than ever.  The civil rights movement of the 1960s had undoubted benefits for the Catholic Nationalist minority; a significant case in point being fair employment legislation from the 1980s, as a result of which more Catholics and Protestants worked together than ever before.</p>  <p>  Some sports have proven to be highly effective unifiers.  However, such integration is limited.  One only has to look at working class communities, which I have visited on a number of occasions and which were most affected by the Troubles, to see the proof.  Resource competition is segregated, as is housing.  The vast majority of Protestant and Catholic children continue to be educated separately.  Fears prevail that simply cannot be overcome.</p>  <p>  The effects of the conflict on the economy of Northern Ireland have been well documented.  Low wages and low labour productivity rates are directly connected to the Troubles and their legacy.  Manufacturing employment went into serious decline when violence levels increased, hence increasing the province&rsquo;s dependence on Great Britain for subsidies to maintain its standard of living.  Such was the relevance of the subsidies that at one point in the 1980s, it was estimated that without them the living standards of Northern Ireland would approach that of Mexico and Argentina.  As the private sector shrank, as foreign investors were put off by violence, the public sector increased sizeably and there was a significant duplication of services.</p>  <p>  A report by the consultants, Deloitte, estimated that in terms of lost opportunity, the violence in Northern Ireland resulted in the loss of approximately 27,600 jobs from 1983 to 2000 and the loss of potential investment amounting to approximately &pound;225 million and a further &pound;1.461 million in tourism revenue.  The social and economic problems that have grown out of the missed opportunities are still having a detrimental effect on generations in terms of poverty and joblessness.  Those households are predominantly concentrated in working class areas where poverty levels continue to rise.  Areas of Belfast have some of the highest rates of child poverty in the United Kingdom.  A report estimated that by 2020, 39% of children in the North would be living in relative poverty.  A significant number of households have experienced intergenerational poverty or joblessness and are far removed from job-readiness and the labour market.</p>  <p>  Historically, Northern Ireland has been neglected in terms of investment and infrastructure.  It is interesting that another direct legacy of the Troubles is the fact that almost half of the working age population in receipt of incapacity benefit have been diagnosed with mental and behavioural disorders.  A significant proportion of those people reside in areas close to what is known as the peace lines and grew up surrounded by violence.</p>  <p>  History will decide the full legacy of the Troubles but there can be no denying that a huge conflict still exists in Northern Ireland and the peace process did not bring about socioeconomic security and peace of mind to a considerable proportion of the population.  The working class is as divided as it ever has been.</p><p>The objective of socialists and people like me was to reunite working classes, irrespective of their creed, colour or political persuasion.  Unfortunately, because of what has happened, we are far from that if one considers the current position in Northern Ireland.  I always have agreed with the philosophy and ideal that working people across the Thirty-two Counties in Ireland need unification, not a particular group of people because they wish to be part of a republic or part of a Thirty-two-County solution.  The same problems exist for working people throughout the Thirty-two Counties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-03a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300039#MM00200"><p>Over the summer months, the news pertaining to the killings of Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan shook people's confidence as to whether they thought the IRA had gone away, the peace process was moving on and things were developing and moving on.  This has shaken the confidence of a great many people nationwide as to what they can foresee for the future and what they envisage about how things can proceed.  However, much of the sometimes hysterical reaction in this House to some of the aforementioned incidents and attempts to try to score political points, possibly with a view to the forthcoming general election, serve no purpose.  I believe the people will look beyond that and will make their own decisions on these issues.  I have heard from many people that they will make their decision regardless of what the Government tries to say or regardless of how it attempts to engage in political point scoring on these issues.</p>  <p>  One vitally important point across the entire peace process is it is only by making politics work and making the process of peace work that one can undermine the existence of paramilitary organisations across the Six Counties and across the two states, that is, by making sure it works, matters can be dealt with fairly and openly and people can get the answers they deserve.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, one sees victims and families seeking answers 20, 30 or 40 years later but they still cannot get closure and cannot get responses from the British Government, which is and has been a party to the conflict all along.  It continues to undermine the process and to undermine the finding of the truth and closure for those families and victims.  This does much more to undermine stability than anything else, other than trying to coax parties to work together or whatever in Stormont and so on.  These are the matters on which Members and the Irish Government should be concentrating.  The Government should be forcing the British Government to live up to its responsibilities and to ensure that by doing so, paramilitaries can be undermined right across the board, regardless of who they are and who they claim to represent.</p>  <p>  If one considers the recent Stormont House Agreement Bill published by the British Government, it contains nothing that will provide any of the answers or solutions I believe the families and victims need.  There has been no consultation on the Bill.  Victims were not consulted and have been ignored completely in this regard.  Moreover, the British Government has set it up in such a way that it will have all the opt-outs it will need.  As Members have seen repeatedly over the past 40 years, the British Government will be able to hide behind the issue of national security.  It will allow the British Government to not deal with issues, not negotiate and not forward information to families.  These are the matters on which the Government should be arguing and fighting the British Government tooth and nail to make sure that when it is passed, the legislation will provide for what the Stormont House Agreement was meant to provide, that is, mechanisms for dealing with the past, dealing with historical inquiries, dealing with information for victims and dealing with information in respect of events that took place over the years of the Troubles.</p>  <p>  If the Government continues to not engage with the British Government in this regard, we will revert to these crises continuously for ever more, probably until the whole conflict reignites in a disastrous way for the entire country.  Consequently, the Government must engage fully.  It must get the British Government to accept it was a party to the conflict and it must put it up to the British Government every step along the way to ensure that what emerges from the Stormont House Agreement will provide what is needed for people right across the North.  This is of vital importance.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about welfare being a matter for Stormont.  In that case, how did the Minister allow it to be included in the Stormont House Agreement?  How did the Government allow this to happen unless it was looking at its own political aims in this regard?  The Government should make sure that welfare is removed from the Stormont House Agreement and that the British Government lives up to its obligations in order that the legislation actually reflects the needs of citizens right across the State.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work done by both the political figures and by those whose names are not in the public domain, including members of the clergy, the Civil Service, individuals and communities.  However, for peace to last, it must be accompanied by justice and one aspect that struck me was the haste to have everything signed by Good Friday, perhaps so it could have the name, "the Good Friday Agreement".  This haste has resulted in issues being unresolved, with flags and parades being two that spring to mind immediately.  There undoubtedly are people in both loyalist and republican communities and circles who feel let down by the Good Friday Agreement and who thought their principles and values were not validated, respected or recognised in the agreement.  While Members are aware the vast majority of people agreed to the Agreement in the referendum, 360,000 people rejected it and I believe a sense of complacency set in and the views of those 360,000 people were left unresolved, particularly in the North.  This sense of abandonment continues to this day and consequently, one can see dissent in both loyalist and republican circles.  Moreover, one can see increased numbers of so-called dissidents in jails in Northern Ireland.  I wish to make the point in the Chamber, as I do on visits to prisoners in the North, that I do not believe in the use of physical force.  However, there is an injustice in the way in which these male and female prisoners are left in jail in the North on remand for excessively long periods.  As Members are concerned about an Irish citizen in a similar situation in an Egyptian jail, many Irish men and women are in a similar situation in the North.  This issue, as well as other issues in the prisons, is not contributing to a conflict-free environment in prison or in society, nor is the perceived view of those prisoners that neither the legal system nor the parole commission system in the North is serving their issues or is being just to them.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and we receive delegations from conflict areas who come to Ireland to learn about the process that led to the Good Friday Agreement, the latest one being this afternoon.  However, Members must be honest about the outstanding issues that remain to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Those living in Border areas know about the illegal activity that goes on in smuggling, fuel laundering and extortion but one does not see the number of convictions that is proportionate for the extent of this illegal activity.  I represent a constituency that has been damaged and ravaged by drugs and find it completely reprehensible and a complete violation of republicanism, in particular, that the value of republicanism has been used by certain groups that are involved in this sort of activity.  I refer to the conclusion of the Villiers report about the main paramilitary groups operating during the Troubles still being in existence and a feature of life in Northern Ireland, albeit that they have undergone significant change.  However, a worrying factor is that the leadership of some groups does not have control over the members.  There is no place for paramilitary groups in a democracy and this issue must be addressed.  While the Villiers report is quite negative in places, I wish to consider the positive developments in communities, some of which have been making presentations before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in recent weeks.  Some of these are involved in issues pertaining to the legacy of the past.  However, I again make the point that people, families, individuals and communities still are waiting on answers and the British Government and other groups are allowed to continue to make excuses on this matter.  In this regard, I think of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Ballymurphy, the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson and at Darkley hall and the Widow Scallan's pub.  Other groups have also appeared before the aforementioned committee and are funded through the reconciliation fund promoting lasting reconciliation and building sustainable community relations.  These include groups such as the Pat Finucane Centre, the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, the Bloody Sunday Trust, WAVE Trauma Centre and Crossfire Trust.  Despite much positive work that is going on, there still are sectarian and racist tensions with intolerance and hatred remaining.  How does one go about re-establishing the trust and respect?  That means real dialogue and means taking on the difficult and contentious issues.  I suggest the bill of rights could be a way forward but there is disagreement on where responsibility lies.  Surely, it is the responsibility of all political parties in the North to be the drivers, with the co-operation of the British and Irish Governments.  It was a central provision of the Good Friday Agreement and it would be based on the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>Respect for human rights, parity of esteem and so on is the way forward.  </p> <p> Through the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have also met groups who are funded through the community relations council and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work they are doing.  Those who feel disenfranchised because of political and economic decisions, including the so-called dissident groups, republicans or loyalists, will have to be listened to if we want to have a just and lasting peace.</p></speech>

The report was commissioned in the aftermath of the killing of Kevin McGuigan in east Belfast on 13 August and of Jock Davison in the markets in June.  The Anti Austerity Alliance and the Socialist Party condemn both murders, just as we stood opposed to the murderous campaign of all paramilitary groups and of killings carried out by the state in the past.  The aforementioned murders would likely have quickly slipped out of the headlines but for the announcement of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, on 22 August that he believes the Provisional IRA still exists and that its members were involved in Kevin McGuigan's murder.  His statement confirmed what most working class people in the North believe, namely, that paramilitary groups still exist and still prey on the most deprived and neglected communities.  Of course, this is not just a question of republican groups.  The loyalist UDA was almost certainly responsible for the murder of Brian McIlhagga in Ballymoney in January this year.  In June, Derry man, Paul McCauley, died nine years after being assaulted at a family barbecue, for which again the UDA is thought to be responsible.  Recently, the UDA, allegedly, crucified one of its victims, nailing him to a table.  The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force also remains active.  Last year, it repeatedly shot Jemma McGrath in east Belfast, in an attempt to kill her.  On top of this, the various dissident republican groups continue with their dead-end campaigns.  </p>  <p>  There is a punishment shooting or beating every third day in the North.  There have been 600 recorded sectarian so-called incidents at the peace lines over the last year alone.  The Villiers report states that the main paramilitary groups and their leaderships are committed to peace and acting to restrain and manage members of their organisations.  This approach is not dissimilar to the famous words of former British Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, who in the early years of the Troubles said he would settle for achieving an acceptable level of violence.  Today, the British state has effectively settled for an acceptable level of violence and the existence of paramilitaries as long as these organisations do not pose any threat to stability and are focused on carving up and controlling working class communities as part of the peace process.  Catholic and Protestant working class people should not have to settle for an acceptable level of violence, which is maintained by dozens of permanent so-called peacelines, thousands of armed police and the local enforcement activities of paramilitary groups interested primarily in control of their areas.  </p>  <p>  It should be remembered that in a period of relative peace, 150 people have died since 1998.  Between 2001 and 2012, there were more than 1,500 shooting incidents and more than 1,000 bombing incidents.  Even if yet another agreement is cobbled together, it will not deal in any fundamental way with the paramilitary control over working class communities.  Only one force is capable of pushing the paramilitaries to one side and ultimately breaking their grip.  That force is a united and organised working class.  Working people are united in their trade unions and on many occasions have followed a union lead to strike and demonstrate against sectarianism and the paramilitaries.  One of the hidden stories of the Troubles and the peace process is the role of trade unionists in confronting paramilitary and sectarian killings on a number of occasions.  For example, in March 1989 when socialists and the Mid-Ulster Trades Council called for strike action following the murder of three Protestants by the IRA, workers from the Unipork factory and others responded in their hundreds.  When Maurice O'Kane, a Catholic welder, was murdered by the UVF in Harland and Wolff in 1994 shops stewards immediately called thousands of workers out and left the shipyard empty.  There are countless of other examples which show the power of ordinary people and the power of the trade unions to take on sectarian forces.  Today they could and should organise against paramilitary racketeering and intimidation.</p>  <p>  We can have no confidence in sectarian parties, paramilitary organisations or the British and Irish Governments to maintain an acceptable level of violence indefinitely.  A peace process based on sectarian forces is one riddled with crisis and division that will pave the road back to conflict.  An alternative agreement must be built, based not on the coming together of sectarian leaders at the top of society but of ordinary working class communities coming together in the spirit of solidarity and prepared to find a solution based on compromise to the issues that divide communities.  The building of a new type of politics, the politics of a united workers movement, is necessary for this to happen.  This means building a new party of working people.  A new generation born since the ceasefire of 1994 will make this happen.  Young people in the North are fed up with austerity, living in a socially backward state and with being imprisoned in Northern Ireland's past.  They are rightly impatient to live in a society where they have the right to live in peace, free from intimidation, division and bigotry.  The sectarian parties have failed to resolve the problems of poverty and division that face ordinary people.  It is time to build a movement that will solve those key issues.</p></speech>

In his statement, the Taoiseach outlined the priority which this Government attaches to peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  Work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across government, regardless of the news cycle.</p>  <p>  Our focus is, of course, on the current political talks in Belfast, which I co-chair with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.  Progress has been made and there has been an intensification in engagement over recent days.  The Government believes that the best agreement is one that all five Northern Ireland parties can support and commit to implement and we are working to that objective.  Specifically, we aim to reach collective agreement on the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and a shared approach to end the impact and legacy of paramilitarism.  I welcome the opportunity to update the House on progress on these issues but must emphasise that as negotiations are still ongoing, I am not yet in a position to speak in definitive terms about the likely or final outcome.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, which was concluded under the auspices of both Governments in December 2014, is a central element of the talks.  The agreement offers a template for overcoming serious difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.  While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their differences for the sake of Northern Ireland's economic stability and the sustainability of public services.  I accept that the British Government has a key role to play in this area and its engagement will, I hope, continue to recognise the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society dealing with the legacy of conflict.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement states in its opening words that the tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering.  More than 3,500 lives were lost in the course of the Troubles, which is an appalling legacy that has left wounds of memory that will never fully heal but we need to continue to do everything possible to ease the hurt and comfort the survivors.  Working with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, I am determined that the work begun by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past will be completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families.  I am working intensively with the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland political parties to ensure the timely establishment of these institutions, including the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, the Historical Investigations Unit, the Implementation and Reconciliation Group and the Oral History Archive.  The Stormont House Agreement set out the political framework for these institutions but we are now working through in more operational detail how they will be established and function.  Given the sensitivity of the issues concerned, this is not without contention and I do not propose to comment on the detail of proposed drafts or solutions currently on the table.  Instead, I will offer some observations on what this Government wishes to see reflected in any final outcome on legacy issues.  There will, in any event, be a need for legislation in this jurisdiction on a number of elements so we will have ample opportunity to discuss the detail in this House when the relevant Bill is introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, will be a new independent body with full investigatory policing powers.  It will take forward investigations in Northern Ireland into outstanding Troubles-related deaths, including cases from the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team process and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p><p>For our part, we want to see a HIU which faithfully reflects what is envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement and is, therefore, victims-centred, independent and transparent and provides every opportunity to ensure effective investigations which are human rights compliant.  Building on the excellent experience of the existing North-South police co-operation, the Government is committed to ensuring full co­operation by the relevant authorities in this jurisdiction with the HIU and, if necessary, to bring forward legislation to give effect to this commitment.</p> <p> The Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR, will enable people from both jurisdictions to seek and receive information about the death of their loved ones during the period of the Troubles.  The work involved in setting up the ICIR includes the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between the Irish and British Governments as well as legislation in both jurisdictions.  The overriding priority for the Government is to establish a commission which is fully independent and, therefore, has the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.</p> <p> A key element of the suite of legacy mechanism is the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG.  It will receive any potential evidence base for patterns and themes from the other mechanisms dealing with the past and commission work in this area from independent academic experts.  The IRG will also encourage and support other related initiatives that contribute to reconciliation, better understanding of the past and reducing sectarianism.  The framework also includes an oral history archive to provide a central place for people from all backgrounds and from throughout Britain and Ireland to share experiences and narratives related to the Troubles.  The archive will be independent.  It will be free from political interference.</p> <p> As two high-profile murders in east Belfast in the summer and assessments from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and MI5 made clear, the pernicious impact and legacy of paramilitarism continue to haunt many communities on both sides of the Border.  The Taoiseach has made the Government's view clear and I reiterate it.  Twenty one years from the first paramilitary ceasefires and 17 years since the Good Friday Agreement, it is long past time that such groups should carry any capacity for any form of threat.  The transition to a fully normalised society in Northern Ireland must be taken forward definitively.</p> <p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's review and the British assessment have acted as a catalyst, injecting fresh momentum into the efforts to collectively address the impact and legacy of paramilitarism.  Addressing this issue will require a multifaceted approach across many sectors and two jurisdictions.  However, any prospective outcome is likely to include an agreed vision for Northern Ireland beyond the shadow of paramilitarism, a commitment by all parties to work collectively to achieve it and some form of monitoring arrangements to measure progress on achieving these key objectives.</p> <p> The effective tackling of criminality and organised crime associated with the legacy of paramilitarism by the forces of law and order will also be a key component of any agreed outcome.  Involvement in violence and intimidation, large-scale smuggling operations, fuel-laundering, drug-dealing and extortion are destroying lives on both sides of the Border.  This cannot be tolerated in a democratic society.</p> <p> Building on the already very successful co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, any agreed outcome to the talks should seek to further deepen North-South co-operation to tackle the scourge of this criminality.  The Government's objective is to secure agreement on new arrangements for enhanced co-operation, involving all of the key agencies that will more comprehensively crack down on cross-Border organised crime.</p> <p> In considering what needs to be done to remove the culture of paramilitarism, we must not forget that dissident republicans, who completely reject the peace process, pose the biggest threat to security right across the island of Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI have been most successful in their efforts to thwart the murderous efforts of these terrorist groups and we must all commend and support that vital work of cross-Border co-operation.</p> <p> As ever, the Irish Government, mindful of its role as co-guarantor of the Belfast Agreement and conscious of its duty to the people of this island, is providing support and encouragement for these talks to succeed.  The Government is determined to ensure that the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement is realised and we will spare no effort to achieve this.</p> <p> I believe that there exists and remains a willingness on all sides to solve the issues around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism.  I have no doubt that, with the necessary will and determination, agreement is possible.  I urge all the parties to engage fully and in a meaningful and positive way over the coming days in order that devolved institutions can get back to the business of delivering good government and effective services for the people of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Last Sunday in my constituency in County Monaghan a mass was celebrated for the late Columba McVeigh, a young man who was taken away and brutally murdered by thugs, criminals and murderers masquerading as republicans.  That mass was celebrated by Fr. Sean Nolan in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Carrickroe to mark what would have been Columba McVeigh's 60th birthday last month.  His late mother, Vera, along with all his family members and friends, campaigned tirelessly to have her son's remains recovered.  She wanted a Christian burial for her son before she passed on to heaven herself.  Sadly, and to this day, Columba McVeigh's remains have not been found.  He is one of the people we refer to as "the disappeared".  Apart from the McVeigh family, three other families have loved ones in that grouping we refer to as "the disappeared".  They are Joe Lynskey, Seamus Ruddy and Robert Nairac.  Their bodies have not been recovered.</p>  <p>  Due to the good work of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, 12 bodies have been recovered.  It is important to record in this House the extremely good and important work that commission has undertaken since it was established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The first commissioner to serve here was my former constituency colleague and friend, the late John Wilson, who also served as T&aacute;naiste.  The people who have held that role since on both sides of the Border have done exceptionally good work in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  I again raise the issue this evening that we, as a Parliament, should appeal to people who have a scintilla of information or knowledge about the murder and burial of those four people, whose remains have not yet been recovered, to come forward to the relevant authorities and provide that information.  Every day that passes makes it more difficult to recover those bodies.  We cannot imagine, under any circumstances, the terrible grief and suffering those families go through when they have not had the opportunity to give their loved ones a Christian burial or when they cannot go to a grave to lay a flower or say a prayer.  We must never forget those families and those people who were brutally murdered.</p>  <p>  It is important in debates such as this that we also appeal to statutory authorities or governments to provide information that can help to lead to the prosecution of those people responsible for horrendous murder and violence.  I have had the opportunity to raise with the Minister, as I had with the Secretory of State, Theresa Villiers, and with the British Labour Party's spokesperson on Northern Ireland, the absolute need for the British Government to respond positively to the unanimous requests of this House, made both in 2008 and 2011, in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This House passed motions unanimously on both occasions asking the British Government to give an eminent international legal person access to the relevant files and papers relating to those terrible atrocities.</p><p>Again, I reiterate that call this evening.  There were many awful days of tragedy on our island during the period known as the Troubles.  That day in May 1974 represented the greatest loss of life on this island due directly to the Troubles.  That loss of life occurred in our capital city, Dublin, and in Monaghan town in my constituency.  That day was, in effect, a mass murder of innocent people.  There is a very good reason the British Government has a moral and political obligation to give access to the files and papers relating to those murders.  There is very good evidence available, as referred to by the late Mr. Justice Barron in his report for the Oireachtas sometime ago, as to where the trail leads and that there was collusion by British state forces with the people who carried out those murders.  I know the Minister has raised this matter successively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Foreign Secretary.  We need to keep it very much on the agenda.  People need to know the truth.  When the families of the victims of those particular atrocities speak to me or to other public representatives, or when they talk openly about their great loss and the grief they continue to suffer, they say the least they need to know is the truth.  The same goes for the Belturbet bombing of 1972 in my home area in County Cavan.  It is important when dealing with the legacy of the past that we deal with all these particular issues.<br/><br/>The recent report by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and MI5 on paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland contained serious findings which have profound repercussions for the island.  The report stated:</p><blockquote>All the main paramilitary groups operating during the period of the Troubles remain in existence: this includes the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando (RHC), Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).</blockquote><p>It is absolutely horrendous these paramilitary groups remain in existence on our island 17 years after the endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement by the overwhelming majority of the people on all of this island.  Paramilitarism in any community, and from whatever source, can no longer be ignored or indulged.  Paramilitarism manipulating and controlling political parties is nothing short of a direct threat to our democracy.  It is imperative we renew and revitalise the hope and energy of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are all aware of the major effort made by various Governments, organisations and parties to bring the Agreement about.<br/><br/>Through parliamentary questions and other debates in the House, we have highlighted the need for additional resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to confront criminality in the Border region.  In particular, I reiterate my calls for a cross-Border agency to get to grips with the challenge.  Last March, I introduced legislation in the House proposing the establishment of a cross-Border agency, the remit of which would be to deal with this criminality.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement in the print media yesterday in which he outlined the establishment of such an agency would be part of the talks process.  This commitment needs to be backed up by real action.  The D&aacute;il will debate my legislation on the establishment of such an agency on 27 November which I hope the Government will support.  It will present the Minister with an opportunity to back up his statements on the negotiations under way in Stormont with real action.  If my legislation requires amendment or improvement, I will be willing to engage on that.<br/><br/>The PSNI and MI5 report on paramilitary activity painted a bleak picture of members of the Provisional IRA engaged in criminal activity.  It also highlighted the criminality of other paramilitary organisations.  The Border region is bearing the brunt of this through illegal cigarette smuggling and fuel laundering.  The latter activity can have serious environmental impacts.  Sadly, in past three years in the Border area in County Louth, we have had the deaths of two members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while on duty.<br/><br/>The Bill put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il proposes the establishment of a cross-Border agency that will build on existing links between statutory agencies, both North and South.  It would enable authorities on both sides of the Border, including environmental bodies, to target and eliminate organised criminality.  It is vital the Minister gives the commitment to such an agency as a core part of any agreement from the current talks, which I hope the five parties and both Governments will bring to a successful conclusion shortly.<br/><br/>It is important we work to ensure we realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  Many people on this island put a major effort into bringing about the Agreement.  Those of us who were privileged to campaign for its acceptance by the people in May 1998 were overjoyed that, in this State alone, more than 94% of those who voted endorsed it.  That was a significant figure.  Similarly, well in excess of 70% of those who voted in Northern Ireland endorsed the Agreement.<br/><br/>As I said earlier today during Question Time, the mandate all of us have as public representatives is to ensure we work to implement the Good Friday Agreement, along with the subsequent agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement.  I hope everyone participating in the talks will be able to deal with the outstanding issues to ensure Northern Ireland can advance so we can have the real cross-Border and all-Ireland economic development we need to create jobs and a better society for our people.  This will also ensure many pockets of deprivation and poverty will be eliminated and dramatically reduced, particularly in areas in Northern Ireland.  Different groups come to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to outline the particular challenges they have in areas of particular disadvantage.  That is what the electorate wants us to be talking about.  The legacy issues, the paramilitary activity and the criminality have to be dealt with and rooted out of our society once and for all.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I wish it happened more often and that more time was given for the North to be a regular feature on D&aacute;il business.  As an Irish republican, the North is not an abstract issue that can be ignored or set aside.  It shaped my politics.  What I have seen, heard and experienced has honed my political outlook and brought me on a journey to this institution.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that Stormont voted in favour of legislating for marriage equality on Monday.  While 53 MLAs voted in favour of the joint SDLP-Sinn F&eacute;in motion and 52 voted against, there will be no moves to legislate for marriage equality because the DUP, Democratic Unionist Party, used its petition of concern on the legislation.  It is disappointing the DUP used this power to block the extension of fundamental rights to a minority group, as well as opposing inclusivity and equality.  There is a responsibility on all of us to continue to fight for equality for all citizens in the North and across this island.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement has had a hugely positive affect on politics on these islands.  It is a cross-party and international agreement between two Governments.  The current crisis in the political institutions in the North has been created by the negativity and disengagement of the British Government, the lack of leadership among unionism and the lack of creative conditions for a better future.</p></speech>
