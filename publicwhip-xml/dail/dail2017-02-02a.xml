We have already seen the policy decision to devalue sterling cost the agrifood industry some &euro;470 million in the last few months alone.  Today, the UK Government publishes its White Paper on Brexit which might give an indication as to how it proposes to manage the Brexit negotiations when Article 50 is eventually signed next month.  Despite the platitudes on all sides, it is clear that we are not prioritising Brexit to the extent we must to address the effect on our economy.  Yesterday, we had to depend on listening to the debate in the House of Commons to find out what the plans and the effects on this country will be.  The Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, addressed the House of Commons and agreed with the DUP's Sammy Wilson that to give Northern Ireland a special deal would be the wrong approach.  It is clear that there will be a hard Border.  This morning, Mr. Lux of the EU Commission went into extraordinary detail to outline blue and red channels for goods crossing the Border.  This situation is totally unacceptable and comes within 48 hours of Prime Minister May talking here about the need to avoid a return to the old Border situation.</p>  <p>  The question is what we are going to do about this.  Does the commentary of Mr. Lux this morning not clearly underline the need for Ireland to build an alliance against what is a very fast emerging hard Brexit for this country with a hard Border and red and blue channels where heavy goods vehicles and others will have to be called in and checked?  He said some of it will happen with the benefit of technology while it will also require Border posts and staff.  This is a seriously retrograde step.  Brexit has the potential to wreck the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and to impact seriously on Border communities which are already struggling in the context of damaged trade.  We have had constant platitudes from the Government about an all-of-Government approach.  We need a Minister for Brexit, appropriately resourced, and the Government must immediately publish a plan about how bilateral negotiations with Britain will go and, more particularly, how negotiations are going to go with the EU Commission.  It is essential that Northern Ireland is granted a special deal to secure the future of this entire nation economically, socially and politically.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that there is a very real and serious risk facing Ireland with the implications of the Border controls confirmed this morning by Mr. Lux?  Is the Government accepting that Borders are going to be put in, which Mr. Lux suggested this morning?  Can the T&aacute;naiste outline the position to the House?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200003#A00300"><p>We are under absolutely no illusion about the nature and scale of the Brexit challenge and we have a clear and comprehensive plan.  That has been evident in our approach to date.  The Taoiseach has made his own views absolutely clear on the fact he is leading on this and will continue to do so.</p><p>All Ministers across Government are also involved as part of comprehensive planning and reaction to the very serious challenges we face as a country.  We are absolutely clear.</p> <p> To continue to talk about a lack of preparation is not the approach that the main Opposition party should take, from a reputational point of view as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is very clear that the Government has done deep analysis across all areas of the Brexit network.  There are 11 working groups.  A significant amount of work has been done in my Department.  I will meet the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, on Monday to continue the discussion.  It is very clear that the top-level priorities have been identified, namely, trade, economy, Northern Ireland, the peace process, the common travel area and the future of the EU.  We have examined the risks, the mitigating factors and what is needed.</p> <p> The House of Commons has now passed the first stage of the Bill, allowing the Prime Minister to notify the European Union of the intention of the United Kingdom to leave.  We are now in a different situation, in that the first formal step has been taken and more is to come in terms of the legislative process and the publication of the White Paper.  It will be useful for us to deepen our preparations and, at EU level, detail our priorities.  There are ongoing meetings with different sectors, industry and civic society.  The all-island dialogue will continue.  Another meeting will be held very shortly.</p> <p> I do not have time to go into the enormous programme of engagement that has been undertaken by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  Let me reassure the House that it has been very intensive and detailed work has been done on all of the implications.  Until Article 50 is triggered, formal negotiations will not begin.</p> <p> Our plan is having an effect.  Chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has named four initial priorities.  Deputy MacSharry referred to Northern Ireland, which is one of the priorities.  I met Mr. Barnier and his team, as did the Taoiseach and a number of other Ministers, and had detailed discussions about our priorities for Brexit.  We made our position on not returning to any type of a hard border very clear.  His other priorities include protecting the common travel area, which is one of Prime Minister Theresa May's 12 negotiation priorities.  As there is greater clarity from the British side, we will be in a position to continue to ensure that our headline priorities are centre stage in our contact with the UK and across the EU and in all the meetings we will continue to have with EU heads of state.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200004#B00200"><p>It is time that we were honest with the people.  The T&aacute;naiste keeps telling us how busy she is and how much work is being done.  However,  Mr. Lux let the cat out of the bag today and spoke of red and green channels.  The T&aacute;naiste needs to clarify this for the people.  Some six weeks ago, traffic was funnelled from the M1 onto the N1 at Ravensdale in order to allow customs guards and social welfare personnel to screen traffic.  Is this a dry run for what we can expect in the future?  It is time the T&aacute;naiste outlined the plan clearly to the people.  Far too much is at stake.  Can she confirm that additional staff and resources will be exclusively assigned to the issue of Brexit so these matters can be dealt with?</p></speech>

I do not think he should anticipate the outcome at this point.  We have heard from many commentators and there are many opinions and individual comments, but we are not yet in negotiation mode, as the Deputy knows.  We have had comments from many different European commentators.</p>  <p>  This is a decision that has been taken by people in the UK and their Government.  We are engaging with every member state to explain our unique issues, and that is progressing well.  Of course the process will intensify in the period ahead.  Every initiative that we can take is being taken at this point.  In my meetings with my Northern counterpart and other meetings next week, we will discuss the applications for civil and criminal law, of which there are many.  A significant amount of work needs to be done.  There is very intensive engagement within and across Departments at this point, highlighting the priority of this issue for us as a Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200005#C00100"><p>The result of a ballot of members of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, is expected to be announced today.  The ballot was held because of major issues surrounding teachers' pay as well as issues surrounding supervision and substitution duties.  Despite some minor concessions on the Government's part, the deal put to teachers remains largely the same as that proposed before teachers went out on strike last October.  The ASTI executive has recommended that its members should reject the deal on offer.  If they do, industrial action will resume and schools will close again.  As any parent will tell the T&aacute;naiste, this will be very disruptive.  As any student, particularly those in exam years, will tell her, it will also be very stressful.</p>  <p>  Teachers have legitimate concerns about their pay and conditions.  Their concerns are justifiably shared across the public sector following seven years of pay cuts, but the teaching profession in particular has been affected as it is the one area in which a large number of new recruits had to be employed over the past ten years because of demographic pressures.  Teachers and the rest of our public sector workers want and deserve fair pay restoration.  They are not looking for a pay increase, but pay restoration, that is, to be simply given back what was taken away.</p>  <p>  The demands of teachers are not insurmountable but they remain unresolved because the Government has its head stuck firmly in the sand.  The issue of pay equality, which was a central reason for industrial action in October has not been addressed in the slightest, but it must be addressed.  New entrants - those who started teaching from January 2011 - start on a pay scale that is on average 10% less than their colleagues.  The Government has no plan to address that situation.  Worse still, there is no commitment to equal pay for equal work.</p>  <p>  I am of the firm view that this issue must be resolved before the scheduled ending of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The clock is ticking and kicking the can down the road will not resolve the problem.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of Government, today commit unequivocally to the principle of pay equality for teachers?  Will she agree that the issue of pay equality - equal reward for equal effort - for post-2011 teachers must be addressed and confirm that it will be addressed before the scheduled ending of the Lansdowne Road agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200005#C00200"><p>I welcome the fact that the central executive committee of the ASTI took a decision to put the outcome of the recent talks process to a ballot of its members.  We should await the result which will be announced later today.</p>  <p>  On the points raised, it is critical to note that three quarters of the gap for new entrants described by the Deputy has been closed in this deal.  It is a good offer that was made following negotiations with all the trade unions.  This was a final offer and we should respect the ballot process.  A new pay process is starting under the Public Sector Pay Commission which will address the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  There are immediate benefits to individual ASTI members in accepting the offer.  The current deal on the table would see new teachers get a 15% to 22% increase in their salaries, beginning in January; immediate backdated payments for supervision and substitution for all teachers; restoration of increments; and increased flexibility in how the Croke Park hours are used in schools.  Acceptance would also mean that ASTI members can avail of a new voluntary opt-out from the supervision and substitution scheme and would provide for earlier permanency for those on fixed-term contracts as well as new arrangements for securing additional hours for part-timers.  The Deputy will see why I say the deal on offer is a good one.  I hope the result of the ballot later today will be positive.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that under the package announced in the recent budget, which was also significant, there will be greater promotion opportunities on offer in schools for new teachers coming into the system.</p><p>These benefits are only available to ASTI members if they vote to accept the package.  The proposals also include arrangements for addressing concerns about the junior cycle, including arrangements for ensuring that no current third year students miss out on marks in their English examination. </p> <p> I accept that the ASTI has outstanding pay demands and that the deal does not travel the full distance it set out to achieve.  However, it represents significant progress, as I indicated.  The door is certainly not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of our public service pay talks when they get under way. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200006#D00200"><p>The T&aacute;naiste's response, while not unexpected, is nonetheless alarming and I am sure it will cause alarm among teachers, students and parents alike.  The alarm resides in the following simple matter.  Why can no Government Minister commit, as a matter of principle, to equal pay for equal work?  That is what this issue boils down to.  Nobody expects pay restoration to happen overnight and it is accepted, including by teachers, that no one has a magic wand.  Why can the Government not make a commitment for new entrants who are currently disadvantaged, employed on a discriminatory basis and do not receive equal pay?  Why can it not commit to implement equal pay for equal work over an agreed timescale?  This is what needs to happen.  Irrespective of the outcome of the ballot, which is a matter for the members of the ASTI to decide, this issue will remain outstanding.  Why does the principle of equal pay for equal work and effort not apply for new and young teachers?</p></speech>

The choice is whether to accept the immediate benefits on offer and participate, with the other trade unions, in the further process of engagement or forgo these immediate benefits in favour of a very unpredictable future.  It is for the ASTI leadership to explain its strategy in that respect.  For the Government's part, as Deputy McDonald is aware, our approach to the budget was that we have a recovering economy with significant demands and we have to balance supporting those who are dependent on social welfare and taxpayers.  If we did not have tax revenue, we would not be able to invest in services or implement the type of pay restoration that is under way.</p></speech>

Much remains to be done, however, and tax justice is clearly the means by which we will advance this agenda.  This week, we learned that the National Asset Management Agency will pay an additional &euro;158 million in tax on profits made by the agency from the sales of property held through section 110 companies.</p><p>Today, it is reported that Matheson has closed three charities that were used by vulture funds to avoid paying tax.  I welcome that.  However, a fortnight ago <i>The Irish Times </i>published a comprehensive investigation showing the intense lobbying before the budget by companies such as Kennedy Wilson, Oaktree Capital, Hammerson and CarVal.  This investigation shows the depth and extent of lobbying activity by vulture funds of the Department of Finance to ensure that changes to our laws did not inconvenience their elaborate tax avoidance structures.<br/><br/>The statutory lobbying register shows a lot less activity.  The lobbying returns for September-December 2016 show that only a small portion of those meetings were required to be declared and that much of the lobbying by these companies is carried out with junior officials so that it flies under the radar.  It is clear that lobbying rules in regard to tax matters need to be strengthened so that all activity is captured.  In at least one case letters from a vulture fund directly to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, have not been declared.  In other cases, it may be that vulture funds avoided the necessity to declare their interactions by channelling their contact to more junior officials with whom contact does not have to be declared. <br/><br/>Tax policy is a particularly important part of public policy.  Our tax must be just and fair.  Continuing to allow vulture funds to influence tax policy under the radar is unfair to families and small business across the country who have no such access.  Will the Government prescribe the higher executive officer, HEO, and assistant principal grades within the tax division of the Department of Finance as designated officials to ensure that lobbying on tax matters, particularly by vulture funds, can no longer be hidden in the shadows?  <br/><br/>In the context of the &euro;150 million paid by NAMA, how much does the Government expect to collect from other companies following the rule changes?</p></speech>

On the CSO data, I welcome that survey which shows that Ireland became a wealthier and more equal country in 2015 as compared with 2014.  It is also shows an increase in income of 6.2%, with consistent poverty falling from 8.8% to 8.7% and a significant fall in deprivation rates.  The rate of those not poor but at risk of falling into poverty is also decreasing.  This data highlights the improvements that have been made in regard to those issues.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of NAMA and section 110.  As the Deputy will be aware, that issue has been discussed in the House previously.  The Government has taken action in regard to section 110.  A a decision was taken to end the eligibility of section 110 companies, not taxable in Ireland, in relation to profit-making from property-related investment under that section.  That change has been made.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy's point about lobbying, vulture funds and contacts with the Department of Finance is an important point in relation to lobbying on tax policy.  A lobbyists register has been put in place.  If there is evidence of people who should be registering not doing so that needs to be pursued.  The message must go out to people that if they are lobbying in any area of government policy they need to register.  I will ask the Minister to examine the report from which Deputy Burton quoted.  There are clear obligations on lobbyists, the legislation in respect of which is very recent and was introduced by the previous Government.  I am sure that it will be reviewed and that any gaps identified will be examined.</p><p> The principal point is that we all expect that if we have legislation stating lobbyists ought to register, they should do so.  I understand many have registered.  If there are gaps, however, they need to be examined.  If changes to the legislation are required in order for that to happen, that can be considered.</p></speech>

In order to seek tax advantages in this jurisdiction, very clever people are engaging in shadow lobbying.  It makes our tax system more unequal than it needs to be.  The reason I raised the SILC statistics is that they show clearly how much further we have advanced by comparison with Northern Ireland, for instance, in making a more equal and fair society, particularly through social welfare increases in 2014 and 2015.  The statistics and comparisons exist and people can read them.</p>  <p>  If we want to make our society more equal, which is what everybody wants, we must have circumstances in which lobbying is properly accounted for.  People are flying under the radar and lobbying in the shadows by lobbying people such as senior officials but also more junior officials at assistant principal and higher executive officer levels.</p>  <p>  I asked the T&aacute;naiste previously whether the Government will introduce a standing commission on taxation so society and the Parliament can be constantly on the watch for new tax-avoidance creations.  Will it do so?</p></speech>

It was very important legislation.  If what the Deputy is describing as a shadow system exists, it clearly needs to come out of the shadows.  I have made that very clear.  The legislation exists and lobbyists have a responsibility to register.  If the Deputy has information about the shadow lobbying she believes is taking place, she should make it known to the Minister for Finance.  It needs to be examined.  We introduced the legislation because there was lobbying of various sorts occurring behind the scenes.  A decision was taken by the last Government to have more transparency in this regard.  If there is further work to be done on it, that can happen.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy's point on social transfers and their impact.  The evidence from yesterday's CSO report and Gini analysis is very clear that social transfers continue to perform very strongly in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  There was a reduction from 34.9% before social transfers to 16.9% after social transfers.  That is a very significant reduction in poverty as a result of the decisions taken by the current Government and its predecessor.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, Tesco has decided to take the extraordinary action of bypassing its workers' union, Mandate, and unilaterally imposing the terms of a contract.  These terms, if accepted, would mean a pay cut of more than 15%, in addition to an attack on terms and conditions for the company's longest-serving workers.  This is only the beginning.  Tesco's union-busting activities are part of a broader plan known as Project Black, which was drawn up by a specialist international legal team called Eversheds.  It aims to get rid of 1,200 of the most secure and well-paid jobs in the company, critically undermining the union in the process.  If this plan succeeds, it will be a big step towards bringing Tesco into line with the low-hour, low-wage and insecure employment that is rampant across the retail sector.  The company intends to enforce these changes by bullying its workers, trying to turn them against one another and disciplining those who speak out.  This is both deeply worrying and unnecessary.</p>  <p>  Tesco is no pauper.  Research estimates suggest the company makes between &euro;200 million and &euro;250 million in profit per year in Ireland.  Only a few years ago, Tesco was calling Ireland "Treasure Island" in its internal documents, a clear indication of the big money it made here.</p><p> In recent days in Britain, Tesco agreed to shell out &pound;3.7 billion to buy Booker, the food wholesale company, and it plans to pay dividends to shareholders at the same time that it imposes cuts on workers.  Tesco is no pauper.  It is a serious player.  It is the largest private sector employer in Ireland.  What happens to its 11,000 retail workers in the coming days and weeks should be of high priority to every Deputy.  It will also tell a story about the reality of work in modern Ireland.</p> <p> Figures show that Ireland is second in the OECD in terms of low pay at 25% of the workforce.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to yesterday's Survey of Income and Living Conditions, SILC, report but it also mentioned that 105,000 people were working poor.  Everyday, hundreds of thousands of people go to work in low-pay jobs on insecure terms and unpredictable hours, struggling to get by from day to day.  In many cases, the public subsidises this.  For example, 10% of Tesco's workforce is in receipt of family income supplement.</p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste condemn Tesco's latest actions?  Will she defend the rights of workers to be represented in their workplaces and not to be bypassed by super-rich multinational corporations that try to impose terms unilaterally?  Will she take action about the low-pay crisis, which already impacts on one quarter of our workers according to the OECD and threatens to escalate further under her Government?</p></speech>

First of all, workers have a right to be consulted on any change in their contract.  That goes without saying; it is a basic principle and we want to see that observed.  The second point is that, in this country, we have the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Clearly, we would want to see these mechanisms being used to the full in a situation such as the Deputy describes.  I will ask the Minister to liaise with her afterwards regarding any particular action that may be taken in terms of the situation that she has outlined.</p>  <p>  The general point is that what we are seeing in Ireland at present is a huge increase in employment.  We want to see well-paid jobs.  We are seeing that across the country.  We are seeing a huge reduction in unemployment from 15.7% down to just over 7% now.  Clearly, we want to continue that.  We launched our new jobs action plan just this week.  We want to see that improvement being reflected right across the country and we want to see well-paying jobs being available for individuals and for families because that is the best way out of poverty.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the Deputy has outlined a situation that she has concerns about in respect of Tesco but, in the first instance, it is for discussion between employers and employees.  We have well-tested labour relations mechanisms available where there is conflict, and I would hope that they would be used.</p></speech>

It is not just about establishing commissions.  We need robust legislation.  The Government is allowing us to become a low-pay Ireland.  According to the OECD, one in four Irish workers is low paid.  According to yesterday's SILC report, there are more than 100,000 working poor.  The same report stated that consistent poverty among the children of lone parents, who are disproportionately retail workers, has increased to 26.2%.  These figures do not even count those people who are underemployed or the prevalence of short contracts and low, insecure hours.</p>  <p>  What action will the T&aacute;naiste take about this?  Tesco is one of the few employers in the retail sector that still has thousands of decent jobs in which workers earn enough on which to live, and it has these jobs because workers organised.  Research shows that, in the retail sector, those in unions earn approximately 30% more than those who are not.  I urge the workers in Tesco to stay strong, stay together and remember that if the company is given the right to impose terms unilaterally on one group today, it will do so to another tomorrow.</p><p>This week is the 70th anniversary of the death of Jim Larkin.  I will conclude with the slogan: an injury to one is an injury to all.  That message should go out to every worker who is fighting those issues.</p></speech>

We certainly want to see that.  In relation to the statistics that were published today, I wish to make the point that the full impact of the recovery that is ongoing is not reflected in the 2015 figures because we have had improvements since the figures that are in the report today were examined.  As the Deputy is aware, we were in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards and, as a result, fewer people are dependent on transfers.  For example, the number of people in receipt of working age income and employment supports continues to fall, to just under 405,000 people in December 2016.  I accept that is still a large number.  However, it is 10% less than the number claiming those allowances in the previous year, thus showing the rise in income.  The jobs that are being created are taking people out of poverty and poverty traps but work remains to be done.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is no doubt aware that we have had motions in the D&aacute;il on the matter and it was agreed that a commission of inquiry would be established into the activities around the sale of Project Eagle and that its terms of reference would allow the said commission of inquiry to add modules should other revelations emerge.  The PAC is completing its work in the coming weeks in terms of the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Project Eagle.  Could the T&aacute;naiste indicate that the Government is still committed to holding a commission of inquiry, as agreed by the House, and could she please give that commitment today?</p></speech>

I understand the PAC hopes to produce a report on the matter very shortly.  It would be sensible to wait for that report to be published.  Deputy MacSharry's own colleague suggested the same.  We should wait for the report to be published and consider its findings before any further decisions are taken.</p></speech>

In 2015 the Government agreed to take the case of the hooded men back to the European Court of Human Rights.  That was the right decision.  Last night Channel 4 revealed that papers uncovered by the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry exposed at least four known cases of waterboarding by the British army and RUC.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that waterboarding is an horrific method of torture which terrorises a victim and simulates drowning.  The papers also revealed that the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, raised one case with the then British Prime Minister, Ted Heath.  That is a very serious matter which demands the fullest investigation by the Government.  Will the T&aacute;naiste instruct officials in the Department to examine its files to determine if the Department of Justice and Equality has information that could shed more light on those claims?  Could she raise the matter urgently with An Taoiseach and ask that he too instructs his Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do the same?  Will the Taoiseach investigate and report back to the D&aacute;il on what steps have been taken to pursue this matter?  Will the Taoiseach release the minutes of the meeting between Jack Lynch and Ted Heath on those matters?</p></speech>

Whatever about the accuracy of the reports, they are a reminder of the very dark history of the Troubles on this island and everybody must face up to their responsibilities in that regard.  It is clear there is a special obligation on any state to act at all times within the rule of law but we must also reflect on the many barbaric acts that were committed by others, which included torture and not even allowing a decent burial for people who were killed or disappeared.  There is a legacy for all of us to reflect on, and we must continue to find ways to address the legacy issues.  I hope the House will agree that what we should do is give priority to maintaining the Good Friday Agreement so that we do not return to those dark days.</p><p>Of course, the Government takes these reports very seriously and is looking very carefully at the issues raised in the programme.</p></speech>

The position is that we are developing much better curricula in history and it is part of the junior cycle reforms.  At present, compulsory history only applies in voluntary secondary schools - 52% of schools - but 90% of pupils take it up.  One of the problems is that they fall away very rapidly thereafter so the junior cycle curriculum has not been a satisfactory curriculum and is being reformed.  It is not very different from what it was when I was in school and is based on trying to retain huge volumes of dates and events, which is not the true type of history instruction we need.  We should be equipping our young people to have the critical skills to which Deputy Burton referred.  We had a very good debate and are reforming the curriculum and it will be very good for history in Ireland.</p></speech>

I know from an answer given to my colleague, Deputy McDonald, that those in government are not massive fans of equal pay for work of equal value.  They are very lucky that they are not getting paid by results.  A total of 601 people were on hospital trolleys yesterday and there are nearly 520 people on trolleys today.  What will the T&aacute;naiste do about this that is new because whatever she is doing and however half-hearted her efforts, it is not working?

It also means extremely difficult working conditions for front-line staff.  We heard comments this morning from the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine.  The trolley numbers for January are lower this year than last year.  Nevertheless, it is an unacceptable situation.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is determined to break the cycle we have seen previous Governments try to break.  He is determined to break that cycle so that we do not continue to see that situation.  He has outlined the three areas needed to deal with this problem.  The bed capacity review is under way to examine precisely the type of new beds that are needed, whether it is high dependency and so on.  He is working with all the relevant organisations.  We have to continue to recruit.  The Minister is in discussions with the nursing organisations and trade unions to see how we can accelerate recruitment because that is part of solving a very important aspect of the problem.  The difficulties in that regard are well documented.  Dealing with the new general practitioner contract that is needed is essential because the development of primary care services are part of the answer to this problem.</p></speech>

In other words, it can close down the fund and leave accumulated liabilities to the detriment of members.  This situation has been resolved in the United Kingdom for the past 20 years.  Unfortunately, the UK legislation is running into some difficulties so we do not propose to repeat that here.  We must take a more nuanced approach in our Bill, which we have done.  It will meet many of the objections raised to the British legislation or to a proposal along the lines we are suggesting.  I will outline the details of that when the Bill is being discussed on Second Stage.</p><p>In addition, the method of calculation of liabilities for defined benefit pension purposes grossly inflates liabilities.  We are obliging the Pensions Authority to do a study of how liabilities are calculated and to report back to this House within six months.</p><p>In addition to this, a pension protection scheme has been in operation in the UK for more than 20 years.  I do not know whether a similar arrangement would be appropriate here but we are asking the Pensions Authority to report to us on this within six months.  I refer to where the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme make an application to the Pensions Authority under section 50 to change the terms of the scheme.  We have had many complaints that in some cases a particular group of members, whether deferred pensioners, future pensioners, etc., might be more adversely affected than others and they have no redress.  We would provide an appeal mechanism to the Pensions Authority in such a situation, provided the majority of the members of the scheme who vote in a particular ballot to deal with the situation propose to do so.  I will recommend the Bill to the House during Private Members' time next week.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Acts to place a statutory requirement on the Taoiseach to outline to the D&aacute;il the Government's approach to negotiations surrounding British intentions to leave the European Union.  The Bill will oblige the Government to report on its approach to preserving the rights of those in the North who will remain EU citizens in the aftermath of Brexit by virtue of their Irish citizenship, and it provides that the Government will report on its approach to opposing the obligations of the British Government and the Irish Government under the Good Friday Agreement.  It also obliges the Government to make a quarterly report to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on developments in the Article 50 negotiating process following the commencement of those negotiations.</p><p>I am of the firm view the Bill will help to facilitate dialogue in the D&aacute;il and go some way towards ensuring all of us are kept up to date on developments in the Article 50 negotiation process.  This will facilitate an inclusive process of open policy debate and will inform, I hope, the Government's political and policy response to the British Government's Brexit plans and the EU's plans as they arise.</p><p>I understand the British Government will publish a White Paper.

A number of amendments have been tabled by Deputies proposing similar provisions and that are alternatives to amendment No. 17.  I am referring to those tabled by Deputy Coppinger and the Anti-Austerity Alliance, amendment No. 18 from People Before Profit, amendment No. 19 from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, amendment No. 23 in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace and amendment No. 24 from Deputy Pringle.</p>  <p>  My amendment states that the report shall include information as to the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offence under section 7A as created by this Bill.  This is the provision that targets the demand for sexual services and I have limited the review to this particular provision, as it is this that has given rise to some concern regarding the impact on the safety and well-being of sex workers.  A review of prostitution legislation by an Oireachtas committee three years ago recommended the introduction of this offence, and there is nothing to stop a similar review from happening in the future.  It does not require legislative provision.</p>  <p>  However, in focusing the review provision in the Bill on the single offence of criminalising the purchase of sexual services rather than including it in a large review of trafficking legislation and prostitution legislation generally, which can be the subject of a separate review, we can concentrate more deliberately and forensically on the impact of the offence with less risk of it being minimised in the context of a much larger review.</p>  <p>  I have set a date for the review being completed within three years of the section being commenced.  I am recommending this because it is pragmatic and will afford the best opportunity to ensure that the legislation has been embedded for a sufficient period to measure its impact adequately.  To begin the review at too early a point may result in an inconclusive report.  Northern Ireland committed to reviewing its legislation after three years, and it would be useful to have a comparable period to measure the impact of the offence in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  I remind Deputies that, under Standing Order 164A, the Minister with responsibility for implementation of an Act shall provide a report that shall review the functioning of the Act and must be laid in the Library.  This must be done 12 months following the enactment of a Bill.  Therefore, a report will be prepared within one year because that is the normal statutory provision.</p>  <p>  The Opposition amendments, including amendment No. 1 to the Government amendment, are too broad.  The Deputies are familiar with their own amendments.  Some seek to include in the review the impact of our existing human trafficking offences under the 2008 Act on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  The existing laws relating to human trafficking target those who traffic human beings for the purpose of exploitation, be it labour exploitation, sexual exploitation or exploitation of some other form.  No one is suggesting that our human trafficking laws have impacted on the safety and well-being of sex workers and require a review in that light, yet that is the implication contained in some of the Opposition amendments.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a general point about the work that has been done in monitoring the State's response to human trafficking.  Last October, I launched the second national action plan to combat human trafficking in Ireland.  It has been published and is available on our website.  It is extensive in terms of setting out the goals and work, including interagency work, that are required if we are to deal with this issue.  The goals include the identification of victims of trafficking, protection and support for its victims and ensuring an effective criminal justice response.  The plan outlines many initiatives across the agencies, including NGOs and the Garda, to monitor the provision of support to victims and so on.  The plan is being overseen by a working group and was sent for evaluation by the Council of Europe in December.  I met the Council of Europe and it will revert to us with its assessment.  If it has recommendations, I will be open to implementing them.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my amendment achieves the purpose that was debated on Committee Stage, namely, that we needed to review this legislation.  I am happy to do that.  We should examine the impact of the new offence of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution.  Regardless, there will be an overall review in the usual statutory way after one year.  I hope that the Deputies will consider accepting this as a way forward.</p></speech>

I would have been happier had we managed to reduced the time to two years.  The Minister probably considered the possibility of doing so.  Her amendment reads "shall, not later than 3 years", so there is no legal barrier to her producing a report within two years if the data exist.  If she could give a commitment to that effect, I would be willing to withdraw my amendment.</p>  <p>  Something that is missing from the Minister's amendment that is contained in all the others is the provision relating to "evidence of the extent to which this section has operated to reduce human trafficking".  We were told that combatting trafficking and brothel keeping was one of the rationales for introducing this legislation.  Any report that is laid before us should at least reference this, given how it has played a central role in the reasoning behind the section.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the report will assess the impact of the section's operation on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  This important provision is contained in all of the amendments.</p>  <p>  I am willing to withdraw my amendment if the Minister can commit to producing a report after two years, if possible.</p></speech>

I too welcome the progress we have made with the Minister.  We also sought to have the review after two years.  The Minister has used wording which is similar to our amendment in terms of the extent to which, in the Minister's opinion, the operation of this Part has reduced human trafficking and the impact of this Part on the safety and well-being of sex workers, and also in relation to the data on the number of arrests, prosecutions etc.  The Minister's wording is not unlike ours, apart from the fact that the review will happen after three years rather than two, but I do not think we are going to get any further at this stage so I signal that I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

He referred to human trafficking.  The justification for the campaign on the criminalisation of the purchase of sex was based on the concerns we all rightly have about human trafficking, in particular for the purposes of sex, where such unfortunates are, in effect, being kept in prison against their will and trafficked across borders.  They are expected to carry out sexual activity to make lots of money for their traffickers.  That is a concern for all of us.</p>  <p>  However, as I said last night when I introduced our amendments, there has been a lot of conflation in this debate.  The argument is fundamentally about whether criminalising the purchase of sex will deal with human trafficking.  I do not believe that is the case and I have not seen any evidence to convince me otherwise.  I have read lots of documents from Sweden, Norway, Amnesty and others that show quite the opposite is the case.  Criminalisation of the purchase of sex does nothing to deal with the plight of those who are the victims of human trafficking or the criminality in that regard.  We are in danger of conflating issues, which is the reason we specifically mention in our amendment that we want to see the impact of the legislation on the level of human trafficking.  Whether the review is in two years or three years it must specifically focus on the impact on human trafficking.  The Minister's amendment does not do that.  I intend to press my amendment.</p>  <p>  I will also press the Minister further on the question of timing.  It will be three years and probably four before we get a report if we opt for the Minister's amendment and the issue is too urgent to leave it for that length of time, not specifically just on the trafficking issue but because there is a plethora of issues we have tried to amend.  For example, the definition of a brothel is being taken to include a case where a number of sex workers work together in an apartment.  They could be considered to be running and brothel and could be shut down.  If I was a sex worker vulnerable to all sorts of creeps out there with money to buy services I would much rather operate alongside a companion in the same apartment.  Working together is not just a sign of being organised in an industry, it about the health and safety of sex workers.  Health and safety at work is a big part of legislation no matter what job one performs, whether a firefighter, nurse or sex worker.  The health and safety of sex workers must be given a certain degree of priority, in particular because they are already extraordinarily vulnerable.  The issue of working together does not necessarily mean people are running a brothel, it may just be a case of safety in numbers.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the heavier penalties for loitering that are contained in the Bill.  We must also examine the impact of that on the human rights of the sex workers involved.  Crucially, we must focus on health.  I have just been going over the report on the Swedish model carried out by HIV Ireland and it is very worrying how such a measure could impact on the health of sex workers.  As we said last night, very often sex workers are searched to see whether they are carrying condoms and the implication is that they are carrying them in order to facilitate the purchase of sex.  There is evidence in the report that sex workers are less likely to carry condoms, which help protect their safety.  There is evidence that the level of HIV is on the increase among sex workers in Sweden.  There have also been statements from people connected with the Swedish department of health that they refuse to issue condoms to sex workers.  I have two young nephews who have grown up in Sweden and I am aware that every school there has a nurse who provides condoms to teenagers if they request them because they are concerned about their sexual health.  However, it seems all of a sudden we disrespect the sexual health of people who are engaged in sex work.  That must be taken into account and in the shortest possible time.  Two years is much healthier than the three years proposed by the Minister.  A reference to human rights and human trafficking must be contained within the review.  I intend to press amendment No. 18.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200023#W00400"><p>I intend to move amendment No. 23.  We have looked at this entire issue the wrong way around.  Rather than start with data, evidence and research and then deciding what policy to adopt, we started with a model that was an alleged solution and we are talking about carrying out a review after the event.  That is regrettable.  It contrasts sharply with the approach taken in the UK where a significant body of research was undertaken in advance of any proposals being put forward to alter legislation, which to me is a far better way.  Interestingly, the Home Affairs Select Committee interim report found disadvantages to a sex buyer law based on the fact that provisions already exist for criminal offences associated with the sex industry.  The finding is that demand is not reduced, just displaced.  The committee also very worryingly cited harassment and other negative effects on sex workers.  That bolsters the point I made last night that already sex workers are very vulnerable to exploitation by the Garda who are in a position of power.  There were 70 reports to GSOC of threats and demands for sexual favours from the Garda.  The health and policing implications are important as well.  The conclusion of the British report is that the sex buyer law is based on the premise that prostitution is morally wrong and therefore illegal, whereas the law at present in Britain makes no such moral judgment.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that the intention of many of the supporters of the sex buyer law is to protect sex workers, especially women, from the harm, violence and exploitation that can occur in the sex industry but we also note that the sex buyer law makes no attempt to discriminate between prostitution which occurs between two consenting adults and that which involves exploitation.  Much of the rhetoric also denies sex workers the opportunity to speak for themselves and to make their own choices, which is absolutely critical in terms of our amendment because we have devised the Bill while excluding the voice of the sex workers themselves.  Our amendment calls for any review to put those people, and the organisations which work on the front line in harm reduction, as the core component.  That is absolutely critical.</p>  <p>  I echo the points made by Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien.  Given the Minister's proviso is "not later than three years" I hope she will commence the review earlier.  We, like many of the others who proposed amendments suggested a two-year provision.</p><p>A review of this type is not expensive.  The representative organisations for sex workers and harm reduction agencies have their own records and data and publish yearly statistics, as do the garda&iacute; in some instances, so it is just a matter of centralising data.  However, we need to engage with the sex workers themselves.</p> <p> The only contention put forward by those supporting the so-called Swedish model is that if we criminalise the purchase of sex, we will reduce demand and therefore have an impact on trafficking.  This proposition is nonsense and I would love to see the evidence for it.  There are already laws dealing with trafficking, which is the abhorrent forced bonded labour, abduction, kidnap, false imprisonment, rape and exploitation of women.  Human trafficking is abhorrent.  I am intrigued in some ways by the over-concentration on sex trafficking in contrast with the coercion and exploitation of people who are trafficked for other purposes, which is an interesting point.  Given that we are talking about the health and vulnerability of a very marginalised group of people, we need to move far more quickly than three years.  Our legislation should have been about enabling those vulnerable people to take control over their own lives and protect their health but we have disempowered them through this legislation by putting the power of negotiation, place of work and so on much more into the hands of the buyer by criminalisation.  Our starting point should have been the health and human rights of sex workers.  Part of the problem with the legislation is that if all sex work is exploitation and there is no room for distinguishing between forced and voluntary sexual activity between consenting adults, in essence, you are saying that all women are victims and that the women or gay men involved do not know their own minds and cannot make a rational decision.  We might not like that decision, it might not be one we would pick for ourselves and it might not be one that those people would pick for themselves if they had an alternative but it is a valid decision and choice for them to make and it is wrong for us to say that they do not have that right or do not know their own minds.  People may say that only a few people are in these circumstances.  Is it the case that minorities do not deserve protection and that just because somebody is in a minority, we should exclude their voice and silence them?  It is completely wrong.</p> <p> Our amendment puts the focus on the sex workers themselves.  A very worrying trend in other jurisdictions that I could see happening here is moneys being diverted into organisations that worked with people to help them exit the industry.  We are all in favour of people exiting the industry when they have choices and alternatives but the problem has been that much of the energy has been taken away from groups engaged in harm reduction which has put people's lives at risk.  This part also needs to be analysed.</p></speech>

That is a good idea.  When we introduce new laws, it is important that we review them on an ongoing basis and come back with recommendations where they might be improved.  It is important that we are not too prescriptive with regard to the legislation in terms of setting out what needs to be done when the review takes place.  I know very many people in the Chamber have strong and certain views about what they think the outcome of this legislation will be.  I think the legislation will be to the benefit of sex workers and Irish society.  I am not certain about that nor am I certain about what the definite consequences of this legislation will be.  I do not think anyone can be sure about what the consequences will be.  For that reason, I think it is important that we leave any report and review open so that things that may happen which we did not expect to happen can be properly considered.</p>  <p>  For that reason, I think the amendment put forward by the Minister is probably the best one.  It states that the review will commence not later than three years after the commencement of this Part.  We need to give legislation some time to settle down in order to get a good overview of its impact.  I know that the Defamation Act 2009 has a review section that provides for a review after five years.  We need to give the legislation some time.  I also note that the amendment put forward by the Minister does take into account some of the concerns referred to by Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Jonathan O'Brien.  Under the Minister's amendment, section 27(2)(b) would provide that the review would conduct an assessment of the impact of the operation of the section on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  An appraisal of people involved in sexual activity for sale will be at the forefront of the review to see the extent to which this legislation has affected them.</p>  <p>  We need a broad overview of that.  We cannot just have a situation where we just review a piece of legislation from the point of view of one or two sex workers.  We have to look at legislation in general to examine its impact on society and whether it has achieved the benefit for which it was designed and introduced and if not, what are the proposals to change it.  With respect to Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Jonathan O'Brien, I think it is appropriate to go along with the amendment put forward by the Minister.  In reality, the difference between all the proposals that are being put before the House is not huge.  I would be concerned that if we had a very detailed section setting out what the reviewing body or section within the Department should do, it would find itself limited to what is set out in the statutory regime.  Any review is better when it is given broad parameters because we do not know with certainty what the consequences will be as a result of the introduction of this legislation.</p></speech>

Essentially, we are meant to cover between five and six very complex amendments in seven minutes.  This needs to be reviewed in light of the practical application of it because I think everybody agrees that this is an extremely complex Bill.  It is unfortunate that many different things ranging from sexual offences to prostitution and sex work have been put into one Bill.  They are huge and complex areas with many differences between them.  To try to speak on particular amendments and the entire Bill in effect in seven minutes is extremely difficult.</p>  <p>  There have been some important progressive changes in this Bill, some of which we argued for.  Examples would be a legal definition of consent, for which rape crisis centres argued; the deletion of the criminalisation of sex workers with regard to loitering, for which many people, including myself, argued; and increasing penalties for criminal gangs which organise trafficking or prostitution.  Those are positive elements in the Bill.</p>  <p>  However, many other amendments for which we have argued have not been taken on board.  For example, there has been no change in the definition of brothel keeping so that one or two sex workers not living off each other's earnings could still be harassed.  Another example is the refusal to rule out going after the finances of sex workers.  The amendments we are approaching will have a bearing on how people vote on the Bill.  In respect of amendment No. 17, there is a difference between what we are proposing and what the Minister is proposing.  The Minister proposes to review the ban on the purchase of sex but not to take up anything broader than that.  Our amendment to amendment No. 17 proposes reporting within two years on arrests and convictions for all existing prostitution-related offences, the new offences created under Part 4 of the Bill dealing with prostitution with information aggregated by gender and offence, the nature and extent of prostitution that may be linked to human trafficking and the impact of all laws on prostitution-related offences and the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.</p><p>We are proposing a much broader review to see what the impact will be, particularly of the criminalising of the purchase of sex.  The Minister has not agreed to that.</p> <p> Amendment No. 21 is extremely important and I will be pressing it.  This amendment calls for a review and an outline of exit services for sex workers who want to get out of prostitution and sex work.  People have suggested this is the Nordic model, of which I have criticisms, but it is not even the Nordic model because that model was accompanied by a number of supports that are not even envisaged by the Bill.</p> <p> I believe that buying sex is an expression of power over another person.  Some 99% of buyers of sex are male; it reflects the gender inequality in society.  Therefore, I would be sympathetic to women, trade unionists and others who are calling for the criminalisation of the purchase of sex.  However, the Bill provides zero exit strategies to accompany that move.  No special measures are being introduced and no social services are in place to ensure that criminalisation does not make conditions more dangerous for sex workers.  On that basis, I cannot support the Bill and will abstain on it.</p> <p> Obviously, we need a transformation in our society's cultural attitudes.  We have a male patriarchal society which objectifies women.  We also have massive economic inequality which leads to many women and vulnerable transgender and LGBT people engaging in prostitution, which will persist until we eradicate those attitudes.  It is very unfortunate that the Minister is not willing to countenance very important amendments and for that reason it is very difficult to support it.  While the Bill contains progressive elements, the Minister should have taken on board the amendments we proposed.</p></speech>

It found that its law was actually leading to sex workers becoming increasingly dependent on traffickers and exploitative third parties.  The number of cases of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation reported in Norway did not change significantly between 2006 and 2014 after the change in the legislation, with 34 cases reported in 2006 and 37 in 2014.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was probably being nice to the Minister in saying that the Government was allowed to review it in less than three years.  However, she would forgive us for suspecting that the Government would wait for the full three years before looking at it.  Given that there are so many issues with the Bill from our point of view and from the point of view of the sex workers, and given the serious lack of sound evidence that the Nordic model has a positive impact on the people it claims to protect, I would rather see it being reviewed no later than two years after enactment.</p>  <p>  The proposed Government report will include information on arrests and convictions made in this regard and an assessment of the impact of the operation of the section on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.  However, no details have been provided on how this assessment will be made or who will be consulted.  We have repeatedly made the point that the voice of sex workers is absent from the Government's work to date, which is disappointing given that this is the very group the Government claims to want to support.  The law should make specific provision to include sex workers and their representative organisations in any review.</p>  <p>  Last night, I mentioned the Queens University survey of sex workers in Northern Ireland, which has been ignored by our Government and sadly also by the Northern Ireland Executive.  Obviously, the findings are not in tune with the ideology driving the legislation down here.  That Queens University report found that 98% of sex workers surveyed opposed the Swedish model; 61% felt this model would make them less safe; and 85% said this legislation would not reduce sex trafficking.  The PSNI also expressed concern that this legislation would be unlikely to be effective against exploitation.  Only 8% of clients surveyed said that criminalisation would stop them paying for sex.</p>  <p>  We should review it earlier.  Too many issues are at play, mostly relating to the fact that the sex workers have not been given any voice.  I reiterate some of their main points.  They insist that the Swedish model negatively impacts on the human rights of sex workers and further pushes people away from the police.  That has to be a big problem.  We are not taking on a harm reduction approach.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said earlier, forcing people to work in isolation cannot be good.  I do not understand the rationale.  People who even use their own home can be addicted and obviously the legislation will not make it safer for immigrants who face the potential of being deported.  Given what we are going into, there does not seem to be much evidence to suggest this is a good idea.  It should be reviewed earlier because it is totally unfair to the sex workers, who also have rights that are sadly being ignored.</p></speech>

Three years is the appropriate time to begin to see the impact; that is the right approach.</p>  <p>  I point out to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that the offence of loitering has been removed from the Bill.  We build in reviews to legislation all the time.  We do not define in legislation all the different aspects of the review.  That would be quite an unusual thing to do, but I am happy to put the following on the record of the House.  Obviously when doing a review of this new offence we would seek submissions from everybody, including those involved in sex work.  I met representatives of the association and heard their views.  People keep repeating that I have not taken into account the views of that group.  I did take them into account, but I still think the approach taken in the legislation is the right one.</p>  <p>  I will not repeat all the research I have used.  Deputy Wallace keeps talking about an online anonymous study that was done; that is one study.  I can quote to him the work of the Swedish Government, and the most recent report from the European Commission done by the University of Lancaster.  I can also quote the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality all of which suggest this is the direction to take.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, we have to review it.  This is a very important issue.  I note there has been much focus on the individual independent sex workers.  There has been a focus by some Deputies, but not by others, on the wider exploitation associated with prostitution which is driven by demand.</p><p>All of those studies refer to reducing the demand and the very close link between human trafficking and prostitution.  We see that repeatedly.  All of the statistics indicate that the vast majority of people involved in prostitution now have been trafficked, and also that they are extremely vulnerable.  I ask Deputies to accept that the review will involve all interested groups including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those involved in helping people to exit prostitution.</p> <p> Deputy Coppinger should know that I have outlined a series of initiatives under the national action plan to support people to exit prostitution.  There is greatly increased funding to the organisations working on the front line.  The Deputy's amendment seems to imply that those supports are not available.  Obviously, they are not written into legislation but all she has to do is look at the website of the Department of Justice and Equality to see the work we are doing.</p> <p> I make the point that the statistics Deputies say they want to insert in the legislation are available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and from the Central Statistics Office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1254" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200026#Z00200"><p>On the Minister's last point about exit strategies, the type of strategies needed genuinely to assist people who want to exit prostitution are financial support, language support and treatment for those who may have an addiction.  A range of supports would be needed to allow those who want to get out of prostitution do so.</p>  <p>  The Minister would argue that the reason criminalisation of the purchase of sex is being introduced is to send a message from society that buying sex is not acceptable, and that it will reduce demand for the purchase of sex.  That is fine but if there are no real ways for people to get out of prostitution, they have to remain in it.  The question arises that if we criminalise the purchase of sex without ways and avenues to help people get out of prostitution, we may make it less safe.  That is a genuine concern.  People are not saying that the buying of sex is wrong, but it is wrong.  That message should be discussed in schools and in workplaces.  It is an expression of power over another human being.  On the idea that 99% of it is male, why are 50% not female?  Obviously, it is related to gender and power in society.</p>  <p>  It is all very well giving money to an organisation but the Minister is not allowing women who, for example, report traffickers, illegality and criminality to be dealt with in a very fair way.  It is very likely, therefore, that it will continue.  In any case, the Minister is not bringing in the Nordic model but if she were, I would look at it in a different way.  I am not surprised by that.  The Irish State does not have a great track record of doing these things for women and ordinary people in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200026#Z00300"><p>The reason we concentrated on those people who engage in sexual activity for the exchange of money on a consensual basis rather than those who were coerced into it is that that is the legislation we are dealing with here today.  Substantial bodies of legislation already exist to deal with people who are coerced or trafficked into this activity.  The Minister, I or other people may not like the fact that some people choose to engage in that activity or the reality that their choice is restricted by their economic circumstances does not make it a less valid choice.  It is a choice people will be making today, tomorrow and the day after that.</p>  <p>  We are putting forward this legislation against the backdrop of the week when the report on consistent poverty levels in Ireland was produced, which showed that the children of lone parents are three times more likely to be in consistent poverty than children who were not the children of lone parents.  Deputy Collins highlighted earlier the statistics on the number of low paid workers in the State.  Economic circumstances are the reasons people end up in prostitution because of the nature of work that is available and their status.  It is laughable to say that giving money to organisations that will tell people to exit the industry will solve that problem.  It will not solve the problem, and the current economic circumstances will mean that more people will be involved in prostitution.</p>  <p>  We urgently need a review of this for the safety and welfare of the people involved.  I would like the Minister to give an indication that she would be prepared to look at it again perhaps in two years rather than three.  The justice committee might work on that and put it in that direction also because that will be critically important into the future.</p></speech>

It states that all the focus is on the sex trade itself, which completely dehumanises the people involved.  It states that we need a human rights based model and that Ireland needs to stop its moralistic crusade of violating the bodily integrity of its citizens and start allowing the full enjoyment of their human rights.</p></speech>

I am very happy to put on the record of the House that I will come back at the end of a two-year period with the most up to date information, including all the information we have on the impact in so far as we have it at that point.  The formal review, however, would be after three years during which we would get the submissions.  Data is available all the time and we will be gathering that together.  As I said, it is available from the CSO and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the justice committee wants to examine this on an ongoing basis, there is no problem with that.  I have to do a formal review after a year anyway so information will be coming together.  To be realistic in terms of impact and examining all the issues, a three-year period is appropriate but it will build on the one-year report and the ongoing statistical information that is available on trafficking and everything else.  I believe that is a reasonable approach to it.</p>  <p>  In terms of the exit strategies and supporting women who are vulnerable who might make a different choice if they had better supports, I would want to see every possible initiative being taken in that regard.  However, it is not just about funding an organisation.  It is about funding the organisation, as we have done in recent times, to put training programmes together that include the point Deputy Coppinger made about language, for example, and skills development, and that an alternative is available.  Increasingly, we are putting supports in place to have that kind of practical initiative so that the exit routes can be clear.  Women find themselves in a very difficult situation when trying to seek an alternative if they have got enmeshed in prostitution or sex work.  There is much talk about free choice.  All the studies indicate that these women often have very little choice for a range of reasons in the variety of circumstances in which they have found themselves over the course of their lives.</p></speech>

Since I joined the D&aacute;il I have been on my feet, along with other Deputies, defending workers' rights, from Luas drivers to teachers to nurses to Tesco workers to Dunnes Stores workers.  There is a system of exploitation of workers that is at the heart of this society and beyond.  This leads to people being impoverished and living in the circumstances exposed by the report on inequality published yesterday.  It leads to people taking measures to find an income which are often distasteful to many of us, not necessarily always distasteful to those who take the measures but distasteful to broader society.  We should not have to see anybody put in this position.  We need far more equality in society and this is not just something that we legislate for by passing nice words, it is how we implement it in deed.  These deeds must be about sharing the wealth and economic opportunities available to anybody.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the exit strategy for those engaged in sex work and the opportunities that should be given to them through education.  Twice yesterday, a serious cohort was mentioned as there is a rise in sex work by students.  If we were to graph it we would probably find a similar trajectory on the graph with the rise of student poverty.  Students are being impoverished because of enormous fees, including registration fees, the lack of grant support and the enormous rents they must pay to be able to live in a city or town to be a student.  Many of them supplement their income with sex work.  I regard the legislation as a whole as being totally inappropriate.  I will vote against it and against the amendment on the three-year report because I do not think it is sufficient.</p></speech>

This boils down to whether or not we support the model proposed by the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and it will be an ongoing debate.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and I would like to see us take up a body of work in this regard.  We hear many different views on whether it works or not and much research has been done.  We will not resolve it here on Report Stage of this legislation.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, as are three other Deputies who are present, I propose the committee examines this issue, including all the research, and issue a report.  I would like to think if this report comes back with information contrary to the Minister's research that it would feed into any report under the legislation.  The drafting and rationale of the legislation is based on the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.  If there is significant research to contradict it the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has an onus to look at it, compile a report and feed it into any report under the legislation.  We will not come to an agreement on whether it is done after three years or two years, but the important work will be done by the committee between now and the report on the outworkings of the legislation.</p></speech>

How much of that is included in the new rural action plan?  Is it old money which is being regurgitated?  There are some serious questions as to what exactly was announced and whether it is the same money.  One cannot pay lip-service to rural Ireland.  It is vital we deal with it in a meaningful and forthright manner.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-02a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020200030#DD00900"><p>Ireland's rural development programme for 2014 to 2020 is co-funded by the EU's European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, or EAFRD, and the national Exchequer.  The total financial allocation for the period is approximately &euro;4 billion, of which EU support amounts to &euro;2.19 billion with the Exchequer funding the remainder.  This significant financial commitment is a key component in our overall strategy to enhance the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieve sustainable management of our natural resources and ensure more balanced development in our rural areas.  The allocation of Exchequer funding is part of and subject to the annual budgetary process.  As part of that process, some &euro;600 million has been allocated to the rural development programme for 2017.  I emphasise that within the structures of the annual budgetary and Estimates process, we are fully committed to the allocation of sufficient Exchequer funding to ensure the full draw-down of the EU co-funded amount over the lifetime of the programme.</p><p>In terms of 2017 funding priorities, the funding allocation of &euro;600 million provides continued support for the following: our flagship environmental scheme, GLAS, which now numbers over 50,000 farmers, and the associated GLAS traditional farm buildings measure; the Burren programme, a locally-led initiative focused specifically on the conservation of the unique farming landscape that is the Burren and a third tranche of which will open in 2017 to bring the number of farmers taking part to approximately 400; areas of natural constraint, or as the Deputy and I know them better, disadvantaged areas, with some  90,000 farmers receiving support because of the constraints to farming which they face; the highly innovative beef data genomics programme with 24,000 active farmers; the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, which funds fully completed on-farm capital investments; knowledge transfer groups which cover some 20,000 participants; targeted training for agricultural advisors and farmers who are engaged in the implementation of the rural development plan; the organic farming scheme, which has over 1,800 beneficiaries; legacy schemes from the previous rural development programme, including AEOS and the early retirement from farming scheme; the collaborative farming measure which contributes to the legal, advisory and financial services costs incurred by farmers in drawing up partnership agreements; technical assistance in respect of, among other things, the running of the national rural network, which promotes and monitors the rural development plan; and support for an evaluation of the GLAS scheme.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As well as continuing to support the schemes that have already been rolled out, two new measures will be introduced and funded in 2017.  Tomorrow is the closing date for applications to the new sheep welfare scheme which provides support of &euro;10 per ewe to farmers who undertake actions aimed at improving flock welfare.  This scheme has been widely welcomed and fulfils a promise made in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Projects under the European Innovation Partnership, EIP, measure will also commence in 2017.  This initiative brings together farmers, researchers, advisors and scientists to look at new and traditional practices, develop ideas and research and co-operate in their own local areas.  Closing dates for tenders and proposals, which included the hen harrier and freshwater pearl mussel projects, have now passed but I am pleased to say that a very significant response has been received.</p><p>In conclusion, I reiterate that I am fully committed to funding the rural development programme and to ensuring that moneys allocated are spent.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the Commission has advised that Ireland well exceeds the EU average in terms of execution of the RDP based on EAFRD spending to 15 October 2016.</p></speech>

The rural development plan must be shown to include completely new funding and not simply represent the rehashing of old budgets.  The budget for the 2015 scheme to help rural villages was &euro;6 million a year, but this did nothing to replace the funding lost under the Leader programme which the former Minister, Phil Hogan, destroyed.  Information provided to me in reply to a parliamentary question suggests that Leader funding has been cut dramatically for the period 2014 to 2020.  There has not been a bob for the last two years.  The funding has been cut by 43% which means that towns and villages in rural areas will lose services relating to child care, rural transport and support for start-up businesses.  Whereas &euro;376 million was allocated under the programme for the period 2007 to 2013, the new programme to cover the period 2014 to 2020 has an allocation of only &euro;220 million.  As such, we are playing with figures.  It is a cut of &euro;156 million.</p></speech>

That is a consequence of the financial climate in which the European Union found itself.  Consequently, the funding for rural development under Leader was reduced significantly.  In response, the Government asked how it could focus its limited resources at the front line in terms of valuable projects in rural areas.  Not without some pain, we decided to cut the administrative side, capping the maximum amount to be spent on administration to drive the maximum amount to the front line for projects.  Consequently, there has been a reorganisation of Leader groups, sweating down the number of organisations and targeting, as much as possible, the front line.  In some areas, local authorities have put additional funding into this.</p><p>The issue may need to be revisited in terms of Exchequer funding, but funding is in place.  It would be better if the Deputy lit a candle rather than cursed the darkness.  A lot of positive things are happening in rural Ireland and the Deputy, who represents a rural constituency, knows that.</p></speech>

There has been a cut of &euro;156 million to Leader funding.  County Tipperary has lost &euro;20 million in Leader funding.  What about other spending on rural environments, such as group water schemes?  In 2011, the Department funded all local authorities to administer the rural water programme to the tune of &euro;70 million.  By 2016 that amount had dropped to &euro;20.9 million, which is an astonishing gap of almost &euro;50 million and the Minister needs to explain that.</p>  <p>  During the same period, in Tipperary alone there was a reduction in payments under the rural water programme of &euro;1.95 million in 2011 to &euro;718,000.  We have been devastated.  The Minister told me to light a candle rather than curse the dark.  The Leader programme has been destroyed.  It was held up as a model all over Europe, but the former Minister, Phil Hogan, destroyed us, and was supported by the Government.  It is only now being restarted.  Nothing has happened in the two years that have elapsed.  Expressions of interest for the Leader scheme close tomorrow in Tipperary.  That is the current situation.  Not a shilling has been provided.</p></speech>

The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socioeconomic factors.  From 2018, eligible areas must instead be designated using a list of biophysical criteria.  In cases where a member state does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must be phased out on a digressive basis.  From Ireland's point of view, this must be avoided.</p>  <p>  Under the new system of designation, which I have said must be introduced in 2018, eligible areas will have to be designated on the basis of biophysical criteria.  The criteria set out in the legislation are: low temperature; dryness; excess soil moisture; limited soil drainage; unfavourable texture and stoniness; shallow rooting depth; poor chemical properties; and steep slopes.  A number of the criteria will not have an impact on the new designation in Ireland, while others will have a small impact.  In effect, the Irish process will be most impacted by soil drainage and soil moisture excess.  The Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data regarding the new criteria.  Department officials have also been in contact with the joint research centre and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, DG Agri, in the EU Commission in regard to technical issues arising.</p>  <p>  Technical work on biophysical criteria in conjunction with the fine tuning and designation of areas of specific constraint processes will produce a new map of areas which are deemed to be eligible.  This designation must be signed off by the JRC and DG Agri.  The process of moving from the current position with the technical work to the agreement of the designation and of the new scheme with the Commission will be complex and detailed.  This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  Once this process is complete, the draft data will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas for ANC.  It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.  </p></speech>

As I am sure he is well aware, there is much concern in the farming community in regard to this review.  The ANC payment can amount to about &euro;4,000 for many farmers across the country.  It is particularly important in more disadvantaged areas.  I hoped that the Minister would be able to give me some new information regarding the process.  We have been aware of what he said.  I hope the Minister can clarify the timeline involved.  When will the maps be published?  Can he give an outline on that today?</p>  <p>  Will there be an appeals system for any farmers who might be excluded?  Would an appeals system and the consultation to which he referred be completed before he goes to the European Commission for approval?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give a commitment that every possible action will be taken by him and the Department to ensure that those who have payments retain them?  It is also important that in the new ANC scheme there is proper funding that reflects the constraints of the land concerned so that farmers on hill land and severely constrained low land receive payments that properly reflect the difficulties involved in farming such areas.</p></speech>

In the programme for Government, we have provided for an additional &euro;25 million in ANC payments in 2018.  I appreciate that will not go all the way to make up the cuts in disadvantaged areas that were introduced when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in government, but it is a step in the right direction.</p>  <p>  The critical timeline is that farmers must have the knowledge of the outcome in order to inform their 2018 basic payment scheme application.  I expect it will be several weeks before we have a draft outline of maps which have the biophysical criteria superimposed on a map of Ireland and which show the areas that are included or excluded.  It is my ambition, in so far as is possible, to ensure that anybody who currently receives a payment holds on to it.</p>  <p>  I cannot definitively say what the biophysical criteria will be.  The State is obliged to apply the new criteria.  As I said, the timeline for the publication of maps which will inform the process will take several weeks.  There will be consultation and an appeals process before there is a final outcome.  The critical timeline is that this matter must be completed to allow sufficient time to make farmers to submit basic payment scheme applications in 2018.</p></speech>

Will it be completed before the Minister submits maps to the Commission for approval?  Can the Minister be crystal clear about that?</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the &euro;25 million allocated for ANCs for next year.  Will he ensure that the money is distributed in a way that ensures those farmers who are farming lands with greater constraints, such as hill lands and severely disadvantaged low lands, will be the chief beneficiaries of the funding?</p>  <p>  The Minister avoided my question on ensuring that the new scheme properly reflects the constraints on land.  The payment currently does not do that.  There are very small differences in the payment per hectare between the three tiers.  It is crucial that the review properly reflects the difficultly of making a profit on poorer land where it is harder to make a margin, and such farmers must be properly compensated.</p></speech>

No decisions have been made with regard to how the additional &euro;25 million will be spent in 2018.  The funding is additional to current payments.  As it said, there will be an appeals system and engagement with stakeholders.  That will come within the confines set out by the European Commission in terms of the biophysical criteria.  We are several weeks away from having an outline of the outcome of such criteria, which are clearly laid down in EU directives.  I outlined them at the start of my response.  There will be engagement with stakeholders.  It is my ambition and that of my Department, officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, to ensure that what we have we hold this regard.</p></speech>

The decision to include agricultural education as an objective criteria for the national reserve and young farmers schemes has been consistently endorsed by this group as it provides assurance that the funding for these schemes is made available to bona fide young and trained farmers.  Otherwise, the funding could be allocated to non-farming landowners.</p><p>Persons who meet the definition of &quot;young farmer&quot; receive significant benefits in terms of preferential access to the national reserve and also in terms of qualifying for an additional payment under the young farmers scheme.  Similarly, the category of &quot;new entrant&quot; provides preferential access to the national reserve for farmers who are establishing their holding for the first time or have established their holding in the previous two years but who cannot avail of the young farmer category due to their age.</p><p>To ensure that the benefits of the young farmer and new entrant categories are targeted at those who had a genuine interest in farming as a career, successful applicants are required to have completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent.  This requirement, endorsed by the direct payments advisory committee, receives wide support as it ensures that payments from the national reserve, which are in effect funded by cuts to the entitlements of other farmers, are targeted at bona fide young farmers and new entrants to farming.</p><p>The requirement in respect of a FETAC level 6 agricultural educational qualification, when combined with the high demand for places on agricultural courses, gave rise to a significant demand and created a challenge for the agricultural educational sector in 2015.  The Department was aware of many prospective applicants who had an interest in pursuing such an agricultural course but may have experienced difficulty in achieving the completed educational qualifications in time to qualify for the 2015 young farmer and national reserve schemes.  To ensure that no such young farmer or new entrant would be excluded from the benefits of these schemes, my Department announced increased flexibility regarding the timelines for achieving the required educational qualifications.  It was decided that any person who met the other eligibility criteria for the relevant schemes and who commenced a qualified agricultural course anytime up to and including September 2016 would be accepted under the national reserve and young farmers schemes in 2015.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational eligibility criteria being applied to the national reserve and young farmers schemes, and the increased flexibility in regard to same.  The EU Commission subsequently advised Ireland that the flexible arrangements that would allow an applicant to commence their agricultural education after the date of submission of an application under the national reserve and-or young farmers schemes did not fit with the &quot;annual logic of the direct payments&quot; and creates a risk of being contrary to EU regulations governing the operation of the scheme.</p><p>To ensure that farmers would not be disadvantaged by this ruling and to comply with the notification from the EU Commission, thus avoiding the risk of a financial correction for Ireland, extensive efforts were put in place by my Department, Teagasc and other agricultural education course providers.  This resulted in applicants to the 2015 national reserve and young farmers schemes being provided with a placement on an agricultural education course prior to 31 December 2015.  All applicants who commenced their agricultural education course by end-2015 were deemed to have fulfilled the agricultural education requirements for the national reserve and young farmers scheme in 2015.  To have enrolled but not commenced an agricultural education course would not be sufficient to comply with the requirement for &quot;appropriate education&quot;.</p><p>Similarly, for the 2016 young farmers scheme, successful applicants were required to have commenced their agricultural education by the closing date for the scheme.  There was no requirement to have the agricultural education course completed in 2016.</p></speech>

He said the EU Commission had stated that there was an issue with applicants commencing their agricultural education on a date after that on which they submitted the application for the national reserve and that they were excluded from the scheme if they had not commenced it beforehand.  Up to now, the Minister and those in his Department have blamed entirely the EU for the situation, but the EU is not and has never been the problem.  The Minister is now admitting that the EU is not behind it but the direct payments advisory committee which has agreed it in the past.  The truth is that the Department, if it wanted to, could change these rules.  It could make this flexible and accessible and offer opportunity to young farmers.  If the agriculture sector is going to go anywhere in this country, there must be opportunity for young farmers to enter it.  We all agree that that is the reality.  Rather than being angry, most people are disappointed to see that our Department and Government are finding ways to block and stop farmers.  That needs to change.  We need to find a way to ensure that we create the maximum amount of opportunity for farmers to complete the green cert so that they can move forward.</p></speech>

There are 450 young farmers in the Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal area doing the course at the moment.  Some 50% of the tutors employed by Teagasc are now awaiting the renewal of their contracts.

We have to notify the Commission that it is an additional requirement that we are imposing so that our requirements are compatible with its requirements.  The Commission has always approved the requirements that we, exercising a domestic competence, add to its requirements.  We cannot do anything that would be incompatible with its regulations.  Our requirements in terms of educational attainment are and have always been domestic and have always been endorsed by the advisory group that advises the Minister on these matters.  That group comprises the farming organisations, which have always agreed with those requirements.  The national reserve is a scarce and valuable resource, but it is not the Department's resource.  It is made up of farmers' resources.  If we make this entitlement available to other farmers, it comes, by virtue of a linear cut, from everyone else's entitlements.  It is a valuable entitlement that is much sought after, so it is only fair that we have objective criteria in terms of active farmers, farm income and educational qualifications to ensure that it is directed at those who are active farmers.</p></speech>

The opportunity exists to create the flexibility to allow more farmers to enter it.  Most farmers from all walks of life will accept that the problem is that we do not have a national reserve.  The mechanism to get one, where if a farmer sells his or her entitlements a certain amount is clawed back, means no one is selling them.  Instead, they are all going into the rental scheme and are being rented out.  That is a problem.  The leasing system is not working.  The Minister needs to review this situation and come up with a way of ensuring that we can establish a national reserve so that young and new farmers and returned emigrants, etc., are afforded an opportunity.  All we are asking for is that that opportunity would be provided.  If the current cap on the level of payments people can receive was lowered to, say, &euro;100,000, which would be more than enough for anyone to survive on, it would create an opportunity to put money into the provision of a national reserve for our young farmers.</p></speech>

These entitlements are a valuable resource that farmers own.  This is not Exchequer funding, so if we want to create a national reserve, we have to take it from other farmers.  In targeting it at others, we have to ensure that we are targeting it appropriately, that is, at active and trained farmers and not at those who are perhaps just landowners who are not active farmers.</p></speech>

This would necessitate a linear cut across payment to all basic payment scheme beneficiaries.  The annual cost of such a measure would exceed &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the greater market orientation of the CAP over recent reforms, including the decoupling of payments from production.  This has provided farmers a measure of income stability from the basic payments scheme while allowing them to adjust production in response to  market demand.</p>  <p>  The beef data and genomics programme is the current main support to the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next six  years.  The programme builds on the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The programme was agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s rural development plan for 2014 to 2020 alongside a number of other schemes such as areas of natural constraints scheme, GLAS and TAMS, which also benefit suckler farmers.  I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme is having on the Irish suckler herd.  It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the national herd.</p>  <p>  The programme provides support to enable suckler farmers to improve efficiency and profitability by improving the overall genetic merit of their beef herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver tangible long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme and for farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is also a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s well-established reputation as a producer of sustainable, high-quality beef.</p><p>On a possible re-opening of the scheme, this is being considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the rural development programme and the potential impact on the scheme and other schemes.  It should also be noted that support under rural development programme schemes can only be provided on the basis of costs incurred or income forgone.  Even if it were possible to reallocate resources from within the programme, any increase in the level of payment to participants in the beef data and genomics programme would require the Department to submit an amendment of the rural development programme to the European Commission and an evaluation and approval by the relevant directorates general.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>Even if a revised scheme were approved, any increase in the level of payment would inevitably result in additional actions being required to be carried out by farmers.<br/><br/>The Department will continue to keep expenditure under the rural development programme under review on an ongoing basis.  As with all such programmes, there are inevitably issues of timing around the scheduling of payments.  Savings in one year do not necessarily imply savings over the lifetime of the programme.<br/><br/>The provision of support for the suckler sector is critically important.  The range of supports as currently configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and rural development measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability.  It is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supports into the future.</p></speech>

All politicians should work with the farming community to ensure supports are introduced to sustain the national suckler herd.  The average income of the 64,000 farmers who produce calves from the suckler herd is &euro;13,000.  Unfortunately, they depend entirely on farm payments under the rural development programme and basic payment scheme.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the beef data and genomics programme.  The original commitment was to open the programme to 35,000 farmers but it was closed when the figure reached 23,000.  Will the Minister indicate when the scheme will re-open?</p>  <p>  Teagasc has indicated it costs between &euro;4 and &euro;4.50 to produce 1 kg of beef, yet farmers are being paid only &euro;3.90 per kilogram.  The beef sector is especially vulnerable to Brexit as 50% of the beef produced here is exported to the United Kingdom.  It is crucial that the Minister show a willingness to introduce the supports required to sustain the suckler herd. </p></speech>

While I acknowledge the sector has had a difficult year, the Deputy comfortably avoided the issue of where this funding would be found.  He indicated it should be allocated from the rural development programme.  It must be borne in mind that we have expenditure lines that extend until the completion of the programme which means all available funding will be drawn down under current schemes.  If the Deputy wants me to allocate &euro;200 million from the programme to the beef sector, he must indicate from which scheme I should take this money.  Should I take it from the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, or disadvantaged areas scheme?  Should I abolish the sheep scheme?</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is not suggesting I should allocate &euro;200 million from the rural development programme and Pillar 2, he should state whether I should cut every farm payment under Pillar 1 to secure &euro;200 million in savings to be reallocated to beef farmers.  That is the uncomfortable choice that would have to be made. </p>  <p>  A third choice, to provide Exchequer funding of &euro;200 million, is a non-runner because of state aid rules.  We do not have &euro;200 million to spare in any case.  If the Deputy asks for funding of &euro;200 million, he must be specific about where it should come from.  There is no plan to leave unspent moneys in the Common Agricultural Policy.  While an underspend may arise in a given year, contractual obligations roll over.  We are still making payments under the previous rural development programme, for example, under the early retirement and agri-environment options schemes.  I have repeatedly made the point, although the Deputy does not appear to accept it, that schemes do not run precisely concurrently with the five year programme but contracts must be honoured over five years.</p></speech>

I have stated on several occasions that the Department is significantly underspending the allocation for the rural development programme.  As matters stand, the Department is on course to record an underspend of &euro;400 million in GLAS by the end of 2020.  That figure is based on information provided by the Minister in a written answer.  If he does the maths, he will see it is correct.</p>  <p>  I outlined the reasons for re-opening the current beef data and genomics programme.  The Minister gave a commitment that the scheme would be open for 35,000 farmers, yet it closed when 23,000 farmers had joined.  There has also been a major underspend in that programme, which could be re-opened tomorrow if the Minister was willing to do so. </p>  <p>  We have to recognise the pressure the suckler herd is under and ensure we are prepared for the challenge presented by Brexit.  We must also ensure export markets, specifically for live exports, are re-opened, and we need to reduce administrative costs, specifically the &euro;8 administrative cost of exporting a calf.  It is also crucial that the Department provide additional support in the form of a suckler payment of &euro;200.

The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, promised a new marine strategy.  I understand the Minister recently approved applications for a large number of new aquaculture licences in County Donegal of which no one was aware.  A single advertisement was placed in a newspaper in August and a notice placed in a Garda station was missed by members of the local community.  To take the example of Gweedore Bay, there will be a 700% increase in the area being given over to oyster farming.  This is a major issue for the local community.  Why did the Minister not seek an environmental impact statement on the proposed development?  How can he justify a planning approach in which the local community is not consulted?</p></reply>

The assessment process takes full account of all national and EU legislative requirements and reflects the full scientific, environmental, legal, public policy and engineering aspects of each application, including the specific production system proposed in each case.</p><p>On recent licensing decisions, my Department received a number of new aquaculture applications which relate to the cultivation of pacific oysters on Braade Strand, Gweedore Bay.  These applications were considered by my Department in accordance with the applicable legislation which includes a period of statutory and general public consultation.</p><p>In the case of shellfish cultivation, an environmental impact statement is required if it is considered that the proposed aquaculture is likely to have significant effects on the environment.  To facilitate this, my Department has established a screening group of officials drawn from my Department, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to advise on the environmental issues relating to each application by reference to national and EU environmental requirements.  This procedure is adhered to fully in respect of all applicable licence applications.  It was determined that an environmental impact statement was not required in the case of the applications in question and the reason for my decision on this aspect of the applications is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>A public notice in respect of the public consultation phase of the licensing process was placed in the<i>Donegal Democrat</i>and the details of the applications were available for scrutiny by the public at specific Garda stations in accordance with the applicable legislation.  Details of applications were also available on my Department&rsquo;s website during the public consultation phase.</p><p>Following consideration of all aspects of the applications by my Department, it was determined that licences should be granted.  A public notice of the decisions was published in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>in December 2016 and the reasons for them are set out on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The legislation governing aquaculture licensing also provides for an appeals mechanism.  Appeals against licence decisions are a matter for the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB, which is an independent statutory body.  My Department understands that the board is in receipt of a number of appeals in respect of these licence decisions.  As appeals are considered by the ALAB as part of a statutory process, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>My Department is also considering a number of new licence applications and also applications for renewal of existing licences in this area.  In some of these cases, the public consultation period is now closed.  In all cases, a licence determination will only be made following consideration of the environmental, legal and public policy aspects of each case.  As my Department&rsquo;s examination of these cases is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on these cases.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I have established an independent aquaculture licensing review group which is currently holding a public consultation to invite submissions on matters relevant to the review.  This public consultation will remain open until 10 February and I encourage all stakeholders to engage in the process and make submissions to support the group in its work.</p></speech>

In my constituency, a pedestrian zone proposed for College Green required an environmental impact statement.  The site affected in Gweedore Bay, one of 45 locations where it was decided an environmental impact statement was not necessary, covers 99 acres and is the most sensitive and beautiful place in the world.  County Donegal is the coolest county in the world and the airport at Carrickfinn, which was voted one of the most scenic airports in the world, is located directly beside Gweedore Bay.</p><p>It is an area of huge cultural importance in terms of the Irish language, fisheries and tourism.  This is an incredibly sensitive site and a huge development.  It beggars belief.  I believe it will run counter to European regulations that an environmental impact statement, EIS, was not considered.  Does the Minister have the scope to direct the appeals board that in this instance an EIS be carried out and to commence proper consultation on this matter.  As I said, there was no consultation in this case because nobody saw the advertisement.  This is not in line with the Taoiseach's statement today in regard to the need for proper community involvement.</p></speech>

In this instance, as is provided for in the process of assessment of applications, the advice was taken on board.  The experts made their recommendations and I abided by them.  I have no doubt that had I done otherwise the Deputy would be excoriating me for not having done so.  It is important that when we appoint people with expertise and they give advice, we assess that advice and proceed accordingly.  I brought my own independent assessment of that to bear and I am satisfied in that regard.  There is an appeals process under way and so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter.  I did take the advice of experts on board in this regard.</p>  <p>  I also point out that prior to Christmas I appointed a three-person review group to review the aquaculture licensing process because I am convinced that it can be a better and more transparent system.  While not wishing to hidebound the people who are charged with that responsibility, they are eminent people who bring a range of expertise to bear on this issue.  It is unsatisfactory that some licence applications take several years to determine.  We have a land-based planning system in respect of which applications can be determined in several months while licensing applications in this area often take several years.  As I said, a review of the system is under way.</p></speech>

I have seen aquaculture licensing which beggars belief in terms of what was allowed to happen.  As the Minister said, the process is not working for anyone.  This community is not opposed to the development of oyster farming in the area, rather it is opposed to the scale of the proposed development without any proper consultation.  The Minister's job is on occasion to say to the experts that he has a different political perception in terms of community involvement.  The massive scale of development in Donegal on this site should have set alarm bells ringing for the Minister, even if the argument of the experts was to the effect that such developments have been always nodded through without an EIS.  In this instance, the Minister should have stood up and said that was not in accordance with the new culture of consultation, openness and transparency in terms of protecting the environment.  I do not know if the Minister has ever flown into Carrickfinn or spent time there as it is a long way from north-west Cork.  There is no other site that is more important culturally, environmentally or otherwise.  At the very least, an EIS should be carried out and there should be proper consultation on this matter.  Hopefully, as a result of this debate the appeals committee will see sense and start that process so that the community is brought on board and we protect our very precious environment.</p></speech>

They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancement of biodiversity, water quality and mitigation of future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices in a sustainable manner.  To date, support valued at over &euro;120 million has been provided to Irish farmers in respect of 2016 payments under these schemes.</p><p>The number of farmers active in GLAS is almost 37,500, of which 25,825 are in GLAS 1 and 11,667 are in GLAS 2.  Almost 20,000 farmers in GLAS 1 and almost 8,700 farmers in GLAS 2 have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued in these cases.  The balancing payment due to farmers who have received 85% of their 2016 payment will issue later in the year when the last of the required on-the-spot inspections have been initiated.  The most recent payments issued on 30 January 2017, with &euro;4.2 million issuing to just under 1,200 participants. </p><p>The year, 2016, was an exceptionally busy one as an additional 11,500 farmers were processed to approval in GLAS 2 and a further 14,000 new applications were submitted under tranche 3 and are currently being processed to approval stage with a view to increasing the overall numbers in the scheme to in excess of 50,000 scheme participants from 1 January 2017.  It is acknowledged that payment targets have not been fully met, with under 3,000 GLAS 1 and under 6,000 GLAS 2 payments remaining to be fully processed.  This is due, in the main, to unanticipated outcomes of the checks required to be carried out on each individual application.</p><p>Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are delayed due to a variety of issues, including declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the basic payment scheme, BPS, application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen, including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 BPS; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on low-emission slurry declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans; and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Just over 8,615 farmers in the agri-environment options scheme are due a payment in respect of 2016.  Payment has issued to 6,020 AEOS farmers, with almost 2,600 remaining to be paid.  As in the case of GLAS, the AEOS 2016 payments are issued in two parts, with an advance payment of 85% and the remaining 15% issuing thereafter.  The most recent payments issued on 31 January 2017, when over &euro;850,000 issued to just under 350 participants.  Payments will continue to be made on a regular basis as files are cleared.</p><p>Outstanding payments under AEOS 2 are largely delayed due to rechecks which must be completed on payments made for all scheme years before the final contract payment can be processed.  Outstanding payments under AEOS 3 are delayed by stocking density checks.  Farmers had until 31 December 2015 to meet their stocking density on commonages and a density check must be completed before payment can issue.</p><p>I also point out that a number of payments under both schemes are held up due to incomplete documentation and all participants are reminded to submit any outstanding documentation as soon as possible to facilitate payment.  Payments under both schemes will continue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.</p></speech>

I asked the Minister for specifics on why this has happened.  According to the Minister's reply, the Department was unable to process approximately 9,000 of the 37,000 applications because there were errors or issues with them.  Farmers only learn about such errors or issues after they have failed to receive their payments.  I do not accept that there could be 9,000 applications in respect of which administrative errors arose such that the Department has been unable to process them thus far.</p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on what IT issues fed into the delay in terms of processing payments.  What are the IT problems and why were they not identified and dealt with sooner by the Minister?  Many of the farmers concerned are due an average payment of &euro;4,500, which they had banked on having before Christmas but they still have not received their payments.  This matter needs to be sorted out immediately.  I would also welcome a full explanation today from the Minister in terms of his oversight of this mess.</p></speech>

I am not pointing the finger at anybody.  When my Department hit the "pay" button in respect of GLAS, some applications did not get through the system.  In terms of what needs to happen now, all of the outstanding applications will have to be scrutinised.  The problems presenting relate to compatibility between GLAS actions and plots submitted under basic payment scheme applications and so on.  Very often a bespoke IT solution is required to address these issues.  It is, unfortunately, a slow process but the issues are being worked through as quickly as possible.  Neither I nor my Department has a vested interest in delaying payments to farmers.  We are working flat out to resolve this issue.</p><p>I wish I were in a position to give a definitive timeline for when it can be resolved.  I assure the Deputy it is not an issue of resources within the Department, nor is it an issue of pointing fingers.  The issues that arose when the payments did not proceed are such that we have to eyeball every application that did not go through.  We have to identify the reason each payment did not go through and then find IT solutions to enable payments to go through.</p></speech>

One should not need to come up with bespoke amendments to the IT system to try to deal with the job that must be done by it.  As I stated, there are 9,000 farmers in GLAS still awaiting payment, and there are 4,000 farmers in the AEOS whom I understand have not been paid yet.  These are farmers whom the Department promised would be paid back in October.  To say this is not a resources issue just does not stand up.  To say the position on the IT system is acceptable does not stand up either.  If the Department had been seeking to pay the moneys back in October and the Minister had been working to ensure this, these issues would have been spotted then.  It was only after the payment was not made that the Minister sought to inform farmers there was a issue and to try to rectify it.</p>  <p>  Farmers are waiting for 85% of their payments.  Is it possible that the Minister could seek sanction from the European Union to pay the farmers the 85%, for which they are so desperately waiting, and then work through the issues that exist?  The Minister is telling me the applications have to be eyeballed one by one and that the resources are all in place to do so.  Unfortunately, this will go on for weeks or months unless the Minister gets a handle on it and finds a mechanism to pay the farmers, many of whom are in desperate financial circumstances because they were expecting to be paid months ago.</p></speech>

In many respects, when one is explaining one is losing.  I must be fair to the staff in the Department.  We must be fair to everybody, including staff and farmers.  Farmers are owed their money.  We are contractually bound to pay them and will do so.  We are working through a difficult set of circumstances, however, and it is not a resource issue.  It is neither an administrative resource issue nor an IT resource issue.  We simply have to eyeball each of the individual applications that are presented as a challenge to get them through our system.  We are doing that.  Staff are working flat out on it.  It is a logistical issue, not a resource issue.  I appreciate that the Deputy wants to spin a narrative of under-expenditure and deliberate under-expenditure.  With regard to the difficulty that farmers are in at present, I acknowledge that if one is waiting for several thousand euro it presents a difficulty.  I assure the Deputy that we are doing everything we can to resolve this matter.</p></speech>

Greyhound racing is a traditional industry that plays an integral role in rural society and the economy.  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of both the greyhound and horse racing industries for our country and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives down through the years. </p>  <p>  In 2010 a report by Jim Power Economics, commissioned by  Bord na gCon, estimated that the greyhound racing industry was responsible for sustaining in excess of 10,000 full and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities, and injected an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies.  The greyhound breeding industry is very export orientated, with over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.</p>  <p>  Since 2002, well in excess of 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  Annual attendances at greyhound race meetings have declined over the course of the recession.  Greyhound racing was not immune from the impact of the downturn and, in particular, the reduction in consumer disposable income, emigration and the collapse in the construction industry.  Over the period of the recession, Government support for the industry was reduced significantly, which coincided with the effects of the economic downturn.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that consumers and fans of greyhound racing are now consuming the sport differently.  With the growth in social media and online distribution of racing generally, audience engagement is expanding.  The board states attendance at greyhound stadia has stabilised in more recent times and saw an increase of 1% in 2016.</p></speech>

Although there was a slight decrease in the allocation during the recessionary budgets, since 2014 the allocations have been on the increase.  I include 2015 and 2016.  In 2006, some 1.25 million people were attending per annum but since 2008 the number has been decreasing.  In 2015, some 600,000 people attended.  The number of meetings has also decreased by over 500.  Sponsorship is falling, as is the number of greyhound owners.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister clarify whether the Irish Greyhound Board has published its 2015 accounts?  If so, are they available publicly?  Is the Government compensating for the drops in attendance, the number of meetings, sponsorship and the number of owners by increasing the funding?  Could the Minister of State clarify the number employed in the industry?  The figure of 10,000 from 2010 seems a little excessive.  How much do the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club contribute to the welfare of the greyhounds that are abandoned?</p></speech>

There are problems in the greyhound industry.  During the term of the last D&aacute;il, the agriculture committee produced a report on it and made recommendations.  One point made was that we need new robust legislation, which will be introduced shortly.  I hope to have it agreed by the Cabinet so it can be forwarded to the current agriculture committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It will provide for better governance, financial structures, control and regulation.  Greater consumer participation is required but this must be based on confidence.  If we simply say we should pull the money in the industry because it is in decline, it is contrary to most principles.  If something is in need of assistance, we should continue to support it so that, in time, it can operate independently.  This is a critical juncture.  It is up to all participants and the greyhound industry itself to engage in this and ensure the industry has a future.</p>  <p>  As for the numbers, maybe there is a question over the figure from 2010, but the industry is certainly still a significant contributor to rural communities.</p></speech>

I hope the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board are very much separated.  I know greyhound owners who keep their dogs for racing do not agree with live hare coursing, yet their fees are going towards supporting it.  This has to be clarified.</p>  <p>  Live hare coursing started in Clonmel last week.  RTE showed a clip of it.  It said before showing it that it would be too disturbing for some viewers.  It showed a censored version.  When some people rang up to find out why it was censored, they were told the footage was too bad to show.  If the full, uncensored clip had been shown, it would have shown the greyhounds tossing the hares and mauling them.  It would really have shown what live hare coursing also includes.</p>  <p>  I hope that on foot of the Minister of State's report, there can be a separation between the two bodies.  How much exactly has the Irish Greyhound Board given to the Irish Coursing Club over recent years in loans and payments?</p></speech>

I did not attend the national coursing championships in Clonmel but I understand no hares were killed in them.  Whether that answers the Deputy's question, I do not know.</p><p>If the Deputy was to ask the coursing club and the greyhound board whether they wanted to stay separate, they would probably agree with her, in that they want clear and distinct lines between their roles and functions.  Some greyhound owners might prefer there to be no live coursing, but others do not.  Animal protection is governed by other legislation, by the way, primarily in animal health and welfare legislation.</p> <p> Coursing is not everyone's cup of tea, but it is part of the tradition.  It is easy to sit up here in Dublin and judge people, but people in Dublin do things that are not always compatible with country life either, and I do not hear people in the country being quite so judgmental.</p></speech>

During preparations by ICES for the upcoming benchmark, an error was discovered in the calculation of the northern trawl survey index for 2016 that resulted in values being overestimated.  Thus, the assessment conducted during the 2016 ICES working group and used as the basis for the 2017 advice released on 30 September 2016 overestimated the stock size.</p><p>Updated northern trawl survey index values have been calculated and a new assessment and forecast have been carried out by ICES.  Based on this work, new advice for 2017 was issued by ICES on Thursday, 26 January.  According to the Marine Institute, the updated advice is 9% lower than the initial advice for 2017, that is, 926,936 tonnes versus 1,020,996 tonnes.</p><p>The original advice for 2017 was for a 14% increase on that for 2016 and it was on this that the 2017 coastal states agreement was based.  Subsequent to that agreement, Ministers confirmed the EU total allowable catch, TAC, and individual EU member state quotas at the December Fisheries Council.  That decision has been given legal effect by the new TAC and quota regulations for 2017.</p><p>It is expected that the matter may be considered, probably informally, at coastal state level involving the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands.  At European level, the right of initiative rests with the European Commission.  If there is support for amending the TAC at coastal state level, it will require a formal agreement.  Following any such revised agreement, an amendment to the EU TAC and quotas would require a proposal from the European Commission and the European Council's adoption of the amending EU regulation.  The Commission has not yet commented publicly on the new advice and a new ICES benchmark assessment for north-east Atlantic mackerel is due next month.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Any amendment to the EU TAC and Ireland's mackerel quota that may be determined by the EU Fisheries Council will be taken into account as part of my consideration of the review.  This review relates to the allocation between the RSW pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment in respect of the increased mackerel quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments.  All relevant issues will be carefully evaluated and consideration given to submissions made in this consultation before I decide if any amendment to the policy is justified for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishery.</p></speech>

They make significant investments and create jobs at sea and ashore.  They must have something definite.

On foot of that proposal and correspondence, of which I received from much, I decided to put the proposal into formal consultation.

Do we revert to the quota under the revised ICES advice or will he propose to Europe to leave it until next year, which would be a double-edged sword?

As I said, my ambition is to try to ensure that every farmer who has a payment retains it, whether that is in County Meath, County Donegal, County Cork, County Tipperary, County Kilkenny, County Wicklow or anywhere else.  It is a critical part of agricultural income and household budgeting in respect of the farmers concerned and for obvious reasons, therefore, we are anxious to hold what we have.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, the position of CEO of the Irish National Stud is currently up for grabs and I hope the Minister can reassure me that the code of practice for governance of State bodies, in particular with regard to stipulation of a single non-renewable term, will be invoked in this situation because there is a perception at large that there is a bit of a clique in operation at the moment.</p></reply>

The Irish National Stud is a commercial State body.  The appointment of a chief executive officer is a matter for the board of the Irish National Stud, subject to the consent of the relevant Ministers.  I understand a recruitment competition is currently under way.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the board has its own obligations in relation to compliance with corporate governance standards.  My Department has arrangements in place to monitor the activities of State bodies and ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p>  <p>  I understand the current CEO of the Irish National Stud has announced that he is stepping down from the position.  I am aware that he has done an excellent job as CEO of the stud and I wish to add my voice to the many tributes that are rightly being paid to him.  I understand that the INS board may request a temporary extension to the current CEO's contract to facilitate a smooth transition to a new CEO and I am open to considering that in line with Government policy and guidelines.  I am sure the Deputy would wish to acknowledge the CEO's contribution as well.</p></speech>

Horse racing has been called into serious disrepute due to the handling of the previous CEO's appointment.  I am concerned to ensure that such a debacle is not repeated in this instance.  I take heart from the fact the Minister has told me the position will not be filled by the current CEO who has just finished his term of office.  I remind the Minister that the code of practice is there for very good reasons.  Only a very small number of CEO positions are filled beyond the five or seven year term.  Is the Minister saying the current CEO will not take up the new position and has not put his name forward for reappointment?  The Minister mentioned he wishes to ensure a smooth transition but I do not know why provision was not made for that, given that the incumbent was well aware when his contract was due to terminate.  Will the Minister assure us the transition period would only be for a matter of a month or two?  Anything more than that would call into question governance issues and compliance with the code of practice.</p></speech>

We in this House have a duty to deal much more in reality than perception.  On that basis and in light of what the Minister has just said, I put on record my appreciation to the outgoing CEO for a remarkable contribution to the running of the National Stud.  One only has to look at the figures in terms of tourism, the equine industry and the overall figures relating to the state the National Stud was in when he took it over compared to the way he leaves it now.  It is a credit to him and he deserves great credit for that.</p></speech>

He addressed far more eloquently than I the track record of the outgoing CEO.  It is insightful to look at the state of the National Stud when the CEO was appointed and its current financial state.  Actions speak louder than words and his actions have been a tribute to the industry, which he leaves in a far better state than he found it.  I acknowledge his contribution.</p>  <p>  Appointments are, in the first instance, an issue for the board.  The CEO has indicated that he does not wish to apply for the position.  There will be a recruitment campaign and in order to ensure a smooth transition, we are open to considering a transition period.  That is something which will be negotiated with the board.  I do not envisage that being a problem.</p></speech>

I am pleased the Minister said the outgoing CEO will not continue in the position.  The recruitment process is already well under way.  The gentleman's contract has expired.  The question I asked the Minister is how long he is prepared to extend the contract and when can we expect the vacancy to be filled in line with the code of practice for appointments to State boards, which specifies that a different person would take up the position.</p></speech>

This question also relates to Horse Racing Ireland, which was the subject of much attention over the debacle surrounding the reappointment of Brian Kavanagh.  We had the board members before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to say they made an absolute show of themselves is probably a gross understatement.  It was quite clear that what the board requires is strong independent intervention and for there to be independent regulation of the industry.  Subsequent to that, why did the Minister appoint to the board two people with a very developed connection to Coolmore rather than individuals with an independent background?</p></reply>

That is obvious and well known.  The people the Minister appointed happen to be people with very developed connections to Coolmore Stud.  There is a belief, which is not an abstract one, that there is an excessive influence by big players in the market.  The Minister might like to comment on some of the crises around horse racing, for example, the foal levy, which is crippling small owners.  There was an important court case in Naas last week where an owner who had won a case was met by the top legal establishment, if one likes, who was marshalled there by Horse Racing Ireland, to get the decision overturned.  We know, for example, that it has a big impact on small owners.</p><p>The Minister might like to comment on the fact that it is widely known that foals at a major stud in Kildare are registered in the UK where the fees are lower and an arrangement for a contribution is made to HRI despite the fact that under regulations, any foals born in Ireland must be registered in Ireland.  Unhelpful and wrong practices are taking place and the Minister needs strong people on the board.  Why is he putting in insiders to police themselves?</p></speech>

I do not propose to trespass on the findings of the courts on such matters in recent days other than to acknowledge the outcome.  There is separation of powers, which the Deputy may not wish to recognise but I do.</p>  <p>  There are 13 members of the board of HRI and the board is representative of all sectoral interests, including workers in the industry, race courses, trainers and owners.  The board is so constructed as to ensure there is an adequate voice available to all the interested parties.  The Deputy has come in here and unfairly and without substantiation cast aspersions on the most recent appointees to the board.  I think the Deputy should reflect on this.  She has made scurrilous, spurious and unsubstantiated against two board members and I do not intend to dignify them other than to say that the appointments were made in accordance with the Public Appointments Service and in accordance with the criteria laid down.</p></speech>

What I put to the Minister as the Minister who appointed them is that he has a requirement to secure independent oversight of an industry that is self-regulatory and, in fact, non-regulatory.  I did not pass any judgment.  Under the foal levy, small owners have to pay a 3% levy to HRI that is based not on the fee they paid, but on the advertised fee, which means that small people are being fleeced for the enrichment of HRI while the big boys, who dominate the HRI board and do so now in even greater numbers, are not affected because the ceiling is set at &euro;30,000.  If the Minister thinks everything in the industry is great, I put it to him that he is about the only one in the country who does.</p></speech>

I am absolutely satisfied that the people who were appointed are more than well qualified to bring a unique and very valuable set of skills in respect of corporate governance and affairs and human resources experience to the board, of which the Deputy has been very critical in the past arguing that it did not have sufficient knowledge in the area of corporate governance.</p></speech>

I am happy to advise the Deputy that between the years 2011 and 2016, as part of my Department's fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme, in excess of &euro;6.7 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, notwithstanding the challenging economic environment in which we operate.  I will shortly be announcing further support under the 2017 capital programme.</p>  <p>  With regard to the possibility of a dredging project in Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, I advise the Deputy that the report from a site investigation works, which was commissioned in 2015, was received by my Department in March 2016.  The report included vital information on the nature of the material to be dredged in any future dredging project.  The information revealed from the site investigation report indicated that certain of the dredge material would not be suitable for conventional disposal at sea.  </p>  <p>  In June 2016, a firm of consulting engineers were engaged to prepare a report on a potential dredging project at Howth to include the possible scope of the project, various disposal options for the dredged material at Howth and permitting requirements.  This report is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2017.  A draft preliminary report indicating initial dredge quantities and cost estimates is expected by end February 2017.  Depending on the outcome of this process, and as is the case for all developments in the six fishery harbour centres, any possible future dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities.</p></speech>

It is badly needed.  It has not been dredged since 1981 or 1982 so we are talking about nearly four decades.  I remember showing the former Minister's father around when he was a Minister.  It came up even then as one of the issues nearly 20 years ago.  Howth Harbour users action group has been in contact with the Department over many months to ask that this be done.  Howth is the key fishery port on the east coast with a synchrolift repair yard and a lot of activity, but we could have much more activity on the fisheries and marine front, particularly marine tourism, if this work was done.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he would put money into the fisheries local action groups, FLAG, programme.  We are in the north east FLAG.  Is is possible that some of the works the Minister is talking about could be done as part of that?  </p></speech>

I do not wish to prejudge their take on this but I suspect that the expenditure in respect of dredging would be far in excess of the funding they have available - I think it is &euro;2.7 million all across all the FLAGs for 2017.  They are making a call for projects.  I met with representatives from all the marine interests in Howth before Christmas and they made a very compelling case.  It is complicated by the preliminary findings and the contamination.  We will make announcements in the capital programme for 2017.  I suspect it is probably too early on the dredging side.  There is a substantial volume of work to be done and I hope we would be in a position to continue some improvement works in Howth, but perhaps not the dredging project.</p></speech>

The scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  This loan scheme forms part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility, which I announced as part of budget 2017.  Along with tax measures and farm payments, it will alleviate some of the pressures being caused by the recent market difficulties, which have been compounded by the uncertainty around Brexit.</p>  <p>  The loans will be available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers, including mushroom growers, and others involved in primary agricultural production, including poultry producers. The loans will be for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years.  The interest rate at 2.95% will represent a significant saving for farmers when compared with other forms of short-term unsecured finance currently available.  The loans will be flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.</p></speech>
