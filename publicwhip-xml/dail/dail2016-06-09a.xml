In accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on D&aacute;il Reform and the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we will for the first time be making use of the clock.  I call Deputy Michael Moynihan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1283" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900003#A00300"><p>Across the country, families have applied for the home help service for elderly relatives to keep them in their own homes.  However, they are receiving letters stating that while the hours are approved, no funding is available to allocate extra resources.  It seems ludicrous that the HSE is sending out letters approving home help hours, yet it does not have resources to back them up.</p>  <p>  The home help system is a fantastic service which allows people to stay in their own homes, and it encourages them to do so.  However, a cost-benefit analysis of that service does not seem to have been undertaken.  Such an analysis would show how much could be saved by allocating a proper care package and home help service for patients.  For example, it would save the costs involved in providing long-term care in nursing homes. </p>  <p>  Last year, the HSE estimated that 2.2 million extra home help hours would be needed to accommodate the requirements arising from demographic changes in 2016.  Unfortunately, there was nothing in either the HSE's plans or the budget to allocate funding for those home help hours.  On the one hand, the HSE says it is necessary to have these hours in place to accommodate people in their own homes, while, on the other, the Government has not put funding in place for them.  That is ludicrous.  </p>  <p>  The current programme for Government included increased funding for home help and home care packages.  The last programme for Government, from 2011 to 2016, had a similar provision albeit with different wording, yet nothing has been done about it.  Does the Minister accept that there is a crisis concerning home help and home care packages?  We are getting reports that the HSE is dealing with this matter in different ways in various areas.  The HSE says it must wait until somebody ceases looking for home help, or dies, before somebody else can be accommodated through that availability.   </p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware that it is taking six months to process applications for the carer's allowance?  Is he also aware that it can take four or five months to process the simplest medical card application?  Reports by advocacy services, including Age Action Ireland and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, state that there is a crisis out there.  Is the Minister aware of this?  What is on the Government's agenda to tackle this crisis?</p></speech>

Members of the House will appreciate the importance of community-based care.  Yesterday, an announcement was made concerning additional funding for the health service which, significantly, includes additional provision for home help hours.  It is also important to bear in mind, as the Deputy has recognised, that the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase home help hours every year.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will shortly publish the demographic impact on spending in each area.  No doubt the demographic impact on health will include provision, built into the 2017 no-policy-change budget, to deal with the demographic pressures to which the Deputy has referred.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach adverted to the fact that currently there is a 4% annual increase in the number of people over 85.  That clearly creates pressure on areas such as the home help service.  As regards having uniformity across the country, home help has always been organised on a decentralised model.  Part of its strength is that local home help organisers understand their community.  It has, therefore, been organised in a way that seeks to respond flexibly to local needs.  That balance between uniform provision, national planning, diversity and division is part of the service's strength.  It is not something we would want to let go of lightly.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned delays in issuing the carer's allowance, which has been a problem for as long as I have been in politics.  It concerns the complexity of the assessment methods which the Oireachtas has put in place.</p><p>It requires capital and income assessments as well as a medical assessment.  That has been put in place, in the wisdom of the Oireachtas, as a fair way of allocating it, but it does create delays in assessment, which are inevitable with that type of approach.  There is also the carer's benefit for people who are at work and decide to take a break to provide care.  That can be a bridge because it is based on stamps and does not require the same detailed assessment.</p> <p> I will alert the Minister for Health to the Deputy's concerns.  The Minister for Social Protection has responsibility for carer's allowance, but I will alert the Minister for Health about the continuing problems the Deputy mentioned with medical card delays.  I have experienced some improvement in that regard.  Members of the last D&aacute;il travelled out there to see that improved processes were put in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1283" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900004#B00200"><p>It is not acceptable to say that there is a system in place for the carer's allowance and we must work through it.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we are challenged to change that.  If there is a system in place that is bureaucratic and is causing undue hardship for families, we are duty bound to challenge it and ensure it is changed.  Does the Government accept that the home help and home care packages, by any standard of cost-benefit analysis, provide a fantastic service to older people and families and save the State a vast amount of money?  I ask the Minister to do whatever is required with the carer's allowance and medical cards.  With regard to the carer's allowance, it is unacceptable that when a medical report is sent to the Department it can take six to eight weeks for it to be accepted, when any layperson can see that the person concerned is in need of full-time care and attention.  It is not acceptable to say that it is the system.  We must change that system, because families are under savage pressure to keep elderly relatives at home for as long as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900004#B00300"><p>I do not disagree with the Deputy.  Much of the effort of the Oireachtas has gone towards recognising that.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, reminded me, last year we restored the respite care grant to its full value and we have sought to improve home help and home care packages.  In each of the winter initiatives, a substantial improvement in spending on home care occurs.  I agree with the Deputy that we must try to keep as many people as possible living independently in their homes.  I noted from the reports during the week that perhaps we have not emphasised that sufficiently and that there has been too much emphasis on institutional care in cases in which people could have remained independent.  The programme for Government reflects that concern and commits to expanding this area.  We have made a very solid commitment in this regard, even though we are aware that new drugs coming on the market or new procedures will demand attention and resources.  There is a recognition in the programme for Government of the importance of this area of care.</p></speech>

At the end of May, the average cost of renting a home in Dublin was &euro;1,454 per month, which is a staggering &euro;17,500 per year.  That is higher than the highest point reached in 2007.  Outside Dublin, while rents are below the 2007 peak, they are still rising.  I believe we can agree that these rents are scandalous.  Due to the failure of previous Governments to ensure an adequate supply of social and affordable housing, more people are finding themselves reliant on - indeed, trapped in - the private rental sector.  How is a low-income family expected to keep pace with such rents?  How are working families expected to pay these rents and save for a deposit on their own homes at the same time?</p>  <p>  A report from the Homeless Agency shows that spiralling rents is one of the principal causes of family homelessness.  Scores of families will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight because they cannot afford their rent.  Across the State, rent supplement and housing assistance payments lag considerably behind market rents.  Last year, the former Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, were locked in a bitter row over how to deal with rising rents.  The Government set its face against rent certainty.  It refused to link rents to the consumer price index.  Instead, it introduced measures which not only have not worked, but have made matters worse.</p>  <p>  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness has received repeated and strong calls in its hearings and submissions for the introduction of rent certainty and for increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payment levels.  Will the Government include rent certainty in its action plan on housing which is to be published in August?  Second, will the Government ensure there are increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payments to ensure that no family is made homeless due to an inability to pay its rent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900004#B00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It is no secret that the crisis in housing is the biggest issue on the Government's agenda.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has committed to an action plan for housing within the first 100 days.  He has consulted widely with all of the interests, including those referred to by the Deputy, in the preparation of that work.  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness is due to report soon with its input into this debate.</p>  <p>  In terms of the response, many worthwhile initiatives have been put in place in the past, although obviously more must be done.  I agree with the Deputy that there is inadequate supply of both social and private housing.  Much of the rental sector is in the private sector, and the rents the Deputy referred to in the reports are entirely in the private sector.  This is a supply issue and we must see an acceleration of supply both in the social housing programme and in the private sector.  That will be a big feature of what emerges from this.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of the adequacy of rent supplement.  The Department of Social Protection has a protocol in place under which 1,000 families have been assisted in getting higher rent supplement with a higher ceiling to avoid the pressures the Deputy has described.  With regard to the housing assistance payment, a 50% uplift of the payment is being piloted in Dublin and that is making an impact for families who are threatened with becoming homeless.  It is working in some cases but, obviously, there will have to be a tight review to assess its impact.  This area is getting a huge level of Government attention.  There have already been four or five meetings of the Cabinet committee on housing at which all of the issues are being raised.</p>  <p>  Rent certainty was dealt with in a Bill that was passed by the Oireachtas, under which new rules governing rent certainty have been provided.  They provide for a more extended period of notice and there can only be increases in rents every two years.  Those provisions are in place and will be monitored in terms of policy in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900004#B00600"><p>The Minister is correct that it is no secret that there is a crisis in housing.  It is equally no secret that this is a Government-made crisis.  It is also no secret that it took a considerable amount of time for the Government to catch up and recognise the scale of the crisis.</p>  <p>  It is no surprise that the Minister has not answered my questions, so I will put them again.  Will the action plan on housing contain a commitment to rent certainty and increases in rent supplement and housing assistance payments?  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness has met.  It is a cross-party committee and it received reams of submissions from experts across the board.  I seek a commitment from the Minister today that rent certainty and increases in the rent supplement and housing assistance payments will be contained in the action plan.  Should the committee in its final report recommend rent certainty, a link to the consumer price index and increases in those payments, will the Government honour the report, listen to the committee and ensure the recommendations are included in the action plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900005#C00100"><p>In respect of what has caused the housing crisis, it is important to remember that misplaced policies caused a construction boom of unprecedented levels where we built 90,000 houses and had a massive property bubble.  This bubble collapsed with all the ensuing consequences, such as the damage to people's lives and the public finances.  We have been living with that ever since and no system is more broken than that relating to housing provision.  The system is simply broken and must be rebuilt from scratch.</p>  <p>  The Minister will look at all views coming from all parties.  The housing action plan has not yet come to Government for consideration so I have not seen the elements of it.  The committee's recommendations have not yet to come to Government.  The Deputy can rest assured that the Government will look at all elements.</p>  <p>  The rent issue is about supply.  We have inadequate supply and that is what the report today showed.  It showed that the number of properties becoming available for rental has declined at a time when there is an increase in demand.  This has simply put pressure on rents and that imbalance must be corrected before we resolve this crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900005#C00200"><p>Last week, together with my Labour colleague, Joe Costello, I held a series of meetings in Dublin north's inner city with community leaders, business owners, educators, service providers and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As everybody in the House knows, the spotlight is on the north inner city because of gun deaths and the focus on crime.  This is a cause of great frustration for the people who live there who are weary of the periodic focus on their community and the analysis and talk relating to it.  They were anxious that they now be fully involved in finding a permanent solution to which everybody can buy in.</p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, I raised the issue of a joint task force with the Taoiseach.  In response to my query, he indicated that this would happen.  I have a few questions for the Minister.  Where stands the task force?  Who will lead it?  The latter is one of the issues that was raised again and again with me.  It is critical that the local community be fully involved in the design of a solution to all the issues of inequality that prevail in the north inner city.  It could be a model for regeneration and a model of hope.  However, it can only work on the basis that all of us across the various parties - in or out of government and regardless of the vagaries of politics and how the political winds blow over the next decade - commit to signing a solemn pledge, individually as Members of this House, to implement the blueprint for action outlined by this task force.  On behalf of the Government and Fine Gael, will the Minister commit to signing such a pledge for this community, which could become a model for other areas in regeneration, rebuilding and supplanting despair with hope?  Will he also answer the questions relating to the timescale and membership of the task force that the Taoiseach agreed to create?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900005#C00300"><p>I do not have precise answers in respect of the timeframe but I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach is taking this very seriously.  Within the education portfolio, I am looking at areas where we could support initiatives within the north inner city and also, as the Deputy says, in the context of a wider model to examine areas of concentrated disadvantage to see how we can break that cycle.  The concept of working across Departments has come into vogue in the past couple of years.  Examples include the Action Plan for Jobs and the action plan for housing.  The Deputy is right in that we need to form an approach to dealing with concentrated urban deprivation in particular in a way that is more consistent and breaks away from silos because an individual family deals with all the problems.  It does not silo its problems between health, education, the community, the risk of slipping into lives of crime and all the other aspects.  The Taoiseach is continuing to work with this and I am sure he will communicate with the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The question of whether such an approach can become something we would roll out and create a pledge around is a challenge for this D&aacute;il.  One of the things we need to do is have a long-term vision.  We are approaching a long-term vision for health and looking to the Oireachtas to have a degree of consensus about that.  We want to do the same in terms of long-term funding for the higher education system where there will also be a challenge coming down the track.  Climate change is a third issue.  There is a large number of major challenges facing this Oireachtas and I agree with the Deputy that this certainly ranks among them.  We need to find a more consistent way of ensuring that the resources of the State are deployed in a way that delivers better outcomes in these communities rather than each sitting within its own silo.</p>  <p>  Today, we have seen the publication of a report on the health prospects of people suffering from cancer in different parts of our community.  The report again raises questions for the Oireachtas as to how it can improve delivery in these areas.  While it would be premature for me to say I will sign on the dotted line for a policy approach we have yet to see fully developed, I am fully behind the spirit of what the Deputy is saying.  In respect of my responsibilities in education, I would like to see that sort of cross-community approach because a school cannot be just an oasis on its own.  Its strength depends on the resources it can bring in from the rest of the community in order to deliver improvements.  I look forward to the work of the task force and I will ask the Taoiseach to communicate to the Deputy on the framework and how the Oireachtas will be fully involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900005#C00400"><p>I welcome the Minister's initial positive view of the all-party pledge in respect of this.  The Minister said that this is a challenge for the D&aacute;il.  It is more than a challenge.  It is imperative that we do not just talk about an area that has been in the public view periodically for decades, but actually commit ourselves to finding a resolution.  We can do that.  All of us, and I put my hand up, have failed this community.  We have failed it because we have not delivered the resources in a consistent, co-ordinated, marshalled and ongoing way that would break the cycle of deprivation that has led not only to elements of crime, but an ongoing lack of participation in proper health statistics.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we have a clear timeframe for this task force, that the membership will be set out - he can come back to me on that - that there will be real community buy in and that we, as an Oireachtas, commit ourselves to this area.  Let this be the model area where we will commit over whatever time is required to ensure that we do not revisit the same issues for this community in a decade or two.</p></speech>

Indeed, our own parliamentary party discussed this challenge last week.  I am sure it is replicated in parts of the Deputy's constituency, as it is in parts of mine.  Most Deputies experience the same and there is a resolve to see a response in the north inner city, which has particularly acute experience.  As a former school principal in the area, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows this better than I do.  As we respond to the challenges in this area, we need to develop a model that we can replicate and build upon for other communities.  I have often been very impressed by the partnership companies and the way they can innovate in a way Government Departments cannot.  We need to find ways of allowing a thousand flowers to bloom in different communities.  One of the things I hope to do in the area of education is examine the concept of supporting innovation, particularly in respect of different community challenges.</p></speech>

If we are a true republic, we must ensure that our institutions respect and reflect the diversity of modern Irish society.  This is true in respect of education in particular.  The State has a serious responsibility to ensure that every child has access to a State-funded school in his or her own locality and that the ethos of that school reflects the ethos of the family concerned.  A significant number of parents have no choice but to send their child to a school that does not align with their own belief system.  Many parents feel they must baptise their children in order that they can be enrolled in a local State-funded school.  This situation is entirely unacceptable in this day and age and must be dealt with as a matter of priority.  <br/><br/>This week, the Minister appeared to endorse the community national school model, which involves splitting classes and segregating children on religious grounds for part of the school day.  This happens because the Catholic Church insisted on a requirement to have faith formation classes and preparation for sacraments during school hours in these schools.  We know this thanks to the excellent research carried out by Emma O'Kelly of RTE, who had access to documents obtained under the freedom of information provisions which showed that this was an agreement reached between the Catholic Church and the then Government in 2007.  It is incredible that such an agreement was reached only nine years ago.<br/><br/>I have two questions for the Minister.  Will he commit this morning to repealing section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act in order to ensure that all children can access their local publicly funded primary school irrespective of their belief system?  Will he end this most blatant form of discrimination against our children?  Does the Minister accept that the community national school model entails segregation on religious grounds and runs counter to the principles of child-centredness and inclusiveness?  If so, why is he endorsing it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising what I believe is an important question.  There is no doubt that Ireland has changed and citizens have different expectations of all Departments, but most particularly in the area of education.  It is my ambition to help parents to have access to the school of their choice.  As the Deputy rightly points out, over 95% of our schools are denominational, and my ambition is to deliver the commitment in the programme for Government to treble the number of schools that offer alternatives to denominational patronage.  My vision for this is to have as much diversity as possible.  I do not see the merit in confining our approach to a single model.  That is why I have sought to accelerate all the elements of the existing strategy and to provide new schools.  Last week, I provided new schools in the Deputy's neighbouring area, Cabra, and in Marino, with Educate Together as patron.  We need to continue to provide new schools with new patrons.  Virtually all the schools where new patrons are being appointed are multidenominational or non-denominational.  The progress that is being made on the transfer of patronage, which was initiated by Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn and continued by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is something we can accelerate.  I will form a working group which will sit down with the Catholic patrons to seek to accelerate that work.  It is recognised as an area in which slow progress has been made, but we hope to accelerate this progress.</p>  <p>  I do not share the Deputy's view regarding the role of the community national school.  A school that is in State rather than private patronage and that offers, under one umbrella, the opportunity for faith-based instruction and makes provision for other options offers a good model that will allow us to transition.  If we are moving from a situation in which more than 95% of schools are denominational we will need models that can accommodate parents with different views of the type of education their children should have, and the model of community-based national schools under the education and training boards, as a State-sponsored patron, is a good one that has potential.  We have to look at it and look at the programmes that children who do not opt to be in a denomination receive.  I am very open to considering how we can improve those programmes, but I do not share the Deputy's view that we should throw out a model that allows different views of education to thrive under one umbrella.</p></speech>

He is talking about endorsing a model that entails segregating children during the school day.  How can that possibly be right?  What he is suggesting is that education policy should put the interests of children second to the interest of any church.  How can the Minister defend that situation?  Just imagine that for a half an hour in every school day, children are segregated according to religion.  That cannot possibly be right.  At a very minimum, is the Minister prepared to insist that any denominational instruction is moved to the end of the school day so that we do not have this kind of divisive and anti-inclusive policy in operation in the community national schools?</p>  <p>  The Minister has not addressed the other question about section 7 of the Equal Status Act, which will continue to allow thousands of schools to discriminate purely on the grounds of religion.  Is the Minister prepared to give a commitment to repeal that section here in order to stop that kind of discrimination?</p></speech>

Children do different things during the course of the school day.  If we can create a model that is acceptable to a lot of parents and that offers diversity within that school, it is something to be celebrated.</p></speech>

It is not the exclusive model.  We will have the Educate Together model, the gaelscoil model, some denominational models and so on.  Diversity, with different education offerings to parents who want different things, is the right approach.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the Equal Status Act, it was not considered in the admissions Bill that was introduced during the last Government and it will not be part of the admissions Bill that I will publish soon, but the D&aacute;il will have to debate its approach to this.  There is constitutional protection for religions within our constitution and the last Oireachtas committee recognised that there is a difficulty here.  That has to be recognised.  The Equal Status Act provides, and we will provide in the admissions Bill, that a denominational school must accept a non-denominational child, but if the school is oversubscribed that may not be the case, and 20% of schools are oversubscribed.  This is a matter on which I will consult with other Oireachtas Members and we will be able to debate it in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I obviously cannot answer for what action the Government will take on foot of this finding.  As the Deputy knows, change in the area requires an amendment of our Constitution, as Deputies have indicated.  In the programme for Government, we have set out an approach where there will be within six months the establishment of a citizens' assembly.  It will not have a specific mandate to reach any particular conclusion and it will obviously be open to the citizens' assembly to examine all the issues and come back to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Will the Minister tell me what, if any, action is being taken by the Government on foot of the issue?  Will he arrange for either the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to meet representatives of the staff?  People are working side by side in exactly the same circumstances, with the same qualifications and doing the same job, but are in radically different positions.  Some of them have protected State pensions but the rest will have practically no pension at all.  Does the Government find that acceptable and what action is it taking?</p></speech>

The board has decided to close the fund and that has major implications for those involved.  I understand from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that representatives of the Health Service Executive, HSE, met representatives from the CRC about this issue.  I do not have an outcome to report on progress but efforts are being made to try to find a solution.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to respond to the Deputy about the work done.</p></speech>

The most recent quarterly household survey indicates unemployment in the south east is still at 12.5%, compared with less than 7% in Dublin, less than 6% in the south west and 5.5% in the east.</p></speech>

When is it expected to see an update on these regional strategies?  They are meant to deal with these issues but, unfortunately, in the south east they have not been dealt with to the satisfaction of people living in the area.</p></speech>

I am grateful that the south east has one of the fastest growing employment rates in any region, although I fully realise it is coming from a position where it had many structural problems.  There has been real success in the south east and the approach we have taken of creating a regional action plan, with much involvement from local people, including agencies, businesses and communities, is the right one.  There are regional competitive funds and I am sure the south east is very competitive in seeking them.  I am sure it would be open to the Whips to provide an opportunity to discuss the progress being made.  It is an important issue and I know it will be built on in this Oireachtas.  There is a renewed focus within the programme for Government on regional development.  I thank the Deputy for his interest, as he has shown much interest in the past.</p></speech>

When the cut was announced, it was indicated that this was not a cut but rather a "time-sensitive saving" as relevant personnel could not be recruited.  If the relevant personnel could not be recruited four weeks ago, what has happened since meaning that relevant personnel can now be recruited?  Will the money be spent on a different element under mental health?  If that happens, it would also be very welcome.  Will the Minister confirm where the additional &euro;12 million will be spent?</p>  <p>  Over three and a half years ago, the Minister's previous Government cut the mobility allowance for people with a disability.  At the time, a review was promised for completion within a number of months.  We are three and a half years on but we are still awaiting the publication of the health (transport support) Bill.  It is included in the programme published a number of days ago but will the Minister indicate what priority this will be given and when it will come before the House?</p></speech>

There is no doubt the restoration of the mental health budget is universally welcomed, if one listens to the debate here.  It puts the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in a position to develop a programme and it will obviously include recruitment of staff.  As the Deputy notes, it can also consider other areas.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will develop her plan to respond with this additional resource where I know the need is huge.  There is no doubt about that.  It is hoped the heads of the health transport Bill referred to by the Deputy will be available in July.</p></speech>

It amends the existing legislation and aims to provide for equality-proofing of Government policy, budgets and public bodies through impact assessments.  Its aim is to promote equality in the functioning of public bodies and to provide for the carrying out of equality impact assessments in respect of measures that are likely to have a significant impact or effect on equality of opportunity.  The Bill will ensure both Government and public bodies exercise their functions in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome that result from socioeconomic disadvantage.  It is quite extensive.  It puts a requirement on the State to carry out proper equality-proofed budgeting.  We know from all the analysis from the ESRI that, budget after budget, income inequality has increased and poverty has increased.  We want to get to a point where we know the impact of decisions at budget time and policies in terms of whether they will increase poverty.  That is the thrust of the Bill.</p></speech>

The biggest cost in insurance premiums, at 60%, is the legal cost.  If one looks at the role and the history of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government and the previous Government of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, none of them touched the legal profession.  None of them went after the legal profession, even in the way the troika asked them to, which was through bringing down the legal costs in the country.  That is probably one of the ring-fenced areas the troika did not go after and yet the ranks of both parties, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, are swollen with legal eagles of all sorts.  I remember this being my experience on Dublin City Council in particular.  The number of barristers and solicitors in that party who were also political representatives was quite astonishing.</p></speech>

Despite the portrayal by the industry of the real cause of the increase in cost being the young, fast-moving drivers who are fraudulent, who get whiplash at the drop of a hat and who are making all sorts of spurious claims, the real costs are much more hidden, in terms of both legal costs and profits.</p>  <p>  When one looks at the profits of the big three insurance companies, it is quite interesting that they are not actually hurting all that badly.  Aviva's profits were up by 38.5% in 2015.  I know that includes all its profits, but nevertheless these are the profits of a company that insures everything from medical expenses to houses.  It may well be hurting a wee bit on car insurance, but it is certainly making up for it elsewhere.  In the same period, AXA Insurance made &euro;76.9 million in profits and Allianz made &euro;43.3 million.  They claim their costs have increased, but their profits are certainly very healthy indeed.  The Injuries Board shows a modest 8% increase in new claims in the 18 months to the middle of 2015.  Some 70% of personal injury claims do not go to court, although there may be legal costs attached to them.  The arguments of the industry that the claims are the problem do not really stack up and there is no real evidence to show it.  The companies themselves have cited, among other reasons, a drop in investment income.  In other words, they are investing money and profits in stocks and shares and the returns on these are dropping.</p>  <p>  Advice received by the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, from his own officials showed scepticism of the industry's claims about premiums rising because of compensation awards.  They were very sceptical of these claims.  The quote I would like to give Deputies from that advice is that from examining the evidence of awards it appears &ldquo;motor insurers are now imposing higher premium rates to return themselves to profitability or to boost profitability after a number of years of insurers competing for market share, with prices driven down&rdquo;.  The officials also stated, &ldquo;[t]he question does arise for motor insurers &ndash; if motor insurance is so unprofitable why does anybody do it?&rdquo;  We are constantly being told that competition is a healthy thing.  It is supposed to be more efficient and it is supposed to improve the industry, but here is an example of the market ruling and making an absolute bags of an issue.  It is making a bags of an issue where people are fundamentally legally required to have motor insurance but still the market does them nothing but disservice.</p>  <p>  The only way we can improve this situation for the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps, who are so well got to the hearts of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, is to have a State-run, publicly owned and controlled and publicly accountable company that will insure people who are legally obliged to have insurance.  We need a company that is not subject to the diktat of the market, trying to make a quick buck by investing in stocks and shares, but rather serving the needs of the people for medical and other cover when they require insurance.  There will be a cavalcade of protesters on this issue - young, old, long, tall, medium and short, the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps from Cavan to Kerry - descending on this city on Saturday, 2 July.  It will be a well-organised cavalcade to protest against the soaring cost of insurance.  I hope most Deputies who genuinely have the interest of Joe and Josephine Soap at heart will be out to support that protest.</p></speech>

Profits on car insurance were up 12% in 2014 and they were up 26.5% last year.  According to Mr. Ken Thompson, the chief executive of Insurance Ireland, they will be up another 25% this year.  My colleague, Deputy Smith, has quoted from the briefing document that was given by civil servants in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the previous Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, last year.</p><p>In it they cast some doubt on whether the root cause of insurance price increases was, fundamentally, as a result of high compensation awards, fraud, etc.  Instead they pointed towards attempts by these companies to boost profits by hiking prices to claw back losses made in the period 2010 to 2014.  Let us look at that.  The industry claims that between 2010 and 2014, it made losses on car insurance of &euro;585 million.  However, with insurance, of all industries, it is not a good idea to look at a narrow window of a couple of years because of the way claims pay out.  One needs to take a longer view.  For example, I could say that industry profits in 2005 - one year - were &euro;582 million which would wipe out all the losses it made during those tricky years.  Let us take the long view.</p> <p> Between 1994 and 2014, the insurance industry made pre-tax profits on car insurance in this State of &euro;2.866 billion.  This is an incredible figure.  The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, reported in 2002 that in the years 1983 to 1999, the return on car insurance in this State was 11 times the return, in terms of profits for the industry, than was the case in the UK.  Between 2002 and 2008, according to the industry's blue book, that is, the statistics it produces each year, the profits as a percentage of claims paid were as follows: in 2003, it was 45.9%; in 2004, it was 60.2%; in 2005, it was a whopping 61.6%; in 2006, it was, 43.6%; and in 2007, it was 47%.  It is quite clear there have been massive profits and profiteering by the insurance industry on car insurance in the State over decades.  If there is to be an investigation, it must involve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth - not some of it.  The MIAB's executive summary report, produced by Dorothea Dowling in 2002, stated:"It has not been this board's experience that insurers have willingly provided all material information in the fulsome manner which the Minister is entitled to expect."  Let there be no business secrets here.  The industry should be compelled to open the books for full inspection by servants of the State.  We would be inclined to vote for the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  We support the idea of an investigation, we want pressure to be brought to bear and we believe the amendment firms things up a bit.  However, we have been here before.  In 2002, the MIAB report made 67 recommendations, many of which were positive and some made a difference, but it did not change the model of insurance we have in the State.  It did not touch the for-profit model and now, 14 years later, here we are back to square one.  A new investigation can come forward with positive proposals and can make a difference but we will be back here again in a few years' time if the root cause of the problem is not addressed, that is, if we keep the for-profit model that has ruled the roost on this issue down through the years.  It is time for that model to be dismantled and changed.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;m comhghairdeas ar Fhianna F&aacute;il as ucht an r&uacute;n a chuir os comhair na D&aacute;la.  I am delighted to support this motion and I have no hesitation in doing so.  This motion has been brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il but it is because of the outrage on the ground among ordinary people who are struggling to pay their bills, their water bills - those who are paying - their property charges and now a hike in insurance.  I have heard of quotes going up 300-fold.</p>  <p>  Let us put this in context in that it is obligatory to have car insurance but there is very little public transport.  Rural areas were mentioned but people are also forced into cars in cities, including in Galway where I am from.  The one and a half page document, if I can call it a document, given to us by the insurance lobby group is a lazy, unbalanced and self-serving.  It has chosen to present certain facts while ignoring other facts.  This is part of a campaign by the insurance companies that started with the abolition of juries and moved forward to the setting up of the former Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Now the industry is putting the blame on anybody but itself.</p>  <p>  There was an interesting article in the newspaper yesterday, which I would say Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have read in detail because they have quoted from it.  However, we should give credit to the person who has pointed all of this out, the former chairperson of the MIAB, Ms Dorothea Dowling.  I do not think she is a friend of the legal profession.  She certainly highlighted the inadequate information given by the insurance companies.  For example, in 2014, there were 31,576 claims and of those claims, all Ms Dowling and the courts can account for is 9,046.  That means 22,530 claims were settled by the insurance companies but they have not given a single piece of information as to how the claims were settled or what they cost.  However, they lambast the legal profession for its costs and they give out to the Garda for not doing its job but there is no obligation on the insurance industry to disclose any information as to how it is settling claims.  Insurance companies point to fraudulent claims while failing to point out that legislation is in place - the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 - which gives huge powers to the courts to dismiss claims if there is any sign of a fraudulent claim or an exaggerated claim.  The industry does not refer to that legislation.</p>  <p>  The industry gives no information on the number of policies repudiated by it.  It is unacceptable for insurance companies to mount a campaign to force further changes without putting their hands up and saying: "We have increased costs by over 300% and 400% in certain cases".  The industry has made huge profits but has not accounted for those profits.  Dorothea Dowling points out that in the UK, which it wishes to copy in terms of the care culture rather than a compensation culture, the industry is breaking even but in Ireland it is making huge profits.</p>  <p>  The Sinn Fein amendment should also be taken on board because there is some merit to bringing the insurance companies before the finance committee and giving them a grilling, not least for their failure to give any information.</p></speech>

We have met many people, including taxi drivers who have seen their insurance increase by 300%, who are being quoted vastly outrageous charges for their insurance.  I know of one particular case of a 28 year old woman who drives a Micra, which is 15 years old.  The car has passed its NCT and it is taxed but when she went to seek her car insurance, she was told that it was going to go up by almost &euro;700 or &euro;800.  She could not afford this so she went to other insurance companies to see if she could get a decent quote but she was refused.  They would not even talk to her about it.  They refused on the grounds the car was 15 years old and they would not even discuss it.  She was told that the companies would not offer her any type of insurance, not even a quote of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  This person has a young child and a part-time job and needs the car to get around, but she cannot get the insurance.  It is outrageous that companies can do this.</p>  <p>  The point has been made that this is an industry which is hugely profitable.  There is no transparency and it is very hard to get figures from the industry.  Similar problems exist with regard to house insurance.  The industry can refuse people on the basis of future potential risk in their communities and on where they live.  These companies then expect the State to step in to create a situation where they can give insurance to people.  If there is risk in a business, it must provide for that risk.  It must be able to manage the risk and see what it can do.  I absolutely support the concept of a publicly owned and controlled insurance industry, linked in with a proper transport system.</p><p>I will be supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the motion because I agree with the idea, as stated by my colleague, of the motor industry being brought before the finance committee and adequately questioned about its policy in this regard.  It is important that the industry faces the ire of the people.</p> <p> It is good to have the debate, but it will not have been worth having if we do not see something result from it and it does not look like the Minister of State will try seriously to address the issue.  It has to be done though because we cannot have a situation where workers cannot afford car insurance.</p></speech>

More than one third of Irish drivers have seen the cost of their insurance increase by more than 50% in the past year.  We could all tell our own individual horror stories.  It has gone beyond being a rip-off at this stage.  Last week, a father contacted me about his son who paid &euro;2,400 for his first insurance cover.  His renewal quote was &euro;3,100, which was then withdrawn, allegedly because he had changed from working in retail to being a labourer.  They contacted the Ombudsman who told them to shop around, which they did, but the nearest quote was &euro;6,500.  This car is registered for social, domestic and pleasure purposes.  It is not used for his job.  The situation is utterly ridiculous.  The young man ended up changing jobs because he needed a car but could not pay the cost of the insurance.  The reality is that the increases being imposed are leading people to drive with reduced over, which is very concerning, or to the imposition of severe economic hardship.  It is simply unacceptable.</p>  <p>  We know AA studies and so forth have blamed fraudulent activity and high costs in legal claims.  However, they fail to mention the profiteering of insurance companies.  This is the nub of the issue.  I support the Fianna F&aacute;il measure calling for a national database to record premiums and settlements.  This can be done anonymously and would help provide some transparency.  The truth, however, is that there is no reason for the current situation whatsoever and the only credible explanation is that a cartel is operating for profit.</p>  <p>  For example, in the modern era of new technologies, the use of dash cams can be implemented.  A dash cam can record footage which could be used as evidence in the event of a traffic incident.  They can record speeds through GPS tracking and issue proximity warnings, for example, when changing lanes.  The encouragement of the use of this type of technology has the potential to massively simplify the insurance process.  Do the insurance companies want it?  We can bet they do not, because there is a cartel of insurance underwriters and companies profiting from the current situation.</p>  <p>  I know of an insurance brokerage company which set itself up with the view to operating with dash cams in particular and using them as a mechanism to reduce premiums and simplify the claims process.  The company was taken over by a bigger insurance company and the dash cam programme has ended up in the bin.  That is the real nature of the insurance business in Ireland.  Figures show that the number of collisions has declined with the implementation of these types of technology, which are already available.  We could radically transform the situation.  There is no need for it whatsoever and unless we get to the heart of the matter the problems will continue.  It is simply unacceptable for young people, in particular, but for other drivers as well, who, as other Deputies have said, against the backdrop of an inadequate public transport system, need their cars and should be able to drive them safely.</p></speech>

Every Member of this House will have had a case brought to his or her attention regarding insurance costs in the past number of years.  I am currently dealing with the case of a lorry driver with a clean licence who has never had an accident.  His insurance bill last year was &euro;1,320 and this year it is &euro;3,847.  He is just not in a position to pay it.  This individual has children at school, but the lorry is parked up because he cannot drive it.  He is in the process of trying to raise the money somewhere to pay for the insurance.  We priced around with a number of insurance companies but they will not give him a quote.  This is what is happening.  Is it that these insurance companies are operating a cartel or something?  I believe they are playing to their shareholders and maximising their profits.  Unfortunately, many of these insurance companies are multinational companies, so I do not know if the Government can force them to bring down their prices.</p>  <p>  In 2002, when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il, there was a major issue regarding insurance claims.  The then T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, introduced the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which brought down insurance costs in the following years.  It is not just car insurance that has increased.  Household and business insurance have also increased.  This morning, I rang five business people in Galway.  Their insurance costs have increased in the past two to three years by between 20% and 50%.  In one company alone, there was a &euro;70,000 increase in the insurance costs for a major factory.  The owner told me he will have to let staff go if insurance costs continue to increase.</p>  <p>  Many other Members have also mentioned young drivers.  Unfortunately, many of these drivers are finding themselves driving without insurance because they cannot afford to pay for it.  I plead with them not to drive without insurance.  It is a very serious offence, and God forbid there was ever an accident.  They might buy a car for between &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000 and the first insurance premium could be &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  Returning to the issue of the flood crisis in 2009, insurance companies refused to renew flood insurance for houses which had been flooded.  We met the insurance regulator and, to be honest, it was a waste of time.  He more or less told us he could not do anything and that it was the insurance companies who set the policies and the premiums.  I know the OPW cannot give a commitment or assurance that following the carrying out of appropriate works a house would not flood again, but some insurance companies stated that even if the works were done they would still refuse to provide flood insurance.  I know a review is being set up within the Department to try to deal with this issue but unless it has teeth and something can be done with the insurance companies, nothing will happen.  Unfortunately, businesses and shops will close because the costs have gone through the roof.</p>  <p>  I ask and plead with the Government to ensure that if it does something regarding insurance, it is given some sort of teeth and will force insurance companies into action.  Some Members have spoken about setting up a national insurance company run by the Government.  I do not believe that is the answer, but something has to be done to ensure premiums are reduced.  I hope that following this motion something will be done.  I think that there will be consensus within the House and that all parties and Members will work together to try to find a resolution to the issue.</p></speech>

I am delighted that in the spirit of the new politics it is not, as I understand it, being opposed by the Government.  This is a very serious issue as we emerge from a dark, deep recession.  I know this matter concerns car insurance mainly as well as commercial insurance, but this fledgling, recovering economy could be hijacked.  That is what it is - a hijacking.</p>  <p>  I have to declare an interest.  I have a small business and my insurance increased this year by 40%.  I know of countless cases of people, both young and old, trying to get insurance for cars, homes and commercial premises and businesses who are aghast at the situation.  Road hauliers have lobbied the Government a lot over the past number of years, as have I, and concessions were made in terms of the rebate on fuel.  In fairness to the Government, last year it gave a huge rebate in terms of the tax on heavy goods vehicles.  It seems as if the insurance company saw this niche and decided to nakedly claim every ounce of this badly needed break back.  We are an exporting nation and we need our haulage industry to carry our exports abroad.  Efforts were made following a lot of lobbying and there was huge satisfaction and appreciation for what happened.</p><p>Lo and behold, as would only happen in this little country, the insurance companies cavalierly decided to balance it out because those involved had to keep paying anyway.  That is the attitude.  What are the regulator and the Competition Authority doing about the problem of insurance cover for young motorists and homeowners?  As stated by Deputy Grealish, many people are now forced to drive without insurance, which I condemn out of hand.  It is off the wall to drive without insurance.  It is a serious issue.  Further increases in insurance are not plausible.  </p> <p> The task force set up to examine this issue, which comprises officials from the Departments of Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport, is only tickling at it.  We need firm action.  While the Taoiseach and Ministers of the previous Government are to be complimented on their discussions with the insurance industry following the recent flooding, the industry took no notice of what was said.  It takes no notice of anybody.  The industry is doing what it likes, when it likes, and is charging what it likes.  It would be more in line for it to address the issue of out-of-court settlements, which as a businessman I have been a victim of over the years.  Despite strenuous efforts in putting together a meaningful defence, claims are often settled on the steps of the court without notification to the interested party, despite the fact that his or her premiums will likely be hijacked on renewal because of the claim payment.  Premiums are also being increased following minor accidents.  When my daughter was involved in a minor accident, the cost of her motor insurance increased immediately in anticipation of a payout which did not materialise until two years later.  In fairness to the barrister involved, the case was fought well in court.  There are too many of these cases.  Pervious speakers referred to the 23,000 claims paid out in 2014 without accountability to anybody.  The person who pays the piper - namely, the person paying the insurance - is the person who should call the tune.  How can we expect the regulator and so on to know about settlements when the insured are not made aware of them?  </p> <p> We need a root-and-branch review of what motivates the insurance companies.  I am old enough to remember the introduction of the PMPA levy and subsequent levies, which we are still paying.  Levies are frequently introduced but never withdrawn.  What is happening in the insurance industry is naked hijacking.  If terrorists were doing this there would be an outcry about it and we would set the Criminal Assets Bureau on them.  This is marauding by the industry with the full power of the law behind it, affecting businesses and ordinary people.  Thus far the attempts to address this issue have been feeble, although I am not suggesting that the motion before us is feeble.  We must deal with this issue, which is damaging to our economy.  Deputy Grealish referred to countless cases of people who have been forced out of business.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, whom I wish well in her new role, is trying to stimulate business.  The cost of insurance cover is outrageous.</p> <p> The legal profession must also take account of what is going on in terms of the staggering settlements being agreed behind closed doors.  There is no transparency in that regard.  Even the insured person is unable to find out the level of payment or cost involved in respect of a claim.  All he or she can do is shut up and put up and pay the premium the following year regardless of the cost.  Insurance cover for my business increased by 40% this year.  No business can plan for such increases.  The cost of insurance must be linked in some way to the cost of inflation.  A business that successfully tenders for work to be carried out over a 12-month period may not be able to meet the cost of huge increases on insurance renewal mid-year.  This is affecting countless businesses across the country, be they agri-contractors, plant hirers or road hauliers.  It is also affecting many other self-employed people, including hairdressers and funeral directors.  All businesses must have insurance cover.  </p> <p> There has also been a great deal of outcry in regard to the need for a review of rates, which I accept something needs to be done about.  The issue of insurance cover has gone wild, although I do not know the reason behind this.  Perhaps it is linked to our having been in election mode since last October and the fact that a Government has only recently been put in place.  It is unacceptable.  This issue must be addressed firmly.  Task forces and so on will not suffice.  We need legislation.  We may also need to consider pay-as-you-go insurance, the cost of which would be added to the fuel tax.  I have previously advocated such a proposal.  There are many elderly people who only use their cars to get to mass or to collect their pensions on a Friday.  They should be able to avail of pay-as-you-go insurance.  The more mileage one does the more risk.  That type of system might put manners on the insurance companies.</p></speech>

It is a great honour for him and his family.  With financial services and government procurement in his portfolio, a background in nuclear disarmament may prove to be quite useful.  I wish the Minister of State the best in his job.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats support this motion on the establishment of a task force to examine the rising costs of motor insurance in Ireland.  However, we would like to go further than that.  We all know that motor insurance costs are skyrocketing.  According to the Central Statistics Office, insurance costs increased by 32% in the last 12 months.  We all know that at least some of the reasons for these increases are historic under-pricing by insurers, new rules requiring higher reserves to be put aside, elevated personal injury awards and lower investment returns.  These costs are being passed on to motorists, with drivers being asked to pay an additional 50%, 75%, or in some cases 100%.  People are being stunned by their motor insurance renewal bills.  The reaction of some people is to question what they have done wrong that has caused their premiums to increase.</p>  <p>  Members of the Freight Transport Association recently reported premium increases of 50%, with some being asked to pay increases of up to 70% on their 2014-2015 premiums.  It is not only in motor insurance that this is happening.  Up to the end of March this year, home insurance premiums had increased by approximately 10%, and health insurance premiums have increased by more than 3% in the past year.  This is in spite of the fact that 100,000 extra people have taken out health insurance following the introduction of lifetime community rating.  The cost of health insurance for hundreds of thousands of VHI customers increased by an average of 3% since the beginning of May.  This is the second increase announced by the State's private health insurer in the last six months.  It rolled out an average price increase of 2% last November.  </p>  <p>  As alluded to by other members, insurance costs for businesses are also worrying.  The Small Firms Association, SFA, reports that insurance costs for its members have increased by approximately 30% since 2011, which is a significant additional cost for any firm to bear, particularly small firms around the country that are hanging on by their fingernails.  This amounts to an increase in the average cost per claim of 8% in private motor insurance, 27% in employer liability and 8% in public liability.  Clearly, the average claim is increasing at a steep rate.  How do we address this?  We need to drive down average claim costs.  We can reform how awards are set by the Injuries Board and the courts.  We must also have better non-litigation options such that legal fees are reduced.</p>  <p>  I listened to a debate on this issue last night during which it was reported that 70% of claims are being settled out of court.  There is no record of those transactions.  The industry, rather than the State, is at fault in that regard.  The industry must invest in proper data sharing.  This happens in the UK and in Northern Ireland.  Firms that are engaged here and in the North have invested in serious data sharing in the North but they have not done so here.  The AA has suggested that a task force of all Government agencies be established.  Obviously, this is a multi-departmental issue.  The problem is not just related to motor insurance, nor is it related to insurance generally; rather, it is a problem related to the cost of living and the cost of doing business in Ireland.  Child care costs here are the second highest in the OECD.  Rents here have increased by over one third since 2011 and the cost of education has increased by almost 20% since 2011.  Variable interest rates here are also much higher than in most European countries.  The Social Democrats support the establishment of a task force on motor insurance, but we believe we have to be much more ambitious than that.</p><p>There needs to be a task force - be it an expert group, an Oireachtas committee or some combination of these - which considers not just motor insurance or the insurance industry but which also systematically addresses the cost of living and of doing business and comes back with a multi-agency, multi-departmental recommendation so that people can get on with their lives.  Then the money in their pockets can buy them more, they can afford a decent standard of living and small firms can reduce the cost of doing business and get on with expanding their operations and employing people.</p></speech>

Why has the Government not taken action in this area?  We know that insurance costs are far too high.  The current annual inflation rate is running at over 34%.  We have no explanation for this and, as far as the Government is concerned, there is no real proposed action to tackle the problem.  In recent years the rising cost of living on several fronts has been a significant problem for many families.  This is one area that is driving up the cost of living for ordinary families.  There are several actions the Government can take to tackle matters such as this in a way that does not entail expenditure but could reduce the cost of insurance, along with tackling water charges and ensuring greater competition on energy costs, which would have a huge impact on the cost of living and family budgets.  Unfortunately, the Government has been quite remiss in this area and, rather than taking that approach to tackling the cost of living and dealing with the issues it has a role in, it has promised tax cats which simply erode the tax base and reduce the potential for investment in good quality public services.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats identified the rising cost of insurance as a key area of concern in increasing family budgets.  We dealt with this last year and raised it several times.  We all became aware very quickly in the recent general election that this is a pressing issue for most people.  It was one of the key issues that came up on the doorsteps and it has taken that for the Government to come up with some proposals for a potential task force.  In many ways, that action is too little too late.  The response of the Government has been too slow but the response of the Central Bank has also been too slow.</p>  <p>  A constituent recently told me that he received a quote for his 2009, 1.4L Renault M&eacute;gane of &euro;873, up from &euro;493 last year.  Another constituent told me his insurance doubled from &euro;600 last year to &euro;1,200 this year.  We hear these stories repeated over and again with no explanation offered.  There is very little transparency in the insurance companies&rsquo; charging regime.  It is very difficult to explain the difference between the increases operating in distinct but similar motor insurance markets.  For example, there has been little or no premium inflation in motorcycle insurance for the past three years, apart from a significant blip of almost 6% last October.  Motor car insurance premiums, however, have rocketed, with inflation of over 10% in each of the months since the autumn of 2014 and in excess of 25% in each of the months since autumn 2015.  How can two very similar markets operate so differently?</p>  <p>  It is difficult to believe that there is not excessive profit-taking going on, yet, as the insurance industry points out, premiums have gone up and down in recent years.  However, they are now 56% higher than at the end of 2011.  This not only imposes a huge additional cost on individual families but also on businesses because the same kind of increases have been applied to commercial vehicles.  I think of people trying to run small businesses, sole traders, people who drive taxis and so on.  It makes it very difficult for them to operate in a way that returns any profit to their small business.  This is a timely motion and we very much support it.  It is long overdue.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, well and congratulate him on his appointment.</p>  <p>  Motor insurance is not like health, travel or home insurance.  It is compulsory.  A person found in control of a vehicle without insurance is guilty of a criminal offence.  When we hear that the cost of motor insurance has risen by 60% since 2014, with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, confirming that there has been a 34% increase in the past 12 months, it is a cause for very serious concern.  We do not need the CSO to inform us, as public representatives, because we have been hearing it anecdotally from constituents.</p>  <p>  For several years drivers benefited from competitively priced motor insurance premiums but the consequence of that was the collapse of insurance companies such as Quinn and Setanta and the consumer will be paying for this with a 2% levy on all insurance premiums for the next ten to 15 years.  On top of that, today's insurance companies are in a race to return to profitability, with premium increases of up to 60% hitting already hard-pressed drivers and resulting in the negation of any well-deserved tax cuts they may have received in the recent budget.  Increases are costing Dublin drivers in particular between &euro;200 and &euro;300 in many cases, regardless of the longevity of their accident and claim free record.  While we are correct to focus on young drivers, this rightly angers and frustrates seasoned and experienced drivers who have a 25 to 30-year accident and claim free driving record.  Dublin motorists have always been at a disadvantage because premiums have often been higher in the capital than in the rest of the country.  In Dublin and across the country, these increases are resulting in very worrying trends where motorists are not insuring their vehicles.  Unable to afford the spiralling cost of car insurance, some are taking to the roads with nothing but the sky for cover.  This cannot continue.  Even Insurance Ireland says high premiums are not in insurers' or drivers' interests as raising the threshold of affordability leads to more uninsured drivers.  Insurance companies tell us that these increases are down to, among other things, fraudulent claims, higher rates of compensation being awarded in the courts and legal fees.</p>  <p>  Without the establishment of the independent task force that Fianna F&aacute;il proposes, however, none of this can be confirmed.  We are setting out clear proposals to tackle motor insurance costs.  This would involve the reconstitution of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was successful in reducing motor insurance premiums, to examine, in particular, the profitability of the industry, the settlement of claims and the impact of fraud and exaggerated claims on premiums.  We need this task force to identify, once and for all, the root cause of these dramatic and crippling price increases.  It needs to have access to data such as the amount of compensation awarded in private which never makes it into the public sphere.  During the previous sustained period of rising motor insurance costs in the late 1990s, prices rose by 50% in seven years.  The establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board helped reduce these costs by 40% in real terms between 2002 and 2013.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes there is a need to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which would include representatives from insurance companies, the Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, motorist representative bodies and the Road Safety Authority, to examine all the relevant issues that affect insurance premiums.</p><p>I have received a raft of calls from constituents in the past month, in particular, regarding the rise in the number of cars, especially older cars, being abandoned in residential estates in my constituency.  I am sure the two issues are connected.</p> <p> Given that car insurance is compulsory, the cost is a major issue for family finances.  It impacts heavily on family budgets.  Higher car insurance premiums mean families are doing without other essentials.  Shopping around for competitive quotes is not only time consuming, but also seems completely fruitless.</p> <p> My party has a proud record of having addressed and effectively dealt with this issue in the 1990s and 2000s.  It is that kind of action which is demanded by the motion.  Dash cam technology is an innovation and initiative worthy of consideration, as are other non-legal avenues to address the issues.  I strongly commend Deputy McGrath on bringing the motion before the House, which proposes to establish a task force to address spiralling insurance costs.  I am happy to support it on behalf of Dublin motorists.</p></speech>

I would also like to thank my colleague, Deputy McGrath, for once again putting forward a motion that makes a lot of sense and proposes a simple and achievable action.</p>  <p>  This is a new D&aacute;il.  Time and again we have heard calls for the D&aacute;il to be taken seriously.  I do not think we can accept the idea that we come in here and vote in favour of motions, and then return in five, six or eight months' time to find the will of the D&aacute;il has been totally ignored and nothing has happened.  If the D&aacute;il accepts the motion put forward by my colleague, which I hope it will, that then is the will of the people's representatives and should be acted upon.</p>  <p>  It is very important that the Government immediately establish a task force to examine this issue.  Since the motion was tabled a major debate has started.  All of the inevitable interest groups said they were not the cause of the problem.  Nobody has explained to us how, for example, the significant change in the number of fatal accidents over many years has not had the desired effect.  There are many GoSafe cameras, but they have not had the desired effect of reducing accidents and, therefore, insurance costs.  Many other things that have discommoded lots of our citizens have not had the desired effect of at least providing them with affordable insurance.</p>  <p>  We need to get to the bottom of what is going on urgently.  We need evidence on whether there is any legitimate basis for charging extra premiums on older cars, when many such cars are used by families as a second car for runabout journeys.  They never go at any great speed and are often driven by family members for school transport, going shopping and other such family business which is not high risk.  We need evidence on the charging system.</p>  <p>  In the motion, Deputy McGrath clearly outlined the steps that need to be taken, the challenges we face in trying to find out the real basis for the increase in insurance premiums and whether it is evidence based.  There is ample evidence that a lot of the necessary data is not available to make that judgment.</p>  <p>  In the short time available to me - two colleagues are due to follow me - I will make another point.  There is a fantastic legal battle going on between different interest groups regarding Setanta.  Those who were injured by drivers who believed in good faith that they were insured are entitled to compensation.  Whether the compensation comes from the compensation fund or other funds, at the end of the day unfortunately it is likely to be motorists who, in one form or another, will pick up the tab.  We need to bring this matter to conclusion and make sure that those who have suffered losses because of the failure of Setanta are paid what they are due.</p>  <p>  We need to make sure that type of bad regulation cannot happen.  A company which is regulated aboard cannot come into the Irish market without proper prudential scrutiny having been carried out to ensure it will not collapse.  Unfortunately, my time is up.  Deputy O'Dea be delighted to note that I have finished five seconds early.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister on his appointment, and wish him the very best and a long and profitable period in his position.  I also want to congratulate my colleague, Deputy McGrath, on bringing forward this very timely motion.  Due to time constraints, I cannot discuss the structural problems of the insurance industry or the implications of Setanta and Quinn.  Therefore, I will confine myself to making a few general points.</p>  <p>  One of the main determinants of the amount one pays into any fund, including insurance funds, is how much the fund has to pay out because, after all, it is a commercial operation.  There is no doubt that the amounts paid out here by way of insurance awards are dramatically out of line with the rest of the world.  For example, some 80% of minor car accident injuries in Ireland involve whiplash.  Whiplash awards here are about three times the level they are in the UK and are an even greater multiple of the amounts in other jurisdictions.  There is no logical basis whatsoever for this.  What is the justification for it?</p>  <p>  Another problem with the costs incurred that determine how much people have to pay into an insurance fund is the process by which awards are now determined.  As Deputy Grealish and others said, we set up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to deal with the level of costs in the motor insurance sector.  Unfortunately, it has been gradually eroded over the years.  I understand it now only deals with about 20% of claims.  It was eroded by the legal profession which found a way to get around it by claiming psychological damage, which means claimants are automatically out of the ambit of PIAB.</p>  <p>  In addition, the section of the legislation which prevents somebody seeking an offer through PIAB from having an each way bet in terms of rejecting it and going to the courts is not being enforced at all, as far as I can see.  For many years it has been suggested that we have a statutory system for all but the most extreme cases, such as cases of very grave personal injury where people have become paraplegics, etc.  We currently have what is called a book of quantum, which is supposed to be a list of indicative awards for particular types of injury.  However, it is based on the prevailing level of awards which means that it is quite useless.  If we base awards on the book of quantum, the only way insurance premiums can go is upwards.</p>  <p>  Premiums have risen by over 60% over the past three years.  I have received the latest figures from the CSO, which show that in the 12 months to the end of May, insurance costs in Ireland rose by 35.5%.  There is no logical justification whatsoever for that.  It is long past time that we took action to deal with the issue.  </p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath's motion proposes a task force.  I note the Minister for Finance told the House there would be a review.  When he addressed the House yesterday, the review miraculously morphed into a Department of Finance task force.  More surprisingly, at the end of his speech the Minister said when the task force eventually reports, there might then be a need for another task force, I presume along the lines of what is proposed by Deputy McGrath, to examine the problem further.  With all due respect to the Minister for Finance, who is a good constituency colleague of mine, that does not indicate that the Government accepts the urgency which attaches to this problem.</p>  <p>  Over the past two years we have had debates, analysis, scrutiny and discussions, but now we need action. </p><p>It seems to me that a task force along the lines proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath, provided the Government's puts a time limit on it, would be the springboard to action in that regard.  Action is badly needed.  Other speakers have pointed out how the increased cost of insurance is eroding disposable income, costing jobs and damaging the economy.  It is a matter of great urgency, particularly when one considers the 35.5% increase in the past 12 months.  It is time to do something.  I urge the Government to accept the motion and to proceed with the task force without delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900015#N00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the motion on the cost of motor insurance.  It is most important that the Minister would accept the motion from Deputy Michael McGrath because of the seriousness of the situation currently and the pressure it is putting on so many individuals and families.  This is a concern that is raised with me on a regular basis by my constituents.  In the past week, one constituent highlighted to me that their motor insurance premium had increased from &euro;900 to &euro;1,300 on renewal.  The car in question is seven years old and the person has a full no claims bonus.  The issue is becoming most serious.  Another constituent who is in the commercial haulage business is now considering moving his headquarters abroad so that he will be in a position to secure more competitive insurance for his business and compete more effectively with other transnational haulage companies that have access to lower insurance costs.  As we know, consumers have been faced with an increase of 60% in the cost of their motor insurance since January 2014, and the situation is now becoming a critical one for Irish consumers and businesses, particularly haulage-related businesses.</p>  <p>  The increasing cost of insurance is also affecting our competitiveness, and action must be taken to reverse the trends that have emerged.  Not only has the increasing cost of insurance affected individuals, but it will also become a barrier to better maintaining or creating jobs in our economy.  The reductions in the universal social charge in the last budget will become meaningless if the benefit is cancelled out or even exceeded by the increase in the cost of motor insurance.  Much debate at election time revolves around tax cuts to help with living standards.  While that is very important, not enough emphasis is placed on the cost of living, which includes the cost of motor insurance.  We must focus on introducing polices that assist in reducing the cost of living and bring about a better standard of living.  The motion is designed to achieve that.  There is little point in sharing the benefits of a modest recovery by reducing taxes such as the USC if it is going to be cancelled by increases in motor insurance.  In effect, the reduction in the USC, and more in addition to that, is transferred to the coffers of the insurance companies, which further bolsters their profits.  Any reduction in the universal social charge should be a direct benefit to workers and should not be taken away by inflated insurance costs.  Giving more disposable income to workers is better for the economy and provides a stimulus for growth and a benefit to local businesses.  All our efforts should be focused on ensuring that we increase disposable incomes, which then become available to the economy, rather than having them grabbed by the motor insurance industry.</p>  <p>  There are 12 key elements in our action plan to tackle motor insurance costs, and I will focus on two of them.  First, we need to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB.  Given the previous track record of the MIAB, that seems to be an imperative action for the Government if we are to make progress in reducing motor insurance costs.  The board should be given a specific timeline to report to the D&aacute;il or an Oireachtas committee on its recommendations to tackle the high cost of motor insurance.  The board should comprise representatives from insurance firms, the Department of Finance and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, motorist representative bodies, haulage companies, representatives of older people and the Road Safety Authority to examine all relevant issues that affect motor insurance premiums.  The Motor Insurance Advisory Board established in the late 1990s put forward recommendations that helped reduce insurance costs by 40% in real terms between 2002 and 2013.  That was a significant achievement at the time and there is no good reason not to establish such a board again.</p>  <p>  Second, I wish to highlight the more vulnerable motorist.  Those on low incomes and older people who use their own transport are particularly vulnerable to increasing insurance premiums, as increases in insurance costs eat up a greater proportion of their disposable income.  Their income tends to be fixed, so if there is an increase in insurance costs they have less net income to survive and they become more vulnerable from a financial perspective, when we should be trying to make them more secure.  Recently, some insurance firms have begun to restrict the availability of cover to cars older than 14 years, which often affects those on lower incomes and older people.  Currently, individual insurers have the right to refuse cover, but it is not acceptable to have a blanket refusal to quote for business for vehicles older than 14 years.  That could be construed as a targeted attack on the most vulnerable motorists and people in society.  We must introduce legislation to limit the ability of insurance firms to refuse cover in such circumstances without a valid reason other than simply the age of the car.</p></speech>

They have 20 minutes.  I assume they will speak for four minutes each.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion and the issue of rising insurance costs.  Insurance costs have become a major issue facing motorists and the Government must explore every avenue to reduce insurance costs.  Over the past year, increases of 30% and beyond in insurance premiums have become an industry norm.  Figures released by Insurance Ireland show that the number of motorists denied quotes by three or more companies in the past two years has almost quadrupled, with no figures available for 2015 as yet.</p>  <p>  Serious challenges are presented to the sector given the cost of insurance and the difficulty in getting viable quotes.  Many leading companies are embarking on a policy not to ensure cars over 15 years old, and young drivers are experiencing extreme difficulties.  I welcome the action the Government has taken to curb the rise in insurance costs - namely, the establishment of a task force in the Department of Finance, which is carrying out a review of policy in the insurance sector.  It is clear that the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Departments, State bodies and private sector organisations.  I understand the task force is due to report back to the Minister shortly.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister held a meeting in his Department on the 3 December last with insurance industry representatives in response to the increasing cost of insurance.  However, while it is easy to highlight the problems, we must also put forward credible solutions.  High Court awards have increased and the Injuries Board does not seem to have the influence on claims that it used to have.  The book of quantum produced by the Injuries Board on the size of awards for various injuries has not been updated in the past ten years.  I know work is under way in that regard, but one new initiative would be international benchmarking.  For example, awards for whiplash account for 80% of motor insurance claims in this country, and awards amount to approximately &euro;15,000 here compared to &pound;5,000 in the UK.  We must review legal costs for litigated cases across the board, given that costs have increased sharply in recent years.  Reports by the industry that legal costs make up 60% of awarded claims are most worrying.</p>  <p>  We must guarantee that insurance fraud is tackled, as fraudulent cases have a significant impact on the industry as a whole.  It is estimated that uninsured driving represents an annual cost of &euro;60 million to the industry, and we must ensure maximum resources are available to eradicate such practices.  There can be no substitute for law enforcement.</p>  <p>  We must assess the possibility of an international benchmark of premiums.  We must also strengthen the PIAB.  We must recognise that the claims environment has changed dramatically and new powers are required.  Those include simple changes such as compelling claimants to provide loss of income information and to attend for medical assessment.  The Central Bank must ensure that greater transparency is provided by insurance companies in the information supplied to it.  We must also restore core competitive underwriting to ensure it becomes profitable again, as opposed to being subsidised by investment income.  Many of those ideas have been raised by industry experts in the media in recent months.  I am hopeful that the new task force will take all views into account prior to making its recommendations to the Minister.  I hope sustainable insurance premiums will be available to all.</p></speech>

Insurance costs in Ireland, both general and motor, have risen considerably in recent years, and figures from the Central Statistics Office show that insurance costs in Ireland have risen by almost 30% since 2011 with motor insurance prices rising almost 34% over the same period.  These rises are unsustainable and from dealing with my constituents, I am familiar with the true cost of rising insurance prices.  I have heard of cases in which premium prices have risen by 400% or even more.  I regularly hear of premium prices being quoted at &euro;4,000 and more for cars that are worth much less than that.  In one case, a constituent who drives a 2000 Polo with a 1-litre engine was given a quote of &euro;5,000 for insurance, which would be reduced to &euro;3,000 were he to install a driving monitor box.  He has a full driving licence and a no-claims bonus.  Other people who had been paying annual premiums of approximately &euro;500 are now being asked to pay premiums in excess of &euro;1,000 and in some cases are not being given quotations at all.</p>  <p>    It is my understanding that County Louth is one of the hardest hit areas when it comes to insurance premiums and this situation must not be allowed to continue.  Members must get to the bottom of why premiums are rising so dramatically, particularly over the past 12 months.  I welcome that the Department of Finance has a task force carrying out a review on the insurance industry, which will report to the Minister shortly.  This review is badly needed and I look forward to reading its findings.  I have spoken to various people in the insurance industry who have offered a number of reasons for rising insurance costs.  These include past underpricing in an effort to win market share, High Court awards and legal fees, the role of the Injuries Board, and an increase in the number of claims.  Moreover, in the past, there was subsidisation of competition on premiums by investment income and other measures.  In addition, claimants are now more likely to engage a solicitor to handle claims, resulting in claims taking longer to settle and in higher legal fees.  Another cause for concern is the incidence of fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  While I understand the reasons given by the insurance industry for increased premiums, I do not believe these costs alone could result in such dramatic increases in premiums.  As I stated earlier, I look forward to the findings of the task force put in place by the Department of Finance.  I believe radical reform is required, particularly in the areas of legal fees and awards given.  I believe both the awards given and the legal fees charged are too high.  It is estimated that legal fees can make up to 60% of the cost of claims.  This is too high and must be addressed.  We must also consider the area of fraud.  Fraud is costing the industry and although measures have been taken recently to address it, more is needed.  Members must get tough on fraud and it must not be allowed to be perceived to be acceptable.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I reiterate the point that serious reform is required in the insurance industry.  Members must tackle immediately the causes of rising insurance costs.  They must identify the causes of such a dramatic rise in insurance premiums and I believe we must reform the Injuries Board.  Finally, I look forward to the findings of the task force set up by the Department of Finance to examine the rising costs of insurance.  Members must act now to ensure that insurance costs are brought under control.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1343" speakername="Tony McLoughlin" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900016#O00200"><p>First, I congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and wish him well in his new position.  At the outset, I wish to record my anger, disgust and deep regret about some of the motor insurance quotations that are being issued nationally by most Irish insurance companies this year.  I also express my full support for this motion that has been proposed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and that calls for a task force to be established to investigate and take real action on this matter.  If anything is to come from Government support of this motion, it must be that it listened and took real action on the issues raised within the motion.  Some motor quotations I have seen in recent weeks are simply appalling.  Most quotes I have seen were increased by more than 60% for no reason whatsoever.  The drastic rise in insurance premiums is affecting all drivers on the road, as young and old drivers, returning immigrants and male and female drivers all are witnessing unfair and crippling increases.  No one is immune.</p>  <p>  In the case of young drivers, I met a young man from County Leitrim this week who had contacted me about his insurance.  He had a no-claims bonus for two years and no penalty points but this week was quoted a price of &euro;2,700 for motor insurance, which was an increase of more than &euro;1,200 from 2015.  Can anyone justify this rise?  How can this young person be expected to keep his part-time job, travel to football or make his way to college independently at such prices?  It is an absolute scandal.  As for older drivers, I also met another person from County Sligo who has been driving on a full licence since August 1972 with no accidents, claims or convictions.  In 2015, his full comprehensive policy with every conceivable extra, including no-claims protection and windscreen and breakdown cover, as well as with no penalty points, cost &euro;365.  This year, however, his quote for renewal was &euro;860.  This is utter madness.  Drivers of older cars also are being discriminated against by Irish insurance companies.  I am advised that neither Aviva Insurance nor Allianz Insurance will insure cars that are more than 15 years old.  The car in question was registered in 2000 or 2001 and if this is the case, what is the point of having a national car test at all?  A car that has passed an NCT should not be discriminated against by insurance companies and this should be made law.  I also have learned about issues affecting emigrants returning home, who are being told they have no right to their no claims bonuses from other countries.  Despite living in a technical age, one is advised that Irish insurance companies cannot receive such information from another company but I ask, why not?  I believe the current situation is spiralling out of control at a rapid pace.</p>  <p>  As Members of a national Parliament, Deputies must take urgent action to address this issue in the next few months as they would be failing their constituents otherwise, many of whom risk losing employment due to these increases.  While it is important to debate the reasons insurance companies believe they can charge such extortionate prices, my own understanding is the number of claims has increased and the value of compensation claims also is very high.  One also is told of the damaging effects false claims and the collapse of both Quinn Insurance and Setanta have had on the industry.  However, I do not believe Irish insurance companies can stand over the current level of increases due to these problems.  I believe what is at play here is a realignment of insurance prices by key players to levels that obtained before the introduction of low-cost providers in the early 2000s.  It appears there is now an opportunity to reset the industry and this is why such increases in the price of premiums are taking place.  Members must take on insurance companies that are charging these prices and must set up a task force that will make strong recommendations.  Moreover, strong Government action this issue is required.</p></speech>

This places further unsustainable pressure on people of all ages and all backgrounds, who frankly are struggling with the cost of living at present.  This, allied with a 9.2% rent increase across the board, is placing great pressure on people in respect of the cost of living and must be addressed urgently.  As such, I welcome this motion which is good and has good foresight.  The idea of establishing a task force with a view to taking action on the causes of the problems in the insurance sector is good.  I am glad to note it appears as though the motion has secured support from right around the House, which is heartening and goes to show the pursuit of new, consensus-driven politics.</p>  <p>  When one considers the problems and how they affect individuals, I certainly can state I have been inundated by people contacting me on the costs of their own insurance.  For example, a 19-year-old who had an insurance premium costing &euro;2,000 last year has now had the cost of his premium increased to &euro;3,200 this year, which is a stunning increase.  Similarly, I refer to a 54% increase in respect of a 1-litre Micra and a 70% increase on a 1.1-litre Yaris.  These are extraordinary increases being faced by people, young and old, working and unemployed, as well as students and people from all sorts of different walks of life.  It is incumbent on Members to examine the reasons for this and to try to address the root causes.  As such, I believe the task force is a good idea, as is strengthening the Injuries Board.  I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out that legal fees are making up to 60% of many claims.  This is an alarmingly high figure, but even more alarming is that eight out of every ten motor injury claims in Ireland are for whiplash.</p><p>In Ireland, the average whiplash claim is &euro;15,000 while, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, it is approximately one third of that in the United Kingdom.  It is less in other jurisdictions. </p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il motion is right to point out that nothing replaces increased road traffic enforcement in terms of getting uninsured cars off the road.  Such cars lead to an increase in costs for all those who work hard, play by the rules and insure their own vehicles.  It is incumbent upon us to bring about more enforcement.  We hope that the investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road traffic enforcement will go a long way towards achieving that.  </p> <p> In the limited time available I have spoken about the impact on individuals, as well as some of the welcome solutions that have been set out in this motion.  I welcome the motion and look forward to hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

I also welcomed this opportunity to hear contributions from other Members both yesterday and today.  It is clear that the rising cost of motor insurance is a shared concern across the House.</p>  <p>  As outlined yesterday by the Minister for Finance, the Government is not opposed to the Private Members' motion calling for a task force on motor insurance matters, which has been tabled for discussion both yesterday and today.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has highlighted that he has already established a task force in his Department to carry out a review of policy in the insurance sector.  This project will examine all of the issues relating to insurance policy and will include all of the matters raised in this discussion.  One of the major issues to be addressed by the task force is an examination of the factors which have led to the significant increase in motor insurance costs in recent years and, of course, to recommend what steps can be taken to influence the situation.</p>  <p>  Neither is the Government opposed to the amendment to the Private Members' motion.  The Government would welcome any discussions on the issues of insurance and the insurance industry in the new Oireachtas finance committee when it is formed, and will look at any legislative proposals that may arise from those discussions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has a task force in place which is addressing the issues raised.  Publication of the Department of Finance's report will be considered as soon as the Government has an opportunity to review it.  As the Minister outlined in his speech yesterday, the review of insurance policy will examine the issue of data and the need for more detailed information to be available regarding claims costs and insurance policy data.</p>  <p>  A Bill is currently being drafted on the merger of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pension Ombudsman.  The points raised in the amendment on increasing the power of the Financial Services Ombudsman could be examined under the pre-legislative scrutiny process for that Bill.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Central Bank, it should be remembered that the Oireachtas has the power under section 33AM of the Central Bank Act 1942 to call certain staff of the Central Bank, including the Governor and the head of financial regulation, to appear before a joint committee of the Oireachtas.  Those called shall provide that committee with such information as it requires, subject to certain conditions.  This provision was introduced under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</p>  <p>  On the call for a review of the Central Bank of Ireland regulation, it should be noted that the IMF has recently undertaken a detailed review of the Central Bank as part of its financial sector assessment programme.  This report examined all the supervisory areas of the bank, including insurance supervision, and it will be published over the summer months.</p>  <p>  A number of additional issues were raised in the House yesterday during the Members' contributions.  They span the work of several Departments and offices, and they will also be addressed as part of the current review.  These include the lack of a link between the national car test and the availability of insurance; insurance costs for the young and those over 65; the case for rural dwellers with no public transport to have car insurance at a reasonable cost; the issue of returning immigrants having difficulty obtaining car insurance; and the cost of insurance to taxi drivers, hackneys and hauliers.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is aware that certain groups are particularly affected by the increase in insurance costs.  The Department will undertake an examination of the underlying issues as part of its review.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance task force will report to the Minister for Finance shortly on the first phase of its work dealing with the insurance compensation framework.  This work is focused on developing an insurance compensation framework that will provide clarity and certainty regarding the insurance compensation framework in Ireland.  This work is being done jointly with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  The work of the task force will be completed over the coming months.  The outcome of the review will be to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  This work on insurance costs fits with the programme for a partnership Government commitment to a fairer society in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's review of the Injuries Board legislation aimed at strengthening the legislative framework in terms of operational issues.  I also welcome the review of the Injuries Board's book of quantum, which is expected as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The cost of meeting expected claims is one of the main drivers of insurance costs.  As the Minister for Finance stated yesterday, the Government welcomes proposals to reduce the uncertainty and volatility of the claims environment in Ireland.  This core issue is being examined by the Department's review of insurance policy.</p>  <p>  The Government will await the completion in the coming months of the existing Department of Finance insurance task force's work.  The Government will then consider what further longer-term options may be required, including the possible establishment of a broader structured task force on motor insurance, as outlined in the motion.</p>  <p>  I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this important issue concerning the rising cost of motor insurance.</p></speech>

The response, which has achieved consensus around the House, is based on stories we are all hearing from our constituents.  Many people have come to my constituency office to outline some really harrowing stories.</p>  <p>  There is a belief that motor insurance has probably risen by 35% across the board.  However, I have heard cases involving increases of between 60% and 100% where there has been no material change in the existing contracts, including the vehicle or any past history.</p>  <p>  The haulage sector has indicated that it is finding things difficult given the spiralling costs.  One particular haulier identified an increase of 160% in insurance costs.  Unlike others, he was in a position to challenge and fight the case, otherwise it would have put him out of business.  As a result of that, he succeeded in getting a much lower cost.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the insurance market is not functioning appropriately.  There is a lack of competition, as a result of which insurance companies are sitting on their hands.  They are getting the business in, passing costs on, and putting a margin in that people cannot afford.  </p>  <p>  When Quinn Insurance was in the market it changed the way business was done.  It had solvency issues which have created a significant cost for the State.  Quinn had an aggressive approach to the management of claims which, at the time, forced other companies to do the same.  The appropriate management of cases and claims has gone with the exit of Quinn from the sector.  Insurance companies now prefer to settle out of court - sometimes on the steps of the court - without an appropriate level of detailed investigation which would manage costs downwards.  The companies know that the market will carry that cost.  </p>  <p>  It can only be seen as an element of price gouging in recognising that the economy is improving in certain areas and that the burden can be carried by consumers.  The haulage sector was hard pressed and the Government responded by lowering truck taxes, yet that saving is now being eaten up by spiralling insurance costs.  In other jurisdictions the cost of insuring a truck varies from &euro;1,200 to &euro;2,500.  Here, however, it ranges from &euro;3,000 to &euro;6,000 per truck, or even higher.  That is not acceptable. </p>  <p>  A number of things need to be done over and above what is set out in the motion.  We need to examine claim management.  In addition, the book of quantum should be reviewed and used by the Judiciary.  We also require a greater level of consistency in terms of how courts deal with claims.  </p></speech>

Having listened to all of the contributions, it is obvious that the issue is a very real one in every constituency.  The anecdotal evidence includes examples of premiums doubling or trebling in some cases.  The CSO has confirmed that premiums have risen by 60% since the beginning of 2014 and by 24% in the past 12 months.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing our motion, it must be acknowledged that we are debating this matter because of inaction by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government.  As with so many other issues in the past, they failed to listen to warnings on this side of the House.  Consequently, motorists have continued to pay crippling and exorbitant premiums.  I will cite an example.</p><p>At the end of last year my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, during Leaders' Questions with the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, raised the need to establish this task force.  Her reply was that the price of petrol at the pumps was falling.  Quite simply, that showed the lack of priority that was given to it.  Last night, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirmed that the data available to her Department from the Injuries Board does not support the sector's claim regarding the volume and cost of claims.  However, less than 25% of claims go through the Injuries Board.  There is an issue in that regard.  The Department initiated a review of the Injuries Board in June 2014, but almost two years later the review is not complete.  The Minister said last night that she hopes to seek Government approval of a draft Bill before the end of the year.  What is the delay?  Meanwhile, motorists are facing exorbitant, crippling premiums.</p> <p> Last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, confirmed that he had been conscious of the issues for some time.  However, it took until two months ago to establish a review.  It is interesting how the review has suddenly become a task force.  In reply to many of the parliamentary questions tabled by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, it was always called a review.  There was no mention of a task force.  There is no clear timeframe for when this review is to report to the Minister.  Will it take the same length of time as the Department is taking to review the Injuries Board?  Will we be here two years hence still waiting for the conclusions of the review?  The time for procrastination is over.  It is time for action.</p> <p> Yesterday, our party published a comprehensive action plan to deal with the exorbitant cost of motor insurance.  One of its key pillars is the re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  We are not talking about reinventing the wheel.  There is no need to wonder whether it will work because we have evidence that it worked in the past.  When it was established in the early 2000s, the board contributed significantly to the reduction of premiums by approximately 40% between 2002 and 2013.</p> <p> As a previous speaker indicated, we have all been contacted by various representatives of the different stakeholders to tell us it is not their fault that the cost of premiums is increasing.  It is not the legal profession's fault and it is not the result of the insurance companies gouging people and seeking to increase their profits.  While each stakeholder blames the other, the end user is being crippled.  This is crippling jobs and having an impact on the cost of living and people's quality of life.  A rural constituency such as mine does not have public transport.  People need their cars to go to the shops, to work, to church or wherever they must go.  At present, the cost of insurance is preventing people from using their cars, and it is preventing people who have two cars from using the second vehicle.  We cannot wait, therefore, for an unknown length of time for a review - that suddenly has been ramped up to a task force - to report back on what must be done.  The time for debate is over.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whom I wish well in his new role, concluded by thanking Members for the opportunity to debate this important issue.  We need not debate it further.  We know what are the issues.  What we need is action.  By virtue of the fact that the Government is not opposing this motion, it is accepting its content.  It is accepting the proposal to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  We will return in a number of months to ask the Government what action it has taken to ensure that the men and women we represent do not continue to pay crippling motor insurance costs indefinitely into the future.  They have been paying such costs for the past two years, which is too long.  The time for that is over, as is the time for debate.  The time for action is now.  We will return before the summer recess to ask the Government what it has done with regard to the motion that the D&aacute;il is now going to pass.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900018#Q00700"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland's accession to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a Battlegroup to be made available to the European Union in the second half of the year 2016.</blockquote><p>Ireland's participation in the UK-led EU battle group is set in the context of our long-standing national policy.  The term &quot;battle group&quot; is an unfortunate title.  It is a technical military term intended to describe the size of the force rather that its role.  The term does not accurately portray the tasks which such groups, if deployed, can carry out.  They are designed to react rapidly to crisis situations and the tasks that are carried out relate to peacekeeping, conflict prevention and assistance to humanitarian operations.  When it comes to these tasks, our national policy recognises the primacy of the United Nations.  This is recognised in our triple-lock mechanism.</p><p>In terms of EU policy, it is my view and that of the Government that the United Nations must continue to be the partner of choice for the EU.  It is important, therefore, that we maintain a close engagement and collaborative relationship with the UN.  Our traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected<b></b>by our involvement in EU battle groups.  The establishment of EU battle groups is something the UN recognises and supports, as they facilitate rapid responses to emerging crisis situations.  This is a key objective of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.</p><p>The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty.  These operations, known as the Petersberg Tasks, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  In the Lisbon treaty, these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile states, conflict prevention, and post-conflict stabilisation.</p><p>A central plank of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council when it comes to international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups is another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.</p> <p> The Defence Forces' contribution to this battle group will comprises five staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters located at Northwood and Catterick in the UK where they will be engaged in training and planning activities.  The UK battle group memorandum of understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Cyprus.  It sets out principles relating to the operation, deployment and management of the UK battle group.  Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deal with the definitions and reference documents that are applicable to this memorandum of understanding.  Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and the operation of the battle group.  One important issue to note is that each participating country retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each participant retains the right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the UK battle group will still be subject to a UN mandate and Government approval and this will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding.  While D&aacute;il approval is only required in respect of deployments of 12 or more personnel, in the event that any decision might be required on an actual deployment, I will be happy to facilitate discussion in the House in such circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this particular EU battle group is five.  Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities.  Sections 14 to 16, inclusive, deal with the process of participation of additional states in the battle group, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the memorandum of understanding and the process for dispute resolution.</p> <p> The memorandum of understanding is similar to those Ireland has previously signed for the 2008, 2011 and 2015 Nordic battle groups, as well as the 2012 Austro-German battle group.  While no battle group has deployed to date, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits in terms of developing improved inter-operability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  It enables Irish personnel to take part in exercises and develop expertise which adds to our ability to work in partnership with other countries on UN peacekeeping missions.  </p> <p> The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.  Ireland's participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces.  It also enhances Ireland's credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  It reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union's common security and defence policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.  Our involvement continues Ireland's proud tradition of participation in international peace keeping operations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900019#R00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on his new responsibilities and wish him all the best in this new role.  Furthermore, I express my thanks to the Minister of State and his officials for the general defence briefing I received last week.  It is clear that the Minister of State will be well served by his officials and I greatly appreciate the courtesy shown to me by him and his officials.</p>  <p>  This is my first outing in this House as my party's spokesperson on defence and it is a great honour for me, especially in view of my own service in the Reserve Defence Force for many years.  I want to say very clearly to all my friends, and now former colleagues, in the Defence Forces, regardless of whether they are Permanent or Reserve, that my party and I value their work and take enormous pride in their achievements at home and abroad.  We are on their side.  We firmly believe that our Defence Forces are of critical importance for both State and society and it is my view that we need greater appreciation of the social benefits for both the community and members of our Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In that light and on the basis of that belief, I want to give the following message to the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I wish to make it clear to him that I mean him no disrespect whatsoever because the allocation of political responsibility for defence is not his decision.  There is great disappointment in the Defence Forces at the absence of a Cabinet-level Minister for Defence.  While the Taoiseach is nominally the Minister for Defence, he has effectively subcontracted out the Department to a Minister of State.  It is not good enough and it clearly indicates that the Government does not properly value and respect the Defence Forces.  I am sorry to have to say this but this is the reality and it would be remiss of me to let this opportunity pass without mentioning it.  </p>  <p>  Five years ago, the Taoiseach got it wrong when he gave the same Cabinet Minister responsibility for justice and defence, despite it being a norm in democratic countries to separate political responsibility for the military and the police.  He rectified that mistake in 2014 and I hope he rectifies this latest mistake at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Turning to the motion, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to strengthening the Defence Forces in terms of numbers and in capability.  Part of this involves participation in battle groups, which we in Fianna F&aacute;il support.  We support this motion, just as we supported the motion last October.  The participation of our forces in this battle group is far more modest than when D&aacute;il approval was sought last year when 175 members were due to be involved.  On this occasion, the D&aacute;il is approving the involvement of five personnel.</p>  <p>  Participation in battle groups presents a valuable opportunity for our soldiers to enhance their skills and for us to maintain modern defence forces.  Every time we participate in such a group, there are the usual warnings about our neutrality being undermined.  We obviously do not accept this position.  Any actual Irish participation in a battle group action can only take place under the same auspices as any other overseas participation - that the triple lock comes into play, namely, the approval of the Government, the D&aacute;il and the mission being endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.  Support for and retention of the triple lock prior to the deployment of the Defence Forces is a fundamental element of Fianna F&aacute;il defence policy and we hope it is fully endorsed by the Fine Gael party in government.</p>  <p>  We have rightly given primacy to the UN since we joined more than 60 years ago.  In that time, we have worked with other UN members to support international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, humanitarian actions and human rights implementation.  We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the United Nations.  We have a long tradition of overseas service in support of UN or UN-mandated deployments in pursuit of international peace and security since the first Defence Forces deployment abroad in 1958 and the battle group continues this tradition.  Thus far, of course, no EU battle group has deployed in a mandated mission.</p>  <p>  As Fianna F&aacute;il has pointed out previously, overseas service deployments by the Defence Forces are a pivotal element of both Irish foreign policy and for the attainment of Defence Forces operational capability across a wide spectrum of challenging military, geopolitical and geo-strategic environments.  Our Defence Forces personnel of all ranks have shined, and continue to shine, in overseas deployments.  We are internationally recognised for the high quality of our Defence Forces members.  The sustained participation of Defence Forces members is indispensable for individual and unit professional development, unit operational viability and cohesion.</p>  <p>  The nature of overseas deployments since 1958 has, of course, changed substantially over the decades and yet they have been perceived by the public as being mainly a form of "armed humanitarianism".  There is, of course, far more to it than that.  Military service, most particularly in the trouble spots of the world where the Defence Forces now deploy, is dangerous and challenging.  We must always keep that in mind and that means that our military personnel need to be trained, armed, equipped, resourced, led and supported appropriately.</p>  <p>  My party and I are happy to support this motion, just as we are happy to support our Defence Forces in their endeavours on our behalf.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; m&eacute; mar urlabhra&iacute; mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ar cheisteanna cosanta ag amanna difri&uacute;la thar na blianta.  The motion deals with Ireland's participation in the EU battle group, which is led by the UK and also comprises Cyprus, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden.  It permits the Government to agree to the deployment of soldiers to an EU battle group meaning a contingent of our military personnel will form part of a battalion-sized force of 1,500 soldiers complete with the combat supports required.</p><p>These are aptly named battle groups because they allow the EU to project its military might by retaining its capacity to rapidly deploy combat-ready troops to regions across the globe.  Their primary purpose is to go into battle on behalf of the EU wherever post-colonial powers such as Britain decide such action is necessary.  Can we imagine the EU going to war?  Some people cannot, but there are warmongers in Europe and abroad who would be quick to embroil the EU and its countries in external wars.  We only have to look at recent history to see occasions upon which similar warmongers wanted the EU to embroil itself in wars not of its making and not of major relevance to it.  Recently, there were the disputes between Russia and Ukraine and Russian and Georgia.  One should look at the history of some of the member states we would be joining in an EU battle group and the stance they took in Syria, Libya, Iraq and elsewhere in that region.  They supposedly aligned themselves with democratic rebels, and we have seen the consequences of that in the world.  </p> <p> Ireland should have and has had quite an honourable tradition in the UN.  We would be best placed to try to enhance our role in the UN and to work with it in peacekeeping, rather than enforcing peace or taking sides as the EU battle group would be doing in the future.  We have a proud tradition and our soldiers have performed peacekeeping duties right around the world.  All one has to do is look at the recent operations by our Naval Service and its contribution to the rescue missions in the Mediterranean to see the role our Defence Forces should have.  They are aptly named the Defence Forces because their role is the defence of Ireland, not the defence of everywhere else in the world.  We are a small nation and our Defence Forces have been starved of investment in many ways.  In the rest of Europe there has been huge growth over the last number of decades, and spending on armaments has continued to grow.  While we have seen famines and crises in terms of poverty throughout the world, those modernised countries that would have us invest money in a battle group are spending money that would save lives on increasing their armaments and their capabilities.  That is the biggest disgrace of the concept of the EU battle groups.  Rather than investing in the UN and its poverty eradication programmes or investing in the UN so it can become fully effective, we have aligned ourselves to those who would create another military institution similar to NATO and other Cold War institutions that should be gotten rid of.  At this stage, the role of progressive states in the world should be to enhance the UN rather than undermine it by creating competing military complexes such as the EU battle groups concept.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900020#S00200"><p>At a time like this, when we are debating and presumably voting on the allocation of five Irish soldiers to participate in a British-led battle group, which I presume will include British paratroopers - the Minister may be able to clarify that - we should remind ourselves of every time we raised the nature of the European Union in discussions.  In debates about the Lisbon treaty and the prospect of the militarisation of Europe, we were laughed at and ridiculed.  Straw men were put up saying that we were saying that everyone was going to be conscripted into a European army when nobody was saying that.  These are battle groups; they are not peace groups.  They are the ability of the European Union to put 50,000 troops on the ground anywhere in the world within five days.  To what purposes can they be put on the ground?  I will read the relevant section of the Treaty on the European Union, which says:</p><blockquote>The tasks ... in the course of which the Union may use civilian and military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks ... All these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories. </blockquote><p>That was added by the Lisbon treaty and it broadens the definition of what battle groups can do.  The fight against terrorism is the pretext <i>du jour</i>for imperialist interventions, led by France in Mali and others in the Middle East.  Nobody goes to war anymore for colonial interest; they always go to war to prevent terrorism.  </p><p>Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, a former secretary general of NATO said:</p><blockquote>EU Battle Groups could be used to go to war.  Why did the EU create the Battle Group?  It is not just to help rebuild a country.  The Battle Groups are not for building schools.  We should not think the EU is for soft power and NATO for tough power.</blockquote><p>There it is in black and white.  That is how the military, political and economic establishment in Europe and around the world view these battle groups and it is a disgrace that the Government would propose, and the D&aacute;il presumably would agree to, Irish participation in yet another battle group that can be used against so-called terrorism.  Unfortunately, the Government and previous Governments makes a lie of the idea of Ireland's neutrality.  That happens in many different ways in terms of the battle groups.  It also happens through the use of Shannon Airport.  It is against the wishes of the vast majority of people in this country and we should reject the motion.  We should not be participating in any battle groups whatsoever. </p></speech>

We are not and will not become part of any military alliance or permanent military formation.  We will not enter into any mutual defence arrangement. </blockquote><p>How then do we explain Ireland's membership of the EU battlegroup or our partnership with NATO?  Fine Gael, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, further ensured the D&aacute;il that any deployment of an Irish contribution as part of the German battlegroup will be subject to the triple lock of the Government, the D&aacute;il and a UN mandate before deployment occurs.  How do we explain the fact that in May this year <i>The Sunday Times</i>reported that 300 soldiers from Ireland, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland and Sweden had taken part in 18 days of war games on Salisbury plain in England in an EU battlegroup led by the British army?  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann agreed in 2015 to the deployment of troops in an EU battlegroup led by Germany, how did we end up deploying troops in war games in a battlegroup led by the British army?  If there is no D&aacute;il oversight on decision making on deployment of troops to EU battlegroups how can we trust in the ongoing commitment of the Government to provide the protection afforded by the triple lock?  The ongoing alliance of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il with the military formations in the EU and NATO directly contradicts our neutrality, associates us with aggression abroad, particularly in the Middle East, and will endanger Irish troops who take part in genuine peace keeping missions by undermining their claim to a genuine neutrality.  </p><p>Ireland should withdraw from the EU battlegroups, NATO partnerships including the use of Shannon by the US, and, as Denmark has done, from further participation in US militarisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900020#S00400"><p>The proposition before us is an affront to the concept of our neutrality.  It is in line with other daily occurrences where we see the US military using our airport in Shannon in spite of our neutrality.  We see other examples where Irish Defence Forces personnel are sent and kept in Afghanistan to support NATO led initiatives, its resolute support mission and so on.  We are told that these initiatives are taken in countries like Afghanistan to ensure the security of the population and to support its Government.  The reality is that our troops have been present in a country where the so-called Government has no mandate or say and which is divided between ISIS on the one hand and the Taliban on the other.  We should have no hand, act or part in participating there, no more than we should have in the idea of participating in the EU battle groups.</p><p>Initially, these groups were established with 1,500 combat soldiers assigned to each one.  The point has been made that to allow for back-up on rotation, there were another seven to nine soldiers for each combat soldier so, in effect, a battle group is a military force of 12,000 troops.  The numbers have extended from their original concept and the size has increased to more than 3,000.  Given that two are made ready approximately every six months, in effect, the European Union is developing an armed force of almost 50,000 troops ready to be sent anywhere in the world.  That is happy days for those in the arms industry who are the main beneficiaries of this situation.</p> <p> The record is well known that EU battle groups could be used to go to war.  Why else would they have been established?  Generally, they were initiated on the basis of being nationally based or made up of troops from adjoining countries, which would lead Britain to be the logical ally for Ireland in that context.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il was in power when this arose originally and it had a problem because the idea of Irish troops fighting alongside those from Great Britain was anathema at that time and could not be envisaged.  Obviously, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael supported the Good Friday Agreement and believed that, eventually, the time would be right when this proposition could be considered.  It is clear that the Government believes the time is right now.</p> <p> I am not a nationalist; I have no interest in nationalism.  I am an internationalist and someone who believes profoundly in our neutrality.  It does not matter to me whether we join a UK battle group, the Russian forces or the American forces.  They are all the same as far as I am concerned but there is a certain irony in the idea that in 2016, we would align ourselves with a UK battle group 100 years on from when the likes of John Redmond sent 50,000 young Irishmen to be slaughtered in the First World War, as part of the British army.  As a pacifist, I find that reprehensible.</p> <p> It is a fact that NATO and the EU battle groups are synonymous, one and the other.  They are the new breed of enforcing imperial power and we, as a neutral country, should have no part in that whatsoever.  We only have to read the words of the UK Minister of Defence in 2005, in a letter to the House of Commons, when he described the UK battle groups as being mutually reinforcing with the larger NATO Response Force, and having the potential to act as a stepping stone for countries that want to contribute to the NATO Response Force, by developing their high readiness forces to the required standard and integrating small countries' contribution to the multinational units.  Wherever possible and applicable, standards, practical methods and procedures for battle groups are analogous to those defined in the NATO RF.  Correctly managed, there is considerable potential for synergy between the two initiatives.</p> <p> That is what we are talking about and that is the end game in terms of these battle groups.  A link between NATO and EU military formations is confirmed.  The battle groups allow small countries, such as Ireland, to become integrated in those structures in a manner in which they would not be otherwise.  Other EU countries like Malta and Denmark have no part in these formations.  We should have no part in them either.  I strenuously oppose the initiative.</p></speech>

My contribution will be short because I was delighted to read the Minister's statement, which clarified some issues for me, but as a former Minister for Defence, I am deeply concerned that our image as peacekeepers should not be damaged by any titles or otherwise.  It is very unfortunate that this group is termed a battle group.  On reading the Minister's speech, it is clear that it is an extension of our peacekeeping missions.  I wanted to intervene to ask the Minister to ask that the title given to these groups should not be "battle groups" as it immediately sends the wrong message and causes alarm bells to ring unnecessarily in terms of the role these people will be asked to perform.</p>  <p>  We can argue here whether Ireland wants to be neutral or not.  I believe strongly that Ireland should remain neutral.  I strongly believe also that we can do more for peace in the world by upholding our great image and professionalism in peacekeeping.  We have a peacekeeping college on the Curragh where people come from all parts of the world to learn about peacekeeping methods.  That is vitally important for Ireland but it is very unfortunate that this group within the European Union should be entitled a battle group.  If it is concerned with security and peacekeeping, that is different from a battle group.  It rings alarm bells unnecessarily throughout the country, which is world renowned for its peacekeeping.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my contribution is solely to ask the Minister to indicate, when replying, if efforts could be made to change the title of these groups which will, in fact, be engaged in peacekeeping exercises.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900023#V00200"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That the amendments and additions to the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business contained in the Report of the sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform regarding changes to Standing Orders (which was laid before the D&aacute;il on 8th June, 2016) be adopted, with effect from the dates outlined in the report.</blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion before the House to amend D&aacute;il Standing Orders on the basis of the final report of the Sub-committee on D&aacute;il Reform<font color="#FF0000"> </font>that was established on the first sitting day of this D&aacute;il.  When this D&aacute;il met on 10 March, an all-party motion establishing the committee, which was chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, was passed.  The committee was established by consensus in this House and in the main for the last nine weeks it has worked by consensus.  It was tasked with reviewing the way our Parliament works and identifying a set of reforms that could and will be introduced to strengthen it.  In May the committee, after a number of detailed meetings, published a draft report, which was debated in this House.</p><p>The committee met again following debate in the House to finalise the report.  The members of the committee,  who came from across the House, were very conscious of the issues raised by Members in that debate when they decided on the final report.  The motion before the House today is a result of the work of 19 committee members from across the parties and groups in the D&aacute;il who, under the able and patient chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, worked over the last three months to review the way our Parliament works and to prepare a report which sets out, in detail, a package of reforms which I believe will radically change for the better the way the Oireachtas operates.</p> <p> The motion before the House today seeks to build on the reforms introduced in the past and to work to create a parliament which is more effective and more efficient.  The fact that the general election this year produced a D&aacute;il where no one party has a majority and where this Fine Gael led partnership minority Government is committed to working in partnership with all Members of the Oireachtas means that we need a new way of doing business.  As a group of 158 Deputies elected by the people, we have a duty to ensure that this D&aacute;il works.  The proposed changes will empower the Oireachtas like never before.  The changes will give our Parliament a stronger voice and make Government more accountable to it.</p> <p> The establishment of a D&aacute;il business committee will give all Deputies a greater voice in the business of the D&aacute;il and allow a fairer distribution of D&aacute;il time between the Opposition and the sitting Government.  The D&aacute;il will establish stronger committees which will work in a better way with the Chamber.  Oireachtas committee meetings and the D&aacute;il plenary sessions will no longer clash.  Oireachtas committees will now meet on Tuesday evenings and Wednesday and Thursday mornings with the D&aacute;il sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons and evenings.  The new split will finally end the problem of Oireachtas committees clashing with important debates in the D&aacute;il and Deputies being forced to choose between the two or to run up and down the corridors and stairs of the House to try and make it in time for votes.</p> <p> The D&aacute;il will enhance the legislative process in the Oireachtas.  The D&aacute;il will establish new structures for Leaders' Questions, Taoiseach's Questions, ministerial Questions and Topical Issues.  The D&aacute;il will establish a fixed time each week for taking all divisions on Thursday afternoons and Members may formally abstain in a vote which will aid in achieving more family friendly hours and working conditions in the House.  These reforms are a major step in the direction of creating an Oireachtas that is stronger and more representative of the people elected to it while allowing Government to carry on the work with which it is charged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900024#W00200"><p>The culmination of 14 meetings of the D&aacute;il reform committee has led to the proposal regarding Standing Orders that will affect the main changes agreed by the committee.  It was a pleasure to serve on that committee with a very diverse group of Deputies from across the House with different political backgrounds and different views on issues but all were focused on bringing about much needed and long awaited reform.  It shows how well the committee worked that only once was it actually divided by way of a vote.  I am not completely happy with everything in it, if I am to be honest, but there are significant changes proposed: the establishment of the budget oversight committee, an independent budgetary office established on a statutory basis; the office of independent parliamentary legal advice, again established on a statutory basis; and by fixing of the mess of the committees of the last D&aacute;il and Seanad by making the committees sectoral and aligned to Government Departments and restricted to membership of 11 - seven Deputies and four Senators - so the committees will not have membership of 29 and 30 people where members cannot contribute properly.  It will afford a much better representation of how the public voted in the general election to ensure that legislation can be passed from the Government or the Opposition side and that Bills will now no longer be allowed to die on the vine after passing Second Stage.  Bills will now have to get to the next stage within ten weeks of that passing.  It is also important that the allocation of speaking time, oral and priority questions and Private Members' business is done on a proportionate basis to reflect the vote of the people in the last general election.</p>  <p>  In the main I would support all the changes to Standing Orders that are proposed on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I will wait to see how one or two items actually work in practice.  The Ceann Comhairle has said, as have many others at the reform committee meetings, that this is not the end of D&aacute;il reform.  The reform committee will meet next week and again at the end of this D&aacute;il session before the summer recess.  The committee will remain in place to ensure the reforms being brought forward are working and where they are not working that they will be changed.  It is open to the committee, at a future stage, to propose further amendments to Standing Orders should that be desirable or required at the time.  I am extremely pleased with most of the proposed changes that have been brought forward.  It is now the job of Members to work within this new reality.  The rules are now changed to allow us to do so and the mindset of all Members needs to change also in how we operate within this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Seanad met yesterday for the first day.  It is important, and I have said this to the Ceann Comhairle, that Seanad reform is also required.  The Oireachtas is not just the D&aacute;il, it is the D&aacute;il, Seanad and Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  The Seanad needs to be reformed and made further relevant.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support each of the Standing Orders as set out by the committee.  I commend in particular the Ceann Comhairle on the efficient and inclusive manner in which he has chaired these meetings.  I commend all of those who served on the committee.  I found it to be a most interesting and, in the main, enjoyable experience.  All of us know that the public want us to change the way we do business in the House and this report on D&aacute;il reform and the changes being brought forward will bring us a step closer to that.  However, we need to continue to ensure that we are committed to reform and to look at how the rules are working and where they are not working in order to change it.  It is vitally important that the parliamentary legal advice office is staffed to its requirement as soon as possible to allow opposition Bills have the same weight as Government Bills and to be written and drafted to the same quality.  Opposition Bills will pass through this D&aacute;il and we have to ensure they stack up.  That is a priority.  The independent budgetary office is also a priority in order to change the way that our budget is formed and framed so it is not just one big hit in October and that the budget is more inclusive of all political views in the House. </p></speech>

Uaireanta n&iacute; thuigeann siad go d&iacute;reach cad at&aacute; ar bun againn san &aacute;it seo.  D&eacute;ile&aacute;il an coiste go maith leis an gceist agus d'&eacute;irigh linn teacht ar sraith rialacha nua a chuideoidh linn an gn&oacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh againn san &aacute;it seo a dh&eacute;anamh amach anseo.  I hope that I contributed positively in my work with the committee on D&aacute;il reform.  I undertook the work diligently, put forward my own proposals and I listened to the proposals of others.  The benefit of the committee was that people brought their practical experience of the House and those who were new to the House brought ideas.  Some of us were able to tease the ideas out and show if they could work or not.  Any change to the rules in this institution has consequences that are often unforeseen.  The committee has managed to put together the first raft, hopefully, of changes which will benefit not only Members but also the public who will receive a more effective and efficient D&aacute;il.  Ba mhaith liom d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa D&aacute;il amach anseo.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go gcomhl&iacute;onfar na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn agus go bhfeicfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; reachta&iacute;ochta agus meamraim m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in as Gaeilge ag teacht os &aacute;r gcomhair.  T&aacute; moladh d&eacute;anta againn freisin go mbeidh coiste ann le d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an Ghaeilge agus is c&eacute;im mh&oacute;r chun tosaigh &iacute; sin.  There are many issues that remain to be addressed and the commitment by the Ceann Comhairle that this is not the end of D&aacute;il reform will hopefully be lived up to.</p><p>I have been here long enough to hear of previous commitments, but I believe an Ceann Comhairle when he says that we will come back to some of the issues, because they are consequential on some of the changes.  We are all eager to ensure what we have changed will work.</p> <p> I believe that in some instances there will be practical problems.  For instance, the proposal for promised legislation allows for 15 minutes' discussion.  If we take it that the Minister and a leader between them have two minutes and there are now eight groups, 16 minutes are already gone, meaning other Deputies will not get to speak on promised legislation on Wednesdays or Thursdays were all the leaders to take their slots.  That is a practical problem but there are solutions and we will examine the issue again.  Other practical problems have also emerged.</p> <p> I express my support for the amendment but if we accept Deputy Daly's amendment, other consequential changes need to be made.  These changes relate to how political parties are registered, how a leader's allowance travels, whether he or she is in a political party and leaves or he or she joins a political party, the allocation of secretarial assistants and the allocation of committee chairs.  If we accept this change, and I hope we accept it, these are all consequential steps to be taken to put in place a more robust recognition process which deals with political parties and the questions I raised.  Further, we cannot have a situation where people are jumping in and out of parties.  There needs to be a cooling down period.  We need to get to grips with this quickly, because the public have told us who are in, if one wants, established political parties that there needs to be a change.  They voted for small parties, big parties and also quite a number of Independents.  Some of those Independents over time will join other parties or will stay independent.  However, there are consequences and we should not put in place rules that restrict them or discriminate against them.</p> <p> Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas ar&iacute;s leo si&uacute;d a d'oibrigh liom ar an gcoiste, ach go h&aacute;irithe an Ceann Comhairle as an obair a dhein s&eacute;.

I think I am the first person to speak who was not a member.  Therefore, on behalf of all Members, I thank those who served on the committee as well as the Ceann Comhairle for the work they did.  I include in that regard my colleague and party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who unfortunately cannot contribute at the moment.</p>  <p>  This is very much an agreed package and we in the Labour Party will co-operate with it.  That the business committee will be operating by consensus is important and will work to ensure we have a smooth running of business in this Chamber which works in the interests, above all, of the people we represent.  It will in some ways take time to find its feet and we need to ensure we all co-operate from all sides to ensure it operates smoothly.  As previous speakers stated, we want to ensure this is a working D&aacute;il that does the business on behalf of the people.  There has sometimes been some scepticism from the public around what goes on in here.  I sincerely hope these changes will help to ensure it works well.</p>  <p>  The Chief Whip referred to the family-friendly aspect in her introductory contribution.  This is important but, inevitably, there will have to be compromise.  What is family-friendly to someone living in Dublin is not necessarily family-friendly to someone living in Kerry, Donegal or west Mayo.  We have to find a compromise for people who live where I live, for example.  We would probably like to start early in the morning on Wednesdays and Thursdays and finish late in the evening on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and get back to our constituencies as early as possible.  For people living in Dublin, family-friendly is something different.  Inevitably, therefore, compromise will be required.  It is a national assembly so we have to find that balance and, overall, the committee has achieved it.</p>  <p>  There are other elements of the reform package, for example, the revamped legal services.  These were also referred to by a previous speaker.  These services are very important, particularly because we will now have Bills from the Opposition which will be able to travel more easily in the current configuration of the D&aacute;il.  It will be important that Members who are bringing Bills forward who are not members of Government and therefore do not have the legal advice of the Attorney General and legal sections of Departments have independent legal advice.  This section is, therefore, very important, as are the budgetary office proposals.  I understand, however, that they are the responsibility of the Oireachtas Commission rather than something for the Standing Orders.  It will, therefore, be important that the Oireachtas Commission gets up and running.  I do not know if the Chief Whip will be able to respond but there was a suggestion it might not meet until September.  Will she provide clarity on the matter and confirm that it will meet as soon as possible in order that we can get these reforms up and running?  I also support what Deputy O'Brien said about the committees and ensuring they are effective and work properly in relation to the various Departments and Ministers engaging with them on business and legislation.</p>  <p>  Certain powers are available to the Chair under these revised Standing Orders only when the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is in the Chair.  Deputy Eugene Murphy is acting as Chairman now, but some of the powers cannot be exercised except by the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I, therefore, want to make the point again that we need to remedy the deficiency with regard to the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Four Members were proposed last week but none of them succeeded in getting a majority in this House.  We need to address that area.</p>  <p>  Overall, on behalf of the Labour Party and my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I welcome the Standing Orders before us today and indicate that we will be fully supportive.</p></speech>

I participated in all the meetings of the Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, so I do not have a whole lot to add at this stage.  However, I add my voice to the thanks to the Ceann Comhairle and all the staff involved who did a huge amount of work in terms of turning around papers, proposals and draft Standing Orders at very short notice and translating difficult discussions into concrete proposals in black and white on which we could then decide.  It was excellent work on their part.  We are nearly finished the process of D&aacute;il reform in terms of this particular set of packages.  I agree that it has to continue but even within this package there are other bits and pieces to come in terms of the written explanation of votes and so on being added to Standing Orders.</p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il reform committee was extremely limited by the basis on which it was set up.  It was set up to examine D&aacute;il reform, but we need something much more substantial.  We need a radical change in terms of how our democracy works, with a real transfer of power to people.  For example, such change could include an ability to initiate a referendum if a certain number of people sign a document or an ability for people to recall Deputies who break their electoral mandates and so on.</p>  <p>  What was attempted in the D&aacute;il reform process?  There was a pressure on all the parties, in particular the establishment parties, to reflect the reality of the election, the fact the two and a half party system we had in this country is gone and finished, that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael combined have less than 50% of the vote and the fact a number of small parties and Independents were elected.  There was pressure on those people to have their voices heard in the D&aacute;il.  This effort was an attempt in that regard and it goes some way towards it, but we will need to review it.</p><p> I would like to highlight some of the changes that I believe are important.  The change to Leaders' Questions to allow for four questions per day is an important, progressive reform.  It means all groups will be able to speak on a rotational basis.  While it is not strictly relevant to Standing Orders I believe a time limit should be imposed in respect of Leaders' Questions such that the first couple of questions do not take up an enormous amount of time and thereby result in the third or fourth question not being taken.</p> <p> The ability to abstain is in a sense a small thing but it allows people to express themselves politically in a way that often cannot be done by a binary "Yes-No" system.  People may feel the need to abstain and explain their reason for so doing.</p> <p> The business committee is important.  Given the manner in which it is being set up in the Standing Orders, it is essential that the Government Chief Whip listens to what is being said by others at the business committee and takes it on board.  Under Standing Orders as currently drafted, the business committee is required to get consensus on a Government proposal, or not, with dissent on the Government proposal going to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  While obviously under the current D&aacute;il such a proposal could be defeated that might not necessarily be the case in future D&aacute;il arrangements.  </p> <p> My next point relates to the business committee.  Private Members' motions previously taken every second Friday will now be taken every Thursday, with motions for discussion to be chosen by the business committee.  We should strongly encourage the committee to use the lottery system used previously as it is the fairest way of operating.  I would like finally to comment on some of the points of controversy that arose at the end of the process.  One of the questions that arose was whether it is correct that political parties take precedence in order of speaking to groupings that are not political parties.  I maintain that it is correct.  I believe that people stand on a political mandate.  As a member of a party they stand on a national mandate.  As they receive votes from all over the country their mandate is a national one.  I do not believe they should get additional time or rights but I do believe they should take precedence over technical groupings of Independents.  Linked to that is the question of whether that precedence can be trumped by people moving between groups or from a non-group to a political grouping following an election.  I think it is correct for us to place a premium on the expression of the will of the people, be that through a general election or a by-election, and to say that this determines the order of speaking rights.  I believe that is appropriate and that it gives due weight to the role of the electorate in choosing on the basis of the mandate that people seek and the programmes on which people stand to order parties in a particular way.</p></speech>

The general principles in the reform document have been broadly discussed here and broadly welcomed.  The initiative of the grouping was positive.  On the last occasion this issue was before the House, the point was made that in some ways the reforms go a good bit of the way towards reflecting the new political reality in that they transfer power from the Government to the Oireachtas, which is welcome.  Interestingly, during the last debate in the House on this issue a large number of Deputies made the point that they only go a bit of the way because the current system still serves to guard and protect the privilege of parties, which to me is inherently undemocratic.  It is inherently archaic and is hankering after an old system that is unravelling not only in Ireland but across Europe.  </p><p>It is ironic that the people who made the point about an electoral mandate and a national mandate are members of the small groupings which comprise only a small number of Deputies.  The larger parties did not tend to make that point because the national mandate was evident in the number of seats those parties got.  In that sense, size does matter.  In this matter, it is decisive.  I am glad that this is being reflected in the concept of proportionality.  It is accurate that this be done.  What was being put forward by the groups was that in giving parties precedence it was not just parties that were being given precedence but parties with more than five members elected.  For example, the Green Party could have a national vote in excess of that of the AAA-PBP but because it does not have as many Deputies it would not get party precedence, even though it could be argued that it has a greater national mandate.  It is a nonsense.  </p><p>The effect of these Standing Orders is to deal with an evolving situation and a new type of politics.  I would like in that context to comment on the groupings.  A mistake was made, in particular at the last meeting, to rush in changes to Standing Orders based on the arithmetic from this D&aacute;il for narrow, petty, sectarian interests over the interests of what a Standing Order should be, which should be to deal with the business of the D&aacute;il in a fair and transparent manner.  I would like to thank the AAA-PBP, Fine Gael and the Labour Party for having such confidence in us that they are bothered to spend time so much time trying to put us down the pecking order.  We are flattered.  I do not propose to focus on that issue now.  </p><p>The scenario we are seeking to address by way of the amendment before us is the insertion of a particular section in the last minute of the last committee meeting.  It is clear to me that this goes against the slant of Standing Orders, which is to facilitate the formation of groups.  It is inherently undemocratic and negative in that it is being put forward to stymie people rather than do anything positive.  In effect this means that if a party was to split and a large number of its members were to form a group which is larger than party under the umbrella of which the original party was elected, then the latter group will rank lower and behind a Technical Group in the pecking order because it was not a party elected at the time of the election.  Let us take the example of the Labour Party.  Many people would argue that the Labour Party broke its national electoral mandate by going into Government on the last occasion.  If a majority of Labour Party Deputies wanted to leave the Labour Party and form a larger group than the one they left, the latter group would be behind the original Labour Party which did not adhere to its electoral mandate.</p><p>Another unintended problem is the fact that if as Deputies are saying the addition of new members cannot alter precedence then the opposite also applies in that a party cannot lose precedence as a result of it.  We could have a situation whereby if a party of 50 people splits and 45 of them go one direction and the remaining five stay with the original party, the latter group will be higher up in the pecking order, which is a nonsense.Let us call a spade a spade.  We all know why this proposal was put forward.  It is not a good way of doing business.  It goes against the grain of the type of approach that was adopted quite successfully on a range of issues.  It is petty and it has no place in any Parliament setting or under Standing Orders.  It is in that regard the amendment is proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-09a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060900026#Y00400"><p>There is an incremental approach to bringing forth Standing Orders as drafted.  I, too, pay tribute to the people who make a complex issue appear easier to deal with than it is, in particular Noreen Banim who is one of the people who worked behind the scenes on the set of Standing Orders with which we are dealing today.</p>  <p>  The business committee will be up and running fairly soon.  I believe this committee will be pivotal in reflecting the change of power in terms of that power being shared among Parliament as opposed to residing with the Government, with the Opposition having only influence in particular matters.  There is a big difference between influence and power.  It is in this regard we will see reform manifest itself.  To allow this to play out all of the committees will need to be up and running.  There is a real problem in terms of the size of this D&aacute;il, which is almost a converse of the previous D&aacute;il which comprised a large Government and a small Opposition.  The reverse is now the case.  This means it will be difficult for the Government to fill all of the positions on committees.  We may well end up with a situation whereby members of the Opposition who want to be members of particular committees will be unable to be so.</p><p>We have to find a way to reduce the amount of negative energy that might create.</p> <p> When writing Standing Orders we have to ask ourselves where we get our authority from.  We get it from the people and the Constitution.  Nowhere in the Constitution do the words "political party" appear.  I have spoken on numerous occasions over the past five years on this point.  Despite now being in a party, I have not changed my view.  The mandate is given to the individual who stands for election.  Sometimes the person stands within a political party system, sometimes as an Independent.  The people decide who should fill the seats in this Chamber.  The Standing Orders as they are written favour the party as having a preferred mandate.  That is wrong.  It will add another layer, if not two, of co-ordination that will make it very difficult to run this House.  Some of the offices of the House are finding that there is additional work they had not anticipated in the temporary mechanism for co-ordination.  Co-ordination in the first instance will be within the groups.  Then there will be co-ordination between the groups and between the groups and the Government.  That will make running this House much more difficult.  The way it has been designed, favouring the parties over big groups, means that, instead of big groups coming together and co-ordinating, there will be a more fragmented arrangement with many small groups, making that much more difficult.  I had some experience of that having been the Whip for the Technical Group, which worked pretty well in the last D&aacute;il.  There were 17 or 18 Members in it and no one missed Private Member's business or Leaders' Questions while Priority Questions were routinely taken.  Members also sat on committees.  The way it is being done here creates unnecessary fragmentation.</p> <p> I take Deputy Paul Murphy&rsquo;s point about the reforms.  They are reforms of the way we run this House but there are political reforms that need to be considered, for example, the Social Democrats put forward the idea of an anti-corruption agency, instead of having tribunals and commissions of investigation after the fact.  There is a better way to do it and that is one of our suggestions.  It is an example of what could be done if political reform was captured, as opposed to just D&aacute;il reform, which is welcome but is only half way towards what is needed. </p></speech>

The headlines surrounding the setting up of the board is that taxpayers will be protected from bailing out banks in the future and that the mistakes of banks will not be borne by the public.  It has been said that under the new system bondholders rather than taxpayers will be on the hook for losses with the creation of a single resolution board.  We are told that underpinning it will be a special system of rules to prevent a failure from spreading panic across the financial system.</p><p>Ireland will contribute &euro;1.8 billion and the total fund will be &euro;55 billion when completed.  The intention is that it will be a nest egg to protect us.  The scheme is presented as a way of defending us against future bankruptcy or bank failure.  However, when one looks at the figures, the sum of &euro;55 billion is small fry.  This State, which relatively speaking is a small one, coughed up &euro;64 billion alone in bailout funding.  Let us look at the cost of bailouts elsewhere.  In the United Kingdom it cost &pound;133 billion to save the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, and the United States spent $430 billion bailing out Citigroup and others.  Therefore, the fund appears very flimsy when one considers the potential costs of the failure of a major banking institution.  One could ask who would believe for a minute that it would protect our system from bank failure.</p><p>Even on its own terms the system will not work.  The ECB has been pumping &euro;80 billion into the European financial system every month to try to get the banks to lend.  The idea behind its approach is that the money will move from the ECB into the banks and on to businesses and households, thereby increasing demand and helping the economy to recover but<b></b>the reality is that much of the money is ending up being used for speculation as banks borrow to buy shares and currencies and anything else that will help improve their bottom line.  If and when another crash comes, &euro;1.8 billion will be quickly swallowed up and the State will be asked to pay out again.</p><p>Funding this therefore sets an extremely dangerous precedent.  Members should vote to make the banks responsible and if they do not have it, it should be the bondholders and speculators that are hit and not the ordinary taxpayer again.  More important, Members should now be taking real steps to rein in the banks and the bonus culture that still goes on.<br/><br/>I also am struck by the rhetoric of the Government and the Ministers about this Bill, which is that the fund is unlikely ever to be used and that this is just a technical Bill.  They state it is highly unlikely to ever be used as the banks now are well capitalised etc.  I am sure this sounds familiar to the people because it is the same rhetoric as before the crash.  Moreover, the Government told people that such and such a bank - I will not say its name - was too big to fail, that it would pose a systemic threat to the economy, that the ATMs would close and the sky would fall in.  Is this fund really going to stop the same thing from happening again for the same reasons?  Will the Government and its Ministers not be terrified about burning the bondholders, about creditors going on strike, about market sentiment, the whole nine yards of capitalism etc.?  The last crash was not caused by liquidity or well-capitalised banks and I do not believe the next one will be either.  Moreover, I do not believe the threat of taking 8% of a bank's liabilities before it could seek public funds will be much of a protection for taxpayers or the State.  Members have been asked to put in place a taxpayer-funded additional insurance scheme for banks, that is, for private banks and for the private sector, which is the sector the Minister and his party constantly eulogise as being the engine of growth and innovation.  Members of course cannot do the same for health, education, housing, transport or the environment, as that would be subject to strict guidelines and they would be breaking all the European Union rules.  Apparently, however, they can do it for the banks.  Members are being asked to vote to potentially give yet more funding over to private banks that make money from speculating and taking risks.  The amount certainly is significant, not in banking terms but in other terms, as &euro;1.81 billion would pay for approximately 70,000 new nurses or teachers.  It would open schools or three children&rsquo;s hospitals and could build more than 10,000 houses.  Deputy Wallace probably has better figures and one probably would get more houses out of him for the same money than the figures I have quoted.<br/><br/>Before the crash, the Irish banks were making astronomical profits for some of the wealthiest people in the country.  Even during the time of the Celtic tiger - this figure is amazing - they made profits of &euro;1 billion per year and together with the Irish developers, they effectively had families in a vice grip.  They sometimes handed out 110% loans or 150% loans, thereby pumping billions of euro of extra demand into the housing market and helping to fuel even higher housing and property prices.  But the profits here will remain private and all that is public are the losses and the potential losses.  This Bill is yet another part of the process of nationalising losses while ensuring profits remain private.  Despite the lessons we have claimed to learn about the crisis, it is the same old story, that is, it is socialism for the rich and capitalism for the rest of us.<br/><br/>This brings me to the need to consider this venture.  Given the extent of the crash and the &euro;64 billion Irish taxpayers put into the ECB and the EU, I note how destructive it is to let banks do their own thing and lend recklessly without a safety net.  This is where the Single Resolution Mechanism is supposed to kick in with banks being brought under a single system for an orderly wind-down in the case of problems.  Put simply, this is an insurance system for future reckless behaviour and the taxpayers are being asked to put up the policy, that is, the very people who never benefited from the bonus culture and the recklessness in the first place.  It is a bit like if a boy racer crashed his car and forced the costs onto his parents - which would be an awful thing to do &ndash; only for them then to be told by him that he was going to continue to speed and continue to crash and they would be obliged to put up the insurance premium to meet that behaviour, which would be obscene.  Why are Members not making the bankers pay for their own insurance and, more important, why are they not enacting legislation now to claw back all the money that was pumped into the Irish bank system for which the taxpayers paid?  I am not convinced that the culture of banks and how they make profits has changed or will change.  I am not convinced that the bonus culture is finished or that caps on bonuses will stay or be around for long enough for them not to regain the reward.  For example, Members are aware the cap on bankers' earnings of &euro;500,000 in pay still is in existence.  They know that Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland gets &euro;840,000 a year and know there is constant bleating from banks about the need to reward their staff and to incentivise their entrepreneurs.  Consequently, I am not convinced the culture has changed or that lessons have been learned. <br/><br/>Nor am I convinced the risk of banks failing has gone away.  Members are told that all this is to ensure that something like that can never happen again and that we, as regulators, and the banks have learned their lessons.  In reality, banks are even bigger and more opaque than they ever were and they continue to trade in highly risky and financially rewarding products, just as they did before the crash.  Consequently, the volume of derivative trading worldwide has reached more than $700 trillion.  Sometimes the figures are mind-boggling but Members should take note of that figure, namely, that derivative trading worldwide amounts to more than $700 trillion, which is ten times the size of the world's real economy.  It stood at $648 trillion in 2011 and probably is even higher now.  According to one report in <i>Forbes</i>magazine, &ldquo;The market has grown so unfathomably vast, the global economy is at risk of massive damage should even a small percentage of contracts go sour&quot;.  Alongside this, one can see the growth of shadow banking with vulture funds, a sector that thrives outside any regulation or State-sponsored insurance scheme and that makes up 25% to 39% of the total financial system.  It is really scary to see where these firms are investing and the real estate and equity they are buying up around the place.<br/><br/>I am sceptical about the ability of this fund to do what it is claimed to do and Members on this side of the House are sceptical about the right of this fund to be used to shore up profit-making for private institutions.  The Irish rich are up to their necks in all of this and it is obscene that Deputies, the people&rsquo;s representatives, are being asked to vote to potentially hand over more taxpayers' money to the reckless banks for reckless behaviour, were the economy to crash again.<br/><br/>People Before Profit wishes to play a constructive role on this issue.  We wish to socialise banking in the interests of the real economy and want all the money that was diverted away from schools and hospitals to be returned to the people by the private bankers.  For this reason, we obviously will be opposing this Bill.</p></speech>

As I have 30 minutes, I was thinking of doing so at 3.30 p.m.</p>  <p>  The European Central Bank and European Union have inflicted a huge injustice on Ireland.  Sadly, the Minister for Finance now wishes to compound it by getting Ireland to co-operate with the single resolution board, which wishes to continue the current practice of regulating banks even though it is aware that banks are hiding losses from the regulator.  Patrick Honohan has confirmed at various times that banks have hidden losses and also confirmed that it is difficult for regulators to ensure that banks are safe.</p>  <p>  It now is well recognised that the ECB was a major contributor to Ireland's banking crisis.  In 2001, the ECB knew that banks were about to start hiding losses yet it simply stood aside to please bonus-hungry bankers, allowing them to amass substantial bonuses while destroying economies like Greece and Ireland.  Members should not allow this to continue.  In 2001, the ECB was aware that banks were going to hide losses but did nothing about it.  It stated: "This approach would allow two criticisms associated with the current accounting standards to be overcome, notably that potential credit losses remain hidden until signs of deterioration are evident and that market participants have insufficient information about the interest rate risk profile of banks."  In 2006, the ECB reconfirmed that the amortised cost system of accounting allowed banks to delay the recognition of losses.  It stated "given that these assets could be accounted for at amortised cost &ndash; the actual recognition of a loss or an impairment of the assets may take longer to materialise".  In 2001, the ECB and the European Union received warnings from a consortium of French banks and bank regulators that carnage would result.  Does the Minister of State agree with the local authority pension fund in London which stated that financial statements of banks and their regulation must be comprehensively reviewed?</p></speech>
