We need to try to minimise the risks and maximise the opportunities.  Earlier this morning, I attended a meeting of CEOs to discuss how Irish companies can remain competitive in the face of Brexit but also in the light of other global challenges, including attitudes on taxation in the USA, challenges within Europe and so on.</p>  <p>  We have much to do.  We need to help firms to compete.  This is an issue across Government.  It is about access to finance.  In the budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced a &euro;300 million Brexit fund.  Last Monday, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, also announced, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, EIB, a new fund designed to make money available to Irish businesses.  That is very important.  We need to continue to help firms to innovate by increasing money for innovation.</p>  <p>  This morning, Enterprise Ireland launched another fund whereby, within three weeks, businesses can access up to &euro;150,000 to help them innovate.  That is really important.  We need to encourage and support firms to trade and diversify.  Obviously, all the work I have been doing on trade missions with IDA Ireland is doing that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about state aid.  On 10 November I had an extremely positive and good meeting with Commissioner Vestager, who has responsibility for competition issues - including state aid - to discuss the unique challenge facing the country.  We agreed to set up a working group comprising officials from the state-aid section of her area and officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The group already met last Monday for the first time and will meet again in December.  The purpose of this important initiative is to discuss the supports and measures available to Irish firms and to look at new measures and supports that can be developed as the Brexit situation develops in order to ensure that there can be - and I stressed this to her - a very timely response to any issues that emerge for Irish business.  She agreed that timeliness in response will be critical.  It was an extremely positive meeting and the working group has already begun dealing with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300003#A00700"><p>The Minister mentioned the scheme announced by Enterprise Ireland this morning and the earlier budget announcement by the Minister for Finance.  By any yardstick, the state of preparedness of business for the onset of a hard Brexit is alarming.  AIB recently published a sentiment index for quarter 3 of this year which shows that only one in four Irish SMEs is properly prepared for a hard Brexit.</p><p>According to InterTradeIreland, 19 of the 20 SMEs it surveyed are also not prepared for it.  Similarly, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, and Deloitte, two major consultancy, auditing and accountancy firms, believe this is the case.  </p> <p> In regard to the working group on the revision of state aid rules to which the T&aacute;naiste referred, will it examine specific issues such as the &euro;200,000 limit, which is posing a huge barrier?  During a previous Question Time the T&aacute;naiste referred to a proposal to introduce a rescue and restructure scheme.  What are the criteria for that scheme and what will be available to business via that scheme?</p></speech>

All of the organisations in this area are doing a huge amount of work to ensure businesses are Brexit-ready.  I would encourage any company, particularly those dependent on the UK market, that has not completed the Brexit score card or linked in with the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to do so.</p>  <p>  On the rescue and restructure scheme, the Department filed for this scheme in August.  Once approved, this scheme will allow for equity supports of up to &euro;10 million to SMEs in severe financial distress as a consequence of Brexit.  While I do not expect there will be a need for the State to provide rescue or restructure aid to companies in the Brexit context, this may well be the situation and so we need to have a contingency measure in place.  We have made good progress with the Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  We are also putting in place another scheme which will make medium-term finance available for companies.  We are also developing a longer-term business development loan scheme.  A variety of schemes are being put in place in terms of access to finance, which will be a key issue for firms that need to diversify from the UK market and to develop products on the research and development side.  A number of different initiatives are available.  Last week, a new fund for small and medium businesses was announced by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in association with the European Investment Bank, EIB, which will also make tens of millions of euro available to Irish firms at a low interest rate.</p></speech>

The issue was discussed on a number of occasions during Leaders' Questions.  As confirmed to me by the T&aacute;naiste by way of response to a parliamentary question, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has commissioned two reports; Sectoral Implications Arising from Brexit: Most Exposed Sectors, and Strategic Implications Arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns.  The T&aacute;naiste also told me that these reports will not be published and that the cost of these reports is in the region of &euro;250,000, which is a significant amount of public funds.  Why will these reports not be put into the public domain?  Surely, the purpose of these reports is to aid business in their preparedness for Brexit.  Will the T&aacute;naiste publish these reports and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

I will share as much as possible of that information.  Information relevant to companies will be shared with them.  If there is information that is key to our negotiating strategy which it would be better not to publish at a particular point from a national interest point of view, that is the approach we will take.  Anything that can be published will be published.</p></speech>

In the past three years, this office has also surrendered almost &euro;5 million of its funding to the State.  The most senior Garda position in that office has been vacant since 2016.  The T&aacute;naiste recently outlined her plans to reform this office.  However, I do not want to know what is happening in regard to those plans but what has happened at this agency over the past number of years and why it was allowed to happen under Fine Gael's watch.</p></reply>

In that context, and in keeping with the ODCE strategy of seeking to allocate resources towards confronting indications of wrongdoing at the more serious end of the spectrum, the ODCE did not initiate any summary prosecutions over the past two years. </p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement cannot initiate prosecutions on indictment, rather only the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.  On foot of investigations undertaken by the ODCE, and the subsequent directing of charges on indictment by the DPP on 21 December 2016, a former director of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc entered a plea of guilty before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to one count of fraudulent trading contrary to section 297 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended; on 21 December 2016, a former director of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc entered a plea of guilty before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to one count of failing to maintain a register of certain transactions involving directors and others contrary to section 44 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended; and, on 27 July 2017, a person entered a plea of guilty before Limerick Circuit Criminal Court to one count of fraudulent trading contrary to section 297 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended.  The facts of this case are due to be heard, and sentence imposed, by the court on 21 December 2017.</p><p>Once the DPP directs charges on indictment, the matter moves into the realm of the courts.  The speed of progress thereafter is determined within that process.  I refer the Deputy to the ODCE annual report 2016 which points to a number of key successes during the year including, following the examination of reports submitted to the office by liquidators of insolvent companies, 90 company directors were restricted and 11 disqualified by the High Court;  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>93 restriction undertakings were obtained from directors of insolvent companies; as an alternative to formal enforcement actions, cautions issued to a total of 61 companies; the securing of the rectification on a non-statutory basis of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014 in relation to directors&rsquo; loans in 60 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;17 million approximately; 108 directions were issued to relevant parties requiring them to comply with their statutory obligations under company law; the submission of five investigation files to the DPP for consideration, with recommendations including charges under both company law and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001; seven demands issued to companies for the production of their books, records and other relevant documents; and during the year, the register of disqualified, deemed disqualified and restricted persons, as maintained by the Registrar of Companies, was reviewed.  Arising from that review, a total of 83 instances were identified where persons appeared to be acting in contravention of court orders-legislative provisions.  Following intervention by the ODCE, the individuals&rsquo; positions were regularised.</p><p>In excess of 1,050 statutory reports and referrals were received from liquidators, auditors, examiners, professional bodies and other regulatory and enforcement authorities.  There were 130 internally generated inputs and almost 250 complaints received from members of the public.  To encourage compliance with company law, the ODCE issued in excess of 16,000 copies of its various publications during 2016.Over the past ten years the ODCE has referred files in respect of a number of investigations to the DPP, on foot of which the DPP has directed a total of 214 charges on indictment.</p><p>In terms of reform of the office, organisational reforms in the ODCE were commenced in 2012 by the current Director of Corporate Enforcement upon his appointment, to enhance the capability of the office to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law and to ensure a more efficient and effective use of its resources.  These include reorganising the structures of the office; and recruiting additional expertise, including six forensic accountants and a digital forensic specialist.  As senior level vacancies have arisen, reconfiguration of the skill sets, competencies, roles and responsibilities associated with those posts in order to better reflect the organisation's current needs. That exercise has resulted in the creation of two senior level professional posts of enforcement portfolio managers, with one of those posts having been filled and the filling of the other expected shortly.  Further recruitment is ongoing.  Other reforms include fundamentally amending the investigative procedures used by the office so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take the lead in all criminal investigations; and fostering a greater culture of risk management within the office.</p><p>In addition to these reforms the establishment, as announced by Government earlier this month, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a new independent company law enforcement agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  The package of measures to combat white collar crime sets out an ambitious timeframe for the establishment of the new independent company law enforcement agency.  It is expected that the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision will be published by the second quarter of 2018, with final publication of the Bill by the fourth quarter of 2018.  Work on the development of the legislative framework for the agency has already commenced.</p><p>My Department will engage with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to advise on international best practice in the establishment of the agency in terms of internal controls, staffing, budget and corporate governance.</p></speech>

Those questions have not been answered.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to me the ODCE annual report of 2016 wherein the key successes of the office are set out.  I have read that report and I do not understand why the T&aacute;naiste's predecessors took no action to fix what I believe is an agency that is not working properly.</p>  <p>  When did the T&aacute;naiste become aware that this office is barely functioning?  The most significant thing this office has done in the past 12 months is sabotage an extremely high profile banker's trial and, as result, let him walk away scot free.  It has been brought to my attention that the figures relating to the number of director disqualifications and restrictions quoted in a previous exchange on this topic between myself and the T&aacute;naiste were secured not by the ODCE, but as a result of work done by receivers, giving the impression that the office is functioning better than is the case.</p><p>I received a response from the T&aacute;naiste's Department at 8.20 a.m., almost a full month after I submitted the questions.  In October, the T&aacute;naiste stated, "Between 2012 and 2016, investigations by the ODCE have resulted in the restriction of 886 company directors."  The figures I received this morning show that between 2012 and 2016, the ODCE only made nine applications for restriction, approximately 1% of what the T&aacute;naiste claimed in October.  The figure the Minister gave to me in October is clearly wrong.  It seems to have become a regular occurrence this week.  Can she correct the record on that matter?</p></speech>

He need only look at the 2016 report - as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said to me, I do not have time to go into detail - as there is figure after figure.  In 2016 alone, 90 company directors were restricted and 11 were disqualified by the High Court, while 93 restriction undertakings were obtained from directors of insolvent companies.  A register of persons deemed disqualified and restricted, as maintained by the Companies Registration Office, was reviewed.  A total of 83 incidences were identified where persons appeared to be acting in contravention of court orders and in excess of 1,050 statutory reports and referrals were received from liquidators, auditors, professional bodies and so on.  A huge amount of work has been done by the ODCE.  The Government has worked to put together a stronger package and to enhance the powers of the ODCE.  We recognise there is further work to do in the area and that is why the announcement was made with regard to a range of initiatives that are being undertaken to make sure that the office is even stronger and is not an arm of the Department but will be an independent body led by commissioners, as are the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Revenue Commissioners.  We are moving to a much stronger-----</p></speech>

She told me in October that 886 company directors were sanctioned by investigations resulting from the ODCE, which is not correct.  I previously made my position clear that the way we deal with criminal law in Ireland depends on who one is, where one is from and what one is worth.  I received a response from the T&aacute;naiste's office yesterday stating that she cannot publish the report received from the ODCE under section 995 of the Companies Act about the failings in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial.  Why can the Minister not do this?  What legal barrier is stopping her from publishing this report?  I asked the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation to examine the agency as a matter of priority to find out what is going on and why the Government has allowed it to happen.  White-collar criminals in Ireland continue to live subject to different laws than everyone else.  Saying that the agency is not fit for purpose is an understatement and many more questions need to be asked and answered on this.</p></speech>

I have had both direct confirmation and written legal confirmation with regard to this.  Under the legislation, which has been carefully examined - since my approach would have been to publish this - it is not within the powers of the Minister to publish such a report.  I certainly want to place as many of Judge Aylmer's concerns in the public arena as I can.  That will involve getting transcripts and so on.  The Department is working on a report that it hopes to be able to publish before the end of the year.  The strong and clear legal advice was that, under the legislation, I did not have the power to publish this report.</p></speech>

This is clearly a cutting-edge issue for companies to deal with in the months ahead particularly in view, as the Deputy said earlier, of the Brexit challenge.  Despite intense competition, the trajectory of Ireland's competitiveness performance is positive.  Ireland moved from 16th to sixth place in 2017 in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.  The World Bank's most recent Doing Business 2018 report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of one place on last year.  We can see that we are competitive.  It can be seen in the strong employment growth across all sectors.  There is no room for complacency.  We need to continue to improve the environment for doing business in Ireland and remain vigilant to the very significant challenges in the external environment.</p>  <p>  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth continues, enterprises are resilient and the economy is internationally competitive.  A range of work is being done on FDI.  The continued focus of IDA Ireland is working with companies abroad that will invest here.  A strong pipeline of investment is due in Ireland.  All the companies I meet are extremely positive about the experience in Ireland, the diverse workforce they can attract and their experience of doing business here.  We often talk about red tape but companies are positive about it.  Enterprise Ireland's work is also important.</p>  <p>  I will shortly bring the National Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government.  I pay tribute to it for the work it does.  We recently held a meeting in Farmleigh House with the stakeholders.  It was clear that the companies are doing much work.  The chair of the National Competitiveness Council was very involved in that and continues to work closely with the Department and Irish businesses to maintain that competitive edge.</p></speech>

What are multinationals saying to the Minister when she goes on trade missions with regard to the challenges related to housing and our planning laws, for example?  We saw the recent Athenry data centre debacle, which has really left us in a state of uncertainty.  We know the Taoiseach got no joy from Tim Cook when he recently visited him in California.  What is the Minister doing about planning laws?  My party has published legislation relating to fast-tracking major IT infrastructural projects.  What is the Minister doing about the provision of housing?  I am sure multinationals raise policy decisions of Government with her.  What are these companies telling the Minister and the Government with regard to these barriers to setting up, such as in Athenry or in Dublin where we have a shortage of residential units, and elsewhere around the country?  What will the Minister do about it?</p></speech>

The job announcements in Drogheda, Limerick, Waterford and so on and recent weeks bear testament to that.  The universal feedback is positive about the experience companies have in Ireland and they wish to continue investing here.  They are interested in our situation post Brexit and I think there are opportunities.  Those that have businesses in the UK are concerned about the changes there.  In recent times, the focus on housing is clearly being raised by some companies, both with IDA Ireland and myself.  They have questions about what is going to happen and what the Government's plans are.  Business wants to be assured that issues are being dealt with.  The most important thing is for us to be clear with businesses that a plan is in place to provide greater housing and that there is also a national planning framework and capital investment programme.</p><p>I have been outlining to businesses that a plan is in place to deal with these issues.  Quite a number of the companies I have met, when I have checked whether their staff have experienced housing difficulties, even very recently, have said they have not and that they have been able to deal with the issue.  However, there is no doubt but that the issue needs to be addressed; otherwise, it will become a barrier.</p></speech>

We really need to hear from her whether this opportunity has now been lost.  Is the investment lost to the country and the State?  As I said to her, Mr. Cook rebuffed, or at least did not give any joy to, our Taoiseach when he visited him recently.  Where are we in this regard?  Is the State now unable to land such major, large-scale investments?  This is a huge worry and concern for the community of Athenry and the wider west coast of Ireland, so will the Minister comment in that regard?  Specifically what does she intend to do?  I have raised this at our committee.  I have asked for her and the IDA to come before the committee, where we will have more time and will not be constrained, as we are here, by time limits, to have a broader discussion, specifically about the delivery of projects such as the Apple project.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</p></speech>

That is why it has been a priority for the Taoiseach to meet Apple and discuss with its directors both here and in the USA the issues in this regard.  The whole country regrets the delays because delays are always of serious concern to business.  That is one of the reasons-----</p></speech>

I would not put it the way the Deputy has put it, that it is lost.  We must continue to work with Apple.  What is important is that we deal with infrastructure planning, as the Deputy rightly says, and data centres.  The Taoiseach and I brought a memo to Government in order that we could fast-track data centres.  This is very important because, as the Deputy knows, Apple put in for one part of a project which, I think, has eight parts to it all together, so it would be extremely helpful for the future decisions that Apple may make to get that legislation through.  I ask for the Deputy's co-operation in the House, which I am sure we will get, to have that legislation passed.  I would certainly like to see those jobs in Athenry, and we will continue to work with the company and will progress that legislation, which will also be helpful.  There is no indication that companies are moving away from taking decisions to invest in Ireland - quite the contrary.  Based on my experience and the IDA work in recent months, there is a strong interest and pipeline of investment in Ireland, thankfully, because, as the Deputy knows, tens of thousands of jobs rely on that sector.</p></speech>

At the centre of its strategy is the Build Scale, Expand Reach strategy for 2017-20.  It works in many different ways to help that employment development.  In 2016, for example, 5,352 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Tipperary, and in the same year Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Tipperary created 290 jobs.  This was a net gain of 189 when losses were taken into account.  Enterprise Ireland has approximately 120 clients in Tipperary and supported client companies in Tipperary with an investment of &euro;11.2 million in the period 2014-16.  I understand as well that in Thurles, I think, the local council is involved in a new enterprise park.  I do not have all the details of that but, again, whatever way the Government, Enterprise Ireland and local LEOs can work to support such development, we will facilitate that.  As I said, Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies in Tipperary through teams of sectoral focused development advisers using a company-led diagnostic approach, which is used to assess the client's needs.  Then they can tailor the package to support them.  This will continue.  Enterprise Ireland has co-funded with local enterprise development groups 157 community enterprise centres across the country, totalling &euro;64 million, and there is a community enterprise centre located in every county.  The agency has also provided &euro;2 million to support the role of 46 business development community enterprise centres.  These employ 6,000 people across 1,200 companies and are key hubs of enterprise activity in many areas.  In Tipperary, Enterprise Ireland has co-funded the establishment of six community enterprise centres.</p></speech>

Towns such as Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore, Cashel, Nenagh, Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir have been left behind.  They were once vibrant retail towns and they are now facing huge difficulties such as competition from suburban shopping centres, problems with parking and parking charges, the increased popularity of internet shopping, and high commercial rates and local charges, and then one must contend with the black economy.  As a result, there has been a reduction in footfall, stemming largely from decreased consumer spending, so we have many empty premises that are contributing to the ghost town effect of many towns right around the country.  We see padlocked gates, permanently shuttered shops, derelict sites - all of the physical and visible signs of the ongoing pain and unemployment happening across rural Ireland.  The 2010 census showed an unemployment rate of 15% in Tipperary, as against the national rate of 12% at that time.  We need initiatives to be taken to address this imbalance.</p></speech>

The best way to begin to have that recovery that we need, and which is happening, as he says, is to ensure a regional focus when we attract jobs from overseas while also supporting local businesses.  The kinds of projects I have described that the LEOs, for example, are supporting will be very important.  In the Deputy's own area, Tipperary LEO was involved in five projects from the &euro;5 million in funding under the competitive local enterprise office fund.  Interesting things are happening, such as the south east artist and foot initiative, the digital initiative that is under way and so on, that will lead to more employment and lead to those premises opening.  There is a pilot programme that will offer carefully selected micro-enterprises with growth ambitions the opportunity to benefit from concentrated supports and advice.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland ran an overseas Enterprise Ireland client itinerary visit to the Lisheen mines.  Again, this is all part of trying to develop enterprise in the area and make sure jobs are created.  We have the very important regional development fund of &euro;60 million, and I will shortly - I hope before the end of the year - announce the results of the first &euro;35 million of that investment.</p></speech>

Her Department is feeding into the national planning framework that is currently out there for public discussion.  The criteria and classification used in this plan mean that in Tipperary, for example, Clonmel is the only designated large town and, because of the criteria established, many towns are left out.  The reality is that the funds in the plan will follow the designated towns.  What will happen to the towns that are outside of the plan and left behind?</p><p>They will be at a huge disadvantage.  The Government has a policy of shifting the balance in favour of the regions, but we will never get people to invest in any rural town unless there are incentives for them.  This plan goes against Government policy in terms of directing investment towards regional geographical areas.  The Department needs to look at this closely in terms of the disadvantage in which it will place many rural towns.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of consultation.  It is a draft planning framework.  There is certainly no question of placing areas at a disadvantage.  I would say quite the opposite.  It is about combining capital investment and a proper regional planning framework.  The intention is to ensure we have balanced and inclusive development throughout the country.  The development of Dublin is part of this.  I imagine and expect that when we have this planning framework in place, we will see a more even spread of jobs and investment throughout the country.  I believe the areas the Deputy has spoken about will also benefit because there is a better regional approach to planning, investment and development.  It is bringing all of the different factors together, such as where there should be housing and where there can be development and investment.</p></speech>

When does she expect it might make a decision on whether it will, in the end, proceed with an Irish plant?  From where does she think it will get the 100% renewable power?

We are striving to ensure that Ireland continues to be able to attract world-class data centres and other high-tech investments.  The Taoiseach recently met the company's CEO in the USA and underlined the Government's support for this valuable project, which will build on this company's substantial existing investment and job creation in Ireland.  My Department, through the IDA, has been engaged in ongoing discussions with the company involved, throughout all stages in the development of this project, including the various planning and legal processes.  This engagement will continue and the IDA is in ongoing contact with the company, both through its US headquarters and with management at its existing Irish operations.</p>  <p>  We strongly support this project for several reasons.  It would help reinforce our hard-won reputation as a country that values and supports technological investment.  The location of this centre in County Galway would have huge benefits for the wider area.  I have just been discussing regional development, and it would serve as a strong endorsement of the west and the merits of investing in regional Ireland.  We are making huge efforts to ensure balanced regional development.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about forecasted benefits of this &euro;850 million investment, and they are well-known.  It is expected that 300 construction jobs would be generated, together with 150 quality on-site permanent jobs.  Of course, there would a whole range of indirect benefits for the wider local and regional economy.  There is very strong local support in Athenry for the project.  There are many factors.</p>  <p>  Whether the project proceeds or not, and we will certainly work to try to ensure it proceeds, remains a commercial decision for the company itself to take.  We will continue working closely with the company and we will try to influence the final decision.</p></speech>

These companies coming to Ireland want 100% renewable power.  The Government has just presented a report which plans for the next 13 years and states we will only aim to keep the existing level of renewable power.  EirGrid states we could get up to 75% in that timeframe, which would provide all the power to run these centres, but the Government does not seem to believe in it, which is one of the reasons we are at the bottom of the climate change league.  Similarly, the Government pulled back the development of the grid to the north-west, including the Mayo and Galway area, and pulled back from the development of wind power there that could have powered the Athenry plant.  One of the reasons it went to Denmark is not just that it was stuck in the planning system but that the company realised that in Denmark it was dealing with a government which believed in this renewable, low-carbon future.  In this country, especially in Fine Gael, there seems to be an ideological opposition to the transition to a low-carbon 100% renewable future.  Why is this?</p></speech>

These companies, as the Deputy rightly said, are big users of renewable energy, and that certainly is to be welcomed.  Their experience in this country has been good.  I do not think what Deputy has said is correct, because it is very clear the planning delays were the issue relating to where we are at present.  The delays that have beset the project underline the need to have an efficient and speedy planning process and associated legal process in place in this country.  I and the Government certainly want to ensure that similar projects are not unreasonably delayed.  The Department of the Taoiseach established a high-level working group earlier this year to examine the many cross-departmental policy issues associated with these projects.  The Department is represented on this group, and we will bring the enterprise perspective and retail related analysis to the group to aid its discussion.  The group will seek to develop a strategic national policy approach to the development of future projects in Ireland.  It is examining among other issues the possible designations of areas suitable for the development of data centres and the identification and resolution of planning issues and infrastructural requirements related to such investment.  This approach is the right one.  It takes into account the issues about which the Deputy is concerned and which he raised today.</p></speech>

This is why we are at the bottom of the charts.  To put this aside, I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is looking at developing a plan for what we do with data centres.  One of the reasons for the planning delay in this case was there was not a national plan.  The planning system had to try to decide whether the project made sense without any understanding of the overall plan in terms of how many data centres we have, from where we get the power, the benefits for the local community and where we locate them.  I very much welcome, if I heard it in the T&aacute;naiste's answer, that she will now have such a plan.  When does she expect it will be ready?  What other bodies are involved?  I have just come from an ESB conference down the road, and it sees the development of a renewable sensitive dynamic network as key.  What is the role of the industry in this?  How quickly can the T&aacute;naiste turn around such a plan so at least companies coming in future know what is happening in this country?</p></speech>

I can confirm a cross-departmental group is looking at this.  I will arrange for details to be sent to the Deputy of who is on the group and an outline of the work, and in so far as I can do so I am happy to do it.  We should not forget that Ireland is still considered, and with good cause, the unofficial data centre of Europe.  There are well over 25 major data centres in Ireland.  Many of them belong to some of the world's leading technology companies located here.  The strengths we have to offer, and I hear it again and again when I visit the companies, for this type of investment include our climate, our energy supply and our business environment.  They are well known to potential investors.  We will continue to work on this national plan and the IDA will remain in very close contact with the company.</p></speech>

The Mid-East Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in this region, including County Meath, with public and private stakeholders actively engaged in delivering the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the plan.  The core objective of the plan is to see a further 25,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.</p>  <p>  The first two progress reports on the implementation of the action plan show that good progress continues to be made in implementing the actions.  The second progress report highlighted actions of specific benefit to Meath, such as the fit-out of Kells Tech Hub, using REDZ funding, to provide shared services and hot desking facilities.  In addition, Meath Enterprise was awarded funding under the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Initiative to develop the Boyne Valley Food Hub.</p>  <p>  There are now 12,800 more people at work across Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow since the launch of the regional action plan for jobs initiative in quarter 1 of 2015.  The unemployment rate in the region has also dropped to 5.8%, lower than the State average of 6.4%.</p>  <p>  I am also determined to grow foreign direct investment, FDI, driven job creation further outside of our main urban areas.  I am pleased that significant progress has been made towards achieving the IDA's target of a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in every region outside Dublin, including the Mid-East.</p>  <p>  There are currently 17 IDA client companies located in County Meath employing close to 1,500 people.  This year has seen some significant investments in the county, with Shire announcing plans to expand its global biotechnology manufacturing capacity over the next four years.  It is expected this will lead to the creation of approximately 400 permanent jobs on a 120 acre site at Piercetown, County Meath.  This news followed Facebook&rsquo;s announcement in January of the construction of a new data centre in Clonee, County Meath.  Construction for the &euro;200 million data centre is taking place, with more than 1,000 workers on site daily.</p>  <p>  The IDA continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in County Meath to its client base and it makes every effort to ensure that FDI is spread as widely as possible throughout the country.  Since 2016, there have been nine site visits to the county.  While site visits can be a useful indicator of new investment interest, they are not by any means indicative of the potential for FDI in an area.  I point out in this regard that at least 70% of investment comes from existing IDA clients.</p>  <p>  While the IDA always highlights the benefits of investing in the regions to prospective investors, determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the firm concerned.  Factors that are also important for overseas investors include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent.  Multinational companies ultimately decide for themselves whether they want to operate in the area.</p></reply>

It is very important and is certainly a vote of confidence in that area.  What I am concerned about is that while the Minister of State mentioned the Kells Tech Hub, and I welcome the investment that has gone into that, there was no IDA financial investment in Meath in 2016.  It was one of three counties which got no IDA investment, the others being Roscommon and Leitrim.  Meath is vastly bigger than Leitrim and considerably bigger than Roscommon, and it has considerable advantages in terms of promoting industry.  What is the Minister doing for Kells?  A number of year ago Kells was designated as an area which could qualify for State aid for employment, yet there was no funding from the IDA for it last year.  There is an IDA business park outside Drogheda which has had one company in it for a considerable period, but on the whole it is completely empty.  That is in County Meath too.  It is not acceptable.  I do not think that the IDA is putting enough emphasis on other parts of the county.  Clonee and Dunboyne are standing on their own two feet, as it were, because of their location and get by with support from the IDA, but with little financial investment.  Other areas need that support, in particular Kells and the business park outside Drogheda.  What on earth is going on with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300008#F00600"><p>The IDA is only one element of job creation.  It is a very important element and has been an important part of the job creation in County Meath.  Meath is very near to Dublin.  Clonee is on the border with the county.  I also point out the importance of the indigenous sector in County Meath.  The number of people employed in that sector has grown substantially over recent years.  There has been an increase of 41%, and there are now almost 7,000 people employed in the indigenous sector there by Enterprise Ireland companies.  That has to be put in the context of job creation in the county.  While FDI is extremely important, a lot of indigenous and start up companies come out of that.  Enterprise Ireland has a very important role in that.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are also playing an important role throughout County Meath.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has outlined the situation in Kells.  I do not have exact numbers but I will ensure that they are passed on to the Deputy.  It is important that there is regional balance throughout the county.  The LEOs should be highlighted as they are a first-stop shop for people who want to start companies.  In 2016, they created approximately 927 jobs there throughout the county.  It is a matter of looking at the context, with the FDI, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and LEO jobs.  I take on board the Deputy's concerns about business parks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300008#F00700"><p>I accept what the Minister of State is saying about the indigenous sector being important, but the question was about FDI and the role of the IDA in funding that.  It is a fact that there was no funding invested by Government through the IDA in Meath last year.  It is also a fact that there is a business park which is owned by the IDA outside Drogheda, in County Meath which is almost empty, apart from one very important industry.  It is also a fact that the Kells area was designated for Government support, yet last year nothing came through the IDA.  That is not to say that there is nothing else happening in Kells, but the IDA needs to have a much greater focus on County Meath and support it financially.  There are parts of the county that will stand on their own two feet, so to speak, and which are doing really well, and we are very proud of those towns and everyone who puts the work in to achieve that, including the IDA.  We must not forget about other parts of the county where support is needed and where we really need FDI.  We have a history of FDI.  We want to continue that and bring more industries into the county.</p></speech>

We have to look at the fact that since 2016 there have been nine site visits to County Meath by the IDA.  There are some flagship companies in Clonee, and there is a &euro;200 million investment by Facebook happening there at the minute.  That is a very important and significant investment.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about it earlier when she discussed data centres.  That investment is strategically very important.  The one disadvantage that Meath has, which other counties surrounding Dublin also have, is that sometimes people commute out of the county into the capital city.  That can be a disadvantage.  At the same time Meath is an important location for FDI, particularly when it comes to quality of life and the availability of housing as well.  I will emphasise to the IDA the importance of the issues that the Deputy has raised today, but the fact is that there have been nine site visits since 2016.  Companies are growing, particularly the foreign companies in the county, and sometimes they increase their workforce without the fanfare that some companies want.  That is a strategic decision taken by the company itself.  Meath has done really well, but the Deputy is obviously concerned about the regional towns.  It is important that we invest in those too.</p></speech>

This is an issue we raise in the House at every opportunity given the disparity in the economic recovery across different parts of the country.  We are effectively seeing a two-tier economy comprising Dublin and the greater Dublin area versus the regions.</p></reply>

Regional development remains a priority for the Government.  I am very much aware that an important part of unlocking the potential of regional Ireland is ensuring that foreign direct investment, FDI, is spread as evenly as possible across the country, as per Government policy.  IDA Ireland is committed to increasing FDI in each region, and I welcome the progress made so far in boosting FDI-driven job creation outside of the main urban areas.  In 2016, for example, more than half of all IDA Ireland-supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  There have been 507 site visits to date this year, up by 18 from the same point last year.  While site visits can be a useful indicator of new investment interest, they are not by any means indicative of the potential for FDI in an area.  It is important to note that at least 70% of investment comes from existing IDA Ireland clients.  While the agency always highlights the benefits of investing in the regions to prospective investors, determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the firm concerned.  Factors overseas investors take into account include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent.  Multinational companies frequently seek to base themselves as close as possible to businesses operating in the same industry.  IDA Ireland continues to work with all stakeholders and potential clients, as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations, to generate additional jobs.  However, the final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  There are 17 buildings owned by IDA Ireland that are currently available.  In addition, the agency leases units from private investors, of which 24 are currently available.</p></reply>

The data show that is not happening.  Of the 323 site visits that took place in the first six months of 2017, 48%, or almost half, were in Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  Counties Laois and Meath had no site visits, while counties Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon had one visit each in the first half of the year.  We should not seek to diminish or dilute the significance of site visits and at the same time, IDA Ireland has almost 100 vacant properties across the country.  I take every opportunity I have on Question Time to raise this issue.  The Government must use whatever means are necessary to force IDA Ireland to encourage site visits in parts of the country where they are not happening.</p>  <p>  Last week, Deputy Quinlivan and I were part of an Oireachtas committee delegation that visited the south east to meet members of the business community.  If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State had been among our number, they would have been run out of town because people there are very annoyed by what they perceive as the lack of attention from both Government and the State agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  It was hot and heavy going during the two sessions, with the business representatives rightly making their feelings known in a vociferous manner.  The Government has a responsibility to achieve a greater spread of site visits into the regions outside the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300009#G00500"><p>I understand the south east is one of the areas that has seen significant investment recently.  It is important to note that foreign direct investment normally locates in clusters.  As we know, industry tends to follow industry.</p>  <p>  In regard to IDA Ireland activities, there were 27 site visits in Limerick, which is the Deputy's area.  In my own area of Clare, we had 20 visits.  These numbers represent a huge increase on what we were seeing in recent years.  In addition, the mid-west results for 2017 show that 57% of all job approvals thus far are based outside of Dublin, an increase of 37% from the same time last year.  This illustrates our focus on investment in every part of the State.</p>  <p>  I take on board the points raised by the Deputy and assure him that the capital development plan is focusing very much on those issues.  As I said, clusters are very important for FDI investment but also the proximity of third level institutions and the innovation centres that may be attached to them.  Another consideration is the quality of the road network, and we have seen substantial enhancements in that regard in recent times.  The inclusion of the Limerick-Cork motorway in the forthcoming plan will be particularly welcomed by the Deputy.  There are some areas in the north east, as well as into the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's part of the country, where there are deficiencies in the road network that remain to be addressed and this is reflected in the number of site visits.  The ultimate concern is to attract jobs into the country and ensure there is balanced regional development.</p></speech>

That is what people in Limerick are saying to me, as I am sure they are likewise telling the Minister of State.  Will he comment on that?</p>  <p>  On IDA Ireland site visits, while the Minister of State cited the numbers for the mid-west, Limerick and Clare, which are welcome, what about counties Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon?  He did not refer to them in his reply.</p>  <p>  Another barometer of the economic recovery is gross domestic product, GDP.  Last year, 45%, or almost half, of our GDP was generated in the Dublin area.  In the United Kingdom, by comparison, London city and the greater London area contributes 20% of national GDP.  That is comparing like with like in reference to our neighbouring country and clearly shows we have a major problem when it comes to balanced regional development.  IDA Ireland must do more to funnel jobs into those regions that have not experienced the upside of recovery.</p></speech>

Balanced regional development is a priority for the Government.  The Action Plan for Jobs undertakes to ensure all regions experience growth in jobs, and the statistics show that is happening.  Our plan up to 2020 is to ensure that of the 200,000 jobs we intend to create, 135,000 will be outside the capital.</p>  <p>  Regarding the national planning framework, it is important to note that we do not yet have a final document.  No matter where the T&aacute;naiste and I visit, in every instance the representatives we meet will say their region is not included in the framework.  That has happened in Limerick, the mid-west and in locations further south or north.  The reality is that submissions have been made and the local authorities have been very vocal in their views, as have the chambers of commerce.  I am sure that when the final document is agreed, and we have the three regional documents as well, it will be clear that all areas stand to benefit.  It is important that we plan for the future and do not return to the days when there was no planning.  Only by having proper planning processes in place can we ensure that all areas benefit.</p></speech>

This is an issue of particular concern as we approach the Christmas season, which is a high business turnover period for retailers.  It is estimated that up to &euro;300 million is spent on gift vouchers every year but there is absolutely no regulation of their usage.</p></reply>

Gift vouchers supplied to consumers are subject to the provisions of general consumer protection legislation, in particular, the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 on unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices and the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, SI 27 of 1995.</p><p>Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are also covered by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information Cancellation and other Rights) Regulations 2013.  Gift cards that come within the definition of electronic money, of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these regulations unless the card can be used to acquire goods or services on the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of services providers or a limited range of goods and services.<br/><br/>The issuer of gift cards that come under the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money - or par value - at any time.  Redemption may be subject to a fee in specific circumstances and any such fee must be appropriate and compensate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money.  The European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 falls under the remit of the Minister for Finance.<br/><br/>My Department published a draft scheme for public consultation of the comprehensive consumer rights Bill on 25 May 2015.  In addition to the parts that deal with the consolidation and updating of the new law around the supply of goods, digital content and services and on the unfair contract terms, the draft scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that comes within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  It is important that we listen to all views and possible approaches to the issue of gift vouchers, including the validity of a set time period.<br/><br/><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i><br/><br/>While I am anxious to progress the scheme of the consumer rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals, which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft scheme of the consumer rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a general approach reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June 2017.  The proposal will now be considered in a trilogue with the European Parliament later this year.  Discussion at Council level on the second proposal on online sales has only just commenced.<br/><br/>In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017, if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time, is obviously open to question.  I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the scheme of the consumer rights Bill.<br/><br/>I also draw the attention of the Deputy to the very useful information for consumers on the issue of gift vouchers and cards on the CCPC website <i></i>particularly in the run-up to the Christmas period.</p></reply>

Consumers are being severely and negatively impacted.  Many people who are in receipt of vouchers and gift vouchers are children, especially at Christmas time.  When they go to use the vouchers to make a purchase with them, often they suffer a loss and huge disappointment.  It is high time that something concrete was put in place in this regard.  Fianna F&aacute;il is publishing a Bill next week to deal with the matter.  If it comes before the House we hope that the Minister of State will support it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen has made reference to what he is trying to achieve within his Department.  Perhaps the Minister of State will specify what the consumer rights Bill will do in respect of time limits, discounting and the loss of vouchers.  It is a big issue and it has been brought to our attention.  People lose their vouchers from time to time and when they seek to recover or acquire a replacement voucher they are met with stonewalling from many retailers.</p></speech>

As politicians, the best advice we should give to consumers who buy or receive gift vouchers is to ensure that the vouchers are used as quickly as possible.  This is also important.  People have a tendency to lose them, leave them in a drawer or let them go out of date.  That is the best advice we can give at this stage.  The consumer rights Bill, published in 2015, contained a set of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers.  We must also bear in mind the European Communities regulations.  We want to listen to all of the views possible on the area of the validity of these gift cards.  I am anxious to progress the scheme under the consumer rights Bill but we have to also take in to account the European Union legislative proposals for the directive on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for online services and other digital sales of goods.  In this situation I say to the Deputy that we will take all views on board and listen to all sides here.  We have the draft consumer rights Bill and obviously we want to be balanced to ensure we have the rights of the customers and businesses.</p></speech>

It goes to the heart of the situation that the State faces on Brexit; how exactly can we ensure that the economic recovery continues.  I have recently published a document form my Department about that very topic.  It is about helping firms to innovate, to do research and to make sure they are prepared for Brexit.  Earlier today I outlined to the House the range of issues that will make  difference in our firms' survival.  Access to finance is going to be absolutely critical and I have outlined a detailed approach, including the contacts with the European Commission we are taking in that respect.</p>  <p>  We have to ensure that jobs continue to be created.  There is no question that we have had a very successful action plan for jobs.  It is one of the key instruments to continue to support job creation.   The action plan for jobs process is working.  Since the plan was launched in early 2012, there are over 225,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to more than 2 million in the first half of the year.  Unemployment has fallen significantly with 18,000 new jobs created in the first six months of 2017 and in the same period employment grew faster in the regions - this is often not noted - at 2.8% more than in Dublin at 1.5%, with four out of five jobs created in the regions.</p>  <p>  The preparation of the action plan for jobs 2018 has started.  I held a forum in Farmleigh with all the key sectors to discuss what they felt the Government should prioritise for next year.  It was decided that we should focus on a smaller number of actions, but that they should be very key actions with regard to the Brexit challenge and where the economy is at this point.</p>  <p>  We will focus on more strategic actions to ensure a significant impact on sustainable jobs creation.  There are challenges out there and every action needs to be taken to continue the economic recovery.</p></speech>

Will the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation confirm that is recognised that we must lift the bar now to its highest level ever? The competition is greater, the threats are many and added to by Brexit and the competition from outside and within the European Union.  Competition is also affected by the added difficulties that have occurred around obtaining planning permission given that it is just as easy to give a quick and positive response as it is to give a slow and negative response.  Is it fully recognised that these challenges now presented to us are greater than Ireland has ever experienced before? Is it recognised that we have the will and the ways to deal with the issues?</p></speech>

A really sustained cross-government approach is necessary to continue the economic recovery.  We cannot take it for granted.  We must continue to focus on all the right areas, particularly on the competition aspect, as I spoke of earlier.  We must ensure that businesses who may need temporary financial support  have it.  This is extremely important.  I will work with colleagues to make sure that the new action plan for jobs focuses on the right areas, as informed by business, so we can continue to build that strong economy.  If we want the economic recovery to continue it is important that the Government continues to support enterprises, businesses and to put money into research and development.  I recently made an announcement, with the Taoiseach, of funding for research centres.  In the budget the Deputy will have seen that the Future Dairy project - in the agriculture sector - received extra funding to make sure that the dairy industry stays at the cutting edge of innovation.  On a recent trade mission I could see that in the UAE and Oman there is huge concern about food security.  Ireland certainly should be in a position to provide to some of those markets.</p><p>That kind of research is what will keep our economy operating very well.</p></speech>

The Action Plan for Jobs will be one of the key vehicles but it is only one.  It is also about ensuring regional development.  The Deputy would have seen in recent times that indigenous local companies are growing.  A huge number of new companies are registering with the Companies Office every month, so there is huge activity and innovation, and people who are willing to take risks to set up companies.  There is also continued foreign direct investment.  If we consider the job announcements even in the past two or three weeks, we have had Regeneron in Limerick, which shows huge confidence in Limerick, a recent announcement in Waterford, two recent announcements in Drogheda and a company opened its centre in Galway recently.  Those are just four examples.  I see no reason that this level of regional investment should not continue.  There is every indication it will continue but we cannot be complacent.  There are very serious challenges facing us, with Brexit probably being the most serious one.  All the indications are that Brexit will be very challenging for the vast majority of Irish businesses.</p></speech>

I take some responsibility for that but I ask Ministers and Deputies to take some responsibility for it also.  The purpose of the clock opposite us is to be mindful of the time.  It is not right that we will get through only ten or 11 questions today.  It is unfair to those Members who have questions tabled.

The current legal position is that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices.  My Department obtained advice on the issue of civil fines from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  In that context, any national legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties having regard to the protection afforded under Article 38.1. </p>  <p>  On 22 March 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.  One of the aims of the directive is to ensure that all national competition authorities are able to impose effective deterrent fines.  The proposal is currently being debated at the Council working group on competition and is also being considered by the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission published an Issues Paper entitled Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences on 27 January 2016.  The Issues Paper invited views on the enforcement powers of the State&rsquo;s main financial and economic regulators, including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the issue of administrative and civil fines was raised.  I understand the CCPC made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on 19 September 2017, in response to the Issues Paper, requesting the power to levy such fines.  With respect to any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise in due course, we will carefully consider them in the Department.</p></speech>

Do he believe the CCPC  should be empowered with financial sanctions?  Some of our other regulations such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation or the Data Protection Commissioner have powers to impose a financial sanction, yet this regulator does not.  It is high time we seriously examined this matter.  The Minister of State has cited to us on a number of occasions when we have raised this matter the constitutional issue but no more than the lack of regulations covering the gift voucher industry, which we conversed about earlier, it is the consumer who is ultimately losing out.  What is the Minister of State's own take on this issue?  Is he in favour of such a measure or will he merely coast along and allow another consultation process to drift on.  We have had numerous comments, as the Minister of State will know, from the Attorney General on the constitutional prohibition in regard to it.  Is the Minister of State in favour or not in favour of such a measure?</p></speech>

There are two areas concerned.  The proposal currently being debated by the Council's working group and the European Commission has to be considered by the European Parliament.  At this stage it is impossible for us to say what format the final EU measures will take.  We must also bear in mind that the CCPC had made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on the area of the levy of fines.  The main argument in regard to all this is with respect to Article 38.1 of the Constitution.  We are listening to the debate in Europe and as soon as recommendations or proposals that may emanate from the Law Reform Commission's exercise come through, we will consider those in due course.</p></speech>

I want her to be clear as to the nature of the criticism we make of her.  She will be aware that the response of the State to the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe has been one of the issues of greatest political controversy in this country during the past three years.  It has led to the resignation of a Minister for Justice and Equality and others.  In spite of that, when we have raised legitimate concerns about what the State has known, she has sought to undermine those concerns and deny the seriousness of the issues we are raising.</p><p>What the T&aacute;naiste has done repeatedly is respond to allegations that we are not making against her.  Last night, she sought legal advice in respect of issues which are not relevant to the matters of concern to her.</p> <p> I want to outline to the T&aacute;naiste Fianna F&aacute;il's criticism of her.  It is this.  In May 2015, the T&aacute;naiste was aware of the strategy of the Garda Commissioner to attack and to try to personally destroy the reputation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  We do not say that the T&aacute;naiste formulated that strategy, we do not say that she was part of the make-up of that strategy but we say she was aware of that strategy.  To use a phrase that was used elsewhere on this issue, the T&aacute;naiste was privy to that strategy.  Our criticism is that the T&aacute;naiste did nothing to stop it.  The T&aacute;naiste did nothing to give the impression that it was wrong what was happening and, instead, she publicly sought to present herself as being supportive of Maurice McCabe and supportive of whistleblowers.</p> <p> It is also very significant that the Taoiseach on a number of occasions last week made false statements to this House.  We know already that on two occasions he made false statements.  He also made a third false statement on 14 November, which was Tuesday of last week, when he stated, "as things stand, the Department [of Justice and Equality] has not been able to find any record of being informed before the fact of the legal strategy the Commissioner was going to pursue."  We now know that is incorrect.  We know that on 9 November the Department was aware of this email.  What I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste is when did she become aware of this email.  I saw reports in the newspaper that the T&aacute;naiste became aware of it on Thursday of last week.  If that is so, why then did she not bring this to the attention of the Taoiseach?  Why did the T&aacute;naiste not go to the Taoiseach on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday, or indeed Monday, and tell him about this email so that he could correct the record of the D&aacute;il?</p> <p> Second, can the T&aacute;naiste tell us, after the Taoiseach spoke to her in Cavan on 11 November during the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, did she speak to any officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, and if she did speak to them, what did she ask them and what did she tell them?  Finally, when did the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, know about the existence of this email?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300012#K00200"><p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.  There are a lot of questions there.</p>  <p>  I want to be absolutely clear that the first time that I knew about the email was last Thursday when I was in contact with the Department.  As I have said on the record, that was the first time that I heard that this email existed - the very first time.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan is absolutely inaccurate in stating that I did not act on concerns.  That is completely and utterly inaccurate.  I have made it very clear that there was no role for me in the legal strategy.  Indeed, many Members of this House in the course of the questions to me suggested, contrary to what Deputy O'Callaghan stated, that I should have become involved in the legal strategy in some way.  I could not do that and the legal advice yesterday confirmed that once again.</p>  <p>  But to suggest that I did nothing about whistleblowers during my time as Minister for Justice and Equality is completely wrong.  The very first thing I did was I met Maurice McCabe and his wife, Lorraine.  I reread the minutes of that meeting this morning, and what I said to Maurice McCabe and what he said to me, and what his wife outlined to me.  I was the first Minister for Justice and Equality who ever met - I think this is accurate - a serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss an issue like this and I did it because I wanted to hear directly what the concerns were so that I would act properly in relation to them during the course of my tenure.</p>  <p>  What I then did was I acted in a whole range of areas to deal with concerns that had arisen.  I could not be involved in the legal strategy.  Referring back to that email in terms of action I could take, at one level that is about the legal strategy.  However, what I did do as a Government Minister was set the tone, I took the actions and I initiated a whole range of initiatives.  One of the first things I did in order to make sure that whistle-blowing was dealt with more seriously was raise my attitude to it publicly.  I raised it privately with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised it with the management of the Department of Justice and Equality on a continuous basis.</p>  <p>  One of the first things I did, which, by the way, had been delayed from 2005, was I said it was really important that there was ethics legislation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I asked the Policing Authority to work on that within a year, I put it into the legislation, so that whistleblowers would be dealt with properly within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If Deputy O'Callaghan reads that ethics report and the ethics code of practice, he will see there is a specific issue in it about speaking out and how whistleblowers who raise complaints should be dealt with within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Every time an issue came up, I made sure that it was dealt with.  I referred it to the proper place.  Instead of discussing these issues here in this House, as we are, while a Charleton tribunal sits to look at all of these issues and in some ways we try and run a parallel process, I set up an independent Policing Authority and I referred the policy of whistleblowers to that authority so that it could look at how it was proceeding and how it needed to change it.  I made it very clear the Government wanted the strongest policy possible in relation to whistleblowers.</p>  <p>  Every time an issue was raised in this House in regard to the treatment of whistleblowers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I was astonished at some of the things that were said here and I continually raised them with my officials to raise with the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I raised them myself.  I continually demanded that they were dealt with properly.</p></speech>

I am telling the T&aacute;naiste what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il last week was he justified not doing anything because it happened after the event.  We know now that is not correct.  What the Taoiseach stated was, "The Department was not in a position, after the fact, to express concerns about it or counsel against it."</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste could have expressed reservations about the legal strategy.  She did not do that.</p></speech>

It seems to me that there was a conspiracy to ruin this honourable man and that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the T&aacute;naiste's former Department were part of this conspiracy.  I say this is because the T&aacute;naiste has refused to provide clear answers and explanations.  This is the T&aacute;naiste's last chance to answer those questions and to provide the necessary clarity.</p></speech>

That email was then sent on to the T&aacute;naiste.  It strikes me as very strange that this email and the telephone conversation happened at all.  It is very strange that the people concerned would be sharing information on a legal strategy and then sharing it with the T&aacute;naiste who, after all, had no hand, act or part in the formulation of that strategy.  The email clearly showed a deliberate plan to smear Maurice McCabe in the worst possible way.  The criminal complaints being used had been already disproved.  The T&aacute;naiste knew this and yet she did nothing.  Why did the T&aacute;naiste do nothing?</p></speech>

She said that she could not remember the email but I do not accept that because the political controversy surrounding Maurice McCabe had already led to the resignation of a Minister for Justice and Equality and a Garda Commissioner.  It centred on allegations against Sergeant McCabe of which the T&aacute;naiste was aware for a whole year, so not reading or remembering this email is, frankly, not believable.  It is baffling that the T&aacute;naiste did not object in some way to the Garda Commissioner's strategy.</p></speech>

She also continued to parrot this line that the whistleblower would enjoy protection from the Government.</p>  <p>  It was initially claimed by An Taoiseach, presumably after discussions with her, that the T&aacute;naiste had no knowledge of the strategy prior to Sergeant McCabe's cross examination.  That is not true.  The T&aacute;naiste knew three days in advance and yet she insisted, and allowed the Taoiseach to insist, that she did not know.  Furthermore, she failed to explain how this email came to light only following a parliamentary question.  She has not clarified how it did not show up in the initial O'Neill scoping exercise or the discovery for the Charlton tribunal.  Her refusal to provide plausible answers has placed her at the centre of this scandal.  The T&aacute;naiste may think that she will weather this storm, that she will ride it out but she will not because the terrible vista of a conspiracy to malign a good man, to smear him as a sex abuser in order to shut him up is not some minor political episode that can be simply brushed away.  </p></speech>

I will not take a lecture from her on due process and fairness.  I have always supported due process in every situation.  In fact, it has been a hallmark of the way I approached this entire issue.  I have been providing answers.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, I am not trying to hide anything.  I was not part of any conspiracy to undermine Sergeant McCabe; quite the contrary.  When Sergeant McCabe came to see me he spoke, for example, about the penalty points and all of the work that he felt needed to be done on that.  That is just one area he raised with me.  I took a whole range of actions to make sure the penalty points system was changed and I acted on many of the recommendations he made.  That is just one example of taking seriously what he had to say.</p>  <p>  I would make the point that these issues are before the Charlton tribunal.  I conferred with Deputy McDonald's colleagues and other Deputies in this House on the terms of reference of that tribunal and all of these issues are yet to be determined by the tribunal.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the email, what I have said about when I was told about it is accurate.  That is absolutely accurate.  I was asked previously if I contacted officials after our party meeting.  I did not contact them until the Thursday.  That is when I spoke to them.

I did say that it should be referred and it has been referred.  To say that I did not act is not correct.

It would have been a criminal act for me to try to influence the legal strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I acted by referring how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was dealing with whistleblowers to the independent Policing Authority, so that the way that whistleblowers were dealt with would be stronger and clearer.  I asked the authority to look at the policy in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how it was dealing with whistleblowers so that they would be dealt with better.  I raised the issue of the supports that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was getting.  I asked if he was getting one-to-one support and whether he was being helped to deal with the various issues.  I asked if his requests in relation to various personal issues which I do not want to mention here were being dealt with properly.  On every occasion, publicly and privately, I raised issues about how whistleblowers were being dealt with to make sure that they were getting the best possible supports within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

My party has always believed in due process and I have always believed in due process.  She can speak for her own party in regard to how it handles issues that arise but I can speak for my party, and I have always followed the principle of natural justice and due process.</p>  <p>  When the issue emerged in regard to Maurice McCabe and his treatment with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I am not speaking to any script, as the Deputy can see, I am responding to the questions that are being asked here, and I can respond to them fully because I am telling the full truth about the situation, as I had experience and knowledge of it in regard to this whole episode, the email spoke about a legal strategy.  Sergeant McCabe was represented at the O'Higgins commission.  Obviously, he had full legal representation and his legal rights were being protected there.  This email came in the context of the establishment and the work of a commission that was actively under way.  What I have made clear is where I had responsibility as a Minister in regard to whistleblowing, in the same way that the previous Government, which was the first Government to act, under the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, brought in the protected disclosures, I sent that protected disclosure policy from the Garda, as I have already said, over to the Policing Authority.  What emerged in that email was about an approach that counsel had taken.  We know that, subsequently, there was further clarification about that counsel's role and the role of the Garda Commissioner.  In fact, much more detail, which I was not aware of, emerged a year later, which is what I was referring to when I spoke to the Taoiseach.  I was referring to all of the information that came out later.</p></speech>

In particular, it refers to the national planning framework, which is currently in draft form, how this document relates to the mid-western region of Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, and in particular how it fails to address balanced regional development adequately and fails to harness the potential of the mid-west as a driver of national growth, as Ireland plans its future going forward to 2040.  There is still an unhealthy dominance by the greater Dublin area.  The draft plan does not fully harness the existing mid-west infrastructural entities, such as Shannon Airport and its international connectivity and industrial base, the university campus of Limerick and its innovative industries, the Shannon Estuary and its potential for maritime economic development, both in Clare and Limerick, and the position of the mid-west, particularly Ennis and Limerick, as the centre of the economic corridor between Galway and Cork.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government promises to put in place measures to revitalise all Ireland in order that benefits are felt on every doorstep and in every community.  It seems that, far from moving towards that aim of balanced regional development, we are going in the opposite direction.  The proposal to restrict population growth outside larger urban areas is going to impact negatively on the fabric of rural towns and villages.  The plan must provide for population and economic growth on a scale that will deliver balance in our economic recovery.  To date, this has been a Dublin-centric model.  The greater Dublin area will attract 50% of the estimated national population growth by 2040.  This does not reflect equitable or effective regional balanced development, especially when one considers the housing shortage that will exist in the greater Dublin area for the next decade, as supply fails to meet demand.  Population growth must be more regionalised and this can only happen if employment opportunities and services are developed in regions and not just concentrated in the Dublin area.</p>  <p>  The draft plan is under review.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that, when the plan is finalised, it effectively and definitively addresses regional development by funding infrastructure and economic drivers which will unlock the potential of regions such as the mid-west?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300014#M01600"><p>I thank Deputy Harty for those questions.  I was taking questions earlier in regard to jobs growth and one of the key points, of course, is that the majority of the jobs that are now being created are in regional areas.  The mid-west is one of the fastest growing regions in the country.  We had the jobs announcement which I attended in Limerick a couple of weeks ago, where Regeneron announced 300 very welcome jobs, and another announcement attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, in County Clare, where there were a further 50 jobs.  There is very strong growth, although we can cannot be complacent and we have to make sure it continues.  That is why I published my Department's Brexit plan.</p>  <p>  The national planning framework is at a draft stage.  The consultation just finished last week and there have been a good number of submissions in regard to it.  It is, of course, a national planning framework for the long term and it sets out a new, long-term strategic planning and investment context for Ireland over the next 20 years.  It is about a high level national vision for Ireland 2040 and will provide the framework and principles to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years, so it is extremely important.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, there will be regional plans, and it is important the Deputy is aware of this.  Of course, the plan is still at draft stage.  Some 1,000 submissions have been received and are currently being considered by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Murphy.  Those submissions are informing the final national planning framework document and every submission is, of course, important.  I believe the framework will be very valuable for co-ordinating across Government different policies and investment on national and regional development.  It will be published in association with the capital investment plan.  That is the first time the two have been published together and I believe that will be important as well.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about his own area.  Within the context of growing Limerick's population by 50% to 60% and expanding its national and international economic capacity, there is specific reference to the role of Shannon Airport.  Shannon Development and the Shannon-Foynes Port Company will, it is hoped, build on recent successes and add to the overall vision for counties Limerick and Clare.  There is a way to go yet in terms of taking account of the needs of different parts of the country.  The plan is still at draft stage and I have no doubt the Deputy will make the views from County Clare known in terms of the finalisation of the report.</p></speech>

Dublin Airport had a market share of 72% in 2005 and it has a market share of 87% today.  Shannon Airport has huge untapped potential in regard to development as an airport, yet it has only 5% of the market.</p><p>It would be a driver of economic development in the mid-west.<br/><br/>Current aviation policy seems happy to allow market forces to dictate how our airports develop.</p></speech>

The uncontrolled development of Dublin into a city state must not be inadvertently enshrined in our national planning framework.  The unbalanced aviation policy illustrates the difficulties our regions are encountering in attracting development, jobs and infrastructure that would allow them to grow effectively and contribute to our economic development.</p></speech>

In every contact that I have had with foreign multinationals, I have spoken of the importance of companies taking the opportunity to locate in regional areas.  We have seen major successes in the Shannon area as regards aviation, particularly in terms of leasing.  The Action Plan for Jobs, which I will publish in January, will refer to Shannon as a centre of excellence in aviation, leasing and so on and will place particular emphasis on how that can be grown further.  Ireland is regarded as a centre of excellence.  Shannon leasing and the work of Shannon Holdings have developed considerably.</p>  <p>  As a capital city, Dublin is always attractive in terms of the balance that the Deputy has described.  That is in common with other countries.  As we focus more on regional development, however, passenger numbers at Shannon will change.  Focusing more on our regional tourism policy will, given its potential, support the development in the region the Deputy seeks.</p></speech>

The cause of juvenile arthritis is multifactorial but includes genetic disposition and environmental factors.  Severe pain is associated with the condition and, because children are growing, any extended period of inflammation can affect their joint formation.  Therefore, early and aggressive treatment of the condition gives the best results for children.</p>  <p>  Parenting of a child with juvenile arthritis can be a rollercoaster experience.  The Irish Children's Arthritis Network, iCan, is a 100% volunteer-based, parent-led, grassroots charity.  It provides a national support network for children with arthritis and their families through the provision of factual, emotional and practical support.  iCan has funded the first ever dedicated rheumatology assessment suite at Crumlin children's hospital.</p>  <p>  The charity cannot do it all on its own and current services for the children in question are deficient.  The Government has a responsibility to provide a fully resourced, staffed and funded rheumatology service to ensure that these children, who are waiting in pain, are diagnosed early and treated quickly.  A delay in diagnosis and treatment risks permanent damage to joints and skeletal deformities.</p>  <p>  There are 793 children waiting for an outpatient appointment to see a consultant.  Of these, 226 have been waiting for more than 18 months.  There are 103 children who have been waiting for inpatient or day case treatment for more than six months.  The standards set out in the model of care for paediatrics are not being adhered to and clinic appointments are regularly being cancelled.  The three-monthly clinic monitoring of children on biological drugs is important but it is not being done.</p>  <p>  There should be six paediatric rheumatologists in the country.  We have but two.  Crumlin children's hospital has submitted a business plan to provide adequate but basic services for these children.  As an absolute minimum, a third paediatric rheumatologist, with a full multidisciplinary team, including doctors, physiotherapists, psychologists and ophthalmologists, is required urgently.</p>  <p>  Will the Government fund the development of the juvenile arthritis service at Crumlin children's hospital in line with the hospital's proposed business plan?  Will it also approve the appointment of a third paediatric consultant with a multidisciplinary team?</p></speech>

I am aware of the work done by Arthritis Ireland - I have taken a special interest in that - and iCan.  The aim of the presentation that the latter made this week was to increase awareness of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, JIA, and to highlight the need for additional services.  This is a common disease of childhood.  It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 children under 16 years of age with juvenile arthritis.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is aware of the challenges and has met representatives of Arthritis Ireland to discuss service needs in the health service.  The increased investment in the health services will be helpful in dealing more effectively with these issues, as will the new children's hospital, where there will be an opportunity to put the new paediatric models of work into play once it is built.</p>  <p>  The rheumatology specialty continues to be one of the most rapidly growing services in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, accounting for the highest number of medical day case patients per year.  This demand has had an effect on waiting lists for paediatric rheumatology services.  The Minister is awaiting the HSE's service plan.  He will address the question of how many consultant paediatric rheumatologists are required in so far as resources permit, but he is conscious of the need for more consultants in the context of children with this condition.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been undertaken.  For example, the paediatric rheumatology consultants in Crumlin were removed from the general medical roster, which has facilitated a greater focus on rheumatology services.  That is important.  The theatre closure situation is slowly improving, which will have a positive impact on access to joint injections for Crumlin patients.  The HSE has developed a national model of care for paediatric health care services, including the development of a hub-and-spoke model of care for paediatric rheumatology as part of a national clinical network in paediatrics.  A key priority for the children's hospital group is to develop a shared strategy to achieve the integration of services, including rheumatology, in advance of the move to the new children's hospital.</p>  <p>  This is a difficult condition for children and their families.  It requires ongoing intensive care.  The Minister for Health and the HSE have been taking some actions to improve the situation, but more investment is clearly necessary.</p></speech>

Children suffering from juvenile arthritis are entitled to a quality health service, something that they do not have at the moment.  These children and their families are demanding that funding for a third rheumatologist and a multidisciplinary team be included in the 2018 HSE national service plan.</p>  <p>  Some 70% of children presenting with this disease are from outside Dublin.  Therefore, we obviously need an integrated national and regional service along the lines of the European hub-and-spoke model, Crumlin hospital being the hub with links to regional centres providing ophthalmology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychological services etc.  Two clinical nurse specialists are required to co-ordinate and manage the transition of teenagers to the regional adult services.  These measures are required urgently and I look forward to the Minister for Health ensuring that the services in question, particularly the third rheumatologist and the multidisciplinary team, are included and funded in the 2018 HSE national service plan.</p></speech>

He has been actively working with the relevant local authorities and I have no doubt that, as we have responded very quickly in recent times when there has been flooding, there will be a speedy response.  It is a dreadful situation for families to find themselves in.  The Minister of State is working very actively to ensure that there will be an appropriate response.</p></speech>

It appears that when it comes to the survivors of the Magdalen laundries all of these worthy commitments go out the window.  Following a comprehensive investigation into the administration of the Magdalen restorative justice scheme, the Ombudsman has today published a damning report into the scheme's failures.</p>  <p>  What the investigation has exposed beggars belief.  The Department of Justice and Equality administered the scheme in a manner which deliberately sought to exclude women from the redress to which they were entitled.  Women who were effectively imprisoned on a single site, working side-by-side with those deemed eligible for redress, were refused their entitlements on the basis of the Department's incorrect administrative interpretation of the eligibility criteria relating to the 12 institutions covered by the State.  Given that the State has failed the women twice, will the Government do the right thing and act on the recommendations of the Ombudsman?</p></speech>

The scheme applied to 12 named institutions.  To date, &euro;25.7 million has been paid to 684 women under the scheme, which is still open.  I understand that the Department of Justice and Equality co-operated fully with the Ombudsman in the course of the investigation.  There are a number of recommendations in respect of women who were outside of the 12 named institutions.</p>  <p>  The report has just been received.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has stated that full and careful consideration will be given to all of the recommendations.  The Ombudsman has welcomed his response.  It is an issue which will be considered by the relevant Department, namely, the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have no doubt that, in line with previous reports from the Ombudsman, as many of the recommendations as possible will be taken on board.</p></speech>

It is something for which the T&aacute;naiste indicated support in the past.  Starting on Saturday, Change the Conversation involves 16 days of action by Women's Aid on violence against women in the home.  It has written to all Members and asked them to wear a purple ribbon.  Given the T&aacute;naiste's support and indications from most female Members from the Fine Gael Party for the production of a further Sexual Abuse and Violence Ireland, SAVI, report, will she please lean on the Taoiseach to spend the money and come up with a comprehensive report on sexual and domestic violence in the country?  The last report was published fifteen and a half years ago.</p>  <p>  Sexual and domestic violence has been on the increase and has gone under the radar.  We really need a report.  The Taoiseach complained a report would cost about &euro;1 million.  The women of Ireland, and the most vulnerable women and children of Ireland, are worth that money.  I would like to know what the T&aacute;naiste thinks and whether she can play a role, as a woman and T&aacute;naiste, in convincing the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to get out the cheque book and spend money on a much needed report,  given that it is Change the Conversation week.</p></speech>

We need up-to-date macro information on sexual and domestic violence in this country.  The Taoiseach does not need convincing.  This matter was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee last week.  The initial scoping work has begun to determine how precisely it will be carried out.</p></speech>

Concerns are increasing about the Mercosur deal and the intention of the European Commission to increase the offer being made to the four countries which are objecting, including Paraguay.  The European Commission had been offered 120,000 tonnes of beef imports, which would come into Ireland and other countries.  If the offer is increased, which seems likely, it will have a detrimental impact on our farming industry, in particular the beef sector.  It would be appropriate to take immediate action to ensure that we are not flooded with cheap beef that would destroy our already vulnerable beef industry.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach has made his views on the issue very clearly known.  Ireland wants more trade deals put in place, but we have very strong defensive issues, in particular on beef.  Any Mercosur deal is very sensitive and the Irish concerns have been very forcefully made by the Taoiseach.  We have sought and received support from other countries.  The French President has also been very strong on this issue, specifically in respect of concerns from a beef perspective.  We have some strong allies.  I can assure the Deputy that the concerns he outlined have been expressed very clearly by the Government on a number of levels.</p></speech>

Incredibly, she proposes to give more powers and resources to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  I say it is incredible because, given its very poor performance over recent years, especially its bungling of the Fitzpatrick trial, it is hard to understand why the Government is taking this approach.  The T&aacute;naiste has had a report on that office's handling of the Fitzpatrick trial for five months.  I have asked her on a regular basis when we will get sight of the report.  Can she tell us the reason for the further delay?  When can we expect to see the report?</p></speech>

It must have been misreported.  The Government plans to establish the ODCE on a statutory footing, with commissioners as opposed to the current model whereby it is part of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am not in a position to publish the ODCE report because I have strong legal advice that it is not within my power under the legislation to do so.</p></speech>

Laois has been mentioned already this morning but on Tuesday night in Kerry we also had extensive rainfall that caused very bad flooding, particularly in north and mid Kerry.  My town of Ballyheigue was flooded, along with premises in Ballyduff, Causeway, Listowel, Tarbert and Ballylongford.  One individual suffered over &euro;60,000 of damage to his property.  I ask that in light of this, along with any other county that received a heavy rainfall, the Government should not forget to respond to Kerry.  Funding should be made available to repair the properties and the local and tertiary roads, many of which were washed away beyond repair.</p></speech>

Given what we have seen in the past day or so we absolutely must keep this issue and how we respond to it under review.  We saw a very good response from the agencies with Storm Ophelia but the Deputy is correct and we must stay targeted on this.  If we can replicate the model used during Storm Ophelia, it would be the direction in which to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is very active on this matter today, ensuring all the resources needed in the area will be brought to bear to help those who have been so directly affected by this flooding.</p></speech>

Recently, there was a ruling in the UK Supreme Court that Scotland can set a minimum price for alcohol, and this paves the way for similar minimum price controls in Northern Ireland.  Similar price controls will help curb the leakage of revenue through smuggling but will the Minister and the House consider the progression of a Bill stuck in the Bills lottery, the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017, as this would help retailers, especially in the Border region?  Surely allowing passage of this Bill to the next stage would help many businesses along the Border corridor and protect much needed State revenue.</p></speech>

We had consultation in my Department between retailer representative bodies and officials last Friday and they will revert to me in the coming days with proposals to ensure we can achieve what we want, which is a really important piece of public health legislation, without placing an unfair burden on small shops, which is the concern of a number of people.  The Deputy is correct that minimum unit pricing saw a very significant landmark ruling and we now intend to introduce minimum unit pricing in this country, as it is a key part of the public health alcohol legislation.  I hope to be back in the Seanad to pass that Bill before Christmas with the co-operation of Senators in all parties.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about cross-Border matters.  A previous Government made a commitment that it would introduce minimum unit pricing, conscious of the fact it is not currently in place in Northern Ireland.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Tallaght hospital, the busiest trauma hospital in the State, was declared by the head of its accident and emergency department as dangerous and unsafe.  It is unsafe because it has been reduced to operating from five cubicles, with 16 patients waiting to be seen by the accident and emergency department doctors.  There were 140 patients yesterday, which is a 35% higher than usual admission rate.  There was a cardiac arrest patient in the waiting room awaiting investigation.  Another cardiac patient was in the toilet of the department, left agitated for 32 hours while languishing on a trolley.  There are other awful cases, including two people who are 79 years old who were waiting 24 or 32 hours to be seen etc.  What can be done to provide extra resources as this is replicated in hospitals throughout the State?  We need extra resourcing as this must be tackled now.  The patients and staff deserve better.</p></speech>

Much of it includes extra transitional care beds and extra home care packages to help discharge patients from our hospitals.  It is worth noting that whereas one patient on a trolley is one too many and the difficulties felt by people and described by the Deputy is not something any of us would stand over or accept, there are 1,300 fewer patients on hospital trolleys this November as compared with last November.  Each and every day this month there have been fewer patients than on the corresponding day last month.  It is important we acknowledge that out of respect for the front-line staff and the measures they are implementing.</p>  <p>  Deputy Crowe is entirely correct on the matter of bed capacity and we do not have enough beds in the health service.  I am due to receive a bed capacity review in the next couple of weeks and that will outline how many beds we need in the health service now and into the future.  I will endeavour to progress that through our new capital plan.</p></speech>

An application was made in the summer but it still has not received an answer.  I raised the matter two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach and I raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, last week.  Both of them indicated it would be brought to the Minister's attention.  It is absolutely crucial the Minister gets involved and ensures approval is given.  The hospital needs time to get the staff in place so the beds can be available this winter rather than winter 2018.</p></speech>

That would give the people in this country billions of euro for housing, health and education, which we need so badly.  The report would examine how a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5% should be imposed.  It is currently not being imposed and this allows corporations like Apple to pay less than 1% in tax on billions of euro in profit.  The average tax rate is not the 12.5% claimed by the Government but approximately 4%.  If we had a minimum effective corporate tax rate that companies had to pay before any of these loopholes kicked in, we could raise at least another &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion in revenue, which would transform the lives of Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I appreciate the views of the Deputy on it but as I explained last night, I profoundly disagree with the approach he has taken.  I reiterate that corporation tax policy and decisions we make on how to tax activity within our country is a legitimate part of an economic and political model for a country of our scale and size, located where we are and which has proven successful over many decades in attracting investment to our country.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett and I debated last night, missing in the analysis he offers is the role of that policy in generating very valuable jobs.  There are over 200,000 such jobs in our country.</p><p>A decision to move to the kind of tax rate and model the Deputy has described could pose a risk to those jobs.  In view of that and the need for certainty in our tax model and for it to be clearly understood and impartially implemented by the Revenue Commissioners, I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment.  As I said last night, I accept that we and many other jurisdictions must evolve and improve our tax code to ensure it meets the growing international consensus regarding how tax should be collected globally and the Government and I are playing our part in that.  However, Ireland cannot be a global tax collector for any company and we cannot do all this work on our own but, rather, it has to happen as part of a broader global journey.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300019#R00100"><p>I move amendment No. 35:</p><blockquote>In page 32, line 11, to delete &ldquo;interest paid&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;interest or other distribution payable&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>Section 19 amends section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which deals with the taxation of special purpose structured finance companies.  The current regime was set up to create a tax neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.  </p><p>Last year's Finance Act introduced restrictions on the ability of 'qualifying companies', within the meaning of section 110, to remove capital profits arising from Irish property from the Irish tax net.  </p><p>Revenue has kept the use of section 110 structures under review and has identified a gap in the Finance Act 2016 amendments, which was not identified at the time.  That gap involves the use of shares which derive their value from Irish land.  </p><p>This Report Stage amendment is technical in nature.  It corrects the drafting to ensure that the Finance Bill amendment to section 110 applies only to interest which becomes payable on or after 19 October 2017.  This ensures that there is no retrospective impact on interest which is paid on or after 19 October 2017 but which was accrued in previous years.  Without this change, the provision would affect the tax liability of a company for those previous years which would be retrospective legislation.</p><p>I commend this amendment to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300019#R00200"><p>If I understand the Minister correctly, what he says is a technical amendment is actually an amendment of very serious substance because we want retrospection.  The Minister does not.  We know that but when it comes to the section 110 tax break we absolutely want retrospection, as much of it as we can get because the section 110 tax break has been ruthlessly exploited by vulture funds to be, as the Minister describes it, "tax neutral".  I love these euphemisms.  "Tax neutral" means, for the ordinary member of the public, these financial vultures which have swept in and made an absolute fortune at our expense pay no tax on their enormous profits.  The Minister established structures that would allow them do so.</p>  <p>  For the layman who does not understand the technicalities of this, let us keep it really simple.  No worker in this country gets tax neutral status, a special dispensation not to pay any tax.  There are measures in our tax code that were designed to ensure these enormously profitable, speculative, vulture-type entities, would be "tax neutral", and would pay no tax on their income or their capital gains.  </p><p> Where the Government had made some efforts to close that loophole for the future, although not completely, the Minister says he is determined that it not be retrospective.  Most people would say that we should claw back as much as we possibly can from these vulture entities that have been let away with murder under section 110 tax breaks.  </p> <p> Will the Minister clarify that I have understood him correctly and that his fear is that unless we make this amendment, some of these section 110 companies could have a bigger tax liability, that is, the Exchequer could receive more tax revenue from these section 110 entities?  If that is what he is saying, then I will certainly vote against the Government's amendment.</p></speech>

It appears that a technical amendment is a substantive amendment, which could have substantive changes to the tax liabilities of these section 110 companies.  Will the Minister confirm that Irish property that would be put into a section 110 structure would now be taxable retrospectively and therefore would not be tax neutral if this amendment does not go through?  Will he confirm that if this amendment does go through, anything up until last year's Finance Act will continue to be able to avoid paying tax through those section 110 structures?</p></speech>

We made those changes a year ago.  We amended section 17 of the current Finance Bill as published to include shares that derive their value from Irish land in the definition of specified mortgages.  In respect of the interest issue, the Minister now proposes to make a change that may be technical but is not without consequence.  He needs to clarify this issue.</p></speech>

He needs to give the House a clear indication of the impact of this proposal will be.  Will it result in a gain to the Exchequer and if so, how much and over what period?  Alternatively, will it result in a loss to the Exchequer and if so, how much is that loss and over what period?  It is regrettable that in the case of these amendments, which are quite technical, no detailed briefing material is available, whether on a dedicated website available to people who are dealing with the Finance Bill or by way of a detailed briefing.  We need to know.  There is now a budgetary oversight committee and the Government has committed to greater transparency but it has introduced an amendment such as this without a detailed explanation of what it is about and its likely financial impact on the Exchequer, good or bad.  It is essential that the Government clarify this now.  If there is no financial impact, will the Minister tell Members in order that they can assess the proposal?</p></speech>

While colleagues may differ in their evaluation of the policy overall, the amendment deals with shares that derive their value from property that are held in section 110 companies.</p>  <p>  As for Deputy Boyd Barrett's remarks, we do not tax retrospectively.  We differ on that.  Regardless of what the asset or the income is, our approach to taxation is to tax from this moment on if we change the law, which is why I am making this change.  I do not believe that retrospective taxation would be enabled if the amendment was not passed, as it is such a well-established tenet of how we implement tax policy here.  On any benefit that the State will accrue from this amendment, we expect the financial benefit to be exceptionally small as we are not aware of this being used to avoid a tax liability but now that we are aware of the issue I want to change it.  On briefing, these amendments have been available for a period of time.  I have supplied information and clarification to anyone who has sought it from me.  I understand the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has a growing staff, which might be able to assist on matters such as this.  I will be happy to engage with the committee or any Deputy on similar issues for next year's Finance Bill to provide clarification in advance.  </p></speech>

We do not have to hand the Minister's initial note in order to go through it.  This is the problem which I raised yesterday and Deputy Burton has raised it again.  We have amendments before us, which may be very substantial, that were not in the initial draft Bill but could have significant implications and we have not been given a proper explanatory note.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the tax-neutral status of these section 110 companies and his concern that if this amendment is not made, there could be retrospection.  The Minister has said that he does not like retrospection but we do when it relates to section 110 companies.  If the Minister is saying that by not changing it that there is a possibility of retrospectively capturing some tax from section 110 companies, which have got away with murder and have avoided tax to an extent that the Minister cannot give us figures - he has never given us figures on the amounts of tax foregone as a result of the section 110 loophole - then I say to him he should leave it as it is.  Then we can see how we might use the current tax code to get some of the foregone tax lost in recent years as a result of this scandalous section 110 tax-neutral structure, which allows these vulture funds to pay no tax on enormous profits and capital gains.  I refer to shares on property, income gains and the capital gains they might make on those shares on Irish property, which has shot up in value, as well as in respect of the rental income generated from it.  </p></speech>

Will the Minister clarify whether he or his officials made an estimate as to what is the likely gain or loss to the Exchequer and over what period or whether it is neutral to the Exchequer?  If it relates to the underlying shares, that implies there are groups of shareholders who are potential beneficiaries or who will pay extra tax, we do not know which, as a consequence of this arrangement.  Will the Minister also tell us the likely value of the asset portfolios in the companies whose shares the Minister is referencing to make this mechanism available to shareholders in these companies?</p><p>When what happened in relation to section 110 was identified, there was absolute agreement across the House that the loophole should be closed and the Minister's predecessor moved to close it.  Now the Minister is making an amendment to it.  I understand it is complicated.  Tax is always complicated.  However, it is an absolutely fair demand on the Minister that he would explain to the House what it is and who broadly are the shareholders.  Are they likely to be offshore or onshore shareholders?  Are they other companies in chains of companies?  Are they individual savers?  We require an explanation.</p></speech>

Any inference that I am in any way looking to reduce the value or the impact of changes made to how these organisations were taxed in the past is wrong and inaccurate.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners regularly review the tax code to see if we need to make any changes to either deter avoidance or deal with discrepancies that might lead to difficulties in the future.  The Deputy asked me earlier if I could give the House an estimate of a yield.  I told the Deputy that I cannot and the reason is that we have no evidence at the moment that this is being used in any way to diminish a yield that the State should currently be receiving.  However, we are making this change in case it could create an opportunity in the future that we would not want someone to take advantage of or a problem for the tax code overall.</p>  <p>  The second question Deputy Burton put to me concerned who are the shareholders.  They could be any of the groups to which she referred.  I am not in a position to comment on who are the owners of shares of different organisations that fall under the heading of section 110.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, we have a clear policy difference on this matter.  For reasons we have previously debated, I do not believe retrospection would be an improvement within our tax code.  Instead it would undermine the way it has operated.  This is a principle which should be held firm for individuals, companies and organisations such as these.</p></speech>

He is amending an amendment to the section in the consolidated Act which was brought in on Committee Stage.  The amendment to section 19 of the Finance Bill was that this section would only apply to interest paid on or after 19 October 2017.  The significance of this amendment is that it does not include just interest but also other distributions payable.  There is a responsibility on the Minister for Finance to outline the purpose of section 19, the addition of "other distribution payable" and what it means and how it applies, as the Minister states, to the issue of retrospection.  This issue is not clear to us.</p>  <p>  No briefing note was circulated.  For years we have been dealing with this type of situation where technical amendments have been tabled by the Minister for Finance.  Every single year, I have asked, as a matter of course, that the speaking note the Minister is happy to put on the public record in a D&aacute;il debate would be circulated to Deputies in order that we could speed up this process.  If we knew in detail what this was about, perhaps we would not have any difficulty with it.  However, I cannot stand here and support this amendment after the Minister noted on the public record that this is about retrospection while not being clear about what the amendment specifically means, how it interacts with section 19 of the Finance Bill and how it concerns retrospection.  We know that many will try to gain the system by wrapping property up in companies and the value of the shares.  This is a big issue but it does not just relate to this matter.  We will visit it again when we deal with stamp duty issues.  However, I cannot support this amendment if the Minister does not give us a clear explanation of what exactly he is trying to achieve.</p></speech>

To deal with the issue again, as the Deputy will be aware, this year we extended the scope of this provision by also catching shares that derive their value from Irish property, which we debated on Committee Stage.  The intention was to catch any interest payments in respect of the period since budget day, which was 19 October.  However, the drafting in the Finance Bill is not quite right in that it refers to interest paid after budget day.  This, for example, means that interest which was accrued before budget day but paid out after it would be caught by the provision and this would amount to retrospection taxation.  This is the point I have been attempting to make during the debate on this amendment.  By making this change, we will catch the interest since budget day but not before.  This goes back to the differing views on retrospective taxation.</p></speech>

He put on record the rationale for the change.  He explained at the time that the package of anti-avoidance measures was being introduced to deal with a number of specific tax-avoidance schemes which had been uncovered by the Revenue Commissioners.  He said that, essentially, those schemes involved converting what should be taxable income payments into capital gains to avail of the lower capital gains tax, CGT, rates.  The Minister went into an amount of detail in that regard.  I have no issue with introducing anti-avoidance measures to deal with those contrived arrangements.</p><p>I must ask the question on behalf of those who raised the issue who claim that this will also affect bona fide commercial transactions.  Has the Minister examined the impact of this proposal in that respect because a number of people put it to me that the measure will close down most forms of commercially motivated management buy-out transactions and many third party SME company purchases because of the wording adopted?  It is important that the Department would deal with it.  That is the essential claim that is being made by some representatives and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that it would not be the case and that the anti-avoidance measures that have been introduced by him on Committee Stage are only going to affect the type of contrived arrangements we all agree should not be allowed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300023#V00200"><p>The amendment brought forward on Committee Stage to section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, in introducing a new subsection (3A), is intended to counter a specific tax avoidance scheme which has been uncovered by Revenue.  The scheme involves individuals avoiding a liability to income tax where a company indirectly buys back shares from a shareholder and the purchase is funded from the assets of the company.  The changes announced to the legislation are to ensure that distribution treatment correctly applies to such transactions.</p>  <p>  The broad policy objective of the Committee Stage amendment was to ensure that where, in effect, a shareholder receives distributable reserves of a company on a disposal of their shares in that company, then the member is treated as having received a distribution from the company which is subject to income tax.  The draft amendment meets this policy objective.</p>  <p>  That amendment, which now forms section 22 of the Finance Bill, has no impact on bona fide management buy-outs, buy-ins or third party SME company purchases.  The amendment only has application where shareholders enter into arrangements to dispose of their shares and where the consideration is paid from the assets of the target company.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many management buy-outs involve the provision of financing by the target company out of the assets of the company.  However, a bona fide buy-out is not structured on the basis of a shareholder specifically arranging for the proceeds to be funded from assets of the target company.  Bona fide financing arrangements entered into by the purchaser to fund the purchase of the shares are outside of the scope of the new provisions.  Therefore, on the basis that the proposed amendment to section 135 does apply to bona fide management buy-out transactions, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I am advised that Revenue will be issuing comprehensive guidance once the provision has been enacted and that should meet the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

In our economy commercially motivated management buy-outs are an important feature, as are third party SME company purchases and we do not wish in any way to impact on transactions that are commercially motivated.  The nature of the anti-avoidance schemes was explained on Committee Stage, which convert what is essentially taxable income into capital gains and thus avoids the payment of CGT using certain reliefs under a certain tax structure.  I have no issue with that being addressed and I welcome the commitment and reassurance provided by the Minister of State.  I ask that Revenue would monitor the implementation of the measure to address any legitimate concerns that arise that it would in any way impede commercial transactions.  On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

It is directly related to the scandal of the &euro;13 billion Apple case.  It turns what is already an enormous scandal around that &euro;13 billion of tax that Apple should have paid but did not pay, which the Government still does not want to collect, but now we discover, courtesy of the so-called Paradise Papers that in regard to the double Irish tax scam which our tax code facilitated to the tune of &euro;13 billion in lost taxes to the people of this country, the real figure of losses may be far greater.</p><p>The reason for that is the phasing out of the double Irish was indicated as being likely to happen from the end of 2013 onwards because of political pressure in the House.  The pressure was primarily from the left, including from ourselves and Sinn F&eacute;in, and externally from people raging about tax avoidance by multinationals as well as from growing international opprobrium about the scams of these multinationals to rob ordinary people of billions in tax revenue.  That revenue could have gone into housing, health and education, especially at a time of austerity.<br/><br/>We discovered that the so-called closing of the double Irish tax scam was simply a prelude to the opening of another tax scam to benefit Apple and a few other extraordinarily wealthy corporations.  The narrative and chronology is well worth setting out.  In July 2013 Joe Higgins, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I and some others were the only people who wanted Apple brought in, along with Facebook and Google, to appear before the Joint Sub-committee on Global Taxation.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and some Independents who were on the committee closed ranks.  They said that the committee would not bring in representatives from those companies to ask questions about the double Irish.  Not only that, incredibly they turned off the cameras when we were discussing the matter.  There was an unprecedented decision to have the discussion <i>in camera</i>in private session to discuss whether the companies should come in and when a vote would be taken on whether they should come in.  Such was the degree of servility of the entire political establishment in the face of Apple when the rumours about the scale of the double Irish were abounding and being articulated by some of us in the committee.<br/><br/>When we roll the clock on, the scale of the double Irish tax scam becomes clear, as does the likelihood that the Government would be forced into agreeing to close down the loophole.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, scurried over to a private meeting with the chief executive of Apple in January 2014.  He admitted on the record when questioned by us after that meeting that corporation tax was discussed.  I would dearly like to see the minutes of those meetings or the recording of those meetings to learn what was discussed.<br/><br/>We know now, thanks to the paradise papers, that in March, shortly after that meeting, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple started to contact Appleby.  The legal firm specialises in tax avoidance for big corporations.  Apple contacted the legal firm's subsidiaries in March 2014 in the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.  They are all tax havens where there is no corporate tax.  Apple settled on Jersey.  The legal firm acting on behalf of Apple asked whether the jurisdiction in question could confirm that an Irish company could conduct management activities without been subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.  Apple was busy reconfiguring the tax scam and using its Irish companies because of the possibility of the double Irish being closed down.  The then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, went over and met Apple representatives later in the year.  We had a debate at the committee on the 2014 budget.  At the debate I suggested, to much ridicule from the Government, that the much trumpeted double Irish will, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies will be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes but in a slightly different way by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>I did not know how right I was.  The scam was already being planned.  The replacement of the double Irish was already being engineered by the Government and Apple.  How else can the Minister explain the extraordinary coincidence of Apple not paying a single extra cent of tax after the closing of the double Irish, the reconfiguration of its subsidiaries to Jersey and the interaction allowing them to pay no tax?  That has been confirmed by Seamus Coffey.  According to Seamus Coffey, raising the cap to 100% on intangible assets meant that we lost &euro;722 million in tax revenue in 2015.  Mr. Coffey went on to comment on the changes the Government brought in through a recent budget.  He said they are only active from the day of the budget.  He points out that they could have applied to all claims during the period when the Government had raised the allowance to 100%.  He said that would have resulted in up to &euro;1 billion of additional corporation tax being collected in 2018.  In other words, this is not simply history.  The Government decided not to take &euro;1 billion from Apple under next year's budget.  We can only imagine what that could have done for the housing crisis, the health crisis and the lives of people who are chronically under-resourced in areas of key public services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300024#W00200"><p>I went back to look at the debate in the D&aacute;il when this cap was removed to enable full exemption on intangible assets.  The change was brought in by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  He said:</p><blockquote>Section 35 provides for additional enhancements to section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the provision of certain intangible assets for use in an Irish trade. It removes the current cap on the aggregate amount of allowances and related interest expenses that may be claimed and amends the definition of intangible assets which may qualify for the relief to specifically include certain customer lists.</blockquote><p>That is it.  It is completely innocuous.  It was simply a paragraph in a Second Stage speech by the then Minister for Finance.</p><p>However, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Minister knew what the consequence would be.  He knew he was facilitating massive tax avoidance by Apple and other corporations.  He knew that working with intangible assets is a key mechanism by which these companies avoid taxation.  He knew that what subsequently happened would happen.  As the Government is aware, what happened was an explosion of foreign direct investment in intangible assets.  The relevant figure went from approximately &euro;3 billion to approximately &euro;29 billion.  That was an explosion of &euro;26 billion as a result of one paragraph in that speech and one law that was changed for the benefit of these corporations.</p><p>We need answers from the Government.  It is good that the Government is going back to change this under extraordinary pressure.  How can the Government justify the original change being made?  We can read papers on what qualifies as, and the indicators of, tax havens.  There is a paper by Taylor, Richardson and Lanis based on data from Australian and US companies.  They identified large inward movement of intangible assets as tending towards proof of the country in question being a tax haven.  It is a key indicator of a tax haven.  Ireland has this by the bucket-load in view of the explosion in activity that has taken place.</p><p>The Government has a problem in light of Seamus Coffey's paper.  The paper highlights the explosion of &euro;26 billion and explains why it occurred.  It also explains that if the 80% cap had been in place in 2015, then almost &euro;6 billion of these allowances would not have been allowable and would have been subject to tax in 2015.  Had that been the case, up to &euro;722 million in additional corporation tax would have been collected in 2015.  Seamus Coffey went on to say that we do not know what impact not removing that cap would have had and he said that it is unknowable.  The point is the measure does not add anything to the Irish economy.  The Government likes to talk about jobs, etc., but the movement of these intangible assets has nothing whatsoever to do with jobs.</p><p>Another important point was raised by Seamus Coffey.  He maintains not only do we not benefit from this inflow of intangible assets over this period, but in fact we lose out.  We lose out because it is a key factor in the increase in our gross national income and, therefore, the increase in our contribution to the European Union budget.</p><p>He outlines how the payments from the Exchequer account for Ireland's contributions increasing from slightly less than &euro;1.7 billion in 2014 to &euro;2 billion in 2015 and again in 2016, to &euro;2.3 billion in 2017 and &euro;2.65 billion in 2018.  There is a cost, in cent and euro, for the artificial inflation of our gross national income, GNI, and a significant reason is the increase in supposed intangible assets investment in Ireland.</p> <p> This returns us to the point made about the finance curse and the fact that the country is being run for elites who do not live here.  Policy has been captured by these elites and we go to such extreme lengths to shape policy for their interests that we offer them a tax haven and allow them to use this country to avoid paying large amounts of tax for years.  We then end up paying for it through an increase in our contribution to the European Union budget. </p> <p> For these reasons, the Government should agree to the proposal to have a report done on how much income we have foregone, the reasons the changes in the 2014 budget were made and the reason the Government, under pressure, agreed to reverse them.  Does the Minister now accept it was not a good idea to introduce the change and that, rather than benefitting the real economy, we incurred only losses through the increased payment to the EU?  Alternatively, does he maintain that the change was good for a certain period but is no longer a good idea?  We need to know the answer to these important questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300025#X00200"><p>I have made these points previously but it is clear the Minister is still hellbent on allowing hundreds of millions of euro in tax to go unpaid as a result of the onshoring of intellectual property.  Mr. Seamus Coffey's report, on which he did excellent work in flagging up this issue, was interesting and embarrassing for the Government.  What was more embarrassing, however, was Mr. Coffey's blog in which he asked why one would allow a 100% cap for intellectual property that had been already onshored.  This is not like our previous conversation about retrospective taxation because the capital allowances in question must be used year after year.  We are not arguing that capital allowances used prior to 2017 would have a different rate applied to them but that from this point onwards, a company would be able to use only 80% against its tax liability.  This does not deal with the issue.  That is not an issue of the core retrospection of taxation.</p>  <p>  Mr. Coffey made clear that &euro;850 million in revenue will be lost to the State as a result of a couple of words the Minister is willing to insert in this Bill, for whatever reason.  The Minister informs us the Government does not do tax policy for individual companies.  In this case, the policy is not designed for an individual company because a group of companies, albeit a small one, will benefit.  There is serious suspicion about the reasons this has been done.  I would like to know which companies, groups or representatives of groups the Department and Minister consulted on this amendment and section.  All this information should be placed in the public domain because transparency is needed.</p>  <p>  This tax measure will allow well known multinational companies such as Apple to pay very little tax on substantial sales they are recording in this State.  Let us examine precisely what is being done here.  Until 2015, Apple recorded all of its sales outside the Americas in Ireland.  It did this through a stateless company.  As a result, even though all the sales were being recorded through a company in Cork, which had no employees or management structure, it did not pay tax on these sales because the company was not tax resident here or anywhere else in the world.  This loophole was closed down in 2014.  We learned in the Paradise Papers that Apple subsequently changed its structures and Apple itself told the media two weeks ago that all of its sales outside of the Americas continue to go through an Irish company.  This time, however, the company is tax resident, which means Apple must pay taxes arising from these sales in Ireland.  This is what happens normally across the world.  Whether a company is producing widgets in a factory in Mayo or crisps in Gaobh Dobhair, it pays taxes in the country in which it is tax resident.  Why then have Apple's taxes not increased significantly?  The reason is that when the tax residency laws were changed in 2014, the Government set a timeframe for implementing the change and introduced the 100% cap.  As a result, the company in Cork which now owns the intellectual property of Apple, which bought it from the company that is offshored on the Isle of Man, now holds these capital assets that it can write off against its profits.  That is what is happening here.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Government will argue that the measure results in the deferment of tax and that once the capital allowances are paid, the companies in question will have to pay additional taxes.  There is no guarantee that when that time comes, these companies, given their current structure and form, will be resident here, will still have their current structures or will have profits that are taxable.  Some of the intellectual property, particularly that which is based on patent protections, may generate profits while such protection lasts but will evaporate when the patent protections expire. </p>  <p>  This is a core issue involving &euro;850 million of tax foregone.  As has been pointed out, the increase in intellectual property also impacts on gross national income and results in an increase of &euro;200 million in our annual payment to the European Union.  Despite this, the Government has decided not to tax this intellectual property because it was onshored heretofore.  This is the wrong policy.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Minister on this issue.  It is not a case of trying to screw Apple or the multinationals but an issue of achieving tax fairness.  I am not asking the Minister to change the rates that applied ten, seven or five years ago.  My argument is that if capital allowances are to be used against profits that are generated by a company in 2018, 2019 or 2020, a cap of 80% should apply.  What the Minister is building into the Bill is a 100% cap for profits that are generated in future, which is not acceptable. </p>  <p>  We have all seen the manoeuvres and tut-tutting Ministers engage in concerning tax schemes, such as the so-called single malt.  Earlier this week, we were told the Government was examining the single malt.  The scheme is not new as it has been on the radar for some time.  A report by Christian Aid brought the issue into the public domain in a very understandable way.  As I stated, however, the single malt was raised directly with the previous Minister for Finance by my colleague, Matt Carthy, MEP, a year and a half ago in the European Parliament.  It is Government policy and when the public finds out about it and anger spills over at some point, the Government tut-tuts and states it is focusing on the issue and will make a change in the next finance Bill.  It then introduces this type of scam - it cannot be described as a loophole if it is, like this one to apply a cap post-2018, deliberately inserted in the finance Bill.  </p>  <p>  This is not a minor issue.  Many of the provisions we have discussed cost significant amounts of money and can result in significant losses to the State.  The chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the person who the Government asked to carry out a report on corporation tax, is telling us the State will lose &euro;850 million per annum as a result of this measure and argues there is no reason the cap cannot be applied to intangible assets that have been onshore until now. </p></speech>

The Minister indicated previously that this is a timing issue and the amount of tax paid will be the same over the relevant period.  Mr. Coffey questions that view, although he does not definitively state it is wrong.</p><p>Given the pace of change in corporation tax globally and in how these companies structure their affairs, it is a valid question to ask.</p> <p> The Minister provided for a yield in the budget day book of &euro;150 million in 2018 from this measure.  I question the basis of that.  The capital allowances related to the intellectual property, IP, that was onshored prior to budget day can be used to shelter 100% of relevant income and one would have to question whether these companies will continue to transfer IP to Ireland, what impact it will have on such activity and whether there will be a yield of &euro;150 million from this measure in 2018.  The Minister needs to explain the basis of that.</p> <p> The impact of the removal of the 80% cap in budget 2015 was quite extraordinary.  The scale of the impact was mind-boggling.  In 2014, the capital allowances claimed on IP amounted to &euro;2.6 billion and the following year, in 2015, they amounted to almost &euro;29 billion.  We have the data in respect of the onshoring.  The Minister confirmed it in parliamentary questions that, "While data on the value of intangible assets onshored through this channel is more limited, the relocations in 2015 along with RandD related imports added approximately &euro;300 billion to Ireland's capital stock."  Corporation tax receipts increased quite substantially in 2015.  That has to be acknowledged as well.  They went up by &euro;2.3 billion, increasing by 50% more than the Government had envisaged.</p> <p> The changes in 2015, as a result of the removal of the cap, were staggering and we are still dealing with the fallout from that.  The Minister is reinstating the cap at 80% and he has made what he has confirmed is a policy decision that the change only applies to IP that is onshored after budget day.  In other words, the capital allowances relating to the IP that was already here on budget night can continue to be used to shelter 100% of the relevant income.  The Minister needs to explain in detail the basis of that policy decision.  We learned on Committee Stage that it is not a recommendation from the Department of Finance officials.  It is very much a policy decision.</p> <p> The Minister needs to explain the implications of not putting in the effective date of budget night.  He needs to explain what would be the implications if he was to say that the future claims of capital allowances against all IP now here would be subject to the 80% restriction in terms of the relevant income that can be sheltered by it.  Presumably, those implications, which the Minister has assessed and has thought through, are the reasons he has decided not to apply it in that manner.</p> <p> Given the scale of what happened in 2015 and given that this is an important policy decision, the Minister needs to explain what level of consultation there has been and with whom, for instance, individual companies and representative bodies.  All of that needs to be in the public domain and on the public record in order that we can have the fullest possible information as to what has guided and informed what the Minister stated is a policy decision, not a recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300026#Y00200"><p>The decision that was made by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, at that point on the management of capital allowances and the rate at which their depreciation could be discounted in the tax code was the right decision then on the basis of what we understood about the magnitude of those assets then, on the basis of how we treated at that point other assets in the tax code, and on the basis of how intangible assets were taxed in other countries against which we would benchmark ourselves and against which we need to be competitive for investment, for the registration of assets and for the maintenance of jobs.  The decision that I am making to go back to the 80% is the right one now.  I have made a policy choice.  I made that policy choice in consultation with my officials because, of course, the Department of Finance outlines choices to me and gives views on this matter.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say, as it was acknowledged by a number of speakers, that the Seamus Coffey report laid out a broad policy direction on this, but it is up to me regarding the timing and how it is implemented, and as Minister for Finance I have made that policy choice.  I have made that policy choice for two reasons.  First, I looked at the value of intellectual property assets as we understand them now, the way in which they move across the world and the impact that they have on payments that the Exchequer needs to make, and I decided that now it is right to tax them in the way I have described in the Finance Bill, and that is what I have done.</p>  <p>  On the reason for the timing and how I have done that, I believe there is an opportunity for Ireland across the coming years to get to a point where we have employment, research, manufacturing and the registration of intellectual property assets related to all of those activities all located in our country.  Getting to a place where we have both commercial activity and employment and registration of assets related to that work - all, or most of it - located in Ireland for a company, it is my judgment that, over the years ahead with all of the change that could develop around our country, this could offer a new form of competitive advantage to Ireland.  That is why I have made the choice on the timing of this.</p>  <p>  It was acknowledged, in fairness, by those who are criticising what I have done, that this affects the timing as to when the tax will come in rather than the magnitude of the tax itself.  The expectation is that, if those companies stay present in Ireland and if the assets remain located in Ireland, at a point in the future we will gain those tax payments, and this decision is about affecting the timing of when we will be able to receive that tax revenue.  I made that choice, as I explained a moment ago, because I believe bringing in this tax change in the way I have done will best serve and allow us to meet an opportunity that is there for Ireland to tax these assets better and combine the location of these assets with other forms of economic activity in our country.  I was not under pressure to make this move.  It was something that formed a core recommendation of the Coffey report and I made that recommendation myself.</p>  <p>  I already answered questions on Committee Stage about who I met about this, but I will answer again.  I met the American Chamber of Commerce.  In my meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce, this matter did not come up.  However, I had many meetings with my officials on this and other policy choices that were presented to me, and in those meetings the officials outlined different options that were open to me, and I made this choice.</p>  <p>  Returning to a question that was asked about what happened in 2014 when the treatment of it was changed, it is important to put on the record of the House that the reason this was done, and it has also led to reasons I have now decided to make this change, was to change the tax treatment of these assets, to bring it into line with how some of these assets were taxed elsewhere, and to bring the treatment of those assets into line with how we taxed comparable assets in the tax code then.  That is the reason it was done.  It is important to acknowledge that in the subsequent period, other changes have taken place across the world, primarily driven by the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process that is under way, that have changed how those assets are taxed elsewhere.</p><p>It meant that companies which have incredibly valuable designs or brands looked for new places in which to locate.  They are the policy reasons behind that change.  I have made this change now because I believe this is the fairest and most effective way for us to tax very valuable assets such as these.</p></speech>

That is what happens.  The company gives these assets precisely the value that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax.  That is the way it works and Seamus Coffey says it very clearly.  The increase in capital allowances almost exactly offsets the increase in intangible asset-related profits such that the onshoring of these assets resulted in little or no additional corporation tax being collected in 2015.  That is the way it has always worked, including with the double Irish.  He also pointed out that the Minister's decision to not apply the new reduced cap on the allowance for intangible assets was unprecedented in terms of the treatment of such assets because whenever changes were made previously, they applied to all claims.  He points out that the specific regime for capital allowances for intangible assets was introduced in 2009.  Amendments were introduced in the Finance Acts from 2010 to 2014.  He goes through a number of the changes and points out that all previous changes to the regime applied to all claims for capital allowances related to expenditure on intangible assets and were applied to all claims for capital allowances under the regime.  The most recent change is the first occasion on which a change was introduced to the regime that only applies to new claims.  Who does that suit?  It suits Apple and a few other companies.  In fact, the full extent of the lost tax revenue is apparent in the Revenue tables on tax expenditures which jump by about &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion between 2014 and 2015.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance now says that it was purely based on the information that we had at the time, the situation in terms of the tax regimes of competing countries and so forth.  He is saying that it had nothing to do with the fact that this was when the pressure was mounting and the Government was forced to end, or at least wind down, the double Irish regime.  He is claiming that it is purely a coincidence that the Government announced the ending, or winding down over an extended period, of the Double Irish at the same time as opening up that tax loophole.  It seems to me to be quite an extraordinary coincidence that one tax avoidance opportunity would be closed and another one would open up, without any relationship.  Of course, the same budget marked the beginning of the so-called knowledge development box.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister saying that if he had the information that was available to the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, he would make the same decision?  If the Minister had the information that he has now about the situation that pertained then, would he also have made the same decision?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister have any estimate of the amount of revenue lost by the change implemented in budget 2015 and the cost to the Exchequer in terms of the increase in payments to the EU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300027#Z00400"><p>The Minister may have misheard me earlier.  I was not acknowledging that this was an issue of tax deferred or an issue of timing.  What I was saying was that this was what the Minister would claim.  I went on to point out that it may not be the case because the companies may not be here in ten years' time when all of the capital allowances are used.  Allowances for intangible assets, which have patent protection would have lost value and so on and the structures could have changed.  Had we taken that approach with Nokia, for example, as has been pointed out by the author of the report, we would have been caught well short.  Companies change, move, change their structures and so forth.  We know that Apple did it in 2015, so it is not just a case of money that will come to us at a future point in time.</p>  <p>  The Minister says that this was the right decision at the time but it was not.  He said that it was the right decision at the time with the knowledge that was available.  What was that knowledge?  What we know now is that the Minister's predecessor, his Fine Gael colleague, was lobbied through the Department by multinational companies, a multinational tax planner and by the representative body for US multinationals and lo and behold, who benefits from this?  Who benefits, not to the tune of a couple of bob here or there, a couple of thousand, million or even billion euro?  We are talking about massive amounts of money and it was the American multinationals who benefitted from the decision.  They lobbied for this.  They asked the Government to do this.  They asked the Government to increase the cap.  A multinational tax planner argued in a submission to the Department that the multinationals needed certainty about the onshoring of intellectual property, IP, because the Government was changing the tax residency rules.  If there is one reason to vote against this Finance Bill, it is this.  This amounts to &euro;850 million next year, the year after and the year after that.  It is &euro;850 million that the Minister is deciding not to collect now because he wants all of the IP that was onshored to be able to be used against future profits these companies may generate in order that they can write down their tax liability to close to zero.  </p></speech>

However, in setting out options, he said that the Department would also convey views.  Has the Department given a view or a recommendation on this specific issue?  It is important that the Minister would answer that question.  How long will it be before the capital allowances in respect of the IP onshored prior to budget day will have been exhausted?  That is a particular number of years.  How long before that will be exhausted?  The Minister did not answer the question about the yield from this.  What is the basis of the estimate that this will bring in an additional &euro;150 million in 2018?</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to deal with the issue of the risk that this is not a timing issue and that there is a loss to the Exchequer as a result of this over time.  This goes back to the points that Seamus Coffey made when he outlined three key risks in that regard.  First, it requires the profits to be present in the future in order for the tax to be collected.  Second, some of the intangible assets will, by their very nature, be time limited.  Third, there is a risk of the asset leaving the country when the capital allowances have been exhausted.  Capital allowances will be exhausted at some point in time so the argument that it is a timing issue is dependent on there still being taxable income in respect of those companies after the capital allowances in respect of the IP onshored up to budget day have been exhausted.  That really is the nub of the issue.</p></speech>

The pros and cons of different options were outlined and it was left to me to make the choice and that is what I have done.  That is what I am stating in the D&aacute;il here this afternoon.</p>  <p>  Several questions were put to me that I have not answered to date.  Deputy McGrath just asked how long we believe it will take before existing allowances are fully exhausted or used.  That depends on how the lifetime of the asset is currently being accounted for by companies.</p><p>We believe that, across a five-year to ten-year period, we will see all of the relevant allowances for these kinds of assets fully drawn down.</p> <p> In regard to the Deputy's question about the risks that are outlined by Mr. Coffey, I acknowledge those risks are there but I believe they are outweighed by Ireland getting to a point where we can have the co-location of IP assets and economic activity about further investment and jobs located here.  I believe that is a long-term, valuable opportunity for Ireland in a quickly changing world.</p> <p> In regard to the question on yield, I estimate the costing is &euro;5 million for every &euro;150 million that is located here in Ireland.  To look at the quantity of movement in Ireland in 2016 and on the available figures for 2017, I believe that &euro;150 million figure will be achievable.  On the question on the cost of EU contributions, the figure is approximately &euro;200 million.</p></speech>

This, in my opinion, is an even bigger scandal and, at the very least, it needs to be investigated.  It is inexplicable that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 2014 changed the tax code around intangible assets to essentially neutralise the impact of closing down the double Irish tax scam.  One tax scam closed down and another one opened, directly as a result of a decision made by Deputy Noonan and the Government which has not been explained.  To get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets is extraordinary, in and of itself, but to get 100%, and for the former Minister to make that decision in 2014, is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  For the current Minister, similarly, having recognised that this needs to be changed, to then make a decision not to ensure that we collect an extra &euro;800 million a year, and to essentially exempt the claims from before budget day, is extraordinary and, again, the only beneficiary can be Apple and that small group of corporations.  They designed this and the Minister has danced to their tune.  Hundreds of millions are being lost which people desperately need in this country for housing and health.  That is what this exposes.  At the very least, we want a thorough investigation so all of the facts can be laid out before the people and they can judge what was lost, why decisions were made and whether it is, as I believe, one of the biggest scandals, if not the biggest scandal, it is possible to imagine in this country in terms of people having tax revenues stolen from them.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the tax paid in 2016 by companies that act as loan originators in the State and avail of section 110 status.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>The amendment deals with the issue of the section 110 regime that was introduced.  A carve-out was built in regarding non-bank lenders that were involved in loan origination business, meaning that non-bank lenders with hundreds of millions lent to Irish businesses and with profits in the millions could continue to pay as little tax as &euro;250 per annum.  BlueBay Ireland is one of the beneficiaries of this treatment.  It has lent out more than &euro;160 million across the State.  BlueBay has issued debt to, among many others, the fast food restaurant company Abrakebabra and the Mater Private Hospital.  I assume, on looking at its lending rates, the blended average of the loan book is in the region of 6%.  This would mean profits in the millions in 2016.  Looking at its accounts, which can be seen by anyone who wants to look at them, we see the total sum it paid in tax on those millions in profits was &euro;250.  Irish banks will not pay tax for 20 years because of the losses they have carried forward, but these non-bank lenders are not paying tax either.  There are other sweetheart deals in respect of some multinationals that we discussed on previous amendments but this was supposed to be dealt with when we dealt with the section 110s in last year's Finance Bill.  This whole section, in the context of section 110, is dodgy, and the evidence suggests it needs further tidying up, to say the least.  It is incredible that a foreign bank can set up a section 110 company, and we have examples of this.  That company then lends into this State hundreds of millions of euro and makes profits on that lending and, because it is in this type of vehicle, no tax is payable.  BlueBay is not unique in this regard.  There are other such companies that pay as little as &euro;250 in tax.  I imagine the Minister will take to his feet and, without naming the company, present words to the House that will somehow justify that a company recording millions of euro in profit pays &euro;250 in tax, yet he says this State is not facilitating State-sponsored tax avoidance.  That is exactly what this is.</p></speech>

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax-neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.</p>  <p>  Loan originations involve a section 110 company fronting for a foreign bank and either lending directly to larger, more sophisticated borrowers or immediately issuing newly made loans to smaller borrowers from foreign banks.  Provided the foreign bank is established in one of the countries with which we have signed a double tax agreement, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.  As the original creditor, there can be no taxable capital gain on any subsequent sale of the loans.  If the loan origination company is a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it can operate in a tax-neutral manner in Ireland using a section 110 company.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that in the Finance Act 2016, the reporting requirements for section 110 companies were enhanced.  As a result, the Revenue Commissioners will have access to more information and at an earlier time regarding these companies.  However, getting complete data from the Revenue Commissioners may take longer than the timeframe suggested by the Deputy.  Given this constraint, it would not be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested report into legislation.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Finance Act 2016 changes, the desire was to address issues relating to property and property-based loans.  I acknowledge, however, that issues outside property are more complex and I want to ensure that section 110 operates in a proper manner.  If concerns are raised regarding the operation of section 110 in the loan origination space, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners and my officials to investigate these concerns.  Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, officials from the Department of Finance will continue to work with the Revenue Commissioners to analyse the use of the section 110 regime to minimise tax avoidance opportunities.</p>  <p>  I cannot therefore accept the proposed amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300030#FF00300"><p>I note the Minister said he will ask the Revenue Commissioners to investigate any concerns regarding section 110s.  The problem is that BlueBay, for example, is owned by the Royal Bank of Canada.  Obviously, there is a different currency here; this section 110 company was set up in Ireland and money filtered through the Royal Bank of Canada into the section 110 company.  A total of &euro;160 million of it went into the Mater Private, Abrakebabra and others and a 6% interest rate was recorded on that, which gave the company taxable profits in their millions on which it paid &euro;250 in tax.  That is what is happening with BlueBay or, really, with Royal Bank of Canada.  The Minister would argue for this in terms of double tax treaties but if the Royal Bank of Canada wanted to lend here, it would face serious barriers regarding currency and other issues.  The problem is that this is completely legal because when we dealt with section 110 companies - and I quizzed the Minister's predecessor on this at the time - loan originators were carved out from it.  We made an exception for loan originator companies.  I question whether there are issues of state aid if a foreign bank can come in, lend on, structure it within a section 110 company in Ireland and not pay any tax in respect of the profits it records from its lending activity.  I have serious concerns about this.  While I heard what the Minister said about the timing of this issue, I believe a report within six months is possible.  There may need to be a further assessment afterwards but the Minister needs to start the ball rolling in this regard.  I have been raising this since the Government carried out this carve-out two years ago and I am not satisfied with the response the Minister has given.  I note he will ask the Revenue Commissioners to investigate these matters, which I welcome, but he needs to go further.</p></speech>

If the activity to which the Deputy refers is due to the operation of a double taxation agreement, and if a company is not paying tax in one jurisdiction, it will pay tax on that economic activity in the other jurisdiction.</p><p>In regard to what I said earlier, not only have I asked the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the matter, I have also asked my officials apprise me of the matter because, as I said on Committee Stage, I acknowledge that issues outside the management of property are more complicated.  I want to ensure that section 110, as it is structured, operates in a proper manner and does not maximise tax avoidance opportunities.</p></speech>

I presume we will return to this issue again and again.  There are serious issues.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this and the Minister has mentioned again that where there are double taxation treaties, there would be no tax liability.  I seriously question that.  Does that mean that the Royal Bank of Scotland operated here on a tax-free basis?  Does that mean any foreign bank can lend into the State tax-free?  I doubt that is the case.  However, when a company sets up a non-bank lender which uses section 110 of our tax code, it then becomes tax-free.</p>  <p>  There are serious lending impediments to lending for firms not located in this jurisdiction, including transfer issues, currency costs, having personnel in the country and so on.  I want a report.  The Minister has given no commitment to come back with any type of assessment.  He gave a commitment to ask the Revenue and his officials to apprise him of the issue and determine whether there are any problems, but there is nothing in terms of transparency.</p>  <p>  The Minister has not committed to bringing forward any type of report.  He is not committed to providing any information to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach or the Committee on Budgetary Oversight or parliamentarians in the House which would better inform us of this issue, if so required, or reassure us that there are no issues.  My amendment is an attempt to deal with the fact that there are non-bank lenders in the State which are branches of international banks making millions in profit by using a section unique to our tax code, that is, section 110, and paying only &euro;250 in tax.</p></speech>
