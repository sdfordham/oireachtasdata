This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  This independent review panel has been examining 311 cases referred to it and is now nearing completion of its work.  This is a significant number of cases, and somewhat higher than originally estimated, but I thought it was important to refer all of the allegations and cases that have been made to me as Minister, or to the Taoiseach or other representatives in the House, whether they came directly from complainants or through representative groups such as Justice4All, with, I would highlight, only the most minimal filtering out of cases which did not actually relate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This means that counsel are examining a very wide range of cases, some of which deal directly with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but others of which extend to other aspects of the criminal justice system beyond my remit, such as the prosecution and trial of offences.  It is also worth noting that the cases contain a very wide variety of allegations in terms of seriousness.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review, that will occur.  However, I would also make the point again that, in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken.  This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process, such as a full investigation by GSOC or a court hearing, even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p>  <p>  The panel has made significant progress at this point and the submission of recommendations to me is being prepared by officials in the Department.  Every recommendation will be very carefully considered but, as a matter of general principle, let me say clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice that is being given to me.  Quite clearly, as we have engaged counsel for this review, it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice.  There will be no undue delay in the process of notifying complainants of the outcome of the review, a process that I expect will start shortly.</p>  <p>  Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be guided by that.  There are a number of possible options - for example, referral to GSOC - but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of the Guerin commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500003#A00600"><p>At an opportunity like this, we have to take stock of where we are with regard to a number of commissions.  The House was told the Fennelly commission would report before Christmas, and that has not happened.  The commission concerning Ronan McLoughlin was established last July, as the Minister is aware, given that we discussed it at the justice committee and here in the House.  It has not got off the ground yet, and concern has been raised about that.  We now have the commission following the Guerin report, which seems to be restricted to Garda practices in the Cavan-Monaghan district.</p>  <p>  There is concern out there that the families whose cases are subject to the independent review have not been kept informed as to the progression and the likely outcomes.  Concern has been expressed to me and other public representatives about why the terms of reference of the commission following Guerin do not provide for any cases which fall out of the independent review and which merit further independent scrutiny.  We already have three commissions of inquiry either established or in the process of being established, and there are questions over their functioning and whether they are doing the job they are supposed to be doing.  For example, I am being lobbied by people connected to the Cynthia Owen case, the Shane O'Farrell case and the Sarah Bland case.  They want independent commissions of investigation into their circumstances.  The commission which was established post-Guerin should provide for cases which fall out of the independent review mechanism rather than leaving people in limbo or thinking there will not be any follow-up after the independent review by the barristers.  Will the Minister consider amending the terms of reference which were published prior to Christmas to include cases that flow from the independent review mechanism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500003#A00700"><p>As I said, the number of cases I referred to the independent review is quite large, and there is a wide variety of cases.  I did originally say that the investigation would, I hoped, take a number of months, but in fact it is taking longer.  One of the reasons it is taking longer, of course, is the complexity of some of the cases, the working through of the material and the amount of written material that has been supplied by individual complainants.</p>  <p>  As I said, the counsel are working their way through the various cases and making recommendations.  I will have a summary of those recommendations in the near future.  It would have been anticipating the outcome of those cases if I had included them in the Guerin commission.</p><p>The legal advice when I was establishing the Guerin commission was that I would be unable to do that in advance of the outcome of the recommendations, because we would not quite know what was being referred if we did not have the outcome of the independent review of those cases.  In that context, I was unable to include them in the terms of reference of the Guerin commission when I published it and I did not want to delay that further.  However, as I have said, if a commission is recommended as a way forward for any of the cases referred to and being examined by the review commission, that is certainly a possibility.</p></speech>

I appreciate that some 311 cases are being reviewed.  In terms of the possible outcome of these reviews, the Minister has indicated that if a commission of investigation is warranted, she will pursue that.  I welcome that, as will the people involved in the 311 cases.  Has the Minister considered what might follow on this in terms of redress?  Has she or the Department considered that issue?</p></speech>

This is due to the response of the Government to legitimate public concerns and concerns of Members.  The Deputy has picked out three particular cases.  However, it would not be right for me to pick out particular cases.  In each case, the same approach is being taken, but I cannot anticipate any outcome.  It is a serious matter to refer a case to a commission or to establish a commission.  I cannot anticipate whether any case or how many cases will be referred as suitable for a commission of investigation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has mentioned three cases and obviously I am familiar with cases where people have serious concerns.  For cases like this, it is unprecedented for a Government to set up an independent legal assessment.  I will be guided by the outcome of that assessment and will examine the outcome for each of the cases.  I will also consider whether any theme emerges from that work that might recommend other actions I may need to take as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

There are growing concerns among the families who have submitted their allegations about this process to either the Minister or the Taoiseach.  For example, in the context of the Guerin report, the delay in announcing the commission recommended by Se&aacute;n Guerin was attributed to the fact that the Minister is awaiting the recommendations.  This issue has dragged on and many of the families involved are e-mailing Oireachtas Members saying they want their case included in the terms and conditions of the commission of investigation recommended by Guerin.  I am concerned at the way this is developing and I want serious assurances from the Minister on the matter today.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500004#B00700"><p>The Deputy has spoken about the length of time involved.  In regard to the cases that have been referred to the review mechanism, many of them have been on people's desks and in various places in the system over the past decade and some cases go back much further.  Many of these cases have been through a variety of processes, including independent investigations or the courts, while no action has been taken on some, other than that a person has made a complaint expressing a concern about how he or she was dealt with either in the criminal justice system or by garda&iacute;.  It is clear there is a wide variety of cases.  These cases have been in the system for some time, some of them for ten years or longer.  It is important, therefore, that we take the time to examine them in detail, that we give the counsel the time to do that and to review all of the paperwork that has come in, and then make a decision.  I have allowed the time for this.</p>  <p>  In regard to the delay in implementing the Guerin commission recommendations, before we saw the scale of the number of cases referred to the review mechanism, I hoped initially that the Guerin commission would be able to encompass them.  However, due to the number of cases referred, it soon became clear that in the context of the terms of reference of the Guerin commission, we would not be able to make a decision about what precisely should be referred.  Therefore, it would have been inappropriate to include these cases at that time.  I was keen also to move ahead with the Guerin commission.  The Government took a decision that we would follow precisely what Se&aacute;n Guerin had recommended in his report for the commission.  Most Deputies appreciate that Mr. Guerin made a series of recommendations.  We followed those recommendations precisely and left nothing out.  The approach we took was to make a comprehensive examination of what was recommended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500004#B00800"><p>When I first heard about the independent panel, I welcomed it because of the unprecedented number of cases.  Not all of these cases will be valid, but some will and I believe some are strong cases and are definitely eligible for an independent commission of investigation.  However, the difficulty is that these cases have all been lumped together and I understand that until they have all been reviewed, we will not have an assessment.  Can interim recommendations be made along the way?  For example, can the counsel say, for example, that they have looked at 20 cases and make recommendations in regard to those cases, rather than make people wait for a long time until all the cases have been reviewed, thereby increasing people's anxiety?</p>  <p>  Also, currently the panel is looking through the documentary evidence provided to it.  Some families have the capacity to explain the case in great detail, but others may not have that capacity.  A face-to-face interview to clarify some of the matters raised might be helpful.  Will the Minister permit the independent counsel to meet some of the complainants face to face to clarify any matters of which they are unsure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500004#B00900"><p>The decision was taken that there would be a review of all of the written material, and that decision stands.  Many of these families have lived with their concerns over a long period.  It is important we take adequate time to examine the complaints and that we give the counsel the time to come to a decision on what recommendation they should make.  It would be counterproductive to start dealing with the cases in the manner the Deputy suggests.  I want to deal with them comprehensively because I want to see the trends and themes that emerge as well as the recommendations for each case.</p>  <p>  The counsel want to progress and finish the work and I am confident that will be completed in the near future.  This issue will not drag on for many more months.  I am confident that at that point I will be able to respond to the complainants individually.  In the normal course of events, many people have concerns about how they have been dealt with by a justice system, and approximately 5% of complaints internationally are held up when complaints are made against a body such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be many cases on which no further action will be taken, but obviously there will be cases where further action is recommended by counsel.  I will have the overview of that in the near future and will publish as much information as I can when I get to that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500004#B01000"><p>The Minister is saying that she does not believe this review will take much longer than another few months.  My understanding is that she continues to refer allegations to this panel which means that if she is ready to publish in two months time, a new case may be referred to it all of a sudden.  I would like an assurance from her that by March or some time in the next couple of months this will be ready so that families can be assured they will have a decision.</p>  <p>  My question concerns Garda malpractice, but some of the concerns relate to the wider criminal justice system.  The independent panel may decide there are issues regarding Garda malpractice, but this issue may need a wider commission of investigation.  Take for example the Shane O'Farrell case in Monaghan where the concerns of the family are wider than that of Garda malpractice.  I believe that case will require a commission of investigation when the time comes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500004#B01100"><p>It is precisely that question the counsel are addressing.  They are examining whether there are cases that will require further action, such as a commission.  It is a serious matter to refer an individual case or to set up a commission of inquiry.  Therefore, we must be sure this is the best way forward for those families for whom this is recommended.</p><p>I think the Deputy will agree that it is a very serious action to take, so we want to be absolutely sure that if there are cases in which a commission is recommended, significant thought has been given to that.  I have said to the panel that this is an option for its consideration if it believes a commission of inquiry would be valuable and would help the families, and if there are issues of such concern that they warrant a commission of investigation.  Again, I make the point that in respect of the cases that have been referred to - and the Deputy knows this because some of them have been on his desk - there is a very wide variety of complaints about the criminal justice system.  When I have the complete overview, I will be in a position to say which ones relate to people's experiences in court, decisions of the DPP, GSOC and how complaints have been handled.  It will then become clear whether further action can be taken, and I will be guided by what the council has to say about that.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said in the House that any tapping or interception of these communications would likely have occurred within the jurisdiction of the UK and would presumably be covered by EU law.  There is no EU law to cover mass surveillance.  Will the Minister answer the three questions I have asked on the issue?</p></reply>

The media reports also suggest that this may have been linked to surveillance being carried out within the UK's own jurisdiction.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, has already been in contact with the British Embassy on this issue.  It has been conveyed that it is generally understood that friendly relationships between states include acceptance of the principle that the privacy of communications must be respected.  I agree with the Deputy that protection of data and the privacy of communication are not matters that should be taken lightly, and it is right that communications are safeguarded and protected against unlawful intrusion and interception.</p>  <p>  The lawful interception of communications is sometimes a necessary tool for law enforcement authorities in order to protect citizens against terrorism and other serious criminal threats, as I am sure the Deputy will agree.  The majority of citizens would accept that there should be a balance between personal privacy and public safety once the mechanisms by which such data is accessed are both legal and proportionate.  There is no question of mass surveillance.  If we needed reminding of the threat posed by international terrorism then we need only look to the horrific events in Paris last week.  Criminals and terrorists have not been slow to take advantage of the various technological advances in communications in recent years.  It is essential that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the necessary resources to address this dimension of the threat.</p>  <p>  The interception of an individual's communications in this State can only occur in the very specific circumstances laid down in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  This Act permits me to authorise an interception but only for the purposes of criminal investigation into serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State.  The operation of the Act is overseen by a designated judge of the High Court who reports annually to the Taoiseach on his or her examination of its operation.  In addition, a complaints referee, who is normally a serving judge of the Circuit Court, is appointed to receive and investigate complaints from persons who believe that their communications have been unlawfully intercepted.  It should be clear from the above that there is no question of me as Minister having authorised or having the authority to authorise the kind of activity alluded to in the Deputy's question.  As far as the UK is concerned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has taken up that issue with the British authorities.</p></speech>

If GCHQ is allowed to work in this area without getting approval from Ireland, it is very worrying.  It would be interesting to see what the British might have to say about it, but that information should be relayed to the public.  There is huge public concern about the fact that many communications seem to be under surveillance.  The legislation signed by the Minister for Justice and Equality on 26 November 2014 has caused much worry for people in Ireland.  Digital Rights Ireland won a case in Europe last year against the existing legislation.  The case showed that the storage of much of this information on people was illegal and in breach of their privacy rights.</p></speech>

The UK legislation is for the UK to decide.  I have made it very clear that we have a very serious approach to any interception of telecommunications in this country.  We have very clear laws about it.  It is only used where there is a question of criminal activity or where the security of the State is considered to be at risk.  There is a very serious approach to it overseen by a High Court judge and a Circuit Court judge.</p>  <p>  Most citizens would agree that there needs to be a balance between the privacy rights of individuals and the protection of the interests and security of the State and dealing with criminal activity.  They would understand that some action would have to be taken on very specific occasions and with a very specific approach under regulation to deal with that and to allow for that interception.  I am aware of the ECJ case and we will examine the outcome of it.  Even in that case, the ECJ made it very clear that in terms of criminal activity, the interception of communications was a legitimate action for a State to take.</p></speech>

J. McIntyre, who is a lecturer in UCD.  He says: "It's worrying because it means telecommunications companies might be pressured into doing things that aren't entirely legal."  He said that the companies would be prosecuted in secret and would be unable to disclose their objections publicly or even the fact that they were being prosecuted.  He said he was very reluctant to allow that it was a good idea for the Minister to have the power to force companies to comply with secret orders.</p>  <p>  The Minister is saying that the people are concerned about terrorist activities.  Yes, they are concerned, but the balance appears to be going very much the other way.  The principle of State security is being abused in order to impinge on the rights of ordinary people.  Mass surveillance is becoming more common, there is far more interruption of communications and the private citizen is very concerned about it.  We are heading down the wrong path on this.</p></speech>

For a start, I absolutely believe that most right-thinking citizens would welcome the State's taking action to protect its citizens.  Certainly, that is very much on people's minds following the Paris attacks in particular.  My belief is that citizens want to be protected.</p>  <p>  I have already told the Deputy that there is no question of mass surveillance.  Neither do I accept the premise that companies involved in the communications industry will break the law.  They will follow the law that is there.</p></speech>

Its report was published on 13 November.</p>  <p>  The report outlined the views expressed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that centre-fire handguns are primarily designed to kill human beings.  Accordingly, they pose an unacceptable risk to society and should no longer be licensed in this jurisdiction.  There are similar concerns about non-Olympic type .22 calibre handguns, centre-fire semi-automatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than three rounds.  Many of these type of firearms have been used either in murders, attempted murders or gangland shootings in this jurisdiction, as well as in mass shootings in other jurisdictions.  On this basis, the working group recommended the prohibition of these firearms.</p>  <p>  These make up a very small proportion of all licensed firearms, however.  It is important to note a wide range of firearms, making up at least 94% of all currently licensed firearms, will not be affected by the proposed change.  Again, I must emphasise this is a report and no decision has been taken on its recommendations yet.  The firearms not affected include shotguns holding not more than three rounds, hunting style rifles, Olympic standard handguns etc.  This point will be of particular reassurance to many of those in agriculture and rural communities, as well as hunting and sporting interests.</p>  <p>  The report also referred to difficulties in the interpretation of the legislation expressed by members of the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  With respect to the report's recommendations on proposed changes and restrictions, I have not reached any final conclusions.  I repeat my commitment I will not make any final decisions until I have had the opportunity to consider all the submissions made and met the key stakeholders, including the organisations that represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes.</p>  <p>  The Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality sought submissions on the report and will hold hearings on this.  The deadline for receipt of submissions by my Department is 31 January 2015.  I extended this when I was contacted by the stakeholders who expressed concerns about the report's recommendations.  No decision has yet been made and a consultation process is under way.</p></reply>

We also believe the stakeholders who legally use these firearms need to be consulted properly, however.  I welcome that the Minister stated this would happen in her reply.  The review must distinguish between those who hold firearms legally and those who engage in criminality.  That is an issue which the representative associations have raised.</p>  <p>  We heard from the Garda Inspectorate yesterday on the PULSE system.  The representative associations dispute the statistical information, or the lack of it, underlying the basis on which the recommendations flow.  In a reply to several parliamentary questions, the Minister stated to me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advises it is not possible to identify accurately from a central database such as PULSE the number of occasions an unlicensed or licensed firearm was used in the committing of a crime.  The reply also stated-----</p></speech>

I have no doubt the justice committee, of which Deputy Niall Collins is a member and Deputy David Stanton is the Chairman, will do excellent work in getting to the bottom of these statistics and examining them in detail.</p>  <p>  While it is a different issue, I have set up a working group to look at technology and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government has committed to upgrading the PULSE technology and I accept what the Garda Inspectorate said about it yesterday.  The working group has already had several meetings to deal with the technological needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which were clearly identified in the Garda Inspectorate report.</p>  <p>  Up to 1,363 firearms applications were refused by the District Courts between 2009 and 2014.  The court hears the evidence upon which it makes a decision.  The Deputy will have heard the figures of the number of cases where a refusal has been overturned by the courts.

I do not know who came up with that notion.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister satisfied the information underpinning the report is accurate and correct, given the reply I received from the Minister this morning on foot of a written parliamentary question?

A process has been set up and we have a report which will be examined by the justice committee.  The Deputy will have the opportunity to make those points at the committee.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s support for the review.  One of my predecessors in office, Dermot Ahern, stated in 2009 during the debate when the licensing system was last amended that he was determined to ensure a gun culture would not be allowed to form in this State.  He also said he would, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, keep the situation on firearms licensing under review in the interests of public safety.  Obviously, I want the best outcome possible in the interests of public safety but also very much in the interests of those representative groups for shooting clubs and shooting sportsmen.</p>  <p>  As I stated, 94% of licensed firearms are not included in the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  We are looking at the other 6% about which there are different views.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made presentations to the committee on this.  The statistics the Garda used can be questioned, if the Deputy has concerns about the quality of research in the report.  No decision has been taken yet.

I laid before the House a draft of the order, which includes the terms of reference, proposing the establishment of the commission.  I also laid before the House a statement of the reasons for establishing the commission.  All of the matters recommended by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC for inclusion in a commission of investigation are included in the terms of reference.  The draft order specifies me, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, as the Minister responsible for overseeing the administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission.<br/><br/>It is important to note that a resolution approving the draft order must be passed by each House.  As such, the terms of reference will shortly come before the House for discussion and approval, possibly as early as next week.  This will provide Deputies with an opportunity to discuss the terms of reference and work of the Guerin commission.<br/><br/>An estimate of the costs, including legal costs, to be incurred by the commission in conducting the investigation and preparing its reports, and the timeframe for the submission of the commission's final report, will be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, as per normal procedure, as soon as possible after the terms of reference are set in accordance with the legislation.  This will occur when the resolution has been passed by both Houses.<br/><br/>Deputy Wallace refers to the independent review by a panel of counsel of a wide range of cases, some of which deal directly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while others extend to other aspects of the criminal justice system.  As I have previously outlined the position in this regard, I do not propose to discuss the matter in detail at this point.  As I indicated, there are a number of possible options for further investigation which I will consider when I have received recommendations on all of the relevant cases.<br/><br/>The Guerin commission examined a particular set of circumstances.  When I decided to establish a commission of investigation I also took the initiative to refer the Guerin report to the Garda Inspectorate.  The inspectorate's recent report included a chapter on the Guerin report which addressed many of the issues raised by Mr. Guerin.  The inspectorate's report is to be implemented by me and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will not be the subject of a further commission.</p></speech>

She denied, for example, that crime figures were being massaged, which is completely at variance with the conclusions of the inspectorate's report.</p>  <p>  I raised a point regarding the parochial nature of the terms of reference of the Guerin review.  The Minister is correct that Mr. Guerin's investigation was confined to the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Little progress has been made since the introduction by the then Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in response to a case in County Donegal.  The 2005 legislation was clearly not the answer to all of our problems.  We know from what has occurred in recent years that serious problems persist in the Garda.  We are receiving information from three new Garda whistleblowers and it is frightening to note what continues to take place.  The things going on in the midlands, Cork and Limerick are every bit as bad, if not worse, than what went on in Cavan-Monaghan.  The Minister has an opportunity to carry out a complete root and branch of the Garda and how it operates.  A failure to introduce root and branch reform will result in sticking plasters being used to tackle serious problems.</p></speech>

It is important to act now to bring about change and the Government has taken action to address the issues the Deputy outlined.  A commission of investigation was established on foot of the Guerin report and will be led by Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins.  We have also established the Fennelly commission, which is examining aspects of the behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   These commissions will provide further information.  It is very important that we also get on with introducing change and reform.  We have established an independent police authority and appointed a Garda Commissioner through a new and independent process.  We are amending the legislation governing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to give it greater powers to initiate investigations.  I hope Second Stage of that Bill will conclude next week.  The new Garda Commissioner is committed to change in the force.</p>  <p>  The concerns have been well analysed, including in the Garda Inspectorate's report.  The Deputy is correct that serious issues arise and the inspectorate's report is clear on that matter.  A series of actions are being taken to address these issues.  This process cannot be completed overnight but many processes are in place that are making a difference in respect of the points the Deputy outlined.</p></speech>

To cite one example, on the watch of the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, an assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Donal &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, is examining certain serious allegations made by serving Garda whistleblowers.  The investigation, which has been ongoing for nine months, does not appear to be making any progress and no reports have been forthcoming.  The handling of this matter is extremely worrying.  I am not so sure things have changed much.  As I have stated previously, we should have examined the approach taken to policing in Northern Ireland where an active effort was made to clean out the old hierarchy and start afresh.  This has not been done here.</p>  <p>  On the independent review mechanism, the Minister went to great pains in her previous replies to refer to the independence and objectivity of the mechanism.  We must remember that the various positions were not advertised, the review's terms of reference were not published, the individuals who made the complaints have not been interviewed and have not received feedback and the mechanism does not have judicial status and, as such, is not subject to an appeal mechanism.  As far as the individuals in question are concerned, it is akin to a kangaroo court.  While I do not want to prejudge the final outcome, the way in which this matter has been handled is worrying.</p></speech>

To go back to the case in County Donegal and a number of other reports, various actions have been taken to deal with the issues the Deputy outlined.  I also believe the Garda Commissioner is committed to dealing with the points the Deputy makes.  While I cannot comment on the individual case he raises, whistleblowers in the force must be treated with respect and their complaints addressed.  I believe mechanisms are in place to do this and I want it to happen.</p>  <p>  I do not accept the Deputy's description of the review mechanism, which was established by the Government in good faith as an independent process and with terms of reference for dealing with the cases that were being referred to it.  Senior and junior counsel have been appointed to examine these cases and provide the best legal opinion possible, having regard to the facts and previous actions that were taken in the cases in question.</p><p>We have a number of commissions sitting at present, and comprehensive work has been done in this area by the Garda Inspectorate over a three-year period.  I do not believe we need another assessment of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Rather, we need to get on with changing the culture as outlined in the Garda Inspectorate report by way of implementation of the changes recommended therein, including addressing the technology issues, which are very basic.  That is what we are doing.</p></speech>

There is considerable concern across Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the consequential threat posed to national security.  This matter will be discussed in two weeks at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Riga.<br/><br/>The horrific events in Paris last week are the latest and the most serious manifestation of this threat.  The events show that all states must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by this phenomenon.  The Government, on behalf of its people, has expressed its condolences to the people of France, as has the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  We should always bear in mind that the threat does not come from particular religions or communities but rather from terrorists, who alone must bear the responsibility for their dreadful deeds.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I briefed the Government on issues arising from the brutal attacks in Paris last week.  While Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune from the threat of international terrorism, I have been advised that there is no specific information to suggest a threat to Ireland.  In response to the Deputy's question, it is estimated that between 25 and 30 Irish citizens have travelled to conflict zones since the commencement of the Arab Spring.  Some of these travelled for humanitarian or family reasons.  However, some are known to have participated in conflicts.  At least three have died in the conflicts.  A number of individuals have returned to Ireland from the conflict zones.  There are also a small number of people based here who support extremism and would try to facilitate it.  I can assure that House that the activities of these people are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, the Garda has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas in line with best practice internationally.  There is also very close and ongoing co-operation with security and intelligence services in other jurisdictions.  It is clear that in this instance international co-operation is necessary.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this, it has the full support of the Government, which is determined that all practical steps be taken to deal with any threat.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  In this context,  I wish to advise the House that the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all Stages in the Seanad.  The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences: public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to ten years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment and are particularly pertinent to the nature of the threat posed by radicalised individuals and indeed those who incite them to commit such heinous acts as those witnessed last week.  It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il next month and that it will be passed shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Ireland has been active on this issue nationally and in an international context for some time now.  Indeed, priority was given to the matter during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  In that connection, Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the member states to carry out a review of the EU strategy for countering radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review is the issue of foreign fighters.  A number of initiatives at EU level have since been developed for member states to combat this phenomenon, including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of suspects' movements, engagement with third countries - notably Turkey - and engagement with Internet service providers and social media companies to curb radical online content.</p></reply>

However, it is also the case that three people died in the conflict zones.  We are also aware that the US National Security Agency has passed information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to individuals who have travelled through this jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  In the main, this is an issue that hugely concerns people.  We must remain on our guard and take seriously the threats that these extremists pose to our society and public safety.  Has the Minister examined the constitutionality or legality of withdrawing citizenship or passports from individuals who engage in such acts of terrorism abroad?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, there is a very particular procedure laid out in that regard.  The issue of evidence in relation to people who travel and the purposes for which they travel is a complex one.  Many people have asked if, for example, people could be prevented from travelling.  The majority of those travelling to Syria from Ireland and elsewhere enter that country through Turkey, but it must be noted that Syria may not have been the original destination cited by many of those travellers.  They may have travelled to other cities and then travelled onwards.  To prevent people from travelling and obtain sufficient evidence of their activities to allow the type of action outlined by the Deputy is a complex procedure.  I would not rule out doing so where such evidence is available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  There is careful monitoring in this area by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We cannot be complacent.  There are many international travellers passing through Ireland all the time.  Monitoring is important.  This is a threat.  We need to gather as much intelligence and security information as we can in relation to it, but there is no evidence to suggest a specific threat against Ireland or that Ireland is being used as a transit hub for people engaged in this type of terrorism.</p></speech>

The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, during a recent interview on the &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot;, stated:<blockquote>That's true - we're not immune.  It's important that people remain vigilant, and that any information of a criminal nature is passed on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</blockquote>In light of the report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>and the comments of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will the Minister examine the idea of utilising the Criminal Assets Bureau in tracking down individuals who provide financial support to the Islamic State organisation?</p></speech>

The legislation in place in relation to money laundering and the type of activity outlined by the Deputy would allow us to do what he suggests.  If there is evidence of that type of activity, that legislation will be used.  As I said, one must first have evidence, and where evidence is available the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will monitor, follow up and prosecute.  I cannot comment on the particular case cited by the Deputy, but if there is clear evidence that a person in Ireland is supporting terrorism through financial activity the matter will be investigated and dealt with.  The new legislation, which has been already passed by the Seanad and will come before this House in the next week or two, provides further powers in relation to anybody who is involved in recruiting, supporting or financing terrorism.</p></speech>

I fear that the result of this will be further incidents of serious injury or worse among our garda&iacute;.  While I appreciate that there are a number of legislative provisions in place to deter this activity, they are not, unfortunately, working.  I would appreciate the Minister's views on how this problem can be tackled and how we can better protect our garda&iacute;.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.79.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500008#F01300"><p>I thank Deputy Griffin for tabling this question.  Like the Deputy, I consider the deliberate ramming of Garda vehicles to be a very serious matter and can assure him that the safety of garda&iacute; and the general public is of paramount importance.  I can also assure the Deputy that all incidents of this nature are subject to full investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter of great concern that individuals deliberately ram Garda vehicles, whether in the course of evading arrest or for other criminal purposes.  All appropriate operational and safety precautions are of course taken, but where an individual is intent on causing such a collision, prevention will inherently be difficult.  Where these incidents do occur, it is important that such persons are brought before the courts.</p><p>I have previously outlined for the Deputy the range of robust road safety and other legislative enforcement provisions available to the Garda authorities in such circumstances.  These include the assault offences contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and for which penalties range from up to five years imprisonment to life imprisonment, depending on the seriousness of the offence involved.  In addition, section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994<b></b>provides for specific offences relating to assaults on peace officers which includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The penalty for this offence was increased from five years to seven years imprisonment by the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991, provides for the offence of damage to the property of another person for which the penalty is a maximum of ten years imprisonment.  Provision is made for very serious sentences for those kind of offences which can be used in the situation as outlined by the Deputy.  A sentence of up to ten years imprisonment can be given for a person involved in the ramming of a Garda car.  If such ramming were to cause death, an offence of attempted murder, murder or manslaughter, may be considered applicable with the resultant penalties including mandatory life imprisonment for a conviction for murder.  Legislative sanctions are in place to deal with those involved in this dreadful activity which often has very serious consequences for garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

I acknowledge the raft of legislation in place.  The punishment for those guilty of such offences is very strict and severe but, unfortunately, this message does not seem to be hitting home.  Would the Minister agree it would be advantageous to create a specific offence of deliberately ramming a Garda vehicle and applying a serious custodial sentence?</p>  <p>  Apart from trying to prevent this crime we need to accept that it will continue to happen.  Perhaps we need to consider ensuring that all Garda vehicles, rather than some, are larger, more robust vehicles and that there should be additional safety features provided such as the reinforcement of the vehicles.  Ramming of Garda vehicles is happening and we need to equip our garda&iacute; to ensure they are safe when this occurs.</p></speech>

He refers to the further use of mandatory prison sentences.  I refer to the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing and its views on the existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provision for various offences.  The recent report on penal policy stated that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  However, those issues are under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the number of garda&iacute; who have been injured in such incidents.  I do not have those figures to hand but I will supply them to the Deputy.  I can provide information on the number of Garda vehicles rammed in recent years.  In 2010, 66 vehicles were rammed; 55 vehicles in 2011; 61 vehicles in 2012; 63 vehicles in 2013.  These are serious incidents which occur every year.  I take the Deputy's point about investment in Garda vehicles.  More upgraded Garda vehicles are available as a result of the increased funding.  I hope this will ensure that the Garda vehicles in use are sufficiently robust.  Nevertheless, the actions of criminals have the potential to cause serious injury or death in the circumstances described by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for considering the draft legislation I have sent to her Department.  If part of that legislation could be implemented or included in any future legislative provisions it would be helpful, in my view.  Anything we can do to protect our Garda force would be very advantageous.</p>  <p>  While I very much appreciate and welcome the investment in new Garda vehicles we need to focus on the quality of the vehicles rather than on quantity alone.  It is important to have the very best vehicles for safety and handling when dealing with criminals.  For example, the odds are stacked against a garda driving a 1.5 litre diesel car attempting to apprehend a criminal in car with a 2 litre or higher petrol engine.  We need to focus on quality as well as on quantity.</p></speech>

Three hundred garda&iacute; have been recruited and the next group will go to Templemore in the next two weeks.  There has been increased investment in Garda vehicles by this Government of up to &euro;27 million over the past number of years.  I believe these measures will make a difference to the robust nature of the fleet with regard to the issue outlined by the Deputy.  The ramming of Garda cars is a serious issue.  Prevention can be extremely difficulty when dealing with those intent on criminal activity which often involves the ramming of Garda vehicles.  I note the points made by the Deputy.  We will examine whether it is possible to incorporate extra provisions in the legislation.  However, strong points have been made against mandatory sentencing for an offence such as this.  However, I will consider the points raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is true that Garda strength has been affected by retirements and that is why I was pleased to be able to secure approval from this Government for the resumption of Garda recruitment.  One hundred new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009.  This is as a direct result of the improved economic situation which has allowed recruitment to take place.  A further 100 new recruits entered in December and a further intake of 100 is due to enter training at the end of this month.  This will bring to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September and is a measure of Fine Gael and Labour's commitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first intake of recruits will attest as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May of this year and they will be assigned to Garda stations by the Garda Commissioner.  In my reply to the previous question I spoke about the increased budgetary allocation for modern, fit-for-purpose vehicles which are of significant importance to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are also providing an additional &euro;7 million for this purpose in 2014 and &euro;3 million in 2015, to allow the procurement and fit-out of approximately 400 new Garda vehicles.  These vehicles will come on stream in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It is a key objective of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all of the resources at her disposal in a manner which maximises their impact on the protection of the public and on the prevention and detection of crime.  In that context, Garda management keeps under continuing review developments in relation to security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure the best possible use of resources.  This is an issue for the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report made the point that there needs to be more attention paid to the allocation of garda&iacute;, depending on crime trends in a given area, on the changing population in an area and whether an area has changed from a rural to a more urbanised area.  These considerations must inform where police are deployed during a particular period.</p><p>Based on concerns expressed by various Deputies, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to ensure the allocation of policing is subject to continuous review, because priorities change.  I commend the Garda authorities on the implementation of Operation Fiacla, which began in 2012.  It was a national operation to tackle mobile gangs who were moving around and committing crimes throughout the country.  This led to 11,405 arrests, and 6,549 people have been charged as a result of this operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps we do not pay enough attention to this type of work and the outcome of these operations.  This very specific operation had a good outcome.</p></speech>

Does she think it might be possible, in further deployments of garda&iacute; throughout the country, to take account of the specific levels of crime in particular areas when enhancing the strength of various Garda divisions?  Might it be possible to focus on the extent to which the counties and areas adjoining Dublin seem to be at the mercy of criminals in recent times to a far greater extent than the average throughout the country?  This is due to a number of factors, including mobility and motorways.  To take County Kildare as an example, the reduction in the number of garda&iacute; in stations in recent years seems to have led to an increase in crime.  Would it be possible to address these particular issues when deployments take place?</p></speech>

The Deputy outlined very clearly that one of the increasing issues with regard to crime in this country is that mobile gangs use very good transport links to facilitate crime by moving in and out of an area quickly, committing a series of crimes there.  The Garda is very aware of this issue and is working to address it.  A number of the initiatives it has undertaken in recent years and months, such as Operation Fiacla, to which I referred, are being used specifically to target the very point made by the Deputy.  I agree with him that the allocation of Garda resources must be linked to the amount of crime in a particular area.  This has not been done as effectively in the past as it needs to be now.  A key point outlined in the Garda Inspectorate report in terms of the allocation of garda&iacute; to particular areas is that it ought to be linked to population, crime figures and the threats in a particular area, whether urban or rural.</p></speech>

It is concerned about staffing issues in the county.  Garda&iacute; based in rural areas are being drafted to Letterkenny, which is the main town in the county.  In fairness, for operational reasons the GRA has not identified the locations, but it states that some rural Garda stations have no garda&iacute; because they have been drafted into Letterkenny.  There is clearly a massive issue.  It also states that in some parts of the county Garda numbers have been reduced by 25%.  Will the Minister examine the situation in Donegal and speak to the Garda Commissioner about what is happening there?</p></speech>

As has my colleague, I met the Deputy Commissioner in the past and stressed the importance of Garda numbers in Kildare.  While resources are just sufficient at present, they are at stretching point.  Many retirements have taken place.  We seem to find it difficult to get garda&iacute; to transfer to Kildare because each Garda division seems to hold on to its allocation.  I would appreciate if the Minister would speak to the Commissioner about the point my colleagues have made with regard to the number of garda&iacute; and the allocation of garda&iacute;, particularly in Kildare.</p></speech>

This is the bottom line.  The situations outlined by the Deputies were a direct result of the economic situation in which the country found itself.  Due to the actions of the Government we are in a far better economic situation at present, although we have more work to do.  This has allowed the Government to take the decision to begin recruitment again, which will be the first recruitment since 2009.  I emphasise this.  We have already recruited 200 extra garda&iacute; and another 100 will start in Templemore.  The situation will be kept under review, depending on the number of Garda retirements and the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I could speak about different areas, and Deputies will be particularly sensitive to the situation in their own area, but the overall situation is being improved by the recruitment of new garda&iacute;.  This means the Garda Commissioner can take the types of operational decision that Deputies Durkan and Lawlor from County Kildare have highlighted, which also relates to the point made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  The best operational decisions can be taken by the Garda Commissioner if she has more resources at her disposal.</p>  <p>  I have already stated that we are examining the IT requirements of the Garda.  We want to see more efficient deployment of the resources we have.  I have the support of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to examine the technological needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which have been outlined by the Garda Inspectorate.  All of these actions are designed to ensure we have more effective policing in every county in Ireland and that citizens are protected in a more comprehensive way.  This is the goal of the Government and it is what we are working towards.  The combination of initiatives we are taking on the recruitment of garda&iacute;, the changes to IT and implementing the Garda Inspectorate report will ensure a better and more efficient service locally and that crime will be detected and citizens kept safe.  This is the goal of the Government and it will be the result of the actions we are taking.</p></speech>

Despite our discussion, I remain to be convinced that lobbying communications as defined in the proposed statute could pose a threat to personal safety or the security of the State and, if they did, that the public interest would be best served by keeping them secret.  I do not believe the Minister has given a really persuasive explanation for that.<br/><br/>He has powers within the legislation under sections 5(4) and 5(7) to accept any specific communications with designated public officials with respect to relevant matters, taking account of the public interest.  Of course, the security of the State or the personal safety of anyone would be a matter of public interest.  I am not convinced this should be in the legislation but I will not press the amendments because I have a sense that it will not get me very far.<br/><br/>In respect of the review after 12 months, I suggest to the Minister that this is another element on which we should keep a watching brief.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 22 proposes to remove the exemption that would protect from disclosure information which would pose a threat to the safety of any person.  Amendment No. 23 proposes to remove the exemption that would protect from disclosure information which could pose a threat to the security of the State.</p>  <p>  I have reflected on the case the Deputy made on Committee Stage.  I remain of the view that sensitive forms of communications relating to the safety of a person or the security of the State should be protected from the requirement to register under this legislation.  This is why I have included these specific exemptions from the communications covered in the Bill.  This approach is similar to that adopted in FOI legislation which recognises that certain sensitive information that literally pertains to a person's safety or the security and safety of the State should not be made public.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage Deputy McDonald asked for some examples of what might constitute this, which was a fair point.  Regarding amendments Nos. 22 and 23 relating to the safety of the person and the security of the State, I looked at a variety of situations, obviously many of them in the justice area and so on.  I will just take one relating to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which formed part of the submissions I received.  Companies involved in the export control system have expressed concerns directly to the Department over the safety of their employees where details are made public.  In discharging its export control responsibilities the Department applies rigorous security to applications for export licences.  This often involves consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on cases where exports are being made to countries where the Department has concerns regarding the risk of human rights infringements or the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, for example.  Making information in many cases public would be very damaging to the international relations and perhaps in some circumstances pose a real threat to the security of individuals who are acting in our interest to ensure, for example, that certain things should not be exported to places where they might be misused or abused.  That level of information should be protected.  That is just to give one example and there are many more.</p>  <p>  Having reviewed the cases made to me by individual Departments, I think there is still a coherent case.  It is a procedure that is not unknown and is replicated in many similar statutes in jurisdictions that have the same open democratic view of these matters that we do.</p></speech>

We are dealing with areas that the Minister has listed as exempted communications.  Amendments Nos. 24 to 26, inclusive, cover sections 5(4)(j), 5(4)(k) and 5(4)(l), respectively.  Essentially these are exempting from the legislation communications by a designated public official in his capacity in his work, and communications by a person who is employed by, or holds any office in, a public service body and makes a communication which relates to the functions of the public service body in which he or she is employed.  Amendment No 26 deals with communications by a person who is a designated public official under the legislation but not specifically employed in a public service body designated under the legislation, notwithstanding that the person is a public official designated under the legislation which relates to the functions of the body.<br/><br/>The definition here is too broad.  It reflects the old thinking in public bodies over the years and in government circles nationally and locally for many decades.  The law has changed when it comes to planning.  There was and still is the hangover of this in the planning area.  It is essentially one law for public bodies and a different law for everybody else.  The essence of what is exempted should be based on the substance and not on who is making the actual communication.<br/><br/>I draw a parallel.  Many years ago many public bodies were exempt from having to submit planning applications.  The OPW could do what it liked and could build in the middle of a main street.  They were public bodies and therefore they did not have to go through the normal planning process.  Fortunately, people became more enlightened over the years and decided that if someone was doing something, we should look at what they were doing.  The owner or the proposer of the development is neither here nor there.  The question is whether what is being proposed is a good idea.  We need to look at the substance of the proposal rather than whether the proposer is a designated body.<br/><br/>Public bodies have to apply for planning permission in many cases.  However, we still have situations in the public arena - the same attitude is reflected here - where even local authorities can grant themselves planning permission under certain sections of the legislation for housing development or different items.  They do not go through the normal planning process; they just have to go through a so-called &quot;agreement, Part 8&quot;.  Different local authorities give it different references whether it is based on the section of Act or the subsection of the Act.  The members of a local authority can give planning approval, for example, for a housing development or a sewage treatment plant by a local authority and there is no right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in some of those.  I know there is strategic infrastructure and in the case of some large applications, local authorities have to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, many local authorities can still carry out work that in the normal course of events would have to go through the planning process if it were being carried out by anybody other than a local authority.<br/><br/>That attitude permeates the public service and is one of let us have a law for the public out there, but let us not have this law complicating how we in the public service carry on our lives even though we might want to do the same thing.  That is what is reflected here.  That is the attitude of saying we are public officials doing our duty.  We should be exempt from the legislation.  That should certainly not be so in my opinion.  If what a public body is doing requires it to be exempt, that is fine, but there should not be a blanket exemption for public bodies.<br/><br/>I have not had time to think about it in too much detail.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>A communication from a county manager or director of services in regard to Irish Water is exempt in the Bill, as I read it, because a designated public official - chief executive officer is the new name for county or city managers - who will be captured under the Act might communicate with somebody on matters which relate to the functions of the public service body, that is, the local authority.  I hope I am wrong, but my understanding of the amendment is that these type of communications can be excluded.</p> <p> I refer to local authorities and housing.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government might have a lot of funding to allocate for social housing programmes by 2020.  Everything now involves a five-year plan, such as tax, homelessness and housing.  Nothing will be done in the next two or three years; it will all be done in five years' time.  The Government has a housing plan for social housing.  A lot of work will be done by voluntary organisations, such as Respond and Cl&uacute;id, and housing associations.  They are not captured under the Bill, but a local authority which is doing identical work, in terms of providing social housing, can be exempt.</p> <p> A director of housing can talk to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about seeking funding for a local authority social housing project and his or her willingness to work with the Department to secure such funding.  As he or she is in a public service body and is an employee communicating about his or her functions, he or she would be exempt from the Bill.  Respond, Cl&uacute;id and other housing associations could have the same conversation, but would not have a specific exemption.</p> <p> I can see that the Minister does not want the normal functions being caught up, but we have included communications where people are looking for factual information.  The Minister tabled an amendment on that yesterday, and stated that people seeking factual information should be exempt because that is not really lobbying.  That should be broad enough to cover pubic officials who are working within their capacity to seek information in regard to the functions of a public body.</p> <p> There can be competition between public bodies and relevant Government Departments regarding the allocation of funding.  The communications of people working on behalf of a public body, or an official who is a designated person or at that grade, are exempt under the legislation.</p> <p> We have been too broad in terms of exemptions.  I would like to see the Bill more tightly drafted.  I understand it should not interfere with the proper working of the organisation, but we have expanded it too much in terms of exemptions.  I would like to see more included rather than exempted from the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister has made that point and it is legitimate.  However, these exemptions are cast, as Deputy Fleming said, very broadly.  Given that the Minister has the power to accept communications in the public interest and has brought forward a provision in respect of simple communications to establish matters of fact, interdepartmental or inter-public official lobbying should not be excluded from transparency and scrutiny.  The objective of all Stages of this legislative process is to make the Bill operable and, as the Minister said, as practical, effective and comprehensive as possible.  Therefore, I have tabled these amendments and others.  There are other very sweeping exemptions, and it is a mistake to cast them so broadly in the Bill.</p></speech>

This is the first time we have had this type of legislation.  We talked about it for a very long time.  I championed it in opposition.  I am anxious, having had very detailed discussions with everybody who was concerned about this, to make sure it works.  The key issue is what kind of communication we are talking about.  We are talking about lobbying, and people understand what that means.  Not every piece of communication that happens between staff in a local authority or Government Department is lobbying.  They are doing their job; they are not lobbying.  If an assistant secretary tells an assistant principal, "This is a policy issue.  Do that." that is not lobbying; rather, it is normal working communication.</p>  <p>  We have to be practical, as I have said, about the operation of this.  To have the net cast in the way the Deputies opposite are now suggesting, even though I understand the reasoning for it, would defeat the purpose because one would not see the wood for the trees.  If everything is reported, registered and so on, real lobbying would be difficult to identify.  What is the motivation of this Bill and what has motivated other countries?  It is to see who is externally influencing or peddling power.  It is not to have all of the normal communication of Government Departments or officials at local or national level monitored, as if there was some sort of external oversight of normal communications in a functioning democracy.</p>  <p>  As I said, my view is very simple in regard to lobbying.  Much lobbying is legitimate and proper.  In fact, I have described it as the lifeblood of our democracy.  Every citizen should lobby, in terms of the things which concern him or her, whether it is the rate of taxes, the roads or whatever else.  That is a fundamental lubricant of our democracy and should be protected.</p>  <p>  The Bill is designed to focus and shine the light of day on who in the public domain is having influence on power brokers.  The myriad daily communications within and between public sector organisations which would be captured by these amendments, if I accepted them, would overload and clog up the system, and make it unworkable.  This exclusion is a common feature of the best legislation we have examined internationally.</p>  <p>  I have been working diligently as a Minister to ensure there is a suite of transparency measures.  Some of what the Deputies opposite are talking about would be fully captured by FOI.  That is the appropriate vehicle to find out what communication, documentation and reports are generated between or within Government and local authorities, if that is what the Deputies are interested in.  It does not fit into the category of lobbying.  Once cannot slot into the category of lobbying normal communications.  Having thought about this long and hard, and having examined the arguments made, I genuinely do not believe that these amendments should be accepted.  It would defeat the purpose of the Bill if I did accept them.</p></speech>

Most of what we introduce is relevant to freedom of information legislation anyway.  If a private company lobbies the National Transport Authority with regard to bus routes, there would be commercial sensitivity involved.  Is the Minister aware of that?  There is not a chance in hell of that information being released under the freedom of information process, as the commercial viability of routes would be seen as commercially sensitive.  The Minister should not use that fig leaf.  CIE can do the same but it is exempt from having to register.  I have already given the example of the education sector.  If I had another five minutes I would have another five examples, but I will leave it at that as I have made my point.</p></speech>

I will return to the principle in any event.  We are discussing lobbying, and not every type of communication made within a body is relevant, such as when a principal officer speaks to an assistant principal or the Secretary General of a Department speaks at the weekly management advisory committee meeting.  Is it lobbying when he speaks about policy direction?  Of course it is not, and that would be captured by the baldness of the amendments before us.  There is an inescapable logic to what I am saying.</p>  <p>  I will not even get into some of the points made by Deputy Fleming.  He oscillates from the opinion that there is no purpose at all to the idea that the legislation should capture everything.  This has a discrete focus and takes in international best practice on how to deal with the lobbying issue.  If my proposal does not hold water, there is no lobbying legislation on the planet that would hold water, as they are all modelled on the same set of principles that are practical, workable and good.</p>  <p>  We must bring people with us in this groundbreaking legislation.  It will certainly be expanded in future, but I do not want to stifle it at birth by making it unworkable and impractical.  That is why I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

As we indicated with previous amendments, this exemption relating to lobbying by commercial and non-commercial semi-state companies should not be excluded from transparency processes and scrutiny.<br/><br/>I can give a contemporary example.  I listened on the radio a couple of months ago to one of the Minister's Labour Party colleagues from the Seanad reflecting on Bord G&aacute;is and its acquisition of responsibility for Uisce &Eacute;ireann or Irish Water.  He made some fairly astounding remarks in respect of how that happened and accused Bord G&aacute;is of misleading the Government.  I do not know if the Minister heard this interview and I assume the Senator subsequently withdrew those remarks.  I raise this example because, notwithstanding the commercial mandate of the commercial semi-state bodies - which gives rise to concerns about commercial sensitivities - there is a legitimate need to scrutinise and understand the lobbying that happens between semi-state bodies and the mothership, whether that is a Department, departmental officials or Ministers.  The broad exemption afforded to these bodies in the legislation is a mistake.<br/><br/>The Minister has the power of exemption under section 5, and he has made a provision to allow that the sharing of factual information may not fall within the scope of the Bill.  There is a definition of a relevant communication.  I am very uneasy about this particular exemption and even at this stage I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  The amendment seeks to strike out that provision.</p></speech>

The exemption is intended to cover governance matters made within the ordinary course of business of a commercial semi-state body.  Commercial semi-state bodies are of strategic importance, and we have spoken about this in every piece of ethics legislation.  The ability of a Minister or a parent Department to engage with such bodies that are owned by the State as shareholder is an essential part of normal governance.  That is as any shareholder would with a body that it owns.  An appropriate balance is therefore critical between strengthening transparency and avoiding the diminution of effective governance of commercial State companies that are really important to the State and the people.</p>  <p>  This is a narrow exemption dealing with governance issues and it is intended that other relevant communications on wider sectoral or regulatory issues would continue to be subject to registration as per the Bill.  There is a narrow sphere to ensure that proper governance and oversight can be dealt with by the parent Department or Minister - the shareholder - and the company in a normal business way.</p></speech>

I propose to delete the following words: &quot;apart from any matter relating only to the implementation of any such policy, programme, enactment or award or of a technical nature.&quot;  Any communication up to implementation point can be regarded as lobbying, but thereafter, the legislation does not capture any of the communications.  That is very worrying.  Implementation is a crucial stage of public policy.  As we know, it can be the difference between success and failure and the overall character and impact of any public policy.  The implementation stage, however one regards that, is probably the time at which contracts are agreed or signed, resources are allocated and money changes hands.  I see absolutely no reason to exempt that phase of deliberation of policy-making and that dynamic from the legislation - in fact, I regard it as quite a dangerous thing to do.<br/><br/>As the Minister knows, I raised this with him on Committee Stage.  I said at that time that I regarded it as a very large and dangerous loophole in the law.  That remains my position and that is why I have tabled the amendment again at this stage.</p></speech>

I will put it in some context.  When framing the Bill, we looked at best international practice.  A number of options were available to actually define what lobbying is.  Different jurisdictions have tried different definitions.  Most of us would ask "What is lobbying?"  In plain English, it is attempting to influence decision-making.  That is the concept that has been used elsewhere in legislation, particularly in the ground-breaking model legislation in Canada.  However, that was actually proved to be too narrow a definition because, in practice, proving that a person is trying, or attempting, to influence became an obstacle, so I rejected that.  I have cast the definition much more broadly than the initial Canadian model.  For the Deputy's information, Canada has amended its federal legislation to change the definition from attempting to influence to any oral or written communication, which is the model we are using here.  However, if one is going to use that catch-all phrase of "any written or oral communication", it is so broad a definition as one's starting base that one has to look at ensuring that one captures what is really at issue here.  The definition used in our Bill is the broad definition.  We need to be explicit in terms of the exemptions we put in.</p>  <p>  I understand exactly what the Deputy is talking about but, basically, what we want to do, certainly at this stage of it, is to capture anything that seeks to influence the creation or making of policy during its formation.  That is our focus in regard to this.</p>  <p>  This provision seeks to find the appropriate balance to ensure that significant communication affecting the formulation of policy is captured and is disclosable so that people understand who is influencing the decision-making at the policy formation phase.  This provision seeks to exclude low-level communication relating to implementation or technical issues around implementation, which, I am informed, would be absolutely voluminous.  It is a standard approach in other lobbying legislation and according to best practice.  Again, it ensures that the base principles of the Bill are broad enough to ensure that people do not run a coach and four through them.  That is why I have used the broad definition rather than the narrow one and confined it in a reasonable way and made it practicable - so that we do not lose sight of what we need to focus on due to the sheer volume.</p>  <p>  As I said, we have probably done more sounding out with stakeholders, lobbying groups, citizen groupings, etc., on this legislation than on any other legislation I have dealt with.  It was indicated during this process that the administrative burden that would be placed on registrants, arising from everything that is done in the implementation phase, would be extraordinary.  I accepted that.</p>  <p>  I do not say that this is an issue that is closed forever.  We may want to broaden it out in the future, but certainly, in order to bring everybody with us and to deal with what this Bill is about, we must focus on who is influencing or seeking to influence, often quite legitimately, properly and appropriately in a democratic system, the formulation of any policy rather than simply every communication about the technical nature of implementation once the policy has been determined.  I hope the Deputy will accept my bona fides on that.</p></speech>

However, the Minister has exempted quite a number of different categories of communications, bodies and individuals, so he has very substantially pruned the scope of this.  By the way, I accept the Minister's bona fides in so doing and I am not attributing any negative motive to that.  It is consistent with the logic he has set out.  However, I it is an absolute mistake to exempt wholly the implementation phase of public policy.</p><p>The Minister should bear in mind that at that phase, as at any other phase of public policy, for the communication to qualify it has to be communication of a certain nature.  It is not nuts and bolts conversations on mundane day-to-day matters.  This is a big mistake.  I am at a loss to understand why the Minister would exempt such a critical part because while the influence and interaction at the level of conceiving policy and shaping it in theoretical or written form is one thing, the real action happens when policy is translated into action, initiatives, resources and money and the where and how of all that.  That phase is as open and prone to quite aggressive lobbying by vested interests as any other stage.</p> <p> I will press the amendment.  The Minister may not agree with me today but as he has referred to the 12-month review and keeping an eye on matters at every juncture, this, critically, should be at the forefront of his mind.  It is a mistake to exempt it.  I am absolutely unconvinced by the Minister&rsquo;s rationale.  It does not stack up.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500016#O00200"><p>I move amendment No. 33:<blockquote>In page 9, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:&quot;(f) Secretaries General and Assistant Secretaries General;&quot;.</blockquote>The amendments we are discussing relate to the designation of public officials under this legislation.  The Minister has included in section 6, as it stands following Committee Stage, a list of people who will have to register under the regulation of lobbying Act if they are lobbied.  The section provides that the following are designated public officials:<blockquote>(a) Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State;<br /><br />(b) other members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann;<br /><br />(c) members of the European Parliament for constituencies in the State;<br /><br />(d) members of local authorities;<br /><br />(e) special advisers [to Ministers] appointed under section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997;<br /><br />(f) public servants of a prescribed description;<br /><br />(g) any other prescribed office holders or description of persons [that the Minister can choose to designate].</blockquote>I have proposed a number of amendments that would provide for specific groups of people to be listed in the primary legislation alongside the people on the list I have just read.</p><p>I have been specific about the additional people I would like to see included in the primary legislation.  Those already listed exclude the permanent government.  Elected persons come and go, depending on when elections happen.  Legislation that did not include the lobbying of Secretaries General and assistant secretaries general would be fundamentally flawed.  The Bill's sole purpose is to capture the lobbying of elected politicians.  Alongside appointed special advisers, it covers no one else.  The Minister can list others by way of regulation, but he will not do so in the legislation.  Everyone agrees that the lobbying of politicians should be captured and regulated, but everyone would be as adamant that not including the most senior public servants in the country would represent a fundamental flaw in the legislation.</p> <p> I tabled amendment No. 33 for this reason.  It includes Secretaries General and assistant secretaries general.  Amendment No. 34 would include directors of services in local authorities.  Such people can have more influence than any elected local councillor.  Amendment No. 35 would include principal officers and assistant principal officers.  Amendment No. 36 would include the private secretaries of Ministers and Ministers of State.  Amendment No. 37 would include the chief executive officers of local authorities.  The Minister has indicated that he will designate public officials on commencement of the Act, but I cannot understand why he will not include these people in the Act itself.  While I accept his bona fides about including such officials, I want a coherent reason for not listing them in the Bill.  I assume that he will accept my amendments by and large.  Subsequent to the previous Stage, the Minister gave a commitment to the Oireachtas committee that he would, on commencement of the Act, designate Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general, CEOs of local authorities and directors of services, as specifically called for in my amendments.  By way of correspondence, the Minister's position on these four categories is the same as that in my amendments.  I am happy to withdraw the amendments relating to private secretaries, principal officers and assistant principal officers, but perhaps those persons could be included in the second round after 12 months.</p> <p> I am not satisfied with the legislation as drafted.  This is the opportunity for the Oireachtas to include in the legislation Secretaries General and assistant secretaries general.  Who are the most important people in a Department?  Some Departments can see three Ministers passing through in the lifetime of a single Government.  The average period of a Minister in a Department is probably two years.  Some can stay for the full five years and some can get second terms, but others might only be in position for a year before being moved.  There was a Cabinet reshuffle last July.</p></speech>

It was to his credit that he got the promotion.  However, he was only in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for six weeks, but he is captured in this legislation while that Department's Secretary General is not.  I saw an e-mail yesterday outlining that a new Secretary General had been approved by the Government.  That person could be in place for the next seven years.  There is no logic in excluding Secretaries General.  Is this just another instance of passing legislation to regulate politicians without also capturing the permanent government, including county managers and directors of services who can be in place for many years?  How anyone can draft legislation that requires people to register if they lobby local councillors but not if they only lobby council managers or directors of services is wrong.  The same applies at Government level, in that one must register when lobbying a Minister, Minister of State - some Ministers are only in position for a matter of weeks or months - or Deputy, but not when lobbying a permanent Secretary General or assistant secretary general.  This is not good enough.  It feeds into the belief that, for some reason, anyone who deals with politicians must be regulated.</p>  <p>  The Minister has only listed politicians as designated public officials under section 6.  Regardless of whether he believes it, public cynicism about the democratic process and politicians is fed when he believes that he must draft legislation that only includes Ministers, Ministers of State, Deputies, Senators, MEPs, local authority members and ministerial special advisers.  Ministers and the like are only the elected heads for a short time.</p>  <p>  I provided an example yesterday.  If someone wanted to lobby on the sale of shares in AIB, he or she would put a case to Goldman Sachs.  Yesterday, the Minister confirmed that he specifically excluded consultants.  One does not approach the Minister for Finance to get a point of view included in a report by Goldman Sachs.  Rather, one probably speaks to people at Goldman Sachs or the assistant secretary general who deals with Goldman Sachs and will present a summary of the report to the Minister, yet the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has excluded both categories.</p>  <p>  We are nearing 12 noon.  We have not been able to complete the Bill, so we will need to spend a bit more time on it this afternoon.  I am sure-----</p></speech>

He knows full well that I intend to include public servants in the legislation.  I explained in some detail on Committee Stage that I would do this in a different format.  I am prescriptive as regards Ministers, Deputies and members of local authorities because they are a discrete, finite group.</p>  <p>  In terms of which public officials should be captured, the Deputy even agreed that there would be more than one wave as we progress.  Rather than including certain officials in primary law and, by definition, others that should not, section 6 refers to "public servants of a prescribed description".  As I have already told the Deputy, I intend prescribing from the outset Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general and CEOs of local authorities.  They will be captured from the beginning.  Within 12 months, it is my intention to extend this provision to principal officers, but there might be other categories or designations that we will have to consider.  My approach is simply to have an enabling power in respect of the prescribed categories.  I am open to hearing the case for capturing any category.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>However, if we state in primary law that these are the only categories, we are saying that nobody else should be captured under these provisions other than those particular categories.  That is a fundamental mistake because there will be categories of public servants that should be subject to this legislation but which are not on the list put forward by the Deputy opposite.</p></speech>

This year, families will, depending on their circumstances, face bills ranging from &euro;160 to &euro;260.  We are all aware of the rebate from the T&aacute;naiste's Department and the costs associated with that.  Yesterday we saw from the new legislative programme that the Government intends to publish another water services Bill this session.  This D&aacute;il would not be the same without a water services Bill each session.  However, nobody seems to know what this particular legislation is about.  The Taoiseach certainly did not know yesterday, nor was it mentioned by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, during his many speeches on the issue at the end of last year.</p>  <p>  Flat charges will be short-lived and probably changed by 2018, but the Government is not shouting from the rooftops about that.  There is no ceiling on the amount of water people can use and householders will receive relief from the Department of Social Protection in an effort by the Government to try to pass the EUROSTAT test in March.  If it does pass that test, we are told we will be able to borrow money to invest in infrastructure.  This would indeed be welcome given that this Government has invested less in the past four years than its predecessor did in a period before water charges were ever talked about.  Despite the political propaganda professed by the T&aacute;naiste and her colleagues, that is the factual situation.</p>  <p>  We had reports yesterday that despite the &euro;500 million spent by Irish Water on installing water meters and the &euro;42 million per year that is being paid for this borrowing, the lifespan of these devices is only 15 years.  We have never seen the contracts for their installation or the detail in regard to the awarding of those contracts.  The management of Irish Water continues to be a secret affair between the Government and the company.  As I said, we were informed yesterday that the manufacturer's design life of a water meter is 15 years.  However, the devices that have been installed throughout the country will not be utilised until 2019 at the earliest.  The Government is spending &euro;500 million installing 1.2 million meters, which works out at &euro;416 per meter.  These items will effectively have a lifespan of up to ten years, given that they will not be used for the first five years following their installation.  When people are told they will pay &euro;60 for water, they should know that &euro;42 of the bill will be for the water meter.  That represents 70% of the bill for a single adult and some 26% of the bill for a family of two or more.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste consider this a responsible use of money given that her Government continues to cut services left, right and centre?  Does she consider it a responsible use of money when hospital emergency services are under such pressure, community care for the elderly is almost non-existent, home help hours are being slashed, and elderly and disabled people applying for housing adaptation grants are being told they must wait three to five years before their applications can be processed?  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, good old Irish Water is spending &euro;500 million on meters that will possibly have a lifespan of only ten years, considering they will be defunct for the first five years.  What assurances has the T&aacute;naiste been given and what confidence can she assert in this House that no further moneys will be expended on upgrading these meters?  Local authorities which installed water meters less than three or four years ago were subsequently told by these characters in Irish Water that they were obsolete.  May we have some clarity once and for all on this issue, or will it continue to be the Government's nemesis this year?  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will be able to tell us what the story is before the embarrassment of the EUROSTAT test in March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500018#Q00500"><p>I begin by wishing everybody a happy new year.  It is a bit disappointing to see that Deputy Cowen must not have had a break over Christmas to read up on Irish Water.  As he rightly acknowledges, the new charging structure will see a gross charge of &euro;160 for an individual living alone, less the water conservation grant of &euro;100 that the Department of Social Protection will pay.  That is a net charge of &euro;60.  For a family, the gross charge will be &euro;260, less the &euro;100 water conservation grant.  This compares very favourably with the &euro;400 annual water charge that was originally proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I suppose it slipped the Deputy's mind, but it is what his party put on the table.</p>  <p>  Having given that clarification, I move on to the more important point.  Our antiquated water system is not fit for purpose in terms of the needs of every man, woman and child in this country and the need for employment, investment and growth in the economy.  As I understand it, Fianna F&aacute;il was once a party that supported public investment in the infrastructure of this country and the employment that creates.  When it managed to lose the banks, however, it seemed also to lose its taste for the investment that this country badly needs.  At this time there are 42 points in this country at which raw sewage is being pumped into rivers, lakes and beaches.  Even if that does not concern Deputy Cowen, it does concern most people in this country, particularly those who have to live near these locations.  The water charges that have been set out are reasonable.</p>  <p>  In regard to water meters, it feels these days as though Fianna F&aacute;il is basically looking to identify anything and everything it can to denigrate the people who work in water services in this country and the people who are committed to investing in and providing clean water for the population.  I am sure the Deputy has had an opportunity to read the newspapers today, in which case he will have seen the views expressed by an expert in one particular article and echoed in all of the media.  This expert indicates that it will, in due course, take around five minutes to replace a meter and that it will cost some &euro;50 million to do so for all meters.  The expected lifespan of the devices in terms of the guarantee and the work that is being carried out is a minimum of 15 years.  In fact, based on the experience in other countries, it is likely to be significantly longer than that.  I do not know if the Deputy has ever actually looked at what the water meter set-up is, but the only thing that will have to be changed is the actual meter.  As I said, experts indicate that it will take something like five minutes to do so, that it can be done at a very low cost and that many of the meters will go well beyond the indicated guaranteed lifespan of 15 years.</p><p>To be honest, what the Deputy is concerned about is a total ball of smoke.  </p></speech>

That is not a ball of smoke.  Some &euro;500 million has now been spent on water metering, and that is not a ball of smoke.  The almost &euro;50 million a year that is being paid towards servicing the costs of that is not a ball of smoke either.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste a question but she failed to answer it.  She is good at that, but she will be held accountable whether she likes it or not.</p>  <p>  In any contract that I or others in this Chamber have seen, the T&aacute;naiste has no guarantee - none whatsoever - that the installed water meters will last beyond 15 years.  She should not try to tell me that they will last 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, because she does not know, no more than I do.  That is the ball of smoke she is talking about. </p>  <p>  Putting the associated spending to one side, we should also consider the debacle in our hospitals, as well as care for the elderly, community care and our home help situation.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think that is money well spent?  Can she stand over this while people cannot get the care and assistance they need and want in their homes so that communities can prosper in some shape or form?  The T&aacute;naiste has abandoned the commitments she made to rural areas.  She should not try to tell me that it is a ball of smoke.  I am here on behalf of the constituents I represent, together with those of my colleagues, who wish to tell the T&aacute;naiste for the umpteenth time that this has been a massive debacle which continues unabated.  The secrecy associated with it continues too because neither the T&aacute;naiste nor the manufacturer can guarantee that those meters will last a day beyond 15 years.  She should not therefore tell me that the &euro;50 million annual expenditure is a ball of smoke when she cannot guarantee that she will not have to spend a further &euro;500 million to replace the meters.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste knows, families still present as homeless every single day.  Almost 100,000 people are on housing lists across the State, some of them for lengthy periods.</p>  <p>  Last December, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, launched a glossy, 90-page social housing strategy.  He promised that the Government would deliver 5,384 new social houses in 2015.  I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about those 5,384 new social houses promised for this year.  Unfortunately, as with so many glossy Government documents, there was very little detail as to how these units would be delivered.  The additional &euro;210 million for social housing in budget 2015 will not cover the cost of these homes.  Talk of off-balance-sheet borrowing and public private partnerships is just that - talk.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has not even told local authorities what their social housing budget will be for 2015.  If and when he does, it will take up to 15 months before any new social housing units are designed, built and tenanted.  In light of all this, can the T&aacute;naiste outline exactly how the Government intends to deliver these 5,384 social housing units this year?  Where will the money come from and what councils will benefit from them?  Can the T&aacute;naiste commit to all of these units being tenanted this year, as the glossy strategy document promises?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500019#R02600"><p>In the budget 2015 statement, the Government committed a significant amount of capital financing to a new housing programme, which is one of the biggest ever launched in the history of this country.  The Deputy is correct in saying that it is not possible to plan, design, build, fit out and hand keys over for houses within a short period.</p><p>Anybody with experience of house building will know that.  I am glad the Deputy acknowledges that implementing this extremely ambitious programme will take time.</p> <p> There were several elements to the Minister's proposals for 2015.  The first and most significant was to deal with the scandal that various Deputies in the House have raised from time to time, namely, the boarding up of perfectly good houses and apartments by local authorities when the tenancies were given up, particularly in the Dublin area.  These houses were left to languish for up to two years, and even three in some cases, before being refurbished and handed over to new tenants.  The first part of the strategy is to bring all available units up to a certain standard and hand them over to tenants, both families and individuals, who are waiting on accommodation.</p> <p> The second part is to provide finance in this regard, and that is what the budget set out to do.  Providing the budget finance is the core part of the strategy.  The Deputy spoke as if she disapproved of assisting with the direct financing, through borrowing by the State, through off-balance-sheet borrowing.  If the Deputy were to examine the facilitation of this, she might think again.  In every country in Europe with a successful house-building programme, a variety of avenues are used, including local authorities, housing agencies, housing organisations and co-operatives.  Financing is directly through the state, as in our case and as reflected in the Budget Statement, but it also involves borrowing from other institutions and borrowing through off-balance-sheet mechanisms.  I do not believe there is any difficulty with any of that.  I wonder why the Deputy sounds so disapproving with regard to obtaining additional finance to build the houses she claims she and her party are committed to building.  Unless one has the finance to build the houses, one will not even get to the starting point.</p> <p> The Minister has been meeting local authority representatives regularly up and down the country.  If the Deputy wishes, I will get a detailed response from the Minister on all the meetings he has had.  He meets the Dublin local authority officials on a weekly basis to be updated on the figures for Dublin.  The Dublin managers have produced quite a detailed map, which the Deputy, as a Dublin Deputy, might have seen.  It highlights where additional housing is to be provided, where sites are ready to go, and where sites are zoned and serviced.  Also mapped are sites where all that work would have to be done.</p> <p> Since the programme was launched, the Minister has probably done far more work than has been done by any Minister in recent years to get the greatest housing programme in the State under way and have housing delivered, from this year on, to the people on the housing list who need homes.</p></speech>

I did not write the document; it is a document of the T&aacute;naiste's Government and of a Labour Party Minister.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste to explain to us how she proposes to make good that promise and deliver the units in 2015.  If I heard her correctly, she is conceding the point that she has not a chance of delivering the 5,384 new social housing units.</p></speech>

She made the promise to provide 5,384 new social housing units in 2015 but she is not going to deliver them, yet the promise was in her document.  She might explain this to us.</p>  <p>  Irrespective of the meetings the Minister might have had throughout the country, the fact remains that local authorities have not been given their budgetary allocation for social housing for 2015.  Riddle me this: the T&aacute;naiste proclaims in her glossy document, and her press releases reiterate, her apparent concern over the housing crisis and for people who need a roof over their heads, yet when it comes to setting out the nuts and bolts of how the homes will actually be delivered, she draws a blank.  Is the T&aacute;naiste delivering the 5,384 social housing units?  Have I misunderstood her?  I understand she is now resiling from that promise.</p></speech>

I said that in the budget, which was the first part of implementing the strategy, the Government made the largest allocation of Government funding for capital and current purposes to provide families with homes.  That is step one.  Step two is actually to provide that finance.  The Deputy, but not I, quibbled that all the finance was not being provided entirely directly from Government sources and that some was to be off-balance sheet.  I suggest she go back to the Sinn F&eacute;in advisers and check how one actually builds a housing programme.</p></speech>

We know that the exit from homelessness for them is through tackling the addiction, engaging with services, and having housing plans, care plans and treatment, whether on a residential or day care basis.  When discussing this before Christmas, I stressed the need to commit to supported drug-free accommodation for those in recovery in order that they would not have to mix with those who are actively using.  One such facility not far from here was described by the 18 persons in recovery there as having been a rock of stability, but because of pressure to take homeless persons off the street, which is very important, there has been a reconfiguration and that accommodation is no longer drug free.  The changing of the culture to a mixed one has undermined the recovery journey of those in the facility, especially those who are at the early stages of recovery.</p> <p> I take no pleasure in saying that what has happened has been disastrous.  As a result of that reconfiguration, there is now widespread heroin use.  There is dealing and chaotic behaviour.  There are multiple relapses.  There has been at least one serious overdose and there are debt issues as well.  In spite of all of these warnings being brought to the attention of Ministers, Dublin City Council and the HSE, in spite of findings from a report on homelessness and addiction and in spite of recommendations from the users' forum, this went ahead.  I consider that a serious breach of duty of care to those in recovery.  Were risk assessments done and were there contingency plans in the event of this going wrong?  I ask for a firm commitment to the principle of separate accommodation for those in recovery who are drug free and those who are actively using or - the term they now use - "stable", which still means those who are actively using.  I also ask that the few who remained on their recovery journey are given proper accommodation in order that they can remain on that recovery journey.</p></speech>

In the action plan, which was introduced over the Christmas period, a very large number of additional beds were provided.  Up to the Christmas period and the end of December, not all of the beds were taken up and used.  Subsequently, as we came into January, the beds were used.  From my own conversations with the many I know who work in this area, the initiatives, such as the night caf&eacute;, the bus and the transport supports, seem to have helped significantly those who, unfortunately, are out of home and on the streets.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan correctly identifies drug addiction and substance abuse issues as being at the heart of many of the difficulties with which those in that unfortunate position must contend.  I do not know if the Deputy named the institution.  I am not aware of exactly where she is referring to, but if she would give me the detail, I will undertake to have a look at the situation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised an important point, and it is a very difficult point for those dealing with both homelessness issues and addiction issues.  Different organisations in this city and the country have different approaches.  For instance, in the Coolmine centre in my constituency and in town where it also supports various facilities, no doubt the approach is for addicts to become substance free and then to enter into an intensive programme of therapy and rehabilitation.  There are also other approaches which involve addicts being on a controlled intake, most frequently of methadone.  In the context of not knowing exactly the location or the institution of which the Deputy speaks - I would be happy to talk to her about it in private - I am not quite sure what the situation is.  However, for quite a lot of homeless persons, having others, some of whom may exhibit difficult behaviour and may have mental health issues, come into their space in a situation where, with difficulty, they are addressing their issues is certainly a difficult issue to address.  I understood that the different organisations, under their different remits and mandates, were approaching it in line with their particular philosophies.  If Deputy O'Sullivan believes that some group has been impacted on in a negative way by that, I would be happy to ask the organisations and the Departments perhaps to have discussions around it.</p>  <p>  On Monday last I visited one of the community employment schemes which assists persons.  There are 1,000 ring-fenced community employment places in the Department of Social Protection with which we support, throughout the country but particularly in the larger cities and towns, those who have substance abuse difficulties and who are rehabilitating.  Some of those places are entirely drug free.  Others have a different policy, for instance, to allow for methadone maintenance along with treatment.  It is a very important issue and I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500021#T00300"><p>One of the issues in respect of what the T&aacute;naiste said relates to staffing.  There has to be properly trained and adequate staffing in these places which are taking in homeless persons who also have addiction issues.</p>  <p>  I refer to a couple of points made by somebody who was living in that hostel.  He was a heroin addict for a long time and 15 years on methadone.  However, two years ago, because of going into a treatment centre, he became drug free, and for the past 20 months he has been alcohol and drug free and living in this hostel.  He makes the point that the past month, when all of this reconfiguration was being discussed, has been the most difficult and challenging.  He states that the change has left many at great risk and that the timing of the changeover was disastrous, given that it was at Christmas which alone presents a high rate of relapse.  His great fear is for his fellow addicts in the house, that someone will lose his or her life through relapse.  He states that he has been through many services in his time and has learnt what works and does not work, and the house where he resides is a perfect example of what does not work.  He attends 12-step meetings which tell him to avoid persons, places and things connected to drug use, and that has been impossible to do with the reconfiguration that has taken place.</p>  <p>  We accept that there are different models for recovery.  Harm reduction has a place.  Giving the homeless a bed has a place, but they have to be fearless going into a place to take up that bed.  However, the harm reduction model cannot be at the expense of the recovery model.  I ask that the recovery model is what we aim for.  Harm reduction has a place but not at the expense of recovery for addicts.</p></speech>

Given my experience down the years and knowing many who have made that journey as well as many now working in the sector, I agree that such is the best model.</p>  <p>  On the organisations which are involved in delivering the services and the decisions they make around how they approach that, something I would like to see developing more strongly is that when addicts are clean, aside from being in hostel accommodation, which should be a transitional phase-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste will recall that the D&aacute;il resolution to establish the convention committed the Government to respond to each of the recommendations within four months of publication and to schedule separate D&aacute;il debates, yet the Government has failed to meet the deadline in regard to four convention reports on which we still do not even know the Government position.  The deadline on extending the vote to citizens resident outside the State passed on 26 March 2014.  The deadline on the three final reports of the convention passed almost six months ago.  When will the overdue D&aacute;il debates on the right to vote and on D&aacute;il reform on economic, social and cultural rights take place, and when will the establishment a second convention be scheduled?  When will the Government make the position on the recommendations known?  By the way, that is not the same as asking when referenda might be held, as the Taoiseach has already told us that nothing more will be done by this Administration in that regard.</p>  <p>  My second question relates to the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.  The Bill completed Committee Stage in April 2009, nearly six years ago, and it has still not reached Report Stage.  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, asked the Taoiseach about the matter in October 2014 but the Taoiseach knew nothing about it.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be more helpful.  It is interesting legislation which also introduces some of the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal.  Could the T&aacute;naiste explain the whereabouts of the Bill and the reason for such a lengthy passage of time without a conclusion to the Bill?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste's response is facile, in my view.  There are four reports outstanding from the Constitutional Convention.  The matter of the convention has been raised repeatedly at meetings of the Whips.  With all due respect to the Government Chief Whip, it is not his fault nor the fault of the Whips that the reports have not been forthcoming.  It is our clear understanding that they are not forthcoming because the Departments have not given them the priority they deserve.  The Government, who set all the deadlines in respect of the Constitutional Convention and who established it with great fanfare, is now sailing very close to the wind in terms of what I would regard as the contempt with which it is treating the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.</p></speech>

noting:&mdash; the deplorable overcrowding being experienced in hospital emergency departments;

&mdash; the record number of patients waiting on trolleys;

&mdash; the further delays in scheduled hospital treatments that will result from such overcrowding; and

&mdash; the failure of the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE) to adequately prepare for a situation they fully expected to happen;agreeing that:&mdash; the overcrowding crisis is causing an intolerable risk and danger to patients;

&mdash; patient dignity is being compromised;

&mdash; there are insufficient beds and front-line medical staff to treat the increased number of patients needing admission; and

&mdash; the crisis is being exacerbated by the number of patients clinically discharged who cannot leave hospital because the Government and the HSE is not providing sufficient nursing home beds or home care support; andcalls on the Government and the HSE to:&mdash; immediately provide beds and increased frontline staff so that the overcrowding can be eased; and

&mdash; restore the number of beds funded under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to at least the level supported in 2013.</p></speech>

&quot;acknowledges:&mdash; the difficulties which overcrowding in hospital emergency departments (EDs) causes for patients, their families and the staff who are doing their utmost to provide safe, quality care in very challenging circumstances;

&mdash; that the Government regards trolley waits of over nine hours as unacceptable and that optimum patient care and patient safety at all times remain a Government priority;

&mdash; the wide-ranging set of actions which are being put in place by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to achieve improvements in the delivery of emergency care; and

&mdash; the targeted, integrated approach being adopted by the HSE in relation to the needs of elderly patients who no longer require acute care;notes, in particular:&mdash; that all hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care;

&mdash; actions being taken to address ED overcrowding, including the opening of additional overflow areas, the reopening of closed beds, the provision of additional diagnostic scans and consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system;

&mdash; other actions being taken, including the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Nursing Homes Support Scheme places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams;

&mdash; that the Minister for Health convened the Emergency Department Taskforce to find long-term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits; following an initial meeting last December, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of January to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015;

&mdash; that the Government has made provision for a welcome increase in the total financial resources available to the HSE in 2015; this increase in funding, which is comprised of additional Exchequer funding of &euro;305 million, increased projected once off revenues of &euro;330 million, and minimum savings of &euro;130 million in areas such as procurement, and drug and agency costs, is part of a two year programme to stabilise and improve health funding after seven years of significant retrenchment as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation the Irish State has had to address;

&mdash; that in 2015 the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is &euro;949 million and this is supporting over 22,300 people in residential care; the budget for community services is &euro;315 million and this is providing home help and home care package services to some 56,000 people at any one time;

&mdash; that the Government provided additional funding of &euro;3 million last December and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges; this funding is being targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timelines for admission from EDs and waiting lists; this has reduced the waiting time for approved applicants from over 14 weeks to 11 weeks currently;

&mdash; that the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently underway will consider the future funding and sustainability of the Scheme as well as how

community and residential services are balanced; this Review will be completed shortly, following which the Government will be considering how best to meet the needs of older people in the future; and 

&mdash; that the long-term solution to the problem involves a shift from worsening ill-health in our population to greater well-being through societal change supported by Healthy Ireland initiatives on obesity, smoking, alcohol misuse and greater physical activity; andsupports the Minister for Health in his continued determination to bring about improvements in urgent and emergency care services. &quot; &mdash; (Minister for Health)</p></speech>

According to the Irish Medical Organisation in its 2015 budget submission, acute hospital budgets have reduced by 29% since 2007.  There has also been a loss of 15% in staffing levels and 900 beds have been taken out of the public system over these years.  All of this is occurring at a time when we have an ageing population which, understandably, brings new needs in terms of health care services.  At this time the fair deal system has been capped and the inevitable consequence is the additional pressure of acute hospital beds being occupied by people who should be in step-down facilities.  Not only is there overcrowding in emergency departments, but also because of this there is an increased risk of infection which adds to health care costs.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, staff at Naas General Hospital decided to work to rule and the nurses at that hospital have repeatedly told me they feel the environment is unsafe.  Overcrowding means they have the added concern that their nursing registration is being compromised.  The hospital in Naas is not an exception, but it does accommodate a higher proportion of patients who should fall into the fair deal scheme, largely because there are a large number of nursing homes in the catchment area.</p>  <p>  On paper the strategy of postponing elective surgery might seem like a good solution, but it is poor medical practice and will add to the levels of illness in the population and the stress for those waiting for an operation and waiting to go into recovery, which is just as important.  It is plain cruel.  We need to stop having to resolve a crisis and start planning to ensure we do not have a crisis.  More beds will simply have to come into the system and the fair deal scheme will have to be delivered in an entirely different way.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;2.7 billion was cut from health during the recession.  Last year alone, approximately &euro;660 million was cut by the Government and 2,000 beds have been closed.  It was inevitable there would be a bed crisis and an accident and emergency department crisis over Christmas and the new year.  We have seen up to 600 people on trolleys and a two-week cancellation of all procedures.  It is probably the worst crisis we have had, given there was no flu epidemic or vomiting bug, and it was purely due to cuts.  There is no solution to this, except for austerity in the health service and everywhere else to be ended and for investment to be made to provide the extra beds, nurses and other health staff needed.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed the Minister is not here.  I did some investigating this morning and was genuinely shocked to discover our local hospital, Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, is the worst in the country.  I have figures for January, since the Minister returned from holidays and has had time to deal with it.  On 7 January, 37 people in Connolly Hospital were waiting for a bed and for admission.  This was the second worst situation in the country.  On 8 January, 38 people were waiting for a bed there and it was the worst situation in the country.  On 9 January, 41 people were waiting for admission to the hospital, with 19 people on trolleys and 22 people on the wards.  How sickening for nursing staff to hear the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, state they should put their shoulder to the wheel and take an extra two beds into wards when 22 extra beds are already in the wards in Connolly Hospital.  Nurses have been driven out of the health service, their wages have been cut and their conditions have been made worse, and now we have the idea they should bear the brunt, when it is not the case it would solve the crisis.  Connolly Hospital scored top of the league again on 13 January, with 35 people still in the accident and emergency department.</p><p>People in Dublin West would have thought that with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for - so-called - Social Protection and the Minister for Health, our hospital would have been in safe hands.  There were huge public meetings in Dublin West before the previous general election - the biggest meetings I have seen in the area on any topic - when the accident and emergency department was threatened with closure.  That was under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and all sorts of promises were given by the Ministers, Deputies Burton and Varadkar, that this would never happen again.  We now find out that Connolly Hospital has the worst record in the country despite the Minister representing that constituency.  It beggars belief that he is not here to answer on that issue.</p></speech>

It is strange that it was not properly foreseen and, if it was foreseen, that nothing was really done about it.  The terrifying question, which was asked, I think, on "Morning Ireland" the other day, which has been asked ever since and to which we have not got a satisfactory answer, is whether the accident and emergency departments are safe.  Eventually, I think, we got an answer, which is that they are in fact not safe in their present situation.</p>  <p>  Given that accident and emergency departments, which are the main point of contact between the public and the hospitals, are in absolute and total chaos, there is no meaningful organisation, they are understaffed and there are inadequate resources to deal with people coming in, one wonders what is happening behind it.  To me this is like pus coming out of a body.  Given the problems that exist at the initial point of contact which cannot be managed, one wonders what is happening inside.  It indicates to me that the entire health system in this country is pretty sick.</p>  <p>  Nobody has been able to tackle the issue in any adequate way for at least 15 years.  One wonders what is going on.  Is it political control?  Is it some sort of extraordinary disease that has infected the hospitals?  Is it inertia?  Is it a massive bureaucracy, sitting on top of some particularly fine hard-working nurses and front-line people, but in control?  From time to time the revelation comes to us that this system is utterly and totally dysfunctional and we are using sticking plaster to address the system when there is a public outcry.  This is what has happened here.  The numbers have been reduced pretty quickly from, I think, 600 to 300, but they will increase again shortly.  The outlook is not in any way perspicuous until it is fundamentally tackled.</p></speech>

We know the knock-on effects, which have meant people being delayed in getting treatment they are awaiting.  We know there have been warnings and there has been the certainty that things would get worse.  We do not seem to be very good at prevention in this country and there seem to be issues around Christmas time and staffing problems, which if addressed could have prevented this situation escalating.</p>  <p>  We know one of the issues is delayed discharge to nursing homes, and this is at a time when there are nursing home beds unoccupied.  In addition, some people present at accident and emergency departments needing minor procedures that could be looked after by their doctors or in primary care centres.  There is a solution there.  We know the solution is more investment in community services.</p>  <p>  We have a major alcohol and drug addiction problem in this country.  We know that between a quarter and a fifth of beds in accident and emergency departments and hospitals are taken up by people who have addiction issues.  People who present at accident and emergency departments, drink-fuelled, drug-fuelled or a mixture of both, provide very challenging behaviour for staff.  They also cause great anxiety and stress, particularly for elderly people in accident and emergency departments.  Alcohol addiction is an illness and these people need treatment, but there is a need for a separate facility because sometimes they just need a space to sleep it off or be hydrated.  I acknowledge what Beaumont Hospital does in trying to link people in with services.</p>  <p>  I mention intellectual disability in accident and emergency departments.  These are vulnerable people, particularly those with autism, who are very sensitive to noise and light and cannot cope with accident and emergency departments.  Equally there is an issue with ageing people with an intellectual disability and the problems that come with ageing.  As a result of the moratorium and the cutbacks, they are going in there.  There is no registered disability nurse in accident and emergency departments who could support these people.  Equally, with the cutbacks there is nobody from the community organisations who could act as support for those people.  We need to look at having the right staff to support those two particular groups.</p></speech>

We have also had a record number of people on trolleys in recent days.  We have seen further delays in scheduling hospital appointments which will result in more overcrowding.  We also have the failure of the Government and the HSE to deal adequately with the problem.</p>  <p>  This is a national emergency and something we have to deal with.  We cannot hang around on the issue for any longer.  Two things will resolve the issue, as the Government knows.  We need to provide more beds and increase front-line staff immediately to ease the overcrowding.  We also need to restore the number of beds funded under the national home support scheme to at least the 2013 level.  While there are other issues, those are the two key things if we are serious about resolving the issue.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 6 January, the nursing home sector surveyed 442 private and voluntary nursing homes to ascertain the number of unoccupied beds.  Within the 277 nursing homes that responded to the survey, 1,261 beds were unoccupied.  While we all recognise it is a complex problem, there is another angle.  If hundreds of people are stuck in accident and emergency departments and we have these wealthy private hospitals a kilometre or two away, why are we not looking at using them in times of crisis, with their plush accident and emergency departments and empty beds?  Why do we not look at that as part of the strategy?  When in a crisis or a battle, it is necessary to look at the serious options as well.</p>  <p>  It is also important to look at the issue of delayed discharges from hospitals, which is being ignored by many people.  The figure for delayed discharges from our hospitals was 782 in October, rising to 800 during December.</p>  <p>  In addition to criticising the Government, I have also outlined some ideas to get on and deal with the crisis in our accident and emergency departments.  Let us have a bit of respect for patients and particularly for senior citizens and those with intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that there has been a major problem since the Christmas period in the accident and emergency departments at all hospitals.  I welcome the action taken in recent days which has seen the problem reduce dramatically.  The Minister, the HSE and the emergency department task force are meeting to address it in the short term initially and then obviously in the longer term.</p>  <p>  I have also seen the extreme trauma and stress that patients, their families and the front-line staff are experiencing in the accident and emergency departments.  I recently visited Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar and saw that at first hand.  I commend the nurses and doctors on the extreme efforts they are making in difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  While Mayo General Hospital has been no exception to what has gone on in recent weeks, over recent years Mayo General Hospital has done very well in reducing the problems in the accident and emergency department even though it has been taking increased numbers since the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital closed.  That was on reduced budgets and increasing numbers.  I commend the hospital manager, Mr. Charlie Meehan, and all his staff on their efforts in doing that.</p>  <p>  Having listened to the debate over the past 15 minutes and last night, it seems to be a question of throwing money at the problem.</p><p>Mayo General Hospital managed to reduce the queues at the accident and emergency unit over the past couple of years on reduced budgets.  </p> <p> This is a problem that has been around for 15 years and that was overseen by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government, and by Fianna F&aacute;il as the major part of Governments over ten of that 15 years.  It was with some disbelief that I saw this motion being tabled, even though it gives us all a chance to discuss a problem that needs to be solved.  During that ten-year period the country was awash with money, and the conception and birth of the HSE came to pass.  Layer upon layer of management positions were filled, yet during the worst period, from 2004 to 2006, patients in accident and emergency departments were afraid to ask to be brought to the toilet because their trolley would be occupied by another patient when they came back.</p> <p> The Minister has been criticised for his lack of action on this.  What I heard him outline yesterday and in recent days was far better and more effective than 147 reports costing &euro;1 million, about which nothing was done.  </p> <p> I want to be balanced about this.  There are many factors contributing to the problem, such as delayed discharges and an aging population.  Health is, by its nature, a demand-led service, and as a result it is very difficult to decide on budgets to solve the problem.  I have spoken in the Chamber on a number of occasions about the Fair Deal issue.  There was an increase in the waiting time from five to 17 weeks last year, and there is a need to remove the cap, which would free up hospital beds.  I understand that 40% of beds in step-down facilities in Mayo are occupied by people waiting for clearance for the Fair Deal scheme.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p> Long-term solutions need to be put in place, such as providing primary care centres - I am glad to see three will be provided in Mayo, starting this year, in Claremorris, Ballinrobe and Westport - and community care packages so that patients do not have go to accident and emergency departments but can avail of a safety valve to give them the best treatment outside of these departments.  I look forward to the short-term and long-term solutions to come in the near future.</p></speech>

It is a crisis.  I walked around Naas General Hospital one Tuesday and saw the trolleys in the accident and emergency department.  I spoke to the staff and management.  The issue is not simple and straightforward.</p>  <p>  This is a Fianna F&aacute;il motion, but the first trolleys in Naas were seen when Fianna F&aacute;il came to power in 1997.  The then Minister promised to get rid of them within two years, but actually increased the number of people on trolleys.  It disgusted me yesterday to see him in the middle of the INMO demonstration.  He stood tall; I think he stood on the 147 reports he commissioned and did nothing about during his time as Minister for Health.  He and another former Minister, Brian Cowen, set up 107 forums, but nothing was acted on.  It is ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il should bring a motion such as this before the D&aacute;il Chamber today, when it was in power for 14 of the 17 years since the first person was on a trolley, and that it should speak to us in a high-and-mighty manner about the issue.  At least we are trying to do something about it.</p>  <p>  I commend the staff and administrators in Naas General Hospital for the work they have done to try to deal with this.  It is not an easy thing to deal with; it is complicated.</p></speech>

Maybe the Deputy should learn from us, rather than from the lessons he has from the past.</p>  <p>  I will deal with a couple of issues which arose from my discussions with the staff and administration in the hospitals I visited.

There is a new term, "transitional patients," which refers to patients who have not made up their minds whether they should go into a nursing home or are capable of looking after themselves.  It is an issue that has not been dealt with.</p>  <p>  Naas General Hospital has the ability to recruit extra staff, which I welcome.  It is often the case that temporary staff are not available over the peak Christmas period or during bank holidays.  Having permanent staff is welcome, but there is an issue with the national recruitment service.  We might consider reinstating the group system or having a local system.  I note Tallaght Hospital recruits its own staff directly.  It is important that other hospitals have the ability to do that.  </p>  <p>  Consultants in most hospitals do a round once a day.  There are opportunities to discharge patients throughout the day.  There should be an onus on consultants to increase the number of times they do their rounds; perhaps they could do them twice a day.</p>  <p>  One issue no one has mentioned is the fact that the EU working time directive has had an impact on hospital doctors.  It may be something we should examine to determine the implications it has had.</p></speech>

I am delighted to say that Liam Doran of the INMO is co-chairing the emergency department task force.  I would like to see more community improvement schemes being put in place.  I welcome the one that will be introduced to Naas this week, which will help to aid discharges and keep people at home.  The objective we all have is to keep people living at home for as long as possible.  The last place an elderly or sick person wants to be is in hospital.  Our objective should be to discharge people as soon as possible after their treatment has been completed.  While I welcome this debate, it is ironic that it is coming from the Fianna F&aacute;il side.  I hope the Minister will examine some of the positive ideas I have put to him.</p></speech>

I want to refer in particular to the serious overcrowding in the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, where serious difficulties have arisen.  There is a facility to admit 17 patients through the accident and emergency department, but as many as 40 patients awaited admission last week.  Extra resources are urgently needed, and I will discuss how the situation developed.  The issue is one of capacity, rather than discharge.  The capacity is not available in accident and emergency to deal with the number of patients now presenting there.</p>  <p>  There is concern that the wards into which people are being moved from accident and emergency on an urgent basis because of overcrowding do not have the necessary apparatus.  They are not designed for the issues that have arisen in terms of the difficulties patients are experiencing.</p><p>There is a new accident and emergency department being built with 35 beds, and there are 17 beds at the moment.  It has been recognised that there is a need for 35 beds.  Unfortunately, they will not come into operation until early 2016 at the earliest, so there is an urgent need with regard to ensuring resources and staff can be applied to the current accident and emergency department.</p> <p> How did this arise?  We have known for some time that there was a lack of planning.  When the reconfiguration process occurred, 18 beds were removed from Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's Hospital at Limerick to the University of Limerick hospital but there were no facilities to respond to this.  If work is being doubled for an organisation, resources must be applied to respond to it.</p></speech>

There is an issue regarding appropriate funding for health services and that is what we should discuss.  The Opposition should be talking about solutions.  We should bear in mind that 2,000 beds have been taken from the health services in the past number of years but because of the professionalism and dedication of the vast majority of people working in health, we have not seen "crisis" or "dysfunctionality".  Those buzzwords used by the Opposition are completely inappropriate.  Bed stays for acute admissions have been reduced, along with elective admission bed times.  A large amount of work has been transferred from inpatient to day care within our acute hospitals and all of that has contributed to major efficiencies that can now be seen in our health services compared with a number of years ago.  We still need more consultants, nurses, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists.  We must also invest in ambulances, accident and emergency departments, community hospitals, mental health teams and home care packages.  We need more medical cards and we should invest in primary care and the infrastructure of health services in general.</p>  <p>  In the course of this debate there has been nothing from the Opposition that would even remotely approach a solution or something useful that the Minister of State would actually go to the trouble of noting while listening to the usual rants.  I heard interruptions coming from Fianna F&aacute;il today but they were not as bad last night, so maybe the Members were not here.  They forgot to include an apology to the Irish people for being contributors to the vast majority of the problems in our health service right now.</p></speech>

It is good to have such debate and air issues, as the health system is very important.  There are different aspects to the matter.</p>  <p>  I will quote a former health Minister from the Opposition side of the House who I agreed with.  The debate was approximately seven years ago and the then Fianna F&aacute;il health Minister indicated "there is no single solution to the difficulties" in accident and emergency departments.  He was perfectly right.  People keep talking about the question of funding and there is also the matter of staffing.  Other aspects include a change in the nature of Irish society, as has been mentioned, as there are more older people and they are living longer.  That is a good development but it brings its own difficulties.  I mention it as a debate such as this is always useful.</p><p> Regarding the NHS in Britain, while not everyone would agree, certainly the NHS would be put forward by many as the best system in the world.  If we think we have difficulties with the issues we have at the moment, one should have a look at what our neighbour is going through, which puts us pretty far down the queue.</p> <p> It is important to resource the health system.  Very seldom would I praise the Progressive Democrats, alive or dead, but when there was a Progressive Democrats Minister for Health, to her credit, she multiplied funding for the health system by a factor of three, and we all know what that did.  It did not solve the problems, so it is not just a simple matter of resources.</p></speech>

If one considers that some of these people are terminally ill, oncology patients and so on, it really puts into context why we need to deal with this issue.  I have no doubt this is top of the agenda.  The Minister for Health, in his contribution, put his finger on it.  The problem of patients on trolleys is a manifestation of symptoms, concerns, issues and problems elsewhere in the health system.  In my experience of dealing with constituents, I am glad to say that when people actually get into the public health system, they have many good things to say.  We all know that delays and waiting times to get into it are the problem.</p>  <p>  The other issue is clear.  Listening to people talk about the situation in other hospitals, whether Mayo General Hospital, Beaumont Hospital or St. James's Hospital, it seems there are different dynamics, different problems and different issues to be addressed, so one size does not fit all in regard to resolution of the problem.</p>  <p>  I have to compliment the management and staff of Mayo General Hospital.  Since this Government came into office, it has made serious inroads into addressing issue of people on trolleys.  Through various measures taken between 2011 to 2013, there was a 64% reduction in that period in the number of people waiting on trolleys, including bed management, looking at step-down facilities and so on.  At that stage, the national average reduction was 20%.  However, we have a problem now and it continues to flare up.  I have no doubt that in the short term, with the sort of resources the Minister has said will be put into addressing this, there will be an abeyance of the problem but an abeyance does not mean it will not flare up again because there is an underlying problem.</p>  <p>  There is a problem in Mayo General Hospital with delays in discharging patients, but Deputy Neville referred to a problem with capacity.  There is a serious problem with capacity, aside from the issue of delays in discharging patients.  There has been the massive increase in the number of people presenting to emergency departments.  The emergency department in Mayo General Hospital was designed to deal with 20,000 patients per year but is now dealing with 35,000 patients per year.  Some of this is down to the closure of the emergency department in Roscommon hospital.  This is borne out by evidence of the addresses of people presenting at accident and emergency department in Mayo General Hospital.  Many of these people are coming from Roscommon.  Many of the additional people presenting are elderly people with chronic illnesses.  The business of addressing the problem is beyond delays in discharging patients.  There is simply not enough capacity.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a business case is being made to the west-north west hospital group through the HSE on behalf of Mayo General Hospital to provide additional capacity in the emergency department and also to provide additional medical beds.  If we cannot plan for this, I do not think we will ever get the bottom of the problem.  Will the Minister make funding available for this?  The idea of the hospital trusts is that the medical needs going forward would be catered for in particular areas.  I would like to see this made a reality and funding for an extension to the hospital provided.</p>  <p>  The issue that needs to be addressed is why people with chronic illnesses are presenting.  It would seem that under the strains and burdens of the budgetary cuts that have taken place, we need to refocus funding.  I know it is the buzzword but we really need to see this happening on the ground, with primary care, community care and home care packages being provided.  These are the sorts of supports people need in their homes in order that chronic conditions, which we know will not be cured, can be managed.  People could stay in their homes and would not be going into acute hospitals.  We all know of the issue with the fair deal scheme.  We have a number of district hospitals in my county.  Previously, &euro;300,000 was granted from the special delivery unit which allowed ten beds to open.   That really helped the whole trolley situation in Mayo General Hospital.  We also have Swinford and Belmullet district hospitals.  Approaching this at either end will lead to a solution.  I would like to see specific actions in regard to the problem in Mayo General Hospital.</p></speech>

I would like to raise a number of issues specific to University Hospital Galway and the accident and emergency department there.  The good news is that additional capacity will come on stream over the next year to 18 months as an extension is built, but we are looking at an immediate problem with the temporary loss of bed capacity which needs to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  There are three issues which really affect, and which are somewhat unique to, the emergency department in University Hospital Galway, including the staffing level.  The management have acknowledged, and the nurses say, that there is a staffing shortage in the hospital.  There was a commitment to hire a large number of nurses to help deal with the shortage, but that has not fully exhausted the panel that is available and we need to do a lot of work to get that done.  The staff-to-patient ratio in University Hospital Galway, which has the second busiest emergency department in the country, is behind other emergency departments, and that is a serious problem.  Another issue is the building, the actual physical infrastructure of the emergency department in Galway.  The Minister for Health, after a discussion with me, accepted that it is not fit for purpose, is not medically safe and is something over which we cannot stand.  We need a commitment in the very near future that, in the HSE five-year capital plan, a new emergency department for University Hospital Galway will be provided.  That is not a luxury or something we might do.  It simply must be done for the medical needs of the patient.</p>  <p>  I welcome the offer the Minister for Health made yesterday when he said that the external hospital review and process improvement group, which is currently in hospitals in Dublin, could be made available to University Hospital Galway to look in its processors and how it deals with the systems in the hospital.  It was something the nurses' representatives, who are working so hard and so diligently in the emergency department, have asked for, namely, an external review to get the best possible use out of the resources they have, the unfortunate site and footprint in which they operating and how they can deal with it in the short term to make the best possible use of resources.</p></speech>

According to trolley watch yesterday, the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar had three individuals on trolleys in the emergency department and a further nine in wards.  I have been informed the three individuals in the emergency department were there from 8 a.m. and were cleared by lunchtime.  Since Christmas, I have visited the Midland Regional Hospital on three different occasions and I am delighted to see work has now commenced on the new accident and emergency unit in Mullingar, costing &euro;6 million.</p>  <p>  The reality our hospitals face is clear.  There are a number of patients in hospital beds who need that extra week of rehabilitation or respite and these patients should be transferred to step-down clinics before returning home to their loved ones.  St. Joseph's care centre in Longford is a fine example of a care facility that could be more fully utilised.  St. Joseph's is located outside Longford town and it is a prime location, right in the heart of the midlands.  The standard of care and the quality of staff is excellent.  All of its facilities have been purpose-built for care, but currently a considerable percentage of the wards on the campus are being used for storage and office space.  The facility already has a GP out-of-hours service and several other services.  If this facility were to become a step-down clinic, it would undoubtedly free up a large number of acute beds in the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.</p><p>Using St. Joseph&rsquo;s as a full-time set-down clinic has been proposed several times over the years and most recently at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of Longford County Council.  I urge the HSE&rsquo;s midlands regional manager to urgently take up this proposal, which I have been making for some time-----</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will take this on board if the HSE does not do so.  I thank the current Minister and the previous Minister for Health for investing heavily in the fine facility at the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.</p></speech>

As Deputy Maloney said, it is almost an annual event; sometimes it takes place more often.  I compliment Deputy Kelleher on the way he has sought to identify the issues and for proposing this debate.  It gives us an opportunity to identify the problems and try to find solutions, in so far as we can.  I want to do so in a constructive way.  Deputy Twomey said a lot about hearing little from the Opposition.  I listened to the debate over the past two days.  I do not think we talked about the dysfunction of the health service because there are some really good practices and people who work exceptionally hard.</p>  <p>  There is a shortage of funding, and it is a matter for the Government to prioritise how that funding is spent.  The Minister looked for &euro;100 million this year in addition to what he got last year and he was given &euro;25 million, while the Government used the money for tax cuts and other measures.  That was a Government decision to use funds that could have been used to alleviate this crisis.  The Government has to decide what kind of health service it wants.  Does it want to meet the needs of the people or does it want to buy the next election by dangling tax cuts and other offers as it did in the past?  That is where I am critical of the political approach.  I will not criticise the staff or, as the Government parties did when they were in opposition, suggest that we have a Third World health service.  I hope the Government sees that is not the case.</p>  <p>  We have heard the standard bluster in debates here.  The press or research offices within Fine Gael and the Labour Party issue the doctrine to the backbenchers: deny there is any great problem, and start talking about the people who were in government last and their record.  While Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, between 2001 and 2010, it produced a report entitled Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You in 2001.  The document contained 121 recommendations, 97% of which were introduced during that period.  There was a 55% increase in the number of patients treated; investment in community services; investment in, and development of, a cardiovascular strategy which saw the life expectancy of men and women increase by two years during that period; and a cancer strategy with investment in treatment, infrastructure and the model of care whereby people were treated more quickly by multidisciplinary teams.  That was recognised internationally as having a major impact on treating the disease at a time when the incidence of cancer was growing significantly.  There was investment in maternity and other infrastructure around the country, including the mid-west, the east coast and the Cork region.  Nursing was dealt with and the degree course was introduced.  There was some work done on primary care, although much more needs to be done.  The Fair Deal scheme was introduced and the National Treatment Purchase Fund was introduced to deal with backlogs at certain times of the year.  It is a bit nauseating to hear that Deputy Lawlor has been running around the hospitals.  God knows what he has been doing visiting hospitals over the past few weeks.</p></speech>

I recognise that has to be done, but I am at a loss to understand how he has been able to telescope all the work done over the past ten years.  What was done then dealt with the problems that arose.  I am not suggesting that the problems cannot be dealt with now, but it requires effective action and for the Minister to come forward with ideas rather than saying &ldquo;Look at what ye did&rdquo;.  We can stand on our record.  I am not suggesting there were no problems year on year, but they were addressed in so far as was possible.  That required investment.  I hate the line &ldquo;Money was thrown at it in the good times and that did not work.&rdquo;  It did work.  If that structured investment had not taken place, the health service would not have met the increased demand and the complexity associated with the new levels of treatment.  The long-term metric that must be considered is that life expectancy has increased for men and women by two years.</p></speech>

It now has the capacity to invest in a structured way, because there is more money available, yet the Government refuses to do it.  An example of that is the Minister&rsquo;s failure to get the additional &euro;75 million he needed, which would have dealt with the crisis.  That comes on top of the promises made.  The Government dismantled the HSE, saying that was the big problem, because it was an easy one to sell to the public.  It said that if it got rid of the HSE and all the layers of management and brought the system back under the Department&rsquo;s control, all would be well.  That has not worked and will not work.  It said it would deal with the funding problem through the introduction of universal health insurance, which initially was to be based on the Dutch model.  Then there was to be a bit of the Danish model.  Then Angela got a phone call from Enda and there was going to be a bit of the German model, because maybe that would help.  We have ended up with the Fine Gael model, which is to deny there is a problem, when that does not work, deny it again, and when that does not work, blame the previous Government, saying it did nothing but write reports and deliver nothing, denying the facts absolutely.  The latest is to tell us what it is going to do after two more elections, well out into the 2020s.  It says that if the people trust it as they did in 2011, some time by 2030 it will have the problem solved.  The Irish people will not buy that canard again.  If they look at the promises the Government made prior to 2011, such as "Abolish the HSE and everything will be fine," they will see that they failed.  The Taoiseach said &ldquo;I'll end the scandal of patients on trolleys.&rdquo;  He put it on a poster, in case people might not know about it.  That has failed.</p>  <p>  The former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, said we would never again see 569 people on trolleys on a single day while this Government is in office.  That could be factually correct, because maybe we will never see the day when there are exactly 569 people on trolleys, but we have seen 600 while this Government is in office.  The current Minister has said we may see more.  I would love to hear how the Government will deal with that, rather than its criticism of the actions taken to resolve the issues between 2001 and 2010.</p>  <p>  To help Deputy Twomey, I will be constructive.  The Minister could deal with investment for the accident and emergency unit in the mid-west.  If he got rid of the procurement rules, that department would be up and running more quickly.  On the Fair Deal scheme, he should stop expecting people to pay for the first 15 weeks of care in a private nursing home - &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 that they do not have available to them.  That is a fairly straightforward way to get 800 people out of acute facilities who have been medically discharged and do not need to be there, creating space for people to move through the system.</p></speech>

Last week, 601 people lay on hospital trolleys.  That is a new record.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I know the Minister of State's colleague - the senior Minister - does not do constituency tours.  Something tells me that will change in the future.  He was invited to visit the regional hospital in Mullingar last week by a local Fine Gael councillor.  He did not accept the invitation.  I would like to share my experience of what I witnessed after I was invited to visit the hospital by the relatives of patients and by staff in the hospital.  I witnessed total pandemonium.  It was appalling.  Every bed was full.  Trolleys occupied by elderly men and women congested the corridors.  The relatives of many patients stood beside them and held their hands to comfort them because they had not seen anybody for a number of hours.  Many patients had no curtains, no privacy and no dignity.  The doctors and nurses who were scurrying around were doing their damnedest to provide a level of care.  Quite simply, an insufficient number of staff was available to deal with the quantity of patients who presented themselves to the accident and emergency department.  Phones were ringing.  The waiting room was full.  Children were crying.</p> <p> We expect people who need treatment to come to accident and emergency departments.  They expect to receive comfort and a level of service.  I witnessed something that was more akin to a field hospital in a war zone.  I do not mean any disrespect to the staff who are doing their damnedest when I say that.  The Minister of State and her colleagues are presiding over this health service.  They have been presiding over it for the past four years.  These problems are not exclusive to Mullingar.  One of the nurses who attended yesterday's small protest said that it is completely unacceptable for an elderly patient to lie on a trolley for days with no access to toilet or washing facilities, having been assessed in an area where a curtain was not available to cover him or her.  The Irish Medical Organisation has said that elderly patients who are sick and vulnerable are now afraid to turn up at accident and emergency departments.  This is appalling.  It is a sorry indictment of the record of the Minister of State and her party in government.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, spoke yesterday about what happened 14 years ago.  His comments offered little comfort to the families of patients who are lying on hospital trolleys, to the patients themselves or to those who have been on waiting lists for many years.  The elective surgery waiting list increased by 20% last year.  The number of people who have been waiting for more than a year for an outpatient appointment increased by 385%.  I know an elderly man - he is 80 years of age - who has had to give up driving because his cataract is so bad.  He has been waiting for over two years for that cataract to be removed.  This has eradicated his independence.  He has been left alone in rural Ireland.  I am talking about what is happening now, rather than what happened 14 years ago.  The Minister for Health failed to acknowledge in his contribution yesterday that the first accident and emergency consultants to be appointed outside of Dublin were appointed by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  He did not mention that the number of patients treated by the HSE increased by 50% between 2000 and 2010.</p> <p> It amazes me to hear officials and Ministers justifying this problem by saying it is seasonal.  They say it is happening because it is winter.  One would think winter comes once in a lifetime.  Winter comes every 12 months.  We are back discussing the same issue every winter.  The Minister and the Department are failing to prepare.  Last year, my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, repeatedly warned that the decisions being taken by this Government would have consequences.  He said the decision to reduce fair deal funding would have consequences.  While I acknowledge that an additional &euro;25 million is being provided this year, it is a long way short of the &euro;101 million required by the HSE.  Nine nursing home beds are lying idle in a nursing home in Mullingar, which is in my constituency, because the fair deal funding has yet to be improved.</p> <p> I would like to inform Deputy Bannon, who claimed that just three people are lying on hospital trolleys at the regional hospital in Mullingar, that 33 people were lying on hospital trolleys when I visited that hospital last week.  The number of patients being treated at the hospital has increased dramatically in recent years, following the downgrading of the hospitals in Navan and Roscommon.  We used to hear the mantra that the money would follow the patient.  I acknowledge that the management and staff of the hospital are working very hard to provide a level of care there.  Deputy Lawlor spoke about doing the rounds more than once a day.  That is all very well if there is somewhere to discharge the patient to.  Given that the fair deal scheme is not working, people are being left bed-blocking.  It is a bad term to use because the people in question have not chosen to be left bed-blocking.  They cannot leave the hospital because they have nowhere to go.</p> <p> I know of a person with a disability who was medically discharged on 30 December last, but the disability services have nowhere for her to go.  The bed capacity at the regional hospital in Mullingar has decreased by 20 since 2010.  Deputy Bannon was right when he said there is room at St. Joseph's in Longford and St. Mary's in Mullingar.  Nobody is making the funding available, however.  Sixty fewer front-line staff have been working at the regional hospital in Mullingar since the introduction of the moratorium.  Is it any wonder that the level of absenteeism is so high, given that the people who are working at the hospital at the moment are being put to the pin of their collars to try to provide a level of service over which they can stand?</p></speech>

I want to focus in my remarks on the impact these difficulties are having on Letterkenny General Hospital, which is in my constituency.  The staff of the hospital - the nurses and doctors and their managers - have been doing their absolute utmost over the last two weeks to try to deal with the increasing pressures they are encountering day in, day out.  The number of people on trolleys at the hospital has decreased to just two today, thankfully.  The number in question was 11 yesterday.  It was 15 the day before that and it was 19 on Monday.  Last Friday, it was 23, with a total of 31 waiting.  It has decreased now because all other scheduled operations in the hospital have had to be cancelled.</p>  <p>  I will give the Minister of State an example.  A man in his early 70s has been waiting two years to have his hip done.  He is in exceptional pain.  He had an appointment for such an operation cancelled once previously.  It has been cancelled again in the last week to allow those who are coming through the doors of the hospital's accident and emergency department to be accommodated.  His plight pales by comparison with the plight of many exceptionally sick people who are coming through those doors to look for help.  They are hoping for assistance because they are more vulnerable than they have ever been in their lives.  The doctors and nurses who want to be able to assist them are not able to take them inside, give them beds and treat them as they require.  Instead, these patients have to wait hours to be seen.  They have to wait hours not to get a bed but to get a trolley.</p>  <p>  All of this comes down to the Government's unfortunate decision not to fund the hospital system properly.  It has failed to ensure sufficient nursing staff, doctors and beds are available to deal with this crisis when it arises.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, spent three years blaming the previous Government for the difficulties in the health service.  I see he has moved on from that in the last week.</p><p>When challenged in the past week about his promise that never again would we have 500 people on trolleys, he moved on from that excuse to blaming the new Minister.  He stated that he knew nothing about it and would not be able to answer questions and that the questioners would have to ask the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  The current Minister's policy seems to be that, if he tells us something will be bad before it gets bad, it might be regarded as competence.  Indeed, it is a relief to many after having Deputy Reilly telling people for three years that everything would be okay.</p> <p> The reality has been different.  Instead of dealing in the budget with the many people who have been waiting weeks for fair deal scheme approval so that they might leave hospitals and free up beds, the Government chose to spend the extra funding available to it on other issues, for example, reducing the top rate of tax by 1%.  Services, beds, doctors and nurses for the elderly and sick in, for example, Letterkenny General Hospital's accident and emergency department were not chosen.</p> <p> I will highlight two issues that present particular difficulty for Letterkenny General Hospital.  When there is a national staff shortage, it is more acute in regional areas.  Letterkenny General Hospital is dealing with this crisis.  Although it has approval for 16 medical registrars, it only operates with six.  This is the result of mismanagement, in that the hospital service did not ensure staff were in place in time to assist in the crisis.  Due to the failure of the Ministers, Deputies Reilly and Varadkar, to ensure that the management was in place to deal with the situation, the hospital is stretched.</p></speech>

Shortly after Christmas, I was invited by a constituent to speak with her 82 year old father, who had been languishing for 48 hours on a trolley in University Hospital Galway, UHG.  Deputy Nolan from Galway aptly and bravely described it as an unacceptable public service for the people of the west.  The 82 year old had been sitting there because, having waited since 2013 for an outpatient appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon, he had developed symptoms as a result of the pain relief he had been managing for more than two years since reluctantly presenting at an accident and emergency unit.  He was reluctant because he did not want to die in an accident and emergency unit.</p>  <p>  He and his family were shook and felt betrayed because he had contributed to the State for 82 years.  He left school as a child, paid his taxes and created employment but, in his hour of need, the State reneged on him.  His family was quite disturbed by the surroundings, as described by Deputy Nolan.  The service in the reference period was shocking.  As I drove into Galway city, I was appalled to hear about the significant recovery that was taking place in the country - a tax profile that was &euro;1.2 billion ahead of target - because people were subsidising it.  That 82 year old man was subsidising it by having to wait two years just to find out that he had to wait a further two years for a procedure.  This is his social contract.</p>  <p>  The human cost of our accident and emergency units is just a symptom of a broader problem that has been described by all Deputies and one with which the Minister of State is familiar.  I do not dispute that she has a handle on the problem.  Significant harm is being done to vulnerable people, particularly senior citizens, who must present at accident and emergency units because of a collapse in aspects of primary care, for example, home help, a lack of beds and the fair deal scheme, an issue that was ignored in the House in November.  There was bed capacity in Galway during the reference period, with 157 beds available for discharge.  This capacity could have been used to alleviate the dire situation at UHG.</p>  <p>  The voices of the elderly man and the accident and emergency unit's staff are not being heard.  Clearly, this situation has not emerged from nowhere.  We knew about it since September when we held a debate in the House and forecast that this would happen.  The Minister of State probably sensed it herself: she has been a Deputy for long enough.  I do not mean that disrespectfully.  It is an annual debate.  We did nothing to prevent this situation from arising.  The task force only sat on 23 December and the actions agreed at that meeting were never implemented.  Subsequently, the Minister went on holidays.  He was entitled to do so.  I will not reduce the debate to that issue.</p></speech>

Needless to say, we knew that the crisis was happening.  So did SIPTU and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  They have been highlighting the situation since September.  It was no great shock that this was coming down the line like a train.  However, these people's views have been ignored.  This is of great concern, as we did not take the opportunity in December to prevent what happened this month.  It will continue happening year upon year.</p>  <p>  The Minister took his three days off.  Unluckily for him, the decisions made on 23 December did not materialise during his absence in terms of the cancellation of electives.  This has caused a significant problem.  When he returned, his first act was to attack the staff.  It was their fault and they should have put their shoulders to the wheel to resolve the situation.  I am disturbed by the trend of attacking front-line staff.  For example, Deputy Twomey attacked staff for taking sick days or time off.  They work in a labour-intensive environment.  Staff at UHG report to me that they cannot take their statutory rest periods because of chronic understaffing and the need to be present, as Deputy Troy described, to ensure service delivery for vulnerable people.  I am concerned that such staff, who are working in difficult circumstances, have not been respected or acknowledged by the contributions of Government Deputies during this debate.  The Minister's contribution the minute he got off the aeroplane was particularly patronising, in that he stated that staff should put their shoulders to the wheel, as if to claim they had not already done so.  Since September, the INMO and SIPTU had been highlighting the emerging crisis.  Ironically, there was subsequently a range of ballots across accident and emergency units.  What the Minister stated was not good management and showed poor leadership.  This condescending attitude has added to the impetus for industrial action and is counterproductive to the necessary resolution.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will agree that we are trying to shove through the eye of a needle the consequences of significant cutbacks in primary care.  There is no integrated, strategic plan for managing home helps and home care packages with a view to keeping people out of accident and emergency units.  As has been described, the consequential bed crisis is multifaceted.  It is a capacity issue, in that we do not have enough beds for the number of people presenting at accident and emergency units.</p><p>This is causing a significant problem, not least for the staff of these units, who genuinely care about the delivery of services and better outcomes for vulnerable people.<br/><br/>It has been suggested here today that the Opposition does not have any solutions to the problems in our health service.</p></speech>

That it has not done so is a decision made by this Government and nobody else.  In recent months we have seen senior Government Ministers celebrating the wonderful tax returns.  Some of them were just short of somersaulting naked down Grafton Street.  The reality is that those returns are being subsidised by the 600 people languishing on trolleys in hospitals throughout the State.  That is what is happening here.  As I said, this is a capacity issue, and the beds could be opened if the resources were made available.  I hope the Minister of State is successful in securing those resources.</p>  <p>  If we can open the beds, we then have an opportunity to look at other issues such as the terms and conditions of employment of nurses, which have been shattered by this Government.  We subsidise nurses' education only to see hundreds of them boarding aeroplanes to Britain, the United States and Australia because the Government has completely destroyed their terms and conditions of work in this country.  There is a solution to be found there.  I assume the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in his veiled reference to people needing to put their shoulders to the wheel was referring to hospital consultants rather than nurses.  I certainly hope so.  Why then is he inviting consultants to have the first go at the trough, thereby ensuring the well-paid are further well-paid while nurses are left with their yellow-pack terms and conditions?  There is no consideration for these vital staff who are working on the front line.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Government must protect jobs in the public service.  I am hopeful that the quality of Minister of State's contributions in recent weeks materialises in terms of the actions required to develop a modern and effective primary care service, which would go a long way towards keeping vulnerable citizens of this State out of our accident and emergency units.  In an interview on Newstalk in recent days, she referred to the capital programme for senior citizens and additional beds for elder care.  That programme should be accelerated.  These are the types of solution we are urging from this side of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500032#EE00400"><p>I will begin by addressing some of the points raised by Deputies opposite.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made reference to people with disabilities, addiction problems and dementia or Alzheimer's disease and the confusion that reigns when they have to attend at emergency departments.  Last Tuesday in the Mater hospital, together with the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive, I launched national guidelines on accessible health and social care which will see extensive training given to staff to help them to recognise that people with certain difficulties may have a problem understanding questions or instructions and ensure those patients are treated in an appropriate fashion.  That type of work is going on behind the scenes all the time.</p>  <p>  Deputy Finian McGrath suggested that opening up nursing home beds would solve all our problems.  I agree it would solve some of them.  However, we do not want a situation in which people in Dublin North, for example, are offered a bed in a facility at the furthest edge of Kildare or Kilkenny.  I am not saying they are not nice places, but they are not very appropriate in terms of patient comfort, accessibility for visiting family and so on.  We have beds, but they are not always where we need them to be.  That is a difficulty we will have to resolve.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding claims to that effect, the problems in our emergency departments are not all down to late discharges.  The numbers in that regard change regularly.  The current difficulty in emergency departments is a combination of factors.  For instance, I was informed recently by a person who advises the HSE that the uptake of the flu vaccine this year is much lower than it was in previous years.  We need to start asking people to get that vaccine.  As sure as night follows day, there is a flu outbreak on the way.</p>  <p>  Turning to the motion itself, I am keenly aware of the issues raised and have listened closely to the concerns and frustrations expressed by Members in regard to the number of patients on trolleys, the overcrowded conditions in which they must wait for treatment and the associated difficulties in moving patients from acute care to long-term community or home care.  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, spoke in detail last night about the wide-ranging actions and integrated approach being taken to managing these issues in order to improve the delivery of emergency care and meet the needs of elderly patients in a responsive, controlled and planned manner.  I am particularly struck by the work of the community intervention teams to help older people avoid hospital admission and facilitate early discharge, which is essential in assisting them in returning to their own homes.</p>  <p>  On the third Thursday in April 2014, there were 309 patients on trolleys, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  On the equivalent Thursday in 2011, there were 383 patients on trolleys.  This morning, there were 316 such patients.  This illustrates clearly that this is not a new problem.  Moreover, it shows that the current emergency department situation did not happen overnight.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister that local leadership, comprising staff, unions and management, with a common view of the issues impacting on their hospitals and an equally common desire to address those issues, is the key to providing an effective and sustainable response.  It is appropriate to acknowledge that through the hard work of hospitals, supported by other HSE services, HSE management and the Department, we have made significant inroads on numbers in the past week.  The engagement of senior hospital consultants, GPs, unions, senior HSE and Department managers, our incredible workforce of nurses, and the emergency department task force co-chaired by the general secretary of the INMO, all working together, has given a focus to the issue and driven momentum towards finding both short- and longer-term solutions to deal with trolley waits.  Consultation and partnership with primary, community and ambulance services mean we are now addressing access to urgent hospital care in a comprehensive manner, which has not been seen before.</p>  <p>  The &euro;3 million funding allocation given in December 2014 and the &euro;25 million allocated in 2015 to address delayed discharges have resulted in 300 extra approvals under the nursing home support scheme, a reduction of six weeks in Fair Deal approval times, and the provision of 50 additional short-stay beds, a further 65 transitional care beds and 389 additional home care packages.  I am pleased to state that, at this time, no patient who has received approval for home help or home care is waiting for funding for these services in order to be discharged from hospital.</p>  <p>  I conclude by reiterating that the problems we have seen in hospital emergency departments are not caused just by the number of elderly people awaiting discharge.  It is much more complex than that.  I would hate the message to go out from this Chamber that the only people responsible for this particular issue are the older patients who are being cared for in an environment in which they do not want to be and should not be.  I would appreciate very much if, instead of repeatedly tabling motions on health, Fianna F&aacute;il would come up with a policy on health.</p></speech>

Several speakers urged that this issue not be used as a political football and that we avoid point scoring, playing on people's unfortunate circumstances and so forth.  The Taoiseach stated boldly before the last election that he would end the scandal of patients on trolleys.  Immediately after the election, his appointed Minister for Health said that never again would there be 569 people on trolleys on any given day while this Government was in office.  The then Minister made that statement in what appeared to be a most sincere fashion.  He looked into the camera and made a firm commitment to - almost a contract with - the Irish people that this would be the case.</p><p>It is unfortunate that members of the Government now say the Opposition should not use this issue as a political football for point scoring.  Those statements came in 2011 just before and after an election.  We must remind people, by placing on the public record, again of many of these and other commitments that have not been honoured by this Government.  They were probably never going to be honoured by the Government.  Against the background of a massive national and international economic collapse, the incoming Government played on people's fears, using and abusing those fears.  The Government now hopes and expects that these commitments can be wiped from recent history.  The final third of the fiscal rectification necessary had been completed and put in place before they assumed office.  Despite having voted against it at every opportunity and ridiculing what it contained, they now want the plan to be the catalyst for retaining power at the next election.  </p> <p> They gave a commitment that bondholders would be burned.  The current Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, gave a commitment that not another red cent would be paid to banks.  He is the straight talker who has proven to be nothing more than a commentator during this sorry debacle.  We were told that there would be a democratic revolution and that there would be no guillotines.  Deputy Fitzmaurice has spoken lately of turning the system upside down, but that is the sort of rhetoric we heard from this Government prior to the last election and on assuming office.  We were also told there would be no increase in third-level fees.  </p> <p> In June 2012, the Government said there would be retrospective recapitalisation of the banks, which would be the game changer to allow this country to prosper and obtain the recovery it deserved.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as we heard last weekend when that was slipped into the rhetoric.  The Government now wants us to believe there will be full employment by 2018.  They say that USC rates will be drastically reduced and that the top rate of tax will also be cut.  They say there will be a second pre-school year for children and that they will abolish the public sector pension levy.  In addition, they say a five-year plan on taxation will be published in April.  These are the new pipe dreams.  It is the new virtual reality being given on the back of a lorry in Roscommon by many members of the Government.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is a republican party that fights for constitutional republicanism.  It is committed and dedicated to the bedrock which established the State, including the Proclamation.  We believe in fairness, equality and equal opportunities in education, as well as the provision of care for the sick and elderly, and security for all the country's inhabitants.  That is what republicanism is about.</p> <p> This Government would have us believe that the recovery is ongoing and the emergency is over.  Unfortunately, however, that recovery is not evident in my constituency or in many others.  It is not evident in hospital accident and emergency departments throughout the country, nor when 1,400 places in the fair deal scheme are slashed.  Neither is it evident when community care facilities are diminished, nor when home help hours are being slashed.  It is not evident when we see the slow place in rolling out primary care centres, or in the manner in which ambulance personnel are asked to work.  It is not evident in the lack of funding made available for house adaptation grants for the disabled and elderly.  They are told they will have to wait from three to five years before their applications are adjudicated upon.</p> <p> If the emergency was truly over, we could afford the necessary staffing levels for hospitals, and many of the issues I have mentioned could be addressed also.  If the emergency was truly over, the Government would abolish the USC, which was an emergency tax for an emergency situation.  If the emergency is over, why does the Government not abolish the USC and stop talking about it?  They cannot do so, however, and they know it.</p></speech>

They think they can stand on the back of a lorry every second week.  The Government's credibility has been shot on these and many other issues.  Whether the election is in one week, a year or in 15 months, the Government will be found out in that regard.<br/><br/>I note that Dr. Crotty, a consultant haematologist in Tullamore and a spokesperson for the consultants and physicians, and the INMO, have said that when they see patients on trolleys they lack privacy, confidentiality and dignity.  It also threatens patient care.  Dr. Crotty claims that studies show mortality rates increase by up to 30% in such circumstances.  When in Government, my party did not build state-of-the-art hospitals, such as the one in Tullamore, for the Minister of State and her colleagues to allow a situation whereby patients are faced with the risk of a 30% increase in mortality because the 11% rise in patient numbers has not been matched with adequate staff.<br/><br/>To return to the issues of equality and fairness, they offer equal opportunities in order to help people to achieve their dreams.  The Minister of State referred to problems in employing hospital staff.  Over the Christmas period, I received a letter from a constituent, as follows:<blockquote>Dear Barry,<br /><br />There have been changes to the benefits applicable to single parents whose child is seven or more.  These changes mean that I may have to drop out of my midwifery course and become long-term dependent on the State.  Until the changes, a single parent could return to full-time education, retain a single parent allowance and receive the maintenance grant, subject to the means test.  Such parents took on their courses on the basis of the supports existing at that time.  They had worked out that the grant would make it possible to cover the cost relating to return to education, such as travel, books, accommodation and child care.  They had a legitimate expectation that these supports would not be pulled once the course had begun.  Under the changes, single parents already in full-time education whose child is seven or older in July 2015 must change their single parent allowance to the back to education allowance, which is the same amount.  But they can no longer receive the student grant.  Or they can keep the grant but lose their other payment. </blockquote>This lady only became aware of this when she visited her local citizens' information centre recently.  She will lose her grant after July 2015.  Subsequently, believe it or not, it was suggested to her on the telephone by a social welfare official that the way to retain her payments was to have another child.  She would then have a child under seven and would not be affected by the new rules.<br/><br/>Her letter continues:<blockquote>I am studying to be a midwife and there is an acute shortage of these professionals at this present time.  I did a year on the back-to-nursing course and am now in year two of a four-year degree course in Trinity.  I love my course and cannot wait to be a qualified midwife working in Ireland and off benefits.  However, the rule changes mean that I cannot continue.  I live with my mother in Portlaoise and commute to Dublin by train daily while I have lectures.  I cannot afford to live in Dublin and, in any case, my daughter is settled in school in Portlaoise and my mother cares for her when I am away.  Any financial support I get from the father of my child is intermittent.  I will get a grant of &euro;5,915 until the end of this academic year.  It just about covers the cost incurred by returning to full-time education.  Apart from my travel costs, I have to pay &euro;50 a week for accommodation while I am on placement in the maternity hospital I am assigned to in Dublin.  I also have to eat out when living here, as there are no cooking facilities.  My mother, who is separated, cannot help financially.  I am repaying a loan I was forced to take out when my grant was paid late.  The loan is at very high interest rates, as normal lenders would not accept me.</blockquote></p></speech>

We were accused of playing politics by putting down this motion, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>Highlighting the concerns of society and the front-line staff who work in our emergency departments over patient safety and dignity is not playing politics.  The Government was playing politics when it pretended it was going to solve all the problems.  It made promises to this effect, and that is playing politics.  It is pretending it is going to do something it has had no notion of doing.  That is what is disingenuous in this whole debate.</p> <p> The Taoiseach said he would end the scandal of people of trolleys, but, of course, he did so in advance of the election.  The previous Minister for Health fell into the camera with the usual ould tear saying he would resolve this issue, and he said there would never again be 569 people on trolleys.  The bottom line is that there were; there were 601 people on trolleys.  What is even more disturbing is that the Government knew this would happen and did nothing about it.  Therefore, I am not playing politics with the matter at all; I am just highlighting the Government's inability to deal with a crisis it knew full well would happen at some stage.  It was warned that there was an impending crisis over delayed discharges by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, who took up his new portfolio last July.  He was warned in November that there was an impending crisis because of delayed discharges and the lack of funding for the fair deal, home care packages, step-down facilities and home help.</p> <p> The bottom line is that the politics being played is being played on the Government side.  There is but one thing, and one thing only - spin.  There is absolute spin on a continual basis.  Week in, week out, 300 to 400 people are on trolleys, yet the Government has tried to convince everyone here that it is on top of the problem.  It was not until the number on trolleys in emergency departments reached 601 that it was realised there is a crisis in emergency departments throughout the country.  Front-line staff have been saying this for years, as have Opposition Deputies, consultants and people dealing with the coalface.  The Government has been telling us the contrary consistently.</p> <p> Farcically, in March 2013 Government Deputies tabled 43 questions on waiting lists and 17 on the trolley count to applaud the Minister and give him a clap on the back.  He was trying to convince us he was getting on top of the problem.  That is how farcical circumstances were.  That is playing politics.  I certainly do not believe that my highlighting the issue everybody else is talking about, particularly when it involves the compromise of patient safety, is playing politics.  The Taoiseach stated in the Chamber only yesterday that patient safety was not what it should be.  We tried to interpret that in a number of ways but the bottom line is that he was trying to absolve himself from anything that may happen or could have happened owing to overcrowding in emergency departments.  The buck has to stop with somebody.  The bottom line is that there are not adequate resources being put in place.</p> <p> It has been said nobody should blame the old person in the hospital for taking up the bed.  Of course nobody is blaming the person in the hospital for taking up the bed.  What we are doing is pointing the finger quite clearly at the Government and HSE for not ensuring there is a proper bed to which a person can go, such as his own bed at home if there are home help hours and a home care package.  However, if the patient is incapable of going home and requires full-time nursing care, he should be in a residential unit or step--down facility rather than a hospital in which he does not want to, and should not, be.  </p> <p> Our duty is quite simple.  It is to highlight the fact that the Government has played politics with health services for years.  The Members opposite did so in opposition and, by hell, they are doing so in government.  There is continual spin over the substance of the matter.  The Government has provided inadequate funding in 2015 under the health budget.  The only way it will get through this year is on a wing and a prayer in the hope that medical cards will be taken from people because of the financial qualification guidelines.  It is hoped those earning a little more than what is specified in the financial guidelines will lose their cards.  I cannot see any other way in which the Government will match the budget.  In the meantime, it is responsible.  I commend the motion to the House for the right reasons and hope the Government will take on board its sentiment.</p></speech>

In essence, the Deputy wants me to put into the primary statute the list of public officials.  It is better to allow enabling legislation with regard to public officials.  I have indicated what I will do at the start, but this is by no means intended to be the end of it.  From the start Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general and chief executive officers of local authorities will be covered, and as soon as may be thereafter, principal officers and other groups which we may discuss, perhaps in committee, will be included.</p></speech>

From the perspective of this side of the House, the public would much prefer to see legislation on a topic such as this being spelled out, in so far as is practical, in the primary Act and not being done through statutory instruments next July or later in the year, as people would have to go out of their way to find out whether it was commenced and who was included.</p>  <p>  Legislation which includes as much detail as is practical - I use this word because I do not seek to overburden - is better than enabling legislation, the implementation of which is left to statutory instruments.  Historically there has not been the same level of debate, if any, on the implementation of statutory instruments.</p>  <p>  There is a lack of balance on this topic as the only designated public officials are politicians.  By definition, there is a lack of balance.  There should be a commensurate balancing of the politicians with senior civil servants who, in the majority of cases, have far more influence on matters than the Minister of the day.</p>  <p>  The Minister is right when he states that under paragraph (f) he can include public servants of a prescribed description and under paragraph (g) he can include any other prescribed officeholder or description of person in due course.  He states he will prescribe some of these from the commencement of the legislation.  The Minister is almost suggesting that by including Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general and the chief executive officers and directors of services of local authorities-----</p></speech>

There are directors and technical grades which should be included but will not be captured by simply describing assistant secretaries.  It is better, I am advised formally because I have checked since we spoke this morning, to do this by way of statutory instrument where there is more scope than simply including assistant secretaries or secretaries general.  I will capture it comprehensively in a statutory instrument and will be able to amend it by other statutory instruments.  We feel the grades may change in the future and the grades outside of the formal Civil Service and the public service might need to be captured.  As we are on the same page with regard to who should be captured, I ask the Deputy to leave it to the most efficient way of doing it which, I am advised and I advise the House, is by way of statutory instrument.</p></speech>

Legislation should be as comprehensive as is practical and there is no ambiguity about the role of a Secretary General.  I understand that those at a technical grade below this grade may have a similar level of responsibility-----</p></speech>

Earlier today, I wondered whether this action plan for the Civil Service had any relevance to this topic.  Action No. 22 states the intention is to strengthen policy-making skills and develop a more open approach to policy-making, and we are speaking about policy-making and not implementation.  The document states this can be achieved by establishing the expectation that all policy officials maintain an active network of key stakeholders in front-line service delivery, academia and international administration and engage this network regularly, particularly at the early stages of policy development.  This is a great group which the Minister could bring together to help him with policy.  Inevitably the group would come with particular perspectives.  Action No. 22 is a method by which people could influence policy and it needs to be captured in the legislation.  People bringing policy to Ministers, such as Secretaries General and county managers, need to be captured in the legislation.</p>  <p>  I do not know how many pieces of legislation pass through the Oireachtas each year.  It could be between 40 and 60, but I am not sure of the figure.  I do know the number of statutory instruments can vary from 700 or 800 to 1,100 or 1,200.  The best place for people to see legislation in a transparent manner is in the primary legislation which comes through the House.  I am sure it boggles the minds of people to look at the list of statutory instruments on the relevant Department's website each year.  They can amount to well over 1,000 and it is very difficult for people to find a particular one.</p>  <p>  Secretaries General and their equivalents, such as county managers, should be included in the legislation because it is not balanced to list only politicians as those who can be lobbied and to whom the legislation will apply.  It would be fairer to the public service, and would send it a clearer signal from the House, to state Ministers and Secretaries General are included.  If the Minister wants to include people below this of course he can do so.  To pass legislation which excludes any member of the Civil Service from being captured as a designated public official under the legislation is a mistake.</p></speech>

The position has been set out that in addition to overtly political people, we need what is often referred to as the permanent government to be subject to the provisions of this legislation also.  My amendment is an attempt to achieve that.<br/><br/>While I know the Minister is minded to deal with the matter in a different way, I believe it is preferable to at least name certain categories.  I appreciate it is not possible to have an exhaustive list in primary legislation, but, of course, the Minister has the other mechanism available to him to bolster that.  The amendment would ensure that the upper echelons of public administration - the permanent government, if one likes - are also captured within the provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

In essence, the Deputies opposite want to achieve the same objectives that I do, but they have a different way of doing it.  They want to set it out in primary legislation.  I say that is not the best way of doing it, because there are analogous grades that could not be captured and it would give the wrong signal.  It is better to state that all appropriate public servants will be captured.  From the beginning I have told the Deputies what I am going to do, and I think that is the best way to proceed.</p></speech>

(1) Where a designated public official is lobbied outside of the State, (in a manner to which section 5 would apply had the lobbying activities occurred within the State) such public official shall be obliged to register the fact that he or she had been so lobbied and the public official shall provide the necessary information to the Standards in Public Office Commission for inclusion in the register.<br /><br />(2) Provision for maintaining this category of information shall be kept in such form as the Commission consider appropriate.&rdquo;.</blockquote>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage.  My amendment No. 39 refers to a public official.  We are now only talking about Ministers and Members of the D&aacute;il, essentially - nobody beyond that.  That is all that is covered in the legislation so far, notwithstanding that some others might be listed by the Minister by way of statutory instrument shortly.<br/><br/>Where these officials as designated in section 6 are lobbied outside the State, I want a mechanism to capture that under this legislation.  Those people should register with Standards in Public Office Commission regarding any such lobbying, because the organisation outside the State might not be subject to legislation within the State.  I gave the example of the then Minister for Finance, who was lobbied in Davos by some vulture funds about the selling off of NAMA loans that they wanted to buy in bigger chunks than the lots being offered.  That will probably be remembered as one of the most serious incidents of lobbying of a Minister by a private sector company from outside the State, and that cannot be captured under this legislation.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 40 deals with a similar situation.  Again, I am talking essentially about Ministers being lobbied by an organisation from outside the State.  I again propose having a mechanism under the Standards in Public Office Commission, if it is not practical to do it under the lobbying register, to capture Ministers who are seriously lobbied by organisations from outside the State, because they can have such influence on major Government decisions.<br/><br/>I know the Minister wants the legislation to be workable; that is probably his catchphrase.  The smaller and narrower it is made, the more workable it probably becomes, but then the less effective it is.  I know there is a balance to be struck, and casting it too wide could create unintended consequences, but some of these are issues we have seen.<br/><br/>I will not labour the point about Goldman Sachs, which will be putting documentation together for the Minister that may constitute lobbying when it comes with its perspective.  We need to remember that an organisation such as Goldman Sachs has other clients - financial institutions in America, Europe and Asia - who might have an interest in buying shares in AIB down the road.  While it is working for the Minister for Finance, it will not do anything inimical to its clients who might be interested in buying shares.  So it is not coming clean - it is not possible for it to do so.  I am not saying anything is wrong, but it is probably impossible in the financial world in which we live for people to have the level of international experience to advise a Minister on a topic such as this without having some other interests or dealing with other organisations which could have a vested interest in such a report that they would give to the Minister, because if they did not have the interests with other people, they would not have the expertise and experience to do the job.  There is an issue here and we need to see some of that captured in the legislation.<br/><br/>The essence of my two amendments is to broaden the legislation to include these two points.</p></speech>

First, it seeks to fundamentally alter the architecture of the Bill.  The Bill is predicated on a very simple structure, which is to regulate through registration and reporting requirements the responsibility of people who lobby.  So the onus is on the lobbyist - the person who is carrying out the lobbying.  These amendments reverse that and in a set of circumstances put responsibility on those who are lobbied.  That is every Deputy in this House and every member of a local authority who happens to be abroad.</p>  <p>  If somebody comes up to a public representative, either in Brussels or anywhere else abroad, and asks about anything, under these provisions, the person would have to say, "Stop.  Are you lobbying?  Are you a registered lobbyist?  Do you comply with the Irish lobbying regulations?  If not, I need your details now, so I can report you and register you."  It is just not going to happen.</p>  <p>  I ask the Deputy to consider explaining to all the Fianna F&aacute;il local authority members that every time anybody comes up to them to talk about anything that affects Irish policy, they will have to stay, "Stop.  I need to register you because you are now lobbying me abroad."  It is an impossible onus to put on the lobbied person.  The Bill is so structured as to put the legal responsibility on those who are carrying out the lobbying to be accountable and registered as lobbyists.</p>  <p>  I genuinely do not believe this is the right way to go about it and I will not be accepting the amendments.</p></speech>

We are doing constructive work.  We are not excluding senior public servants.  I want to include them in a different way, something which I told the Deputy and which he accepted.  One minute he says he accepts my bona fides that this will happen by way of statutory instrument because it is a more effective way of doing it, but the next he wants to make a silly political statement to the effect that I am excluding them all.  I am telling him, de facto, on the record of the House, that I am going to include them.  Why would he stand truth on its head?  There is objective truth.</p>  <p>  In regard to this issue, which is lobbying, he can see the practicality of including every Member of the D&aacute;il.  Has he run this past his parliamentary colleagues?  Every time they go abroad they will not be able to have a discussion with any foreign colleague.  When they go to the Council of Europe and somebody talks to them about public policy here, they will be required to register as a lobbyist.  That is so impractical and silly that it should not be done.  The Deputy knows in his heart that it is not practical to do that, but he is trying to create some sort of political statement that this is not an effective Bill.</p>  <p>  I have been trying for ten years to get the register of lobbyists done, and the Deputy's Government resisted it.  It voted down a version I presented, and twice voted down a version presented by Deputy Rabbitte.  This is a good stab at addressing the issue.  It examines best international practice and exhaustive discussions were held with stakeholders in order to develop as good a Bill as we can.  It is an effective and good Bill.</p>  <p>  I reject the notion that the Deputy is trying to include a list of things by way of exclusion, and that somehow implies this is an ineffective Bill.  It is not fair to the volume of work that has been done by Members of the House, the Deputy included, to put that construct on it at this late stage of the debate.</p></speech>

I have a public record of supporting the principle of the Bill on Second Stage and did not vote against it on Committee Stage.  I do not propose to vote against its passage on Report and Final Stages.  All I am saying is that the Bill, while good, is too narrow.  Given that we have gone so far to introduce the Bill, we could have done a little bit more to make it broader.  My argument is not about the need for legislation.</p>  <p>  I agree with what is in front of us, but it would be better if there was more substance in it from day one.  Every amendment I tabled has been specific and was an effort to improve and broaden the Bill.  Very few of my amendments propose to delete anything in the Bill, because I am happy with what is in it.  I want to include extra provisions, such as public bodies and lobbying.  The Minister said this is a first effort; let us see how it goes after a year.  I will not oppose the principle of the Bill or what is in front of us, but we could be doing a little bit more.</p></speech>

My amendment proposed to strike out the definition, but having reflected on this I want to withdraw the amendment and adopt an approach of adding to, rather than striking out, that provision.  Deputy Fleming has tabled a set of amendments, which are grouped with mine and which I now withdraw, which seeks to do just that.<br/><br/>I recognise that one could not be absolutely exhaustive in the Bill, because the Act would be like a telephone directory if one attempted that.  Invariably, something would be missed.  Nonetheless, in each of these amendments there is a good rationale for the inclusion of these bodies and for making specific mention of them in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider that and accept this proposal from the Opposition benches not as a means to try to frustrate his efforts in the Bill, but rather as an attempt to add to it.  </p></speech>

I want to go through them individually, not in an argumentative way.<br/><br/>The section I seek to amend is the definition section of the Bill, section 7.  It defines a public service body, and refers to a Department of State, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the National Pension Reserve Fund, NAMA, the National Treasury Management Agency, local authorities, etc.  It is quite a group; 11 organisations are listed.  I know it is not possible to have a final exhaustive list, but the Minister has made a fair stab at it by including 11 specific organisations, many of which are quite large.  The HSE employees 100,000 or thereabouts and is the largest organisation in the country.<br/><br/>I am not seeking to break any new principle; I just want to add to the list of the 11 organisations named.  I want to include, under the list of public bodies, EirGrid, which operates in the public interest in the same way as education and training boards or other similar organisations.  The Minister mentioned including the Revenue Commissioners.  Where does one stop in the designation of public officials?  When I referred to the Secretary General, the Minister asked where that would leave the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners.  I propose to include the Revenue Commissioners as a public body.<br/><br/>If the Revenue Commissioners is not listed as a public service body, will it be difficult to include its chairperson as a designated public official?  Secretaries General, members of local authorities, CEOs, directors of services and assistant secretaries, as the Minister has indicated in correspondence, are included.  The non-inclusion of the Revenue Commissioners in the definition of public bodies may make it more difficult to include it, even though many people believe it should be included.  How will the Minister include the chairperson as a prescribed officeholder under the Bill if he or she is not in a public body listed in the Bill?  We need clarification on that.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 45 deals with Ervia, the parent company of Irish Water.  It goes without saying that we have thrashed that out umpteen times, and it is important that it is included.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 46 deals with the Revenue Appeals Commissioner.  Will it not be possible to include it under the statutory instruments because it will not be listed a public body?<br/><br/>I have asked for An Post to be included because it has an monopoly on the delivery of post to residential addresses and normal letter post.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 48 refers to any organisation with the word &quot;regulator&quot; in its title.</p><p>That covers quite a few regulators, although I will not spell out all of them.  Is it possible to include them in the legislation?  The Minister has indicated that in due course he may work his way down to principal officers in designated bodies, Departments of the State or local authorities, but it seems that he will not be able to include the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners if that is not deemed a public body under this section.  I hope the Minister will clarify that it will be possible to include people by way of statutory instrument in some other manner in the public interest if the annual review indicates as much, but will there be a requirement to change the legislation to include organisations as public service bodies under the definition in section 7? The Railway Procurement Agency is an important organisation and it should be included, along with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> Perhaps the Minister will accept these amendments; I do not know.  How can the Minister tell us that under the definition section in this legislation, a public service body would not include An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority or the Environmental Protection Agency?  Although they are the essence of what constitutes a public service body, they are not included in the Minister's list of 11 organisations.  I am happy with those 11 bodies, but the list is too small.  I will not even respond to the Minister's words when he spoke about trying to include extra elements in the legislation, but with this set of amendments, nobody could comprehend how there could be a definition of a public service body in this legislation that would exclude EirGrid, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, regulators, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Competition Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency.  They are public service bodies.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 41 to 52 and 68 to 70 are included in this group.  At the very end of the legislation there is a list of &quot;bodies that are not public service bodies&quot;, as indicated by the heading of the Schedule as proposed by the Minister.  There may be good reason for including all of these, including commercial grounds, and I would be happy to go along with that if bodies have a commercial remit or commercial activity might be complicated on behalf of the Irish public as a result of this legislation.  It is another list of exclusions from the wonderful lobbying legislation.  Under the Schedule, there is a list of bodies that are not public service bodies, which will be excluded.  They include &quot;Any body corporate established by Act of Parliament before 6 December 1922 that, upon its establishment, was of a commercial character.&quot;  The list of bodies that will not be a public body under this legislation continues by including:<blockquote>2.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500040#OO00600"><p>I thank the Deputies opposite and I understand their points.  I listened on Committee Stage to the points about the definition of a public sector body and I thought it too narrow in the initial draft Bill.  I amended it on Committee Stage to include the 11 bodies listed by Deputy Fleming.  That is a fairly comprehensive sweep of all bodies.  The definition of what constitutes a Department of State, for example, is set out in primary law already.  A public service body is defined in section 7, and for clarity a list of bodies coming within the scope of the definition, such as Departments, is included.  The list contains the National Treasury Management Agency, the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as they come within the scope as captured by a parent Department.  The Revenue Commissioners is also captured by the definition of a Department of State.  All the subsets of Departments, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and virtually every organisation listed by the Deputy, are captured in that definition.  A public service body is one that has a pre-existing public service pension scheme, and that is the definition that captures all of those bodies.  I intend the registrar's website to list all of them, but the Deputy is correct that we would be left with a telephone directory if we were to insert that in a piece of primary legislation.  The list would not be permanent because bodies come and go, and that is why the process is done this way.</p>  <p>  This goes back to the debate on whether we should be exhaustive in a list within primary legislation or if we have a broader scope in how we capture bodies.  We would do that by using broad phrases such as "Departments of State", which are defined in broad terms, with all the agencies and sub-agencies within that remit.  The Deputy is correct that the list of included bodies would be voluminous if I listed every State agency and body to be captured.  Those to be excluded from the definition of public sector bodies are listed in the Schedule under the title "Bodies that are not Public Service Bodies".  All of them have a commercial remit but are excluded.  The reason for their exclusion is related to the point rehearsed very clearly by Deputy McDonald with regard to the debate on section 5(4)(m).  The bodies listed in the Schedule benefit from the exemption set out in section 5(4)(m), which provides that certain - although not all - communications between a body and a Minister who holds shares in or a statutory function relating to that body would not need to be registered.  The exemption is intended to cover governance matters made within the ordinary course of business for a commercial State body.  Other types of lobbying not of that ilk will be captured.  I hope that gives comfort to the Deputy opposite.  It might not be clear from a "plain English" reading.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>That is my intention.  The advice I have from the parliamentary draftsman is that intention is met in the way it is set out here.</p></speech>

I do not understand why he listed those if he is saying that any organisation under the auspices of a Department is essentially included under his definition of a Department of State.  Why did he list all these?  When I saw he had listed some, I thought we should be a little more comprehensive and listed more.  If the definition of a Department of State includes the HSE and the education and training boards, why did the Minister need to include them specifically?  I do not understand that.  The Minister mentioned that the Revenue Commissioners probably come under the Department of Finance if the NTMA does.  Why did he not list the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

If the Minister is saying An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the EPA do not need to be listed because their legal standing is captured by the parent Department, that is good.  I just do not know why they are not listed if that is not the case.  Will the Minister clarify why the NTMA, etc. had to be listed separately and other organisations did not?</p>  <p>  In regard to the Schedule, the Minister mentioned that these are exempted communications under the meaning of section 5(4)(m) which refers to communications between some of these bodies and the public officials serving in the Minister's Department in the ordinary course of business of the body corporate.  They are exempted from that as well but are the rest of their activities exempted?  To be clear, is the Minister saying that other than that exemption for corporate activities in section 5(4)(m), everything else relating to CIE contacting its parent Department will now be included in lobbying?  If CIE wants to make a point to a Minister, other than on a corporate matter, for example, a business or a commercial matter, will that be captured under the legislation?  If it is, the legislation is a bit broader than the impression I have been given, but I do not know yet. </p></speech>

In regard to the definition of what constitutes a public sector service body, it is any public body which has a pre-existing public service pension scheme.  That includes all those the Deputy mentioned.  As far as we are aware, they all have a pre-existing public service pension scheme and they are all captured.  I hope that answers the Deputy's first question.</p>  <p>  The second question related to the exemptions in the Schedule.  The interpretation the Deputy just gave is right.  I think I explained this in some detail to Deputy McDonald in regard to her amendment, but in terms of the shareholding function and corporate governance, those communications would not be subject to registering of lobbyists but normal communications outside of that would be, so lobbying outside the shareholding function, as defined in section 5(4)(m) would not be exempt.</p></speech>

Let us take Horse Racing Ireland or the national stud, for example.  I am not an expert on the horse racing industry but a large grant for the horse and greyhound fund goes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine every year.  Will lobbying by Horse Racing Ireland, the National Stud or whatever group, which wants to get a larger fund from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or a bigger share of a fund, be captured?  I can understand issues in regard to corporate governance but this is a funding issue dealing with the commercial day-to-day activities.  Will that activity be captured in the legislation?</p>  <p>  If RTE, for example, spoke to the Minister about the licence fee, would that be considered lobbying under this legislation?  It is not a corporate matter.  It does not come under the exemption in section 5(4)(m).  It affects its financial position.  Will we say that everything to do with the company is corporate and that everything is excluded?  If that is the case and all this is included, this is bad legislation.  In terms of all those bodies, is the Minister saying that the only aspect included is in regard to the corporate matters referred to in section 5(4)(m)?  I know people might find this a little bit tedious.  It deals with the business of the body corporate.</p></speech>

It is my intention that that would not be exempt but, ultimately, I cannot say that definitively because it would be a matter for the registrar.  The registrar will determine whether it is a corporate governance issue, that is, the narrowness of the question the Deputy put to me.  However, as I said, it is my intention - the drafters have assured me that the intention is met - that corporate governance matters, appropriate to the shareholder, would not be subject to this legislation but lobbying outside of that would be.  Those are the general parameters about which I am talking.  If the Deputy wants specifically to pose a question as to whether this is a corporate governance matter, I could not give him a definitive guarantee here.

This is essential information if we are to have maximum public confidence in this system as well as full transparency.</p></speech>

Account also needs to be taken of significant administrative issues in establishing consistent and comparable financial data which could usefully be included in any register.  This is particularly the case in respect of in-house lobbyists where in some instances only a small portion of their time is engaged in lobbying communication and where such financial data could not be collected.  The disclosure of financial data also presupposes that financial disclosures can give us some insight into the effectiveness of lobbying communication.  Ministers and public officials would argue there is no direct link between the amount spent on lobbying and the degree to which it is successful.  I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I believe that lobbyists could shave down the costs associated with any particular lobbying activity.

I see no valid reason to protect from public scrutiny lobbying of public officials with respect to public policy, legislative or funding decisions on the basis of adverse effect on the financial interests of the State, business interests generally - so-called - or particularly, or potential material financial loss to, or prejudice to the competitive position of, or contractual negotiations engaged in by, the lobbyist or his or her client.  If the Minister is concerned to protect those various interests, the provision in the Bill should have been drawn much more narrowly.  As it stands, one could drive a coach through this loophole.  It suggests a level of secrecy in the form of delayed public scrutiny, which is not wise.  The legislation aims to change all of that culture of secrecy and a closed atmosphere around this activity which, as the Minister has said correctly, is an entirely legitimate one and a legitimate part of the political and democratic process.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s amendment that is grouped with this one but I hope he has heard what I am saying.  I think he has the essence of my concern.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, as a small open economy it is important that we have some mechanism to protect for a period genuinely sensitive information of this nature.  The provision sets out several checks and balances to ensure that this saving provision is not misused.  The thresholds in section 1 are high, requiring a serious adverse effect in relation to section 14(1)(a).  In subsection (1)(b) the threshold requires &ldquo;material financial loss&rdquo; or to &ldquo;prejudice seriously the competitive position&rdquo;.  That is the threshold that has to be met.  The commission is obliged to consult relevant Ministers before making a decision on matters coming within the subsection.  It must also take account of the public interest in coming to a determination.  It has the option of making information available in summary form if there are some things it wants to exclude.  There is a right of appeal to an independent appeals officer under section 23 and a right of further appeal to the High Court on a point of law after that.  It is a saver clause that I am advised is necessary.  It has high thresholds and on balance should remain in the Bill.<br/><br/>In respect of amendment No. 60, section 14 provides for delayed publication in certain circumstances on foot of a submission from the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  I propose amendment No. 60 to section 14 to revert to the original timeframe of 21 days for the consideration of an application for delayed publication by the commission.  This is to ensure that there is sufficient time for consultation as required under section 14(1).  The Deputy may recall that on Committee Stage we changed this but SIPO has asked that I revert to the 21 days and I am minded, if that is what it believes it requires, to accept it.</p></speech>

I do not believe Deputies, Senators, Members of the European Parliament and councillors should be exempt from these restrictions, including the requirement on a person to obtain pre-authorisation by way of an application to the Standards in Public Office Commission if he or she wants to take up employment as a lobbyist within two years of leaving public office.  The Minister and I have debated this previously.  I reiterate that it might not be in the public interest for certain individuals to make their insider influence, knowledge or contacts available, especially to private commercial interests who might become their clients.  For that reason, I believe people in this category should be covered by the provisions of this section of the Bill.<br/><br/>I concur with the view of most commentators - certainly, most of those whose views I am acquainted with - that a two-year cooling-off period during which the law would impose restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist would provide a much safer margin to protect the public from influence-peddling for hire.  I do not believe such a longer period would be excessively onerous; indeed, it would be especially reasonable given that the Bill does not impose an absolute prohibition but rather makes provision for the conditional or unconditional consent of the Standards in Public Office Commission in appropriate cases, as set out in the legislation.  I can almost pre-empt the Minister's response, which will involve what is reasonable and a person's constitutional right to work etc.  We have debated all of this previously.  While I am obviously convinced by the rights that people enjoy, I am not convinced that two years is excessively onerous.  I suggest such a provision would be safer and much more clearly in the public interest, particularly as it is not an absolute express prohibition - it is just two years of conditionality.  If the Minister cannot agree to accept this amendment, perhaps he will agree that we should keep a very close eye on this matter.  I think we should maintain a watching brief in respect of the 12-month review.</p></speech>

While it is right and proper to constrain people's rights in order to impose restrictions on post-term employment on relevant designated public officials, those constraints must be proportionate, must not trample on people's rights and must be practical to operate.  The categories included in the list are Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and public servants of a prescribed rank.  I think what I am suggesting in the Bill is the right way to deal with this.  I think the one-year cooling-off period or timeline that is proposed is an appropriate and practical provision.  I will be anxious to see how it works out.  This is the first time such restrictions have been brought in.  If we feel they need to be adjusted over time, that is well and good.  I think this is a very good starting point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500044#SS00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Customs Bill 2014 was published on 3 October 2014.  The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, revise and modernise Ireland's existing national customs legislation, some of which dates back to the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.  The Bill can thus be seen as another significant milestone in Revenue's comprehensive programme of consolidating and modernising our tax and duty legislation.  Deputies should note, however, that this is not a "standard" statutory consolidation of the existing customs legislation.  Instead, it includes the two additional elements of revision and modernisation that were necessary to cater for developments in trade and in technology over the last almost 140 years.</p>  <p>  The principal domestic legislation under which Irish customs operate is the 1876 Act.  That Act has been extensively adapted over the years to take account of various events and developments, for example, the foundation of the State in 1922, Ireland's joining of the EEC in 1973 and the introduction of the EU Single Market in 1993.  As a consequence, many of the provisions in the Act are of doubtful validity, yet they still remain on the Statute Book.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of other Acts concerning customs matters were also passed in the intervening period, for example, the Customs Act 1956 and the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988.  Numerous Finance Acts have also introduced customs measures, as have a number of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  The result is a complicated, overlapping structure of old and newer national customs legislation that can be difficult to follow and understand.  The Customs Bill is designed to address this issue.  When enacted, the Bill will repeal the old structure with a single, much shorter Customs Act that will be clear and easy to understand and access.  This consolidated approach, which is in accordance with the requirements of better regulation, will result in much clearer legislation in the customs area to the benefit of all.</p>  <p>  Deputies should be aware that there is also a European dimension to this matter.  The EU customs legislation, known as the Community Customs Code, directly provides most of the legal framework for customs, including the rules relating to rates of customs duty in different circumstances, customs valuation, the form of declarations and so on.  As a consequence, national legislation is now needed only in respect of those areas that are not already covered by Union legislation.  Typically, these include certain control provisions, enforcement provisions and sanctions for breaches of the various customs provisions.</p>  <p>  This trend can be seen in the structure and the much smaller size of the Customs Bill.  The bulk of the material in the Bill reflects a small core of existing legal provisions relating to customs now updated, of course, to reflect modern language and terminology.  This includes certain controls and procedures that are not included in Community legislation, mainly relating to arriving and departing aircraft and vessels; specifying the various offences that arise in a customs context, for the most part involving smuggling; specifying the penalties associated with these offences and the procedures to be followed in court proceedings; and providing the necessary powers to customs officers to enforce customs law.</p>  <p>  The Bill also includes a number of administrative and housekeeping provisions, among them the repeal and revocation of a large body of legislation, much of it of old vintage, that will become redundant upon the enactment of the Bill and its subsequent commencement.  The Bill provides for meeting a number of specific EU and international customs obligations relating to mutual assistance between Ireland and other member states and to centralised customs clearance.  The Bill also carries forward the existing customs appeals procedures.  Deputies might note that the new legislative provisions are simply a reiteration of the procedures that currently apply.  Any change applied to the tax appeals procedures will have appropriate application to customs appeals.  The Bill also restates and modernises the existing legislation applying customs law to prohibited or restricted goods on their import into or export from the State.</p>  <p>  I will give a more detailed section-by-section explanation of the Bill shortly.  Before I do so, however, I ask Deputies to try to imagine the environment for which the original 1876 Act was designed to cater and the social and political mores of those times.  I like to think that we have moved on confidently from then.  For example, we no longer have a need for some of the more extreme powers with which customs were conferred at the time.  However, we will always have those who will try to outwit our customs rules and, therefore, not everything has changed in the Customs Bill that I have laid before the House.</p>  <p>  Before I go through the specific provisions of the Bill, Deputies might wish to be reminded of the scale of the customs operation in modern Ireland.  For example, Customs and Excise annually processes on the automated entry processing system approximately 1.1 million customs declarations in respect of goods being imported from or exported to non-EU countries.  This breaks down into approximately 600,000 declarations in respect of imports and 550,000 in respect of exports.  The most recent Exchequer figures show that customs duty collected on such imports was &euro;270 million in 2014.</p>  <p>  However, it is not just the scale of the customs operation that should be noted.  Customs and Excise also has an enviable reputation for the way that it does this business.  Deputies might like to note that in recent reports from respected international bodies such as the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the Swiss-based Institute for Management Development, Ireland, particularly Customs and Excise, scored highly in terms of ease of doing business with them.  Some of the rankings achieved by Ireland in categories in which Customs and Excise has a direct involvement are as follows: in trading across borders, Ireland scored fifth in the world and second in the EU; in the burden of customs procedures, Ireland scored eighth in the world and third in the EU; and in the efficient transit of goods, Ireland emerged as the leader in the world, beating Singapore into second place.  Deputies will agree that these rankings paint an excellent picture of the way that Customs and Excise goes about its business and that the Revenue Commissioners are to be congratulated on this.</p>  <p>  With that in mind, I will go through the Customs Bill and describe the main provisions contained therein.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Act.  Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, provide for the interpretation of certain words and expressions used in the Bill to assist in the understanding and application of the Bill, for the repeal of certain statutes and the revocation of certain statutory instruments and for a number of technical linkages to provide for legal certainty and legal continuity in the operation of the law relating to customs in respect of the relationship between the repealed enactments and the Customs Bill.</p><p>Sections 6 to 13, inclusive, deal with customs controls.  Section 6 provides for the appointment of customs ports and airports for the arrival and departure of vessels and aircraft into or out of the State.  The section also provides, for reasons of confidence and certainty, that existing appointments of customs ports and airports in the State will continue for up to five years or until fresh appointments or reappointments are made under the new legislation.<br/><br/>Section 7 provides for the approval of places within customs ports and airports for the arrival of vessels and aircraft, for the loading and unloading of goods and stores, for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and for the storage of goods awaiting customs clearance.  Again, existing approvals will continue for up to five years or until fresh approvals are made under the new legislation.<br/><br/>Section 8 provides for the control of movement of vessels into and out of the State by the Customs and Excise.  The section allows for derogation from these requirements, subject to certain conditions, in respect of instances of <i>force majeure</i>and in instances where the Revenue Commissioners grant permission.  The section provides for an offence of contravention of the provisions of the section and the penalty that will apply for such offence.</p></speech>

Many people in my constituency - and, I am sure, in the Minister's constituency - are having to put up with excessive noise and nuisance as a consequence of the misuse of scrambler vehicles and other types of motorbike.  The problem has been particularly acute since Christmas, when many such vehicles were given as presents.  People trying to relax in their homes on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning are subjected to hours of deafening noise as people race up and down the roads on scrambler bikes.  In many cases, these drivers are using the wrong side of the road and going the wrong way around roundabouts.  Some of them also do significant damage to public parks, making them places of fear for other residents rather than places where they can go for leisure, to exercise their dogs and so on.</p>  <p>  What is happening amounts to an epidemic and something must be done about it.  Some of the scrambler racers have put videos of their activities on the Internet.  I will send the links to the Minister if he wishes so he can see what is going on.  My concern in this regard is twofold.  The first is the impact of these activities on the quality of life of ordinary people.  Second, I am concerned that the wild behaviour in which some of these scramblers are engaging will ultimately result in loss of life.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these drivers generally do not have the appropriate licences and, in many cases, are underage.</p>  <p>  The thrust of the reply to the parliamentary question I tabled yesterday on this issue was that it is a Garda matter.  That is, of course, correct.  However, the garda&iacute; to whom I have spoken about the issue have indicated they are fearful of chasing these people in case one of them should be killed, in which case the garda in question will be held responsible.  There is also an issue as to whether garda&iacute; are authorised to go into public parks and chase them there.  My understanding is that they do not have adequate powers to take that type of action.</p>  <p>  It is time to consider whether anything can be done in legislation to address this problem.  I appreciate that it is a difficult issue to deal with, but I will offer a suggestion.  I am proposing that people who purchase scrambler bikes for juveniles should be obliged, at the point of sale, to show the birth certificate of the person for whom the vehicle is being bought and give evidence that this person has the relevant licence.  That would contribute towards eliminating this scourge.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500045#TT00500"><p>I thank Deputy Dowds for raising this important matter.  It is an issue with which I am familiar in my own constituency and I understand the difficulties it can cause for residents.  My area of responsibility relates to legislation concerning the use of motor vehicles, including scrambler bikes, in public places.  Enforcement of the relevant legislation, including addressing any illegal use of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The use of mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation.  The Road Traffic Act definition is that "public place" means any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles, whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.</p>  <p>  The Garda has been contacted about the issue raised by the Deputy and has stated its view that it does have the necessary powers to deal with cases concerning the use of such vehicles in public places under the Road Traffic Acts.  Based on the definition of a "public place" and "mechanically propelled vehicle" in those Acts, garda&iacute; are satisfied that road traffic law applies in public parks and the powers granted to them under the Road Traffic Acts may be exercised there.  Those powers allow members of the force to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a licence or learner permit.  If the scrambler bike is below 50 cc, the minimum age to hold a driving licence is 16 years.  For vehicles above 50 cc, the minimum age is 17 years.</p>  <p>  In addition, garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation.  The legislation makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly or drive dangerously.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that any of these charges could be brought, where appropriate, in the circumstances of misuse to which Deputy Dowds refers.  The Garda has further indicated that a prosecution could be brought in these circumstances under the Criminal Damage Act, if appropriate.  Furthermore, garda&iacute; have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and SI 89 of 1995.</p>  <p>  As the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the necessary powers exist to deal with the matters raised by the Deputy, it does not appear at this stage that any further legislative action is required.</p><p>If, however, Deputy Dowds has proposals concerning the implementation of existing laws, especially regarding public places or residential roads or where a law is not in place to deal with the matters he referred to, I would be glad to hear his specific points to see if I could be of further help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500046#UU00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I accept that the legislation is in place but I wish to raise two or three issues in this regard.  First, I am interested in what the Minister said about public parks because, in a sense, it contradicts something that was said to me by our local garda&iacute;.  I will bring this to their attention.</p>  <p>  The second problem concerns tracking down those using scrambler bikes because they are not registered.  If they were registered, garda&iacute; could photograph them and chase them up afterwards.  Since there are no registration plates on such motorbikes, it is not so easy for garda&iacute; to track them down.  That is why I specifically suggested that when somebody is buying such a bike for a minor, they should have to produce evidence to show their age and that they have a relevant licence.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that we will have deaths over this.  The Minister is well aware that deaths have occurred as a result of joyriding in cars, although I am surprised that this has not yet happened in my area.  I would be happy to show the Minister some of the videos that have been sent to me.  If he looks at them he will see what is likely to happen.  In a recent video, there were buses and cars on the road while the scramblers were going up the wrong side of the road as well as taking roundabouts the wrong way.  They also lifted the motorbikes so that only the back wheel was in contact with the road, while being videoed by the pillion passenger.  There is a real need to re-examine this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500046#UU00300"><p>I thank the Deputy and will respond to each of his points.  I take his point that this is not just a matter of inconveniencing people or affecting the domestic environment.  It is also a serious road safety issue.  I am aware of the kind of behaviour the Deputy referred to, which is a threat to people on such scrambler bikes as well as those in the vicinity.  I am also aware that in many cases scrambler bikes may be used in places that are well run by clubs.  That poses no difficulty to anybody.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said in his opening contribution, safety is the paramount issue.  In dealing with somebody on a scrambler or other motorbike in a residential area or in a public park where other people are present, including families with young children, garda&iacute; must use their discretion in responding for fear of aggravating a situation or causing further risk to others in that area.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised this issue in a parliamentary question earlier this week, to which I responded.  In anticipation of this Topical Issue matter, however, I specifically checked the definition of a public place and it includes a public park.  There is therefore no impediment to stopping illegal activity taking place in a public park.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's second point concerned a requirement to show evidence of age when purchasing such bikes or obtaining a licence.  As I said in my earlier response, there are already two different age requirements in place.  They are 16 or 17 years, depending on whether the engine is above or below 50 cc.  To obtain a licence, the individual would be required to show that he or she is above either 16 or 17 years of age, just as one has to show evidence to obtain a driving licence for other vehicles.</p>  <p>  I will take the Deputy's points to see whether that provision could be enforced more strongly or in a different manner.  Having dealt with this in my constituency, I know that Garda stations seize these vehicles and take them from people who are either too young or pose a threat to others.  I will follow up on the Deputy's specific point regarding whether this could be done in a different way or even more rigorously in order to respond to the risks he mentioned.  I will write back to the Deputy on that point as well.</p></speech>

I wish to put on the record the fact that quite frequently Ministers are not turning up or cannot turn up.  The idea of Topical Issue matters is that such matters can be taken up with the relevant Ministers.  It is something we should look at.</p></speech>

In reply to your point, I have already made it known that it is becoming unacceptable that week after week we are losing a slot.  The fact is that another slot could have been used by somebody else today.  Next week, because this matter has been postponed, only three slots will be available on Tuesday, so two slots have been lost.  My office received no prior notice that Ministers were not available.  If that had happened, and there was a good reason for it, we could have postponed the matter and picked somebody else's issue.  I am asking, on the record, for Ministers to be conscious that this is an important opportunity for a Deputy to raise serious issues.  It is a shame to be losing valuable slots like this, although I know it is not the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's, fault.  I just wanted to put that on the record.</p></speech>

I also appreciate the Minister taking time out from his busy schedule to give us a response.  This project concerns upgrading the N7, including the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass.  If the Minister does not mind, we will group them all together because in Kildare we look upon them as being part of one package.</p>  <p>  The N7 has been upgraded from two lanes to three lanes as far as Naas, but then comes into a two-lane road.  This has caused serious congestion, particularly at peak traffic times.  As a result of that congestion, there is increased traffic going through the villages of Kill and Johnstown which have been bypassed since the early 1960s.  The planning on this upgrade has been passed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la because it is a strategic piece of infrastructure.  That was welcomed last September, but we now need funding to progress this upgrade further.</p>  <p>  The economic benefit of this is quite clear.  The National Road Design Office has explained that the development is justified when it is at an economic benefit rating level of one.  The Sallins bypass is at level 17, while the Naas bypass can be up to 15.  The N7 is the second busiest road in the country after the M50.  The interchange at Osberstown has the potential to create 6,000 jobs in the north-west quadrant of Naas.  Anybody passing by can the see the development there by the Kerry Group and so the necessary infrastructure for the Osberstown interchange is vitally important in that respect.</p>  <p>  We are seeking a commitment for multi-annual funding for 2016 to 2018 because this project will take about 18 months to complete.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>This project will take about 18 months to complete.  At present, the NRDO hopes it will be able to make further progress on it.</p></speech>

His doing so is greatly appreciated because it is an issue of significant importance, not only to the residents of Kildare, including south Kildare, but also to those residents and businesses in the south of the country.  The road in question is the main artery.  As Deputy Lawlor stated, it is the second busiest road in the country after the M50.</p>  <p>  My constituents in Kildare South, including commuters from Newbridge, Athy, Kildare, Rathangan and beyond, are greatly affected by having to sit in traffic at the spot in question.  They greatly appreciate the &euro;100 million investment in Newlands Cross in that this has made part of their journey easier.  However, the solving of the problem at Newlands Cross has led to further congestion down the line.  There are three lanes as far as the big ball at Naas, from where there are two lanes.  Those commuting from Dublin to Cork and Limerick will be very aware of this.  Traffic slows to a crawl until one gets beyond Newbridge.  That is why the investment is crucial.</p>  <p>  Those affected, who must sit in traffic, include constituents of mine who are rushing home to get their children who have spent a long day in child care, in addition to business representatives and delivery staff.  There are economic, social and national arguments for securing road funding.  It is very badly needed.  From the big ball, we need three lanes all the way to the M7-M9 junction, in addition to an upgrade to the junction at No. 10, or the Bundle of Sticks, as it is known locally.</p>  <p>  To put the congestion in context, it is the equivalent of 42 vehicles sitting in traffic for 24 hours per day for 30 years.  As the country recovers and as we get more people back to work, it will only increase.  The problem is a function of recovery.  The increase in the number on the roads is a good problem to have in that so many people are back to work.  However, as road projects go, the one in question is really important.  We got planning permission at the end of last year, and now we need funding committed to it.  The project has the full backing of the Garda because there is a significant safety element, as raised during the recent oral hearings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-01-15a.630" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015011500047#VV00300"><p>I thank Deputies Lawlor and Heydon for raising this matter with me.  Both Deputies have raised it with me persistently.  They raise it continually with my Department and me to emphasise the importance of the project, both nationally and locally.  At some point in the future, when progress is made thereon, it will be in no small part due to the efforts of both Deputies consequent to their having continually raised the matter with me and my Department, and on the D&aacute;il floor through parliamentary questions and Topical Issue debates.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding regarding the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the Naas bypass widening, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. The assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  With regard to the interchange and bypass referred to by both Deputies, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Owing to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality, as I have stated publicly, is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing projects and roads while addressing the growing demand both Deputies have raised with me.  For this reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects.  The focus has to be on maintaining and repairing the existing road network.  The Deputies will be aware of the great importance of road safety, and that is why I have devoted all funds available to me to maintaining existing roads before prioritising new projects.  Only a small number of new national projects have been progressed to construction stage.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement the funds of councils.  I am aware that the projects raised, which have considerable merit, are interconnected and have a substantial overall cost. The objective of the M7 Naas bypass widening scheme is to increase capacity and to improve traffic flow on the Dublin-Cork road corridor.  The interchange and bypass schemes are intended to enhance connectivity between the M7 and the towns of Naas and Sallins.  The interchange will connect to the proposed R407 Sallins bypass to the north and the existing roads to the south.  The receipt of planning permission for these projects last September was a very positive and important development.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects and PPPs is limited.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></speech>

I understand the financial constraints the country is under but I hope part of the funding may be secured on a European basis.  Deputy Heydon will talk about this.  NAMA, which owns the land surrounding the proposed Osberstown interchange, is willing to put forward &euro;10 million towards the project there.  Therefore, there are outside sources of funding.  The project is expected to cost approximately &euro;110 million overall.  We can identify other sources for approximately 25% of this.</p>  <p>  I understand a capital programme is to be initiated shortly.  I hope the Minister will consider this project as a priority for the capital funding being proposed for the period from 2016 onwards.  At least, we might then get the project up and running.  Deputy Heydon and I may refer to the local aspects of the project but it is a national one.  The road is one of the main arteries in the country.  It is not only a national route but also a European route.  Consequently, we hope that the Minister will push the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the project when the capital programme is being analysed.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed with it and it makes me even more determined to increase the priority accorded to the project.  I accept completely the Minister's statement that he accepts its importance and that there are so many competing projects in the Department but, as he knows, there is potential to obtain European funding for the M7 Newbridge-Naas bypass upgrade scheme.  The application deadline for the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, funding for the scheme is the end of February.  The application cannot be lodged without the commitment of funds for the balance of the scheme by the member state.  Therefore, there is a minimum State requirement of approximately &euro;38.5 million.  This is the scheme cost of &euro;55 million minus the &euro;16.5 million in potential CEF funding for the years 2016 and 2017.  Approximately &euro;19 million per year would be required.  Without this, the potential CEF funding may be lost until the next application round in 2016.  I accept that the Minister's Department is tight on funds because of constraints.  This is a matter that we need to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, as part of an overall examination of capital funding for 2015 and potential stimulus programmes.  This project is of the utmost importance to the country.</p></speech>

On job creation, I am very much aware of the investment that Kerry Group is making in the millennium park which, I understand, will employ between 350 and 400 staff.  They emphasised to me directly that they believe the development of better access would be important to ensure their investment pays out and delivers what they want to the economy.</p>  <p>  I have a number of points on what my colleagues have put to me.  First, I have been informed that were we to go ahead with the interchange, it would increase traffic flow within the vicinity by approximately 8%.  Deputy Heydon correctly stated that a project such as the flyover that has been opened beyond the Red Cow can shift traffic congestion elsewhere which feeds into the concern he has with this project.  The current analysis of the projects to which the Deputies refer is that were we to go ahead with them it would be highly advisable to progress the three of them together to ensure we do not end up shifting a problem from one part of their community to another.  In order for that to go ahead, the overall cost of that project is &euro;110 million.  While they acknowledged that there could be other funding opportunities out there and I recognise that NAMA indicated it would be willing to make a contribution, there are still many tens of millions of euro that I would be required to contribute to this project.</p>  <p>  I emphasise how important I know the project to be in order to support economic development within the Deputies' region.  While I cannot give them a commitment now that it can be progressed because the Government simply does not have the funding to do it, I am aware that this project has received planning permission.  Despite all the competing demands that I must manage, I will continue to see if I can find any opportunity to progress projects that are economically and socially important.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister, Deputy White, for coming in to reply.</p>  <p>  It is a simple matter.  The prices of oil and gas have plummeted over the past few months but this has not been reflected in energy bills, that is, the electricity and gas bills that are dropping through the letter boxes of homes and business.  In fact, the opposite is true because there was a recent increase in the public service obligation, PSO, charge.</p>  <p>  From the point of view of companies, this is not acceptable.  If the price of fossil fuel had gone in the opposite direction we would be told that Ireland, as a small country with no oil and little gas, has no control over the international prices and that would be a reason for hiking them.  However, when the opposite is the case, it does not happen the other way.</p>  <p>  I listened with interest to the energy regulator in a media interview.  I accept what the regulator states, that she does not have a role in fixing the prices - either increasing or decreasing them - and that is taken care of through competition between the companies.  However, the evidence does not support that argument.  In other words, prices are not coming down.</p>  <p>  The price of Brent crude oil today was $47 a barrel.  The average price in 2014 was $110 a barrel.  That represents a considerable decrease.  I acknowledge that gas prices have fallen by 27%, but it is still a major decrease.</p>  <p>  We have seen fuel prices, both for petrol and diesel, dropping at the pumps in recent weeks despite the Government tax take remaining constant and there should be capacity for a bigger decrease to be reflected in ESB and gas bills, but that has not happened.  In fact, as I stated, the opposite is what is happening.</p>  <p>  It has also been suggested that, with competition, consumers can make savings by switching from one provider to another.  While there are incentives to switch, consumers must also sign a contract which ties them to a provider for a minimum of 18 months and the original decrease due to changing disappears after a few months.  That should not be the only way that consumers can make savings on energy bills.  Consumers have changed provider without reading the terms and conditions and found that they were tied in for 18 months.  If the companies are suggesting that consumers can make savings only by switching provider, I have another suggestion.  The simple suggestion is that the bills should reflect the price of fossil fuels on the international market, and that has not happened.</p></speech>

However, it is important to note - the Deputy has fairly acknowledged this although the consequences of it are a matter for debate - that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised and competitive and they operate within national and European regulatory regimes, supported by legislation.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  The CER is focussed on actions to mitigate costs for business and residential consumers, such as rigorous scrutiny of network costs, deeper integration with European energy markets and the delivery of a truly competitive market in the interest of customers.  My officials continue to liaise with the Commission for Energy Regulation on all these matters.  Indeed, there was a meeting earlier today in this respect.  The commission also continues to monitor the electricity and gas markets to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition.</p>  <p>  At a national level, electricity and gas prices are no longer regulated by the CER.  The competitive energy market results in choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and this exerts downward pressure on prices.</p>  <p>  The reduction in wholesale gas prices since the beginning of 2014 has led to reductions in the wholesale electricity price.  It should be noted that wholesale electricity prices tend to reflect the price-setting fuel in the market, which is natural gas, not crude oil.  It is worth noting that only 1% of electricity was generated from oil in 2012.  Lower wholesale gas prices in 2014, compared to 2013, should have a knock-on impact on retail prices and this is reflected in the latest EUROSTAT figures published by the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, SEAI, on 9 December last.  However, I should caution that wholesale gas prices have been rising since the summer of 2014 and this rise is likely ultimately to feed through to retail electricity and gas prices.</p>  <p>  The SEAI report shows that all business consumption bands in electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% in electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% in gas.  Similarly, in the first half of 2014 EUROSTAT figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market.  The average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%.</p><p>Electric Ireland, the larger supplier of electricity in this country, reduced its unit rate for domestic customers by 2% in November 2014.</p> <p> I listened carefully to what the Deputy said about switching, but it remains true that consumers can and in many cases have mitigated electricity and gas prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers.  I would encourage people to continue to do so.  Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the regulator, are there to assist people in this endeavour.  Even if customers wish to remain with their existing supplier, they should contact that supplier and insist that they be placed on the best possible offering.</p> <p> I realise that energy supply companies have not automatically passed savings on to their customers, but I expect that savings will feed through to domestic prices in due course.  However, all supply companies offer competitive deals to customers who switch or engage with their suppliers.  For example, a customer can go online today and achieve a discount of approximately &euro;150 per annum by switching from the standard rate electricity offering and also more than &euro;150 on gas by switching from the standard rate.  That equates to a saving of more than &euro;300 a year by switching electricity and gas suppliers.</p> <p> However, I fully appreciate that some customers, particularly older and more vulnerable people, are reluctant or feel unable to switch.  In this situation I urge all stakeholders, including the energy companies and the regulator, to make the more vulnerable customer categories aware of the most competitive offerings available and to facilitate their transition to the best value deals in the market.  I intend to meet the chief executive officers of the various energy supply companies in the very near future to outline the Government's concerns regarding these matters and to insist that they offer their customers, our citizens, the best value available in a competitive, liberalised market.</p></speech>

I also accept that the energy regulator does not set the prices.  I heard an argument to the effect that energy companies must buy supplies in advance and that the current prices reflect the price of fuel bought at a higher price.  If that is true then we should expect a reduction in the coming months, because I presume they are taking advantage by buying fuel at the current lower price.<br/><br/>The Minister provided a lot of facts.  I refer to an article from <i>The Irish Times</i>from 29 December 2014 which suggests that the wholesale price for natural gas fell by 27% in 2014.  As far as I am concerned, that reduction has not been reflected in the price paid by domestic consumers.  I noted yesterday the point made by the National Competitiveness Council that this country has higher than average energy prices which restrict job creation.  That matter must be addressed.  We are all aware of it.  I am not the only one saying it; the National Competitiveness Council has also made the point.<br/><br/>I wish the Minister well in his forthcoming meetings.  There is a need to do something, because the ordinary person sees prices going up very quickly but they do not drop as quickly.  That is not a good message to send.  We must get to the bottom of the matter.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which also deals with energy, I intend to tease out the matter further with the energy companies and the regulator.</p></speech>

He referred to his perspective as Chairman of the joint committee.  He exercises his important role assiduously in this regard, as indeed in other areas within the remit of the committee.  It is important - and perfectly natural and reasonable - that this issue should be debated publicly and in this House.  The Deputy has fairly acknowledged the legal framework in respect of the fact that we have a liberalised market and there are no price controls, as such, but he raises very good points, particularly with regard to the reasonable expectation that if purchases are made at a lower price this would have a consequent positive implication for customers and businesses in the future.  Deputy O'Mahony is correct to be vigilant and I will join him in that regard.  I look forward to meeting with the chief executives of the supply companies.  I have no doubt the issues raised by the Deputy can feed into the discussion.</p></speech>
