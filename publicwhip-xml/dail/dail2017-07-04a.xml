Today Deputies Mary Butler and David Cullinane hosted a meeting in the Leinster House audio-visual room for public representatives at which Thomas Power&rsquo;s sister gave a heart-rending account of the devastation endured by her and her family as a result of her brother&rsquo;s untimely death.  She used simple words to encapsulate the entire event, namely, that the doors had been closed to him in seeking access to emergency heart treatment or intervention.  Thousands more in the south east are beyond the 90-minute window that cardiologists say is the essential timeframe within which to be treated from first medical contact.  Others argue that it is less than that, but every minute counts, as the Taoiseach knows.</p>  <p>  In 2012 a national assessment was made and Waterford University Hospital featured as a designated PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, centre.</p><p>In essence, it was to be a centre for emergency heart treatment.  The third appendix to the report identified the issues that would have to be addressed.  Essentially, it stated that Waterford has the potential and needed a second cath lab.  A configuration report by Professor Higgins again calls for an extension of the facilities at Waterford hospital in terms of PCI and interventional cardiology facilities.</p> <p> A business report was presented in 2014.  It was accepted by the clinical review team in the south east at the time and it was sent to the HSE.  It was accepted and those concerned were told the facility was queued for funding.  I spoke to Dr. Owens about this some time back.  He is a very reasonable man.  He, along with Dr. Colwell from South Tipperary General Hospital, Dr. Mark Doyle, an emergency medicine consultant, and others have all identified the lack of a second cath lab as a major risk to safety.</p> <p> What happened in 2014-2015?  Why was the second cath lab not proceeded with?  Why was the essence of the 2012 report and the configuration report not acted on before 2016?  Why has so little happened even since last year, when the Minister made commitments in here to give eight hours extra?  Nothing has happened.  With regard to the provision of the mobile cath lab, nothing has happened in the past 12 months.  The national review we were promised has not happened either.  People in the south east, in particular in Waterford, are very angry and they feel marginalised and alienated.  They feel there is a lack of any meaningful response from the Government on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400004#B00200"><p>Once again, on behalf of the Government, I convey my sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Power on their very sad loss.  As the Deputy knows, I cannot comment on individual cases.  However, I stress the importance of patient confidentiality and patient privacy.  The Minister for Health expects, as I do, that all proper procedures will take place with regard to the examination of the circumstances of Mr. Power's death, be it through a case review or an inquest, to find out what happened and why.</p>  <p>  Last year, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, an independent review of the need for a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford was undertaken by Dr. Niall Herity, a world-renowned cardiology expert.  The review concluded that the needs of the effective catchment population of University Hospital Waterford could be accommodated from a single cath lab.  However, investment was recommended to enhance cardiology services at the hospital and provide an additional eight hours of activity per week to reduce waiting times and provide increased access for patients.  At the time of the publication, the Minister, Deputy Harris, committed to providing the additional resources to the hospital.  The HSE's national service plan of 2017 subsequently identified the implementation of the recommendations of the Herity report as a priority, and additional funding of &euro;0.5 million was provided.  An additional &euro;0.5 million in funding was provided in 2017 to enable the hospital to provide two additional cath lab sessions per week, as per Dr. Herity's recommendations.  The cath lab is now funded to provide 12 sessions, that is, 48 hours of activity per week.  The HSE issued a tender, last week, for a mobile cath lab, which will contribute on an interim basis to the further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists at the hospital.  The Minister is also committed to a further review to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending.  This review will take place at the end of the deployment of the mobile cath lab.</p>  <p>  With regard to emergency work at hospital, all decisions on how we configure our health services must be evidence based.  Dr. Herity recommended that emergency work cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work and contribute to improved patient outcomes.</p>  <p>  The organisation of primary PCI services is an issue for the whole country and it relates to how we provide services for our whole population, taking into account the best evidence available.  The Minister for Health is, therefore, committed to a full national review of primary PCI services and his Department will make the arrangements for this to be undertaken based on the independent clinical expertise.  This national review will, of course, include the south east of the country.  It will seek to ensure that as many patients as possible can have access on a 24/7 basis to a safe and sustainable emergency intervention service following the type of heart attack in question.  The review will, therefore, deal with the wider implications for all services in all parts of the country of Dr. Herity's recommendations regarding primary PCI services and come up with a plan for the achievement of the best patient outcomes possible, with clinical safety being paramount.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400005#C00100"><p>A man died because he could not get access to emergency heart treatment within any reasonable timeframe.  People feel the time for review is over.  I asked the Taoiseach a very specific question.  The clinical review team said to go ahead with the second cath lab.  A business case was made in 2013 and 2014.  Who stopped that?  Can someone give me a transparent answer to that question?  Why was there a need for the Herity report at all when, according to the 2012 assessment of 12 designated centres, Waterford was identified as having the potential to become a PCI centre with expansion?  Who actually stopped that in 2014 and 2015?  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is blaming invisible civil servants for stopping the Minister from doing what he wants to do.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach read out a statement about the national review.  He could have been reading what the Minister, Deputy Harris, wrote in response to a parliamentary question ten months ago on 28 September of last year.  He stated, "A national review of PPCI and PCI services is to be undertaken and completed by July 2017; recommendations will be made regarding the future configuration of these services, including the number and location of centres required to serve the population needs".  The only difference is that the Taoiseach has moved it 12 months forward or maybe beyond.  People feel that the Taoiseach has no credibility in reiterating meaningless statements of that kind.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach give me an indication or a reason as to why someone stopped the implementation of the 2012 recommendations and the actioning of that in terms of the business case of 2013 and 2014?  The consultants in Waterford were making this case very strongly to everybody who would listen.  They were clinicians as well.  For some reason someone said we were not having that and that a new review was needed to bury this thing once and for all.  I put it to the Taoiseach that if he follows the Herity report to the letter, which he seems to want to do, the idea of ceasing emergency heart treatment makes absolutely no sense.</p></speech>

It fails to recognise that many people will not be able to afford increased charges.  The Taoiseach's Government failed to include any meaningful alleviation measures for those on low incomes.  Citizens and families across the land have been left to the mercy of private operators, especially those who produce higher than average waste because of their age, disability, ill-health or family size.</p><p>Incredibly, the Taoiseach seems confident that a measly annual grant of &euro;75, less than &euro;1.50 per week, will make a difference.  It would make Ebenezer Scrooge blush.  It is in keeping with a nasty, mean-spirited Government that is implementing its nasty policies and mean-spirited choices with no regard for how ordinary people live.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach's lack of empathy on the issue is shameful.  His indifference towards the people in question is predictable and it seems that his Government has learned nothing from the water charges debacle.  He seems to think people across the State will simply take it lying down.  The Government got it wrong on water charges and it is getting it wrong again on this issue.  It fails to understand the anger its unjust charging scheme has provoked in communities.  It seems that it just does not get it, but the nodders and winkers in Fianna F&aacute;il will save the Government's bacon.

Ordinary people are getting another sharp reminder that they just cannot trust Fianna F&aacute;il to do what is fair.  The Government and its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il collaborate to ensure punitive charges will be imposed on those who simply cannot pay.  The Government is creating a free-for-all designed to serve the profit-chasing instincts of commercial operators.  Many are frightened that an increase in waste collection charges will make them the bill that will make it impossible to make ends meet.  They are not interested in the Taoiseach's choice of socks, rather they are interested in what he is going to do to ensure they will not be exposed to an increase in their waste collection charges.  As of today, his answers to questions indicate that he will do absolutely nothing to help.  It seems that he is happy that a free-for-all will ensue.  Will he try to break through his fog of indifference and lack of empathy?  Is he happy that those on low incomes, the sick, those living with disabilities and large families will suffer directly as a result of his decisions?  Will he immediately withdraw this unfair charging system and put in place a waiver scheme for vulnerable citizens?</p></speech>

It is almost a cut and paste of a speech on a question on a similar issue not that long ago.  Fundamentally, it is about the environment.  Landfills in Ireland are filling up.  We do not want any new dump.  I do not know of a single Deputy in this House who would like to have a dump in his or her constituency or town.  I do not know of a single person in the country who would like to have to live beside a new dump or landfill site.  Therefore, we need to reduce the volume of waste and recycle, re-use and compost more.  Charging for bin collection is not new.  It has been the norm for householders for 15 years and there are no new charges proposed.  There will be a new system of charges, but 50% of households already pay under it.  They are the people who pay by lift and by weight and with or without a standing charge.  Therefore, 50% of households have been paying under this system for quite some time and are well used to it.</p>  <p>  The system will change for the 50% of households which are not paying under the new system, who pay a flat charge once a year, regardless of how much they throw away, but it will not change overnight.  Contracts stand and remain.  The new system will be phased in in the next 15 months.  The Government does acknowledge that there is a concern about a sudden or massive hike in charges under the guise of a new system.  We understand there is this concern and it is a legitimate fear people may have.  We have, therefore, agreed to put in place a watchdog that will monitor prices.  We reserve the right as a Government to bring forward price regulation if the industry hikes prices or uses the change as a cover to dramatically hike prices.</p>  <p>  I should point out that it is not an unregulated industry.  This is not a free-for-all.  A licensing system is in place.  Someone cannot just collect bins.  He or she needs a licence in order to do so.</p><p>What we do not have is price regulation.  Bear in mind that price regulation does not necessarily mean that prices will not go up.  We have price regulation in many areas, such as for taxis, energy, aviation and just because there is price regulation does not necessarily mean that prices do not go up.  The best way to ensure quality and standards is through licensing, which we have - one needs a licence from a local authority, the regulator, to collect bins - and also through competition.  There is much competition.  What will happen now is that the 50% of households that are not already on the new system will, over the course of the next 15 months, as their annual contracts expire, have bin companies come to them to offer options, possibly to pay by lift, to pay by weight, or to continue to pay an annual standing charge and then pay by lift or by weight.  As I said already, half the country is already on the system.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach seems to have great faith in the bin companies and the waste operators.  He tells us that he is establishing a watchdog.  He accepts that there is no price regulation.  Good for him.  He needs to remedy that and he needs to go much further.  He needs to step outside of his robotic zone and connect himself with the real world, the world in which people now worry that they cannot afford this bill.  That might sound like scripted outrage to the Taoiseach's delicate ears, but sadly, it is the reality that people have now experienced for many years under the watch of Fine Gael.  It is important that those of us elected here come in and reflect that reality to people like the Taoiseach, who are clearly at some distance from it.  What will the Taoiseach do for people in ill health, for people with disabilities, for our older citizens, and for large families that cannot make this bill?  What alleviation measures will he introduce and when will we see the detail of them?</p></speech>

Some 15 years ago, the results of a study informed the Government and society.  It was the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland study on the prevalence of sexual assault and violence in the country at the time.  The groundbreaking study exposed facts which were very difficult for us to comprehend and deal with, giving an insight as to how difficult it must be for the victims of sexual and domestic violence.  Up to 2002, the only figures available were based on the numbers seeking counselling or going to the Garda.  The service providers were keenly aware that these figures were not reliable and were the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The report, the sexual assault and violence in Ireland study to which I refer, saw 3,120 men and women participate.  The landmark study confirmed exactly the concerns of the service providers.  It established that more than 47% of those reporting abuse in SAVI had never told another person.  Moreover, almost a quarter of the men who took part, 24%, and almost one third of women reported some level of abuse in childhood and a staggering figure of 40% of women and 28% of men reported some form of sexual assault or abuse during their lifetime.</p> <p> Unfortunately, that was 15 years ago.  That study has never been replicated or updated, leaving us in a situation where policy is being formulated and legislation enacted, if not in a vacuum, certainly in a very limited space.</p> <p> The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, in January of this year, told us that without accurate and comprehensive data the State itself cannot understand the extent of, not to mention deal with, sexual assault and domestic violence.  The National Women's Council of Ireland has clearly told us the collection of data and analysis around domestic and sexual violence is at crisis point.  The European Union fundamental rights agency revealed that Ireland has the second highest number of women avoiding places or situations for fear of being assaulted, etc.  I could go on but I know the Taoiseach is listening carefully.</p> <p> My question is very simple.  Can the Taoiseach please commit to updating this study?  I note the T&aacute;naiste, who is sitting beside him, in her former life, made very positive comments in regard to this, acknowledged the need for evidence-based research and committed to a review if the funding could be found.  I am simply saying to the Taoiseach we cannot afford not to find the funding, given the implications of this degree of sexual violence on every level of society.</p></speech>

I am told there have been European studies that have given us some statistical evidence in this area since then and, of course, the priority over the past 15 years has been the development of services, many of which have improved considerably - for example, additional refuges, new legislation in this field and also additional funding for many of the organisations that provide support to those who are affected by gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  It is a matter under consideration at present as to whether we have a second SAVI study.  I agree that 15 years is a long time and a big gap to leave between two studies.  It is costed at roughly &euro;1 million, which is a considerable amount of money.  Of course, it could be argued that &euro;1 million would be better put into services and enforcement rather than into studies.  However, that is something that needs to be considered by Government across different Departments because in order to plan services well, one needs good information and good statistics.  It is certainly something that I will discuss with Ministers.</p></speech>

I welcome the matter is under consideration but I would ask for a sc&aacute;la ama, a timescale, immediately.  The Taoiseach referred to refuges.  Let me confirm that, according to the Council of Europe, we need 446 family refuge places in Ireland; we have 143.</p>  <p>  In regard to the cost, let me refer to the cost of a subsection of that violence, which is domestic violence.  It costs &euro;2.2 billion to the economy every year and I can tell the Taoiseach how that is laid out in terms of hospital visits, loss of productivity, etc.</p>  <p>  In regard to putting funding into front-line services and not into research, the one follow-up that did take place of this groundbreaking research was four years later it was found that those who had participated, who had never before revealed sexual abuse, confirmed that it was a positive experience.  Therefore, not only will the Government save money - perhaps I can get through to the Taoiseach on that level in terms of the cost of not dealing with being &euro;2.2 billion - but on a psychological level, it is extremely good for the participants because this groundbreaking research and the follow-up were sensitively carried out.</p><p>That is what is important about this.  We have no choice.  I appeal to the Taoiseach.  Referring to European facts is not helpful at this point.  I have all of them and have carried out the research.  I acknowledge the other Deputies, including those of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Solidarity, who have repeatedly raised this issue.</p></speech>

Departments will know in October what the budget for next year is, provided it is voted through by this House.  We will then be able to make a decision on whether we should have another Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland report.  I am told that the research conducted at European level is of good quality.  The Departments concerned believe the associated statistical information is useful.  As is always the case in any spending, there is not only the cost but also the opportunity cost.  We will have to consider whether the &euro;1 million might be better spent on services and in enforcement rather than on studies, but I accept the fundamental point the Deputy is making which is that if we want to plan services well, we need an evidence base behind them.  I draw attention to the new legislation brought through in recent times.  It is both important and significant.  It provides for protection orders, whereby a woman or a man who is the victim of domestic violence can stay in the home rather than having to move to a refuge.  The new orders and the new law put personal safety ahead of property rights.  It is progressive legislation which means that instead of a victim of violence having to leave home, it is the perpetrator who must go.</p></speech>

The fishing industry has struggled to be recognised as the second most important in the country owing to a lack of vision shown by successive Governments.  On Sunday the British who have been sweetening the Irish Government up to now with some nice words about Brexit came out and showed, in respect of the fishing industry, that they wanted to see a hard Brexit.  They want Irish trawlers out of British waters, in which up until now we have fished 60% of our mackerel stock and 40% of our prawn stock.  Also, European trawlers will have to exit British waters.  The Taoiseach knows well to where they will turn when this happens: straight into Irish waters.  In recent years some &euro;2.5 million worth of Irish fish has left the port of Castletownbere alone weekly in foreign vessels for Spain.  This is an extraordinary loss to Irish fishermen and the economy.  In an interview on RTE Radio 1 on Sunday the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, when pushed on the announcement made by the British, accepted that it would be a disaster if it were to happen.  However, what was most worrying was that when the Minister was pushed further, he accepted that the Government had no plan B.  In all honesty, it has no plan A or plan B for Irish fishermen and Governments have not had for many years.</p>  <p>  Recently at the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs representatives of fishing organisations were present for several hours.  The unfair way in which many fishermen are being treated is scandalous, to say the least.  Fishermen from the south west only possess 13% of mackerel fishing rights, while those in the north west possess 87%.  Public representatives and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation did their best on the day to put the case.  We said all we wanted was that if a further quota became available, fishermen in the south west should be given first choice, but all of our efforts will fall on deaf ears.</p>  <p>  Fishermen are facing and have faced some tough years.  Inshore fishermen have been almost totally forgotten.  In 2007 the Government of the day introduced a ban on drift-net fishing for salmon in Irish waters.  This had a devastating effect on all coastal communities.  Drift-net fishing for salmon was the lifeblood of offshore islands and rural communities where the only employment to be gained was in fishing or farming.  The ban should never have been introduced and was to have been reviewed after seven years.  Ten years later, there has been no review and none is planned.  In 2007 inshore fishermen were blamed for the drop in salmon stocks, but the so-called experts have been proved wrong as stocks have not yet recovered.  In turn, it has led to anglers and other bodies seeking a seal cull.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has a unique opportunity to be different from his predecessors in respect of the fishing industry.  How does he intend to deal with the announcement made by the British over the weekend?</p><p>How does he propose to deal with the massive anomaly whereby south west fishermen have only 13% of the mackerel rights?  In regard to inshore fishermen, will the Taoiseach provide for a review of the salmon drift net fishing ban, which is now three years overdue?  If the Taoiseach and the Government are serious about the importance of the fishing industry, will he appoint a designated Minister for the marine with sole responsibility for rebuilding the fishing industry in this country?</p></speech>

It is important to note that this forms part of the UK's approach and negotiating position to broader Brexit negotiations.  The announcement will have no immediate affect, as the withdrawal process for the convention takes at least two years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 35% of the fish that we land is taken from UK waters, including very valuable fish such as mackerel and prawn.  I was interested to learn in my study of this issue that we take so much of our fish from UK waters.  We hear often about the amount of fish that is taken from our waters by others but, as I said, 35% of the fish we land, is taken from British waters.  As noted yesterday by Michel Barnier, the UK decision to withdraw from the convention does not trigger any immediate change.  He is now focused on prioritising the fisheries interests of the EU 27.  The threats posed by Brexit to the Irish fishing industry were discussed as recently as last Thursday at a session hosted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, with the industry at Seafest in Galway.  This dialogue with the industry will continue as the situation evolves.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and his Department have been working closely with their counterparts in other EU member states that have a particular interest in the north west waters.  A unified front on these matters and a united negotiating position by all of these countries is what is best for Ireland and the EU.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will also be speaking to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Gove, MP, this week regarding this matter and other priority issues in the agriculture and fisheries sectors.  If there is additional quota, we will strive to ensure that Ireland gets a fair share of it, bearing in mind sustainability.  Fisheries stocks all around the world, particularly around Europe, have been horrendously depleted in the last number of decades due to over-fishing.  It is not in any of our interests in the long term that that should continue, for all the obvious reasons.</p>  <p>  In terms of mackerel, the mackerel review is ongoing.  No decision has yet been taken on it but once a decision is taken the Minister, Deputy Creed, will make an announcement.  The Minister for Agriculture, Marine and Food is the Minister with responsibility for the marine and he as at the Cabinet table.</p></speech>

Until this is addressed, as I said earlier, the fishing industry will remain the poor relation in Irish politics.  I also asked the Taoiseach about the unfair mackerel quota system.  I do not think he is clear on this issue.  As I said earlier, 87% of the quota goes to the north west and only 13% goes to the south west.  If any additional quota becomes available the situation in the south west will have to be addressed going forward.  The Taoiseach did not mention the inshore sector, where up to 85% of the fleet are also entitled to a fair share of the quota and not the crumbs.  This Government and previous Governments have not realised the social economic benefit which small inshore boats bring to communities.  They far outweigh what the big fleets bring.</p>  <p>  I urge the Taoiseach to explore why salmon levels are decreasing, which is of concern to inshore fishermen and anglers.  If the Taoiseach will not accede to my earlier request of a review of the drift net salmon ban, will he at least set up a pilot scheme to allow a small number of boats in each county, under the guidance of the Marine Institute to ascertain stocks at sea?  If this Government remains laid back on the fishing industry it will have far-reaching implications for this country.</p></speech>

To establish a new Department of the marine it would be necessary to abolish another Department.  For the duration of this Government, the marine sector will continue to form part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There are obvious synergies in having agriculture, food and the marine together, for reasons I am sure the Deputy understands.</p>  <p>  In regard to the mackerel issue, I am aware that there is ongoing competition between the fisheries in the south west and the fisheries in Donegal and Killybegs in terms of quota.  As I said earlier, the review is ongoing.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, has not yet made a decision on the matter but once he has made a decision the Deputy and the industry will be notified of it.</p>  <p>  On the inshore issue, I will come back to the Deputy on that matter as I do not have up-to-date information on it today. </p></speech>

There has been no prelegislative scrutiny of it.  We have nothing but the scantiest details about it.  We are being asked to commit &euro;320 million of public money.  We have not seen anyone from the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, present to a committee, which it could easily have done to answer questions about it.  To push that Bill through this House and conclude Second Stage of it within 120 minutes and Committee Stage of it within 120 minutes is wrong.  We could defer putting this Bill through until next week.  We do not have to agree it this week.  We should not commit &euro;320 million of public money without any proper analysis as to where it is going, what the risks are and what are the potential benefits.</p></speech>

Following the completion of the tender process and the awarding of the contract, targeted for June 2017, the new Government will work with the winners to accelerate the roll out of the infrastructure next year. </blockquote><p>It is now July 2017.  There are still 542,000 rural homes and businesses without high-speed broadband.  It is a complete shambles.  No one is clear about the pathway to proper access to broadband across Ireland and people are in despair and have no sense of there being any capacity on the Government's part to deliver this.  This will cost jobs in SMEs across rural areas and makes existing jobs difficult to retain.  </p><p>Recently, Deputy Michael Moynihan and I visited Kanturk and met a company, Avonmore electrical, and North Cork Creameries and listened to how they attempt to cope in the absence of high-speed broadband.  It reflects on their incredible professionalism and commitment but it speaks very badly of the State and its capacity to roll out a basic tender.  Could the Taoiseach explain why the Government's commitment on broadband has not been delivered?  Can he explain the delay?  When can the homes and businesses across Ireland expect to get access to high-speed quality broadband.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach confirm this?  Can he also confirm that over half a million customers in rural areas will not see the roll out of rural broadband commence until at least 2019, after this commercial scheme is completed?  Does the Taoiseach accept reports that claim that it could now be 2023 or 2024 before many of these 500,000 homes and businesses see any progress towards linking them to broadband?  In the context of Brexit and its likely impact on agriculture, the agrifood industry, fishing communities and rural communities, the failure by Government to deliver broadband places rural Ireland at a distinct economic and social disadvantage.  It shows once again that people in rural areas are treated like second class citizens.</p></speech>

I note and welcome this development as drivers and businesses have been ripped off for years.  We recently learned that in 2015, the Central Bank wrote to the Minister for Finance, telling him insurers were giving false and misleading information, and the new Minister confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, last week that no action was taken.  Currently Irish law does not allow the courts to impose any form of civil financial penalty on persons found to have breached competition law.  What steps will the Taoiseach take to ensure that if wrongdoing is found to have occurred, this will not be another white collar sector of society where the law does not reach and consumers will not get justice?</p></speech>

Enforcement happens independently of the Government and we are not informed when raids occur.  The competition Acts are very strong in Ireland already and it is an area where we have very strong legislation and penalties.  I have no doubt that if sufficient evidence is found, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will take the necessary action.</p></speech>

Anybody who watched RTE would have been struck by Mr. Brendan Courtney's struggle to care for his dad, Frank, after he was left paralysed by a stroke.  The family had to battle to try to get the resources needed to allow him stay in his own home.  I and others raised this when the programme was first broadcast six months ago and the Taoiseach's predecessor stated the best option for the future might be a statutory home care scheme, with consultation having to take place on that.  Six months on, we have not even seen the beginnings of the consultation.  Where is the statutory home care scheme that was supposed to replicate the support scheme for families in the fair deal scheme?  While I am standing, I ask about the Leech case I mentioned last week and whether the Taoiseach has had the chance to look at the letter I sent to him.</p></speech>

I draw the Taoiseach's attention to an urgent and serious employment issue in Clonmel, County Tipperary, that is developing in a company called SNC-Lavalin.  It is a multinational based in Montreal which has 50 office staff employed in Clonmel.  When SNC-Lavalin took over from Kentz, a wonderful indigenous company that provided huge employment, guarantees were given to the staff.  Now I find that many employees, without warning, have been put on notice that they face redundancy under extremely unfavourable terms and conditions.  For some of them it will happen this week while for others it will be in two weeks.  There is a commitment to employment and the support of workers in the programme for Government.  Will the Taoiseach direct his Minister sitting beside him to engage with the issue as a matter of urgency and do all she can to prevent this happening?  This wonderful company has been in existence for 60 or 70 years and for the workers to be treated like this two or three years after it was taken over is wrong.</p></speech>

There is no indication on the Order of Business for this week or the indicative order for next week that Second Stage will be debated in the House but, amazingly, Committee Stage to be taken by the joint committee is scheduled for this day week.

The programme for Government commits to doing a mid-term capital review.  That is under way.  We understand that various Departments have made submissions to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I asked this question of the Taoiseach's predecessor and I am asking him now.  Can those submissions be made available to be scrutinised in advance?  I ask the question because a capital programme cannot be turned on and off easily, so we plan for a number of years ahead.  In terms of some of the written replies I have received, I have concerns about certain areas.  In terms of the capital review, I ask the Taoiseach that at an early date - his predecessor committed to this but it has not happened - the submissions made be published to allow this House have a proper debate on the matter.</p></speech>

It is part of the deliberative process.  It probably would not aid our efforts to come to decisions and compromises to have all those submissions in the public domain because, inevitably, Departments ask for much more than can ever be delivered and it would make it harder to have a fair outcome and a balanced compromise were all that to play out in the public domain.</p></speech>

It is complex and was the largest piece of legislation ever to emanate from the European Union.  Data protection is obviously at the heart of the technology industry, multinationals and SMEs.  In fact, anybody who does business keeps customer records on file and this is not to mention privacy issues, as well as the data protection and digital rights citizens must enjoy.  Civic society has done great work in this area.  However, if we look at the ministerial portfolios the Taoiseach created recently, data protection is fifth in line in the list of responsibilities of one Minister of State.  The Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, has responsibility for jobs, trade, small business, the digital single market and data protection, which in fifth in line in what is already a fragmented and complex Department.  With the best will in the world, it is difficult to see how the Minister of State can give it due attention and there are concerns within the industry that it is not receiving sufficient Government attention.  It is a hugely important issue and will be a game changer across the area of commercial, scientific and data privacy issues.</p></speech>

The averaging of contributions made over a person's lifetime has left many hugely disadvantaged but particularly women who started work early in life and took a break in the middle.  We know that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with and the Taoiseach made a commitment to deal with it.  How does he intend to deal with it?  Are we to revert back to the way it was prior to 2012 or, if not, has the Taoiseach some other scheme that he intends to put in place?  When does he intend to do so?  Most importantly, what is to happen for the people in the middle, those who made the same contribution as other citizens, yet who find them themselves with a lower pension?  Citizens deserve to receive the same pension as others who made the same contribution.</p></speech>

It involves taking the total number of contributions made through the course of someone's working life, whether it be 35 years, 40 years or 50 years, and the pension he or she receive will be linked with the number of contributions made, not when he or she made them.  Obviously, any rule change will not be retrospective; it never is for any scheme of this nature.  It is intended to have the new system in place by 2020.</p></speech>

The latest figures released by the INMO are very troubling, particularly for hospitals outside Dublin, in that there have been significant increases in the numbers of patients on trolleys and the level of overcrowding.  More than 51,000 patients have been impacted on, including 1,695 in Naas, County Kildare, in the past six months.  The figure is significantly higher than at the same time last year.  It is now the summer, but it will not be that long before we will have to prepare for the winter.  It is very worrying that the position is getting worse; it is certainly not getting better.  What measures are the Government going to put in place, with the Minister for Health, to make sure we not find ourselves in a more difficult situation?</p></speech>

Of course, the Government and the Minister are not going to wait for the report on a bed capacity review to take action.</p><p>An additional 102 beds were brought into the system last year and 300 the year previously, and anything that can be done to increase capacity in our hospitals and reduce attendance at our hospitals will be done in the time ahead.</p> <p> I had a look at the figures, and I have always taken an interest in the area being a medical professional and having served as Minister for Health.  While overall the figures certainly show a disimprovement and underline the fact we need to do a lot more, it is interesting to see the variation from hospital to hospital.  For example, according to the INMO figures Beaumont Hospital has had its lowest overcrowding since records began, and this is a hospital with an ageing population with no additional beds.  Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, an area with a massively growing population, has its lowest overcrowding in ten years.</p></speech>

If there is, it will come with a sour taste, however, because schools are off, boards of management are not operating and teachers are not at school, meaning people do not know what is happening with the sector.  Special needs assistants are worried about their jobs and parents are worried about their children.

It also provides that the receipt and expenditure of voluntary contributions shall be recorded in the annual financial records of schools.  This is in keeping with recommendations made by the cross-party Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection in 2013 in its report on tackling back to school costs.</p><p>The practice of schools seeking voluntary contributions has become widespread in recent years.  A recent study by Barnardos showed 66% of parents of children at primary school and 79% of parents of children at secondary school are requested to pay a voluntary contribution.  The average contribution is between &euro;100 and &euro;150 per child and the specific amount is often stipulated on the same form as the child&rsquo;s enrolment information.</p><p>The same report by Barnardos stated the majority of schools pursue parents who do not pay their voluntary contribution.  In some cases, reminders are sent by email, text or letters with some schools even sending reminders of requests for payment through children.  The study stated in some cases the children of parents who refuse to make voluntary contributions are denied access to facilities such as lockers until the money is paid.  Parents reported feeling pressured and embarrassed into paying these contributions on an annual basis.</p><p>It is clear from this study and, indeed, from the numerous stories I have heard from parents that the current practice is far from being voluntary and makes a mockery of our so-called free education system.  I fully accept the austerity policies of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have had a significant impact on schools.  I know from my time as a school principal that there were significant and unnecessary cuts.  Capitation rates have been slashed by 11% since 2008.  This has led to a massive shortfall and schools being put under tremendous pressure.  Schools are struggling to pay for essential basic services such as lighting and heat.  They are relying on the generosity and goodwill of parents to make up the shortfall in funding to meet these basic costs.</p><p>However, it should not have to be parents and children who pay the price for bad government policy which has refused to tackle this issue.  In many cases, parents and children simply do not have the means to make these levels of contributions to schools.  An Irish League of Credit Unions survey stated 31% of parents get into debt to cover back to school costs.  Figures have shown that the rate of children experiencing consistent poverty has almost doubled between 2008 and 2015.</p><p>This Bill seeks to strike a balance between the right of schools to accept voluntary contributions to make up the shortfall in funding and the realities for many parents who simply cannot afford them.  The Bill states schools must clearly state that any contribution by parents to the operating costs of the school is voluntary and there is no obligation on parents to provide such a contribution.  It seeks to ensure schools may only contact a parent about voluntary contributions once per school year and may not make further contact in any form to request payment.</p><p>The Bill seeks to ensure no child will be treated differently in terms of access to school facilities as result of the fact his or her parents chose not to make a contribution to the school.  It also seeks to effectively end the seeking of voluntary contributions once capitation levels are restored to adequate levels by the Government.  I have called on the Minister several times to ensure capitation levels are restored as soon as possible.  The Bill further provides the receipt and expenditure of voluntary contributions will be published in the annual accounts of the school.</p><p>The Bill makes a genuine attempt to address an issue that is of fundamental concern to parents.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

The Government will shortly make a decision to re-establish more streamlined Cabinet committee structures.  The Cabinet committee on regional and rural affairs was established to co-ordinate the work of Departments that affect rural Ireland.  Its main focus has been on the preparation and implementation of the action plan for rural development which was published in January.  The action plan contains 276 actions for delivery across government, State agencies and other bodies to support improved quality of life, economic activity and public service delivery across Ireland's rural communities.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been achieved since the action plan was launched and an interim progress report was submitted to the Cabinet committee and published in May.  It identifies progress in areas, including the provision of rural broadband, a &euro;20 million investment in the town and village renewal scheme, 500 additional places for the rural social scheme and establishment of the Atlantic economic corridor task force.  One pillar of the action plan is to support enterprise and employment in all regions, with the objective of creating 135,000 extra jobs outside Dublin by 2020.  While there are still disparities between areas, the quarter one figures from the CSO show that 77% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin and that the unemployment rate had fallen in all regions in the past year.  The new Minister for Rural and Community Development now has responsibility for leading implementation of the action plan and the first formal six-monthly progress report is due to be published in July.</p></reply>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade tells us that he only heard about it through the media.  Was no one in government forewarned about this action?  The British stance is obviously part of the hard Brexit Ms Theresa May appears to be absolutely determined to pursue.  According to 2015 figures released by the British, about 10,000 tonnes of fish were caught by other countries under the London Fisheries Convention, worth an estimated &pound;17 million.  Can the Taoiseach state how much of that figure was caught  by Irish boats operating from this state?  The potential consequences for the rural communities that depend on fishing are enormous, as we all accept.  Has the Government raised this matter with Mr. Michel Barnier and the EU negotiating team?  Will the Taoiseach stress to our EU partners the economic importance of fishing to the Irish economy and the need for EU support for those communities that will be affected by these British decisions?  Will he agree to hold a debate in the D&aacute;il on this matter before the recess?  Will he instruct the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to appear before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to outline the measures the Government intends to take to protect the livelihoods of Irish fishermen, fisher-women and families?  Rural communities and families are also under threat from the announcement made last week by European Commissioner G&uuml;nther Oettinger of farm subsidies certainly facing cuts as Brexit will leave a black hole in the EU budget.  The Commissioner said reductions under the CAP were likely.  Has the Government spoken to the Commission about these matters?  Has Commissioner Hogan given any information to the Government on these proposals?  The European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Corina Creţu, has also warned that governments will have to consider topping up direct payments to farmers.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to sanction this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400018#Q00800"><p>When the re-establishment of a Department of community and rural affairs was announced three weeks ago, no details were provided on what its responsibilities would be.  There has since been near-complete silence.  In the Taoiseach's leadership manifesto there is very little detail on rural affairs, with the programme simply promising to implement existing policies.  It is clear that the Department of Deputy Michael Ring will be significantly smaller than that of its predecessor before it was abolished by Fine Gael six years ago.  I believe that was an incorrect decision.  Development schemes for the Gaeltacht and the islands have been left to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Nothing appears to have moved from the Department of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  Drugs policy is remaining under the Department of Health.  The last point indicates a highly regressive move and decision.  In the past two decades the major progress made in drugs policy was based on working with communities, partnerships and task forces in various areas, both urban and rural, through development work and schemes, particularly for young people at risk.  That was a far more effective way of dealing with drugs policy and implementing a draft strategy than operating singularly through the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  On Leader programme funding, the last Government performed a desperate deed against rural communities by savaging the Leader programme and taking autonomy away from leadership groups and subsuming it under the county council.  It is now bedevilled by over-regulation and bureaucracy such that the reduced funds available to it cannot be drawn down by many of the groups involved.</p>  <p>  The implementation of broadband policy has been an absolute failure in rural areas.  I echo what what has been said about the challenges facing fisheries and agriculture arising from Brexit.  These are two of the main economic pillars of rural areas.</p></speech>

Most people outside the major cities were profoundly worried about the impact of the delay in the rolling out of broadband.  Obviously, I was directly involved in the previous Administration in examining this issue and setting out clearly what would be commercially available and the areas in which the State had to step in.  We had every expectation that the tender would would have been out by now to fill the gap in order that provision would be made for the entire country, to be completed in the next 18 months or so, but we have not even got to analysis stage to determine what the tender will look like. This is a really important issue.</p>  <p>  My second question relates to regional rebalancing.  The Taoiseach has been around the country campaigning to be leader of his party.  He will know, just as I know from travellling around the country, that there is a real need for somebody with a big idea, the big idea of rebalancing the country.  Bluntly, that will not be done with the rural plan we have of making sure every county receives something.  We need to have concrete action to have a focus on the mid-west, the south and west to rebalance away from the east in order that not all economic activity will be sucked into the east.  Considering that the Taoiseach is a big admirer of both the Canadian Prime Minister, whom he is hosting today, and the French President, Mr. Macron, who present themselves as big ideas persons, does he have a view on developing a big idea to have true regional rebalancing in the State?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, it has no immediate effect as withdrawal takes about two years.  In reality, it will get tied up with the Brexit negotiations, which of course involve the UK leaving the Common Fisheries Policy as well, should it proceed with Brexit as it plans.  Some 35% of the fish we land is taken from UK waters, including some of the most valuable fish such as mackerel and prawn.  As I mentioned, I was not aware that we take so much valuable fish from British waters.  I had often heard the reverse being spoken about but had not heard so much about what we take from UK waters.</p></speech>

When it comes to committees, invitations are issued by the committees and not by me.  We have of course discussed issues relating to fisheries and the reform of the CAP with both Commissioner Hogan and Mr. Michel Barnier.  In addition to that, the Minister, Deputy Creed, has been working closely with counterparts in other EU member states with a particular interest in fishing in the north-western waters.  We plan to have a united front and a common negotiating position for Ireland as part of the European Union during this period.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will be speaking to the UK Secretary of State, Michael Gove, this week about this and other priority issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to the new Department of rural and community development, the Department will be taking the rural affairs and regional development section from the Department of arts, heritage and Gaeltacht, and the community section from the Department of Housing, Community, Planning and Local Government.  Also, it will most likely take the charity sector from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The new Department will not be taking Gaeltacht affairs.  That will remain in the Department of arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, with its name still to be finalised.  What is being recreated there is the Department that existed in 1997, when it was originally created under President Higgins.  It will be slightly smaller than the previous Department, but that is mainly because the Gaeltacht portfolio is not going to be a part of the Department of rural and community development.  An interim Secretary General has now been appointed.  Work is under way to get that Department up and running.  There is much important work to be done there.</p>  <p>  Like many things, one could place something like drugs in many Departments and could associate it with justice, education, health or community.  My view is that drugs and addiction are health issues and that the best place for drugs is in the Department of Health, and not the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of community affairs.  Of course, that is a matter of opinion.  I am also conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is now finalising the new national drugs strategy.  Therefore, I thought it appropriate to allow her to finish that work and to finish it in the Department of Health and not to disrupt things by moving that area of policy to a different Department.  What is more important than which Department it is in is that the work gets done and the new strategy is produced and implemented.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Howlin's question on regional development, I noted that he mentioned the mid-west, the south and the west, but not the south east.  I am not sure whether that was an oversight on his part-----</p></speech>

Two things are in development that I believe will have a big impact on rebalancing our country and ensuring there are alternative poles of development to Dublin.  One of those is Ireland 2040, the spatial plan that is now advanced and being developed by the Minister, Deputy Murphy.  The other is the new capital plan.  Key to ensuring that all regions in all parts of the country have the opportunity to benefit from prosperity is to make sure that they have the infrastructure they need.  I expect that to include extending and improving the road network in various parts of the country, such as between Cork and Limerick and into the north west, and continuing to invest in broadband.  However, I believe there are limitations to how far Government policy can take us when it comes to these issues.  Certainly, what we can see is a recovery that is taking hold all over the country.  We see that in the employment numbers going up in every region, the unemployment numbers going down in every region and income stats improving in every region.  It is also very evident that we need to accelerate the recovery and economic development in parts of the country that have not benefited to the extent that others have.  That makes sense for many reasons, not least the fact that Dublin is becoming congested and price inflation is very much affecting this city.  Therefore, it is to this city's advantage that there would be more balanced regional development.  I hope that those two plans will help to bring us some of the way there.</p></speech>

One of the convention's recommendations, of particular importance, is in relation to amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections.  In March of this year, Government approved, in principle, to the holding of this referendum and the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government is now working on this matter.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to establish a Citizens' Assembly with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues, including the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  In July 2016, the Houses of the Oireachtas approved establishment of the assembly. </p>  <p>  The assembly is chaired by former Supreme Court Judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  It operates independently of Government and will report directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The assembly has concluded its deliberations on the first topic, the eighth amendment, and published its report on the matter only last Thursday and laid it before the Houses.  The Houses will now refer it for consideration to the recently established Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment under the chairmanship of Senator Catherine Noone, which will in turn bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to hold a referendum on this matter in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also says that on foot of the recommendation of the banking inquiry, the Government will seek a review of the powers of Oireachtas committees in conducting inquiries and, based on this review, will consider whether there should be a constitutional referendum to strengthen the power of Oireachtas committees.</p>  <p>  Aside from a referendum on the eighth amendment taking place next year, no decision has been made yet as regards timing for other planned referenda.  Before any referendum would be scheduled, I will of course bring a proposal to Government and hold discussions with Opposition leaders.</p></reply>

Can the Taoiseach please be more specific than that?  We need a reassurance that the referendum will be put to the people early next year.  It would be most welcome if the Taoiseach clarified that matter in the House this afternoon.  The convention did, as the Taoiseach said, deliberate on matters and produced a report that I believe is broadly reflective and chimes with public opinion, broadly cast, right across the country.  There is no doubt that there is now a level of public impatience with the Taoiseach's ongoing failure to deal with this issue.  I know the Taoiseach will cite the committee and how it is up and running, but there now needs to be a sense of urgency around all this.</p>  <p>  There was a revelation several weeks ago that a young girl who had requested a termination when reporting suicidal ideation due to an unwanted pregnancy was instead falsely imprisoned under the Mental Health Act.  It is an absolutely appalling and shocking thing.  That appalling situation echoed the experience of Ms Amanda Mellett.  Last summer, the United Nations ruled that the State had failed her and that she had suffered discrimination and cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment.  She is by no means alone in that experience.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has made the commitment to the referendum.</p><p>That is to be welcomed.  We now need to know when it will be held and we need to be reassured that there will be no further foot dragging.  </p> <p> In respect of the extension of voting rights, we must bear in mind it is limited to presidential elections.  This matter was also deliberated on by the constitutional convention.  Its view was crystal clear and yet we are waiting and waiting.  Notwithstanding the work of the Minister, when will this matter be put to the people?</p></speech>

Given the timeline of the Oireachtas committee, which has a number of months in which to do its work, whatever further deliberations the Taoiseach may decide are required in terms of these Houses and the actual preparation of the referendum, it would be highly desirable if the Taoiseach could commit to holding the referendum shortly after March and perhaps before the middle of June 2018.  It is appropriate for it to be held then because it should not become embroiled in the visit of the Pope to Ireland towards the end of the summer.  We want a respectful debate.  It is a very difficult personal issue for huge numbers of people.  The people who campaign on the "ultra" sides of either side may have very clear and shrill views but many citizens will want the opportunity to come to their conclusions about what is the most appropriate option.  I agree with what has been said, namely, that there has been a sea change in people's attitudes in this area.  I want to make it clear that the Labour Party wishes to see the repeal of the existing constitutional amendment, which was passed over 30 years ago.  Younger people in particular want their opportunity to vote on that as soon as is practically possible.  My view is that it should be early in the second quarter of next year.</p></speech>

I do not want to rehearse or repeat matters that have already been raised by my colleague with which I strongly agree.  However, I wish to get some clarification from the Taoiseach.  I do not think anybody on any side of the House believes that this D&aacute;il will last a full five-year term or anything like it.  I would like to get some sense of what other issues are prioritised in the list given by the Taoiseach.  He has given us a list of matters.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Taoiseach's view on holding more than one referendum on the same day, which he will recall was debated in the Government of which he and I were both members, it was his predecessor's view that one could have a referendum day to address a number of issues.  However, I think it is clear that on matters of substance, one cannot have the kind of focus and debate if there are a number of issues to be addressed.  Some issues get put to one side and focused on at the last minute and we do not get a rounded debate on them.  I would be interested in hearing the Taoiseach's view on two matters.  What is his view on multi-referenda days?  If he is of the view that they must be taken on a stand-alone basis, in reality, we will only have one referendum by the end of next year and probably in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  Where does this leave two matters, one of which is the issue of emigrant voting rights?  We have a Minister of State for the diaspora and a Minister of State for electoral reform and I understand that we now have a special envoy for the undocumented Irish, so plenty of jobs have been given out but are we going to proceed on that matter?  The Taoiseach has not raised the issue of Seanad reform, which was a matter for a referendum.  Where are we in terms of what we do next?  </p></speech>

Bizarrely, much of the coverage of the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau focused on things like the pattern of the Taoiseach's socks and his youthfulness when this deal has hugely significant and potentially very damaging consequences for our economy and the sovereignty of our legal system.  A wide range of NGOs and legal experts are saying that, effectively, this deal is illegal for European states because it will undermine their legal systems.  Does the Taoiseach not think that it is wrong for us to go along with the provisional application of this corporate, globalisation-style agreement without a democratic process - a referendum - and some democratic input into whether or not we sign up to this agreement rather than just provisionally applying it, as the lingo goes, over the heads of this Parliament and the people of this country?</p></speech>

The question is what kind of referendum it will be.  I hope it will be one that respects the findings of the Citizens Assembly, which this D&aacute;il established against the advice of many of us.  It came up with a decision to trust women.  I also hope that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution will be respected and that the parallel process we are hearing about in the media will wait for the committee to give its verdict.</p>  <p>  The Citizens Assembly was set up by the D&aacute;il.  It has come up with a position of trusting women.  That position is beyond what most of the parties in this D&aacute;il are in favour of - bar Solidarity-People Before Profit and probably a handful of other individuals in this D&aacute;il.  Given that the D&aacute;il is more conservative than the wider public, I hope the public will not be prevented from at least having a say on those proposals.  How could this be done?  We need a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  It is vital that we remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution and not police women's bodies or health in our Constitution.  Would the Taoiseach be open to the idea of a second vote - a consultative vote - where people could have a say on the options put forward by the Citizens' Assembly?  This would be a plebiscite.  Generally, we do not hold plebiscites in this country but a plebiscite was considered with regard to water charges and public ownership of water.  Otherwise, people may not get an opportunity to have a say on those progressive proposals.  The pro-choice movement, the repeal movement, young people and women would campaign for a "Yes" vote to all of those options.  That would give people a democratic say on what are historic proposals rather than the D&aacute;il possibly coming up with a more restrictive proposal.</p></speech>

The referendum to abolish the Seanad failed because it was seen as a party political objective as opposed to one that was necessarily good for the country.  The people saw sense in terms of maintaining a second, Upper, House to have the proper articulation of views, views independent of the Government in many instances.</p>  <p>  In respect of the eighth amendment, it seems that the key determinant is the Oireachtas committee that has just been established in terms of both the timing and the content.  Let us be honest.  The content will be central to whatever proposition is ultimately put to the people.  There will be varying degrees of interest around the committee.  That will be the challenging part in terms of the process and a workable proposition to be put to the people because it is an issue on which the people deserve to be consulted and have their say.  The precise nature of the question will be the difficult part of this.  It was our view all along that we wanted this to be considered by the Oireachtas in advance of the Citizens Assembly.</p><p>We would have preferred for the Oireachtas to start working on it much earlier.  As it is, we now have the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly.  The Oireachtas committee will have to work on that and then the issue has to be put to the people.</p> <p> The Taoiseach mentioned the European patent court as necessitating a potential referendum.  That is economically important and I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could indicate to me what is the up-to-date position.  Has the Government set priority on the other referendums that the Taoiseach identified and referred to, apart from for one on the eighth amendment?</p> <p> On the D&aacute;il debate on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, last week following a Private Members' motion that we tabled, along with other issues pertaining to enterprise, if one talks to small and medium-sized companies, they actually see benefits to be derived from CETA from new jobs-----</p></speech>

The overall point that I would make is that Ireland cannot go anywhere if we do not have access to markets.  I would like to hear about the opposite to the CETAs of this world.

Everyone in this House has been involved in a number of referendums and we all know what is required to have a referendum.  First, there needs to be wording, even if that wording is as simple as "delete the following sentence", so that has to be agreed with regard to all of these referendums.  Secondly, there needs to be legislation.  While it probably is not needed, it is advisable so that people know what legislation is going to come into force if an amendment is made.  We did that for divorce and for marriage equality.  I imagine we would also have to publish legislation so that people know what the new law is before they vote on the amendment.  An electoral commission also has to be established, and electoral commissions will want a certain amount of time.  We have faced complaints from electoral commissions before, telling Government that it was rushing a referendum and that it did not give the electoral commission enough time.  We have also had court cases on campaigns and the validity of referendums as a result of that.</p>  <p>  When it comes to a referendum on abortion, on the eighth amendment, I have no interest in long-fingering it.  This issue has been discussed for a very long time and I think people should have their say.  If it is possible to have it done before the summer of next year, I would have no difficulty with that, but I do not want to make a commitment in the House here that that is possible and then suddenly have to come back into the House in March and April and say that it cannot be done for various reasons.  The first step is the Oireachtas committee completing its deliberations.  The Citizens' Assembly report was only formally published last week and I understand the committee is not going to have its proper hearings until September, so I expect it will be near to the end of the year before it is able to advise us on the potential wording of legislation.</p>  <p>  I will explain the parallel process.  It is not an attempt to circumvent the Citizens' Assembly or to circumvent what is happening at the Oireachtas committee.  Rather, I have asked the Attorney General and the Department of Health to pay attention to what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended and to pay attention to the deliberations that are going to be happening in the Oireachtas committee, so that if and when the Oireachtas committee makes its report, perhaps at the end of November or December, it does not suddenly arrive on the desk of the Attorney General or Minister for Health and have them asking what it is all about.  I want them to pay attention to what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended and to what the committee deliberates on so that we are ready to have a referendum in 2018.  If it can be done in the first half of 2018, that is fine with me, but I do not want to make that commitment without knowing that is possible, because I do not want to make a commitment that I might not be able to honour.</p>  <p>  On the promised referendums, there are many potentially in train.  There is also one on divorce, with Deputy Josepha Madigan having a Bill to liberalise our divorce laws.  There are potential referendums on blasphemy, on the patent court, which is slightly in abeyance now because we do not know what the UK is going to do but that does not mean we should not go ahead with it, extending the vote on the Presidency to citizens abroad, women in the home, the eighth amendment and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  There is much in train.  I do not yet know myself which should come first and which should not, but my sense is that the greatest public demand and potential impact on people's lives is from the eighth amendment and the votes for the Presidency for citizens overseas, though for that one, even if we have the referendum in 2018, is not going to be in place for the presidential election, for all sorts of reasons.  It would apply to the presidential election after that.</p>  <p>  What I would be interested in knowing from the House today and perhaps sitting down with the main party leaders in the weeks ahead is to hear their views and perhaps agree some sort of schedule of referendums.  I am not totally averse to the idea of several on one day.  I see the upsides and downsides.  We have opportunities and potentially a referendum day of some sort in the first half of next year.</p></speech>

That is interesting to know.  The function of these committees is to ensure that policy is developed and implemented which reflects the Government's programme for Government.  This system and the time restrictions which are simply implemented really do not afford us the latitude to question all of those matters in the way that we might.  There is also the issue of Cabinet confidentiality and I recognise its necessity and value, but it is difficult to get under the bonnet of these committees as they similarly enjoy that privilege.  Has the Taoiseach considered not just the establishment of Cabinet committees, but the workings of them and better mechanisms to report back here to the D&aacute;il for scrutiny by all of us?</p></speech>

From what I have heard, the most radical move seems to be to get rid of some of them or to bury them altogether.  The Taoiseach may have reason for that.  I have a question on some Cabinet committees.  If one looks at the last Government in the last five years, the Cabinet committee on health has been an outstanding failure.  This is the committee that cleared a White Paper, which had no costs or implementation schedules and was ultimately abandoned within two years of its publication, on universal health insurance.  It insisted that HSE service plans would commit to levels of service that were impossible to deliver with the provided funding.  To put it bluntly, there is a huge question mark around the Cabinet committee on health and how it works, and indeed others as well, particularly on housing.  The help-to-buy scheme was launched with great fanfare last year.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was entirely confident about it.  He was warned that it would inflate house prices.  Ultimately, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, agreed with Deputy Michael McGrath to a review of that.  We learned within 12 months that the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has a very negative view of the help-to-buy scheme and is contemplating its abolition.</p><p>I take the Taoiseach's point that he will either reduce the Cabinet subcommittees in size or have fewer of them, but it is difficult to ascertain how effective they have been in terms of decisive policy interventions that have made a difference to the biggest crises that are facing the country.</p></speech>

I want to ask again about the need for a Cabinet subcommittee in the area of education.  We did not have one in the previous Government and it is critical that we have one for multiple reasons.  There is a lot of controversial issues emerging.  Education, it goes without saying, is a very important area.</p>  <p>  In particular, as I have said to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills, there is a very serious threat to the facilities of schools throughout the country because of religious control of schools and school lands.  To my mind, playing pitches and recreational areas around school are not an optional extra.  They are critical for all sorts of health reasons and to allow for the expansion of schools, and yet we have discovered in many schools, such as Clonkeen College in my own area, religious orders are flogging off their lands at the expense of the quality of the education and amenities provided to school students.  The Government is letting it happen.</p>  <p>  There needs to be a serious policy discussion at a high level within the Government about the threat this represents to school facilities.  I have said I believe that compulsory purchase powers have to be used to prevent the religious orders, who are accountable to nobody, flogging off playing fields and recreational areas for schools all over the country.  I would ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider that instead of merely saying it is nothing to do with the Government, the religious orders are private entities and the Government does not have any control.  This is what we are getting and it is a threat to the quality of the education that is available to our young people.</p></speech>

They allow the Taoiseach and other Ministers to be across what is happening in a lot of different Departments and they can be useful in troubleshooting issues before they get to Cabinet so that they can then be agreed by Cabinet once they have been agreed and teased out at Cabinet subcommittee level.</p>  <p>  Overall, there are too many.  There are ten at present.  That is too many, and too many people attend them.  There can be 30 to 40 attending Cabinet subcommittee meetings.</p></speech>

I expect there will be fewer Cabinet subcommittees, probably, approximately five.  There will be an economic focused one, one focused on public services and social policy, another on EU affairs and international affairs, another on infrastructure and housing, and probably, we will retain a dedicated one on health given the high priority that will be attached to that.  I will have many fewer people attending them, meeting in different formats.</p>  <p>  I am also doing a lot more on a bilateral level.  For example, yesterday I met bilaterally with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, their Secretary General and their adviser.  I also met the Minister of Stat, Deputy Finian McGrath, on disability issues with his three Secretary Generals.  I will be doing that a lot more - meeting bilaterally with Ministers to try and drive the agenda and get things done.</p>  <p>  I will also have longer Cabinet meetings.  For example, there will be two Cabinet meetings next week because there will be a special Cabinet meeting to deal with the summer economic statement.  Something like that deserves full consideration by the Cabinet for two or three hours, and not being one of 28 or 50 items at a regular meeting.</p>  <p>  There will also be full-day Cabinet meetings.  The first full-day Cabinet meeting will deal with climate change and the Government's actions on that in the morning and then the capital plan in the afternoon.</p>  <p>  Those are the kind of changes that I intend to make.  We will see how they work out.  The key is to troubleshoot problems and drive the agenda, and that is what I will try and do.</p></speech>

He has done a great service to children.  He has also done monumental work in terms of what we as policy makers need to do in order to support children in crisis.  His report is a comprehensive, thorough analysis of the strengths and deficiencies in our shared approach to child protection.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I will apply this research to our child protection system.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the report I have met Dr. Shannon on two occasions and have had several other communications with him.  He has also had intensive engagement with officials in my Department.  He has been very generous with his time and his expertise.  Together, we have identified an action plan to improve our emergency child protection services.</p>  <p>  Specifically, Deputy Rabbitte has asked me about establishing a 24 hour social work service.  Following the discussions with Dr. Shannon, the initial steps have been agreed as to how best to implement the recommendation.  I have already requested that Tusla examine, as a matter of priority, the level of demand for such a service and identify the most appropriate and child-friendly manner in which supports can be provided when a child needs emergency out-of-hours care.  We can probably all agree that the needs of younger children and older adolescents will be different.  We need to have a system that recognises this and responds to these differing needs and circumstances.</p>  <p>  Last week, I attended a public consultation in the Seanad on mental health services for children.  I listened to the testimony of mothers who described the chronic challenges faced by them when they need an urgent out-of-hours emergency service.  In my opinion, we need an out-of-hours emergency service which responds to the needs of all children.  We need the right response, from the right services at the right time.  This should be flexible enough to meet the needs of the individual child and the particular situation.  It could involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla social workers, HSE psychiatric professionals and HSE medical teams.</p></speech>

What piece of information is missing from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report?  The information is not there.  He has written this in the here and now, for example, he wrote in 2014, 2015 and was compiling it up to 2016.</p><p>Tusla put in place an out-of-hours service which the report acknowledges is in place.  However, while Dr. Shannon was compiling the end of the report, he found serious gaps, including those associated with the 91 cases referenced.  What part of the report that is missing suggests we do not need a 24-hour service?  What gives a child in rural Ireland, or any part of Ireland, a lesser right to access to a social service worker than a child from any of the other four counties?  No child should be denied that right.  The Minister is right: Dr. Geoffrey Shannon has produced a comprehensive report.  It is probably one of the leading worldwide reports carried out, yet we are saying we do not have enough information.</p></speech>

I have asked Tusla to take the first steps.  This has been agreed with Dr. Shannon on the most appropriate way to move forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that we have an out-of-hours service.  The Garda has access to a telephone line and live social workers when section 12 is invoked for children in counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork.</p>  <p>  It has been agreed with Dr. Shannon that the most appropriate way to begin the process of responding to his recommendation is to ask Tusla to set out the level of demand by county and age.  Most of the demand seems to be in these areas.  We need to know whether enough staff are in place and, if not, whether Tusla could add additional social care staff.  That is one of the questions.  In areas outside counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork seven social workers are available to be called.  They receive calls from the national telephone service.  It is true that they only go out in situations involving parental death, car crashes, mass tragedy and other special circumstances.  In that sense, the service is restricted, but the threshold is being examined in the light of what I have requested Tusla to do.  The key is seeing where the demand is and what types of situation and children are involved in order for us to respond appropriately.</p></speech>

The implementation plan agreed with Tusla last week was welcome.  I am keen to see the timelines and the reviews to be completed.  When will we know the county by county details in respect of the data contained on page 50 of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report?  Do we have a timeline in that regard?</p>  <p>  Reference was made to 23 social care workers possibly being required to work in strategic divisions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Do we have a timeline in that regard?</p>  <p>  Time is of the essence.  If we do not put timelines in place, we will encounter problems.  Dr. Shannon has invited himself back to the Oireachtas committee next year to indicate how we are making progress.  Has the Department of Children and Youth Affairs put timelines in place for delivery in the next 12 months?  We need measurable targets.</p></speech>

For example, in respect of the out-of-hours service, on which the Deputy's question focuses, my officials will be meeting representatives of Tusla towards the end of this week to begin the process of looking at page 50, as well as additional issues that, no doubt, are being raised about the table Dr. Shannon has produced.  As I said, he has agreed that it is important to do a little more detailed work in that regard to respond appropriately or make recommendations to me to develop an out-of-hours service.</p>  <p>  I tried to indicate in my initial response to the Deputy's question my vision.  We need an out-of-hours service that is right for the children at the right time and at the right place.  I intend to ensure it will be put in place over a period in the light of the recommendations brought forward.</p></speech>

I appreciate and accept your condolences.  It helps me during this period.</p>  <p>  As stated in my previous reply to Deputy Anne Rabbitte, I have developed an implementation plan to address the recommendations made by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon relating to Tusla.  They have been agreed with him and are being implemented without delay.  Several recommendations relate to the practice and procedures for seeking and using emergency care orders under section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 to which the Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has referred.</p>  <p>  Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire will be aware of one point, but I believe it is important to highlight it.  It was not within Dr. Shannon's terms of reference to review Tusla's actions in his recent report.  However, I am strongly of the opinion that, based on the work carried out by him, the next logical step is to conduct a detailed study of how section 13 is implemented by Tusla.  I have asked it to commission suitably qualified and experienced researchers to examine this issue in detail.</p>  <p>  The research will examine the children's experience of being received, out of normal working hours, into Tusla custody.  It will examine Tusla's decision-making process in deciding whether to apply for an emergency care order under section 13.  I have asked that the research examine the reasons when a decision is made to return a child to the home from which he or she was removed by the Garda.  This was the subject of much commentary.  I think it is important that we understand why these decisions are made.  The research will also identify where children have been the subject of repeated section 12 interventions and examine the reasons behind them.</p>  <p>  I believe the research will provide clarity on the realities for children when sections 12 and 13 are invoked to protect them.  The examination of the operation of section 13 will provide an understanding of the reasons staff initiated the actions.  It is important that the research and the findings be regarded as a positive and constructive exercise to show us what is working and what is not.  First and foremost, the purpose is to help us to provide the best possible response for children when they are taken into the custody of Tusla in emergencies.</p></speech>

I will return to that aspect of the matter.  As the Minister is aware, we have had debates at the committee in recent weeks.  Mr. McBride and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon were before it.  Several differences in emphasis and perhaps in detail emerged in the contributions made by both gentlemen to the committee.  I wish to flag some particular issues about which I want to ask the Minister specifically.  Is she committed to implementing the recommendations of the Shannon report?  The big issue in terms of the discrepancies in the report was the lack of a proper 24-hour service.  The answer cannot simply be the provision of a telephone line.  I believe it is possible to provide such a service and it should not be dictated by demand.  Much of the exercise has already been carried out in respect of where the demand is.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister tackle the excessive reliance on private placement organisations that have the ability to refuse children?  One consequence of this practice is that we see children still being referred to this day to Garda stations.  That is entirely unsuitable.  What will the Minister do to ensure the inter-agency co-operation which was described as poor and superficial can be improved?</p></speech>

Several aspects in this regard will be examined and reported on to me in ensuring better inter-agency co-operation.  In particular, we will examine the Garda and Tusla and what is going on in terms of the strategic liaison committees, the membership of which comprises representatives of the Garda and Tusla.</p>  <p>  Another question was related to co-location and whether we needed the physical presence of garda&iacute; and Tusla staff working together.</p><p>Initially, co-location will be piloted, following which consideration will be given to how it can work better such that in other settings, including at national level, we can have a co-location of Tusla and Garda to ensure a better response to the children invoked in terms of section 12.</p></speech>

As I have previously noted, we have an unhappy history of child protection in this State.  Issues are still regularly being raised in regard to weaknesses in our child protection services.  For this reason, I called some weeks ago in this House for a full audit of the child protection system.</p>  <p>  I noted with interest an announcement on the airwaves of a review or a piece of research into the section 13 cases.  I welcome this.  I believe we need a transformation of our child protection services and a roadmap along the lines of A Vision for Change to achieve it.  In regard to the independent research, I believe it should be independent of Tusla and that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs should have oversight of it.  It must have access to social work files, Courts Service reports, where relevant, and it should have a broad terms of reference, with the potential to expand beyond section 13 cases, if necessary and appropriate.  Also, Tusla should not have a veto over its recommendations.  That is important.  Is this the type of audit the Minister envisages?</p></speech>

The progress of commissioning the independent research has already commenced.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that in terms of understanding social work decision-making it would be helpful to have social work input.  The chair of the board of Tusla has responded to my request to commission that independent piece of research and is currently putting it in place.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's call for a wider audit, there are two points I would like to make.  It is important to note that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has inspected all of the Tusla child protection services, including how social workers' respond to children in emergency.  All actions identified by HIQA are being implemented.  HIQA and Tusla report any outstanding issues to my Department.  All of their inspections reports are published.  In regard to the statutory investigation that I directed HIQA to have carried out under section 9 of the Health Act, the Deputy should look again at the terms of reference as they relate to the handling of child sex abuse allegations, which at my request provide that if in the course of that piece of research there are reasonable grounds to believe that there are further or other serious risks to children or persons receiving services these should be reported to HIQA or to me as Minister.  There are many ways in respect of which Tusla is currently under scrutiny, some of which were put in place by me.  I must wait until these have been completed and reported to me, when I will then consider what further action might be necessary.</p></speech>

An additional &euro;19 million will be available to an estimated 70,000 children.  This is a first big step, one from which there can be no row back.  All children aged between six and 36 months, or until they are eligible for the free preschool scheme, will be eligible for some level of support totalling approximately &euro;1,040 per annum.  In addition, there will be targeted child care supports for those who need it most.  In particular, I want to offer support to parents who cannot take up work, training or education because they cannot afford child care.  However, changing one of the world&rsquo;s most expensive child care systems into the best system is not easy.  Our goals are ambitious, as they must be if we are to deliver genuine affordable accessible quality child care.</p>  <p>  Despite the changes in September, some of which I referred to in regard to the affordable child care scheme, there are still challenges to delivery of the new scheme.  Developing the high-tech part of our new approach is not easy.  As well as technical issues, there are data protection and other legal requirements which must be met.  The systems we are building now will last generations.  We simply cannot afford to get this wrong.  Strong progress is being made and I will update Deputies as we progress.</p>  <p>  When it comes to our children there can be no compromise on safety.  Parents must be assured that their children are being cared for in a safe environment.  For this reason, the financial supports on offer can only go to those providers where quality is assured.  The affordable child care scheme will be delivered through Tusla-registered providers, centre-based or childminders.  A report has been requested from an expert group on how the childminding sector can be developed to meet appropriate quality standards.  This report will inform future policy.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge Deputies' support and their input.  I hope I will continue to have their support as I seek more child care funding in budget 2018.</p></speech>

I, too, acknowledge that this is not an easy process.   This time last year, I asked the Minister for an update on the ICT system.  I understand roll-out of this scheme is being held up because it is not up to standard.  What is the status of the ICT project at this point, which was supposed to be in place for August 2018.  What is the current timeline in this regard?</p>  <p>  I understand that 70,000 children will benefit under this scheme but that there are 9,000 families which do not make the cut in terms of eligibility for it.  These families do not qualify for the GP services card either.  What is the Department doing to assist the 9,000 families who will lose out on &euro;12 per week?  What is being done to assist that sector?</p></speech>

In regard to the 9,000 families which may not be able to participate in the full affordable child care scheme vision, which we hope will be the best in the world and will be less expensive, the figure of 9,000 is an estimate.  We are being upfront and honest in terms of our first effort to put in place mechanisms through which parents can access substantially more subsidies as and from September 2017.  It is important to get that message out.  For parents wishing to determine to what extent they can access those subsidies all the information in that regard is available on <i>www.affordablechildcare.ie.  </i>We have initiated a huge information campaign for parents.  We are also travelling the country with a roadshow to ensure providers have that information.  As we move towards the roll-out of an affordable child care scheme from September, which is a significant step, parents will have the information to determine how they can access it. </p></speech>

As the committees will be going into recess in two weeks' time, I presume the scheme will not be in place before the end of the summer.  Also what engagement or work is being done by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to that legislation?  As I understand it, legislative change is required in terms of the remit of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to this scheme.  Each time we try to move forward on the child care issue we are hit with the road block of legislation.  This has certainly been the case during the past 12 months.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the timeline in regard to the ICT system.</p></speech>

In terms of the legislation and the ICT, the Deputy will be aware that I will be before the committee discussing these issues in more detail before this session ends.  In regard to the ICT, we are in a process.</p><p>The development of the ICT infrastructure for the affordable child care scheme has gone into what is called a peer review process in the context of the development of complicated systems within the Oireachtas that are helpful to ensure that, ultimately, we get it right, even though it takes time.  We have begun a significant part of the process.  A number of steps have been gone through already.  The business case is currently being reviewed.  Work on the business support requirements is under way and the functional requirements specification will be finalised by the end of June.  We have done some data sharing requirements with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  Those have been finalised with the plan for the ICT system, and this links with the development in that respect.  For example, the Department of Social Protection has agreed to host the affordable child care scheme, ACS, data.  I could go on.  There are a number of ways in which the different Departments are working very closely with us, both in terms of ICT and data protection, to ensure we get it right.</p></speech>

It recognised the important role that the school completion programme plays in working with children at risk of dropping out of school.  However, the review also highlighted the need for a fit for purpose structure with effective governance and employment models in place.  The report suggested that the governance and employment structures adopted by Tusla will be key in meeting the future objectives of the programme nationally.</p>  <p>  Following the ESRI review Tusla commissioned an employment audit, which is what the Deputy's question is about, to be carried out to examine the issues raised in the review.  The employment audit pointed to important issues regarding the employment status of the school completion programme staff around the country.  For example, some 55% of staff had no employment contract or inappropriate employment contracts.</p>  <p>  In response to the employment audit, Tusla's educational welfare service undertook a series of initial steps to address these matters.  First, a specialist firm was contracted to provide human resources and industrial relations advice and support to the local management committee chairpersons and school completion programme co-ordinators. This firm is providing an ongoing 24/7 service via phone.  Second, a  suite of appropriate contract templates was developed by a specialist human resource firm, to be used by the local management committees for the various full and part-time positions on school completion programmes.  Third, governance training for local management committees and school completion programme co-ordinators has been provided by The Wheel, which is now complete.  Fourth, For&oacute;ige was contracted to conduct a staff learning needs analysis.  This was followed by a continuous professional development  programme in response to the training needs identified.  For&oacute;ige also provided day to day management of the school completion programme nationally on behalf of Tusla's educational welfare service for a short period.  This was to allow Tusla to reinforce the structure of its educational welfare service by hiring additional resources.</p>  <p>  The board of Tusla has also considered a number of other options to address the governance and employment issues.  An expert panel has been put in place to consider those options in detail and it will be reporting to me in due course.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by school completion programme co-ordinators who are concerned about the audit and about not having heard fully from the audit people as to what is envisaged.  There are rumours about closures and amalgamations.  They are into the holiday season now and will return at the end of August.  I want to acknowledge the great work the school completion programmes do and the gaps they filled in the recession years when there was a loss of language teachers and visiting and resource teachers for Travellers and the way in which they supported after-school clubs, business in the community and team parenting programmes.  I sometimes wonder when audits are carried out by outside agencies if they get a good sense of the work that is being done on the ground, particularly given that we are talking about very disadvantaged areas.  Is the Minister committed to the school completion programme as a strategy to address educational disadvantage?</p></speech>

I am fully committed to the school completion programme as a strategy to address ways in which we can support our young people to stay in school, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  Regarding the audit which was conducted a while ago, I have described a number of steps that have been put in place working with school completion programmes on the ground during the past year and a half in order to begin to provide the support that will be required to ensure their effectiveness as we move forward.  The employment and contract issues are serious.  I appreciate there are rumours and concerns about what is happening.  A process has been put in place to support them on the ground.  I also put in place an expert panel, comprising officials from my Department and from the Department off Pubic Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills and senior staff from Tusla, which is chaired by the CEO of Tusla.  It is examining various issues with respect to the way to put in place the best model for the school completion programme in order that we can move beyond the employment and governance concerns and effectively ensure that our children stay in school as long as possible.</p></speech>

However, both the Minister and I represent constituencies where progression to third level is way below the national average.  School completion programmes play a role in that respect.  When an audit is carried out or new measures are being introduced, there must be engagement with the people working on the ground and we must have their involvement at all levels.  I am referring to the school completion programme co-ordinators and the people who support them in the schools.  Sometimes they get lost in audits and reports as we move forward.  With respect to what has emerged now and the plans for the future, I ask that the school completion programme co-ordinators are involved in that process and that they will be engaged with on every aspect of that.  That is my ask, namely, that from today they will have direct input into that process as we go forward.</p></speech>

If the Deputy has information that this is not happening, I would be very keen to be aware of it.  The Deputy can talk to me, write to me or email me about that.  I completely agree with her that they should be the ones who are informing the process.  My understanding is that they have had that opportunity.  This group is meeting.  We are trying to review what are the best elements that should be in place in terms of the best model and moving it forward.

The rate of subvention funding provided by my Department&rsquo;s child care schemes is at the core of this, but there are also other significant issues.  These include the receipt of parental contributions; funding from Tusla and other sources for services related to child care; and the scope of care offered by providers, in particular in the community sector.  The scope of care often goes beyond the core child care and early years care and education or school age child care funded by my Department.  I am confident that the reduced parental co-payment that will be required as part of the September 2017 more affordable child care measures and the new affordable child care scheme will improve community providers&rsquo; sustainability.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of commissioning an independent review of the cost of quality child care.  This will be put to tender by mid-August and will be completed within a number of months.  My officials have been scoping the work that will be involved and preparing terms of reference for the study.  Issues to be examined in the independent review will include average unit costs for child care providers, both centre-based providers and home-based childminders; factors that result in different costs for different providers, including age of children, geography, such as rural versus urban, whether a service is a community service or private, and aspects of the quality of provision; comparison of unit costs in high quality services with average services; possible impact of future cost pressures, including potential wage increases; and analysis of the child care market, including the functioning of the child care market in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that the independent review will be a key input in informing future decisions on the funding of child care schemes, including both the ECCE free pre-school programme and the affordable child care scheme.</p></speech>

The crux of my question related to the programme for Government and the independent review the Department for Children and Youth Affairs was going to carry out.  It was a follow-on from where Early Childhood Ireland was last year, a more in-depth review where it was doing the sums.  Early Childhood Ireland did the sums last year and the Minister's Department was going to conduct an independent review which would cover the average unit cost, age, geography, community versus private, and bring it down to wages and the sustainability of the entire sector and the funding it would take to move on with the sector rather than it being funded by the parents.  We need to make sure that we have a sustainable, affordable, integrated child care sector in the future.  There is no point in ICT and legislation unless we know we can afford to do it and there is a sector there for the future.</p></speech>

In order to have consistency we must ensure we encourage staff to enter the sector and then remain in it.  The Minister will be aware that I have been undertaking a report in recent months.  People working in the sector have told me time and again that they would love to remain working in it but unfortunately they cannot because they are not paid enough and they have to sign on during summer months.  Eventually they leave.  Many of them go on to train as special needs assistants or in primary education, although that is not what they wanted to do originally.  That is not what we want for that sector either.  If personnel are constantly changing when caring for children, we will not have quality child care.  That cannot be the case.  Any review or analysis that has been done shows there have to be realistic wages in the sector.  We should start with a living wage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400026#Y00600"><p>There are a number of things which I am doing now because of the urgency of the situation and in order to support the movement towards the sustainability we have all spoken about.  A piece of independent research is being commissioned - I hope it will be put out by mid-August - and it is critical.  While we wait for that, given the urgency of the challenges faced by the services, I have asked the officials in my Department to address two of the most acute issues relating to sustainability that the sector has identified to me.  That relates to the impact of the removal of unqualified community employment scheme participants from the core child staff ratios and funding for the administrative work done by services or non-contact time.  Officials are in the process of administering payments totalling &euro;1 million to a number of services which had relied on CE participants as core staff.  A large proportion of funding has already been paid out.  In addition, my Department is currently administering non-contact time payments to providers totalling &euro;14.5 million.  The average payment per service is &euro;2,600.  I was also pleased to allocate an additional &euro;3.5 million in non-contact payment recently for services which sign up for the September 2017 more affordable child care measures.  That is &euro;18 million in 2017 for non-contact time.  I look forward to responding to some of the issues the Deputies raised, especially Deputy Funchion, in more detail tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400026#Y00700"><p>I also welcome the funding allocated for non-contact time but it is critical that the independent review is conducted as urgently as possible.  I fear that the sector might begin to contract if we do not have the right information because when people do their sums, they will look to see where they can make a living from this business.  Whether they are a private operator or even a community operator, they will see where they can find their margins.  The margins are in the ECCE and in the after school care.  There is very little money to be made in minding babies with the ratio of 1: 3.  That ratio has to be adhered to at all times but that is not what the issue is here.  Rather they need the support to know there is a sustainable sector.  They need to know in which direction it is going.  My fear is that it is contracting.  Deputy McConalogue told me recently that one of his constituents in Donegal has no full-day child care in his area for the simple reason that only ECCE or afterschool care is being provided.  I welcome the review is going out to tender in August.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400026#Y00800"><p>I welcome the Minster's remarks about funding for non-contact and acknowledge the work she is doing in this sector.  Progress is being made.  I want to reiterate that staff views must be considered in relation to this.  There has been a lack of consultation with the sector.  Clever things could be done in this sector, including streamlining inspections which has an impact on quality and sustainability for the sector.  The Minister should bear this in mind.  As she said, we will discuss this in more detail tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400026#Y00900"><p>On Deputy Funchion's last point, officials in my Department have been very committed to finding ways to consult with, and hear from, the sector.  That is not to say we have heard from everyone but most recently they have been on a roadshow giving information to providers about the more affordable child care which will start in September 2017.  My understanding is there has been strong and robust conversations at those gatherings, which have been sold out in various parts of the country, where the officials and providers have met face-to-face.  Much of that discussion is not merely about explaining what we are putting in place in September but also the issues which the Deputies raised on pay and working conditions.  It is a huge challenge because the Department is not the employer of the people who provide the services.  I hope I will be successful in securing more money to raise the ECCE capitation rates, but how do we know for sure they will be passed on to the employees?  These are huge issues.  </p>  <p>  I refer to non-contact time.  We hope for that and I am asking providers to look at this.  It makes it more complicated that we are not the employers but that is not to say we will not try to lead in ways to ensure these things are made better.</p></speech>

Those payments have started and providers are receiving them to ensure there is no disruption for providers, parents and, perhaps most important of all, children.  The money is being targeted at those services that experienced some difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements as a result of recent changes, most notably services that rely on people on community employment schemes to form part of their core staff.  The money was given as recognition of the challenges faced during a period of transition, and it is also important to remember why these changes are taking place.  If we are to change child care radically in this country, we must not only tackle the affordability issue but also ensure quality.  Additionally, we must ensure our children are being cared for in a safe environment with qualified staff.  As I stated before, when it comes to our children, there will be no compromise on safety.</p>  <p>  Under recent legislation, each employee working directly with children attending a preschool service must now hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at level 5 or an equivalent qualification.  It should be noted the vast majority of services were able to implement the new requirements through their existing structures and supports.  The &euro;1 million fund was, however, made available to those which could not.  My officials are vigilant to challenges facing the community child care sector and to offer support when required.  Further funding will be decided within the context of budget 2018.  In the longer term, the independent review of the cost of quality child care, which will be commissioned I hope by mid August, will also include consideration of factors that affect the financial viability of the child care sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400027#Z00200"><p>There is absolutely no question about the need for quality training for people who are working in child care.  Some community child care facilities were reliant on members from community employment, CE, schemes.  It had a double-edged benefit as some of the people on the CE schemes were parents getting training in child care for themselves as well as in the setting where they worked.  It provided a service in the community as well, which was important.  We know the figures in the more disadvantaged areas and the kind of backgrounds that children come from.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister's comments about extra funding but it is about seeing that it gets to the areas of most need.  Some of the staff from community child care services have been in touch with me and others here.  As they do not have the staff at the level of training that we would all like to see and they relied on CE participants, they face being told they need a plan for sustainability.  The only sustainable plan is to cut hours and nobody, including the Minister, wants to see that.  We discussed the possibility of a DEIS status for some of these child care centres and the Minister stated it was being examined in her Department.  Has there been any further move on that?</p></speech>

The Minister has again emphasised the &euro;1 million in sustainability funding but it is 185 days since it was announced, and as far as I am aware, no service in Cork has received the second tranche of funding.  The first tranche for advertisement and recruitment was received but no service in Cork has received the second tranche.  It is 185 days on.  The services were asked to submit considerable amounts of documentation, which they did, but the Department came back with a new form that it had not previously asked for called template B or something like it.  It is a poor way for the Department to treat community services, which feel like they are being strung along.  We are still risking services going under or being curtailed significantly due to a failure to provide money in the here and now.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Sullivan commented on a DEIS-style approach, particularly for disadvantaged communities.  On a personal level I think it is a wonderful vision and I have been raising that within the Department.  I agree with the Deputy and it would be a substantial policy change if we moved towards that.  There is merit in considering it.  With an acknowledgement of the issues the Deputy identifies with regard to CE workers and particularly people living in the community who are receiving a wage, there are ways in which the Department has tried to give support both in moving forward with the regulations and providing more money up to a certain point, working with services in order to take a look at the model and ensure they will be in a better place in 2018.  For the medium term, I am aware that in disadvantaged communities, there are often other types of support going into the care and early years in education setting that go beyond what is strictly funded by my Department.  We are trying to see whether the Health Service Executive or other statutory agencies could also provide support for additional care in those communities.</p></speech>

It is a community after-school project that has existed since 1995.  It is an accredited training centre and caters for five local schools.  There are over 100 attendees for 48 weeks in the year.  They offer a variety of practices, including restorative practices etc.  The Department of Social Protection wants to remove a supervisor's position from November this year, meaning there will be reduced management available.  The effect will be on the service, with the reduction coming to three days in one project and two days in another project.  It is an area of real disadvantage and there does not appear to be any leeway.  I know this is not in the Minister's Department but it is connected to her Department.  I will send the details to the Minister and she might be able to engage with the Department of Social Protection on it.</p></speech>

That would be a good way to proceed.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised questions relating to the sustainability fund.  With regard to the first tranche of money from the sustainability fund, 47 providers have signed and returned contracts in respect of the phase, with each being paid approximately &euro;2,000.  The city and county child care committees are working with a further 67 services across the country to make submissions for once-off payment under the second phase, as the Deputy noted in respect to Cork services, with an average payment that will probably be approximately &euro;15,000.  It is really important to identify that.  To date, four services have submitted complete applications for phase two, with a further 17 expected to reach the stage shortly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy indicates some of the services in Cork are finding the requirements for additional documentation a bit onerous.  I will take that back to the Department.  My understanding is that with payment from the fund we are trying to enable services to move to a place where they can be sustainable after the money is spent.  Perhaps that is related to some of the requirements for documentation.  I will certainly look into it.</p></speech>

I also would like to note that Tusla had a national social work turnover rate of 8.4% in the first few months of the year, with some areas exceeding this.  The national figure, however, compares favourably with other jurisdictions, such as England, where the 2016 turnover rate was approximately 15%.  Tusla has a health and well-being and employee assistance programme department as part of its human resources since January 2017.  Tusla also has a critical incident stress management programme in place.  Training and supports are provided on an ongoing basis to all staff.  It appears that Tusla&rsquo;s efforts are paying dividends.  The latest absenteeism rate for April 2017 was 6.38% for social care workers.</p><p>That shows a positive trend when compared to April 2016 when the absenteeism rate was 7.71%.  Similarly, absenteeism at Oberstown Children Detention Campus has followed a downward trend in response to management&rsquo;s support of staff.  It includes the availability of the employee assistance programme, an organisational psychologist and the introduction of a volunteer peer support workers programme accredited by the Carlow Institute of Technology.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, Tusla has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;713 million in 2017.  That represents an increase of &euro;37 million on its funding in 2016 and will allow Tusla to proceed with an ambitious ongoing programme of service reform and transformation.  The programme is under way, with a particular focus on governance, risk management, health and safety, quality assurance and service monitoring to support the delivery of the best front-line services.</p> <p> Tusla continues to evaluate management and the staff skills mix with a view to enhancing services.  It includes reviewing the roles of family support workers, social care workers in the community and administrative structures to support the delivery of a more efficient and cost-effective set of services.  These are the measures I believe address the concerns raised in the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400028#AA00200"><p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer and welcome everything she said.  One of the reasons I tabled my question was to get the answer the Minister has given, namely, that supports are available for social care workers and all those involved with Tusla.  The other reason relates to the children who lose a social care worker or when a social care worker, having accessed the supports, no longer wants to continue working because the demand is so great.  I asked one of two representatives who appeared before the committee recently the number of social care cases they would expect to have.  They could not answer us; they could not say whether they should have 35, 55 or 65 cases for the simple reason that every case is significant and must be examined on a case by case basis.  The Minister has said a 15% turnaround rate in this respect is comparable with that in other countries, but when we take workers out of the system, we let down children.  We are taking away key supports, about which I have a serious concern in terms of meeting future needs, and it is coming across in HIQA reports.  Good staff are walking away from the job because we do not offer key supports to retain them such as a good ICT communications system.  Retention is crucial in an industry in which only 230 qualify annually.</p></speech>

What I have been doing is identifying the measures Tusla is putting in place to address concerns.  Social workers, social care workers and even administrative staff working with Tusla are working at the coalface.  These are hugely difficult and challenging jobs.  As the Deputy identified, in terms of staff, it is important to pay attention to concerns about attrition rates, exhaustion, etc.  I am identifying some of the measures Tusla is putting in place in order to do this, including evaluations that look at enhanced job roles and increasing multidisciplinary team working in an effort to alleviate pressure as part of an ongoing reform programme.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome Tusla's focus in 2017 on leadership development and supporting the forthcoming workforce development plan through learning and development and succession planning, for which I have asked.  I talk about the issue of workforce development planning when I meet its representatives every quarter.  I will have another such meeting with the executive relatively soon.  That is a critical aspect of Tusla's planning for some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

While we acknowledge that it is under pressure in recruiting staff into the organisation, we should consider the opportunities available in terms of co-operating with advocacy groups.  I am talking about EPIC and the role of YAP Ireland.  We should engage more with these advocacy groups because they have a skill set to support Tusla.  We should also consider the likes of Sugru, a not for profit organisation that has been set up.  There are various groups to which Tusla can reach out to work with that can help with lower priority cases, which would leave the expert skilled staff free to deal with priority cases.  That will allow us to get to the core issues as quickly as possible and, importantly, retain the good people we have attracted into Tusla.  Retention is critical if we are to develop Tusla and it is to continue to be the child protection agency we want into the future.</p></speech>

As she identified, it could be doing more, particularly in the various regional settings, in which, of course, I believe.  I will certainly raise the matter with those involved in Tusla when I meet them.  Proceeding in that way takes planning, time, etc.  However, some of the Deputy's suggestions might result in finding ways to save time and ensure people involved in organisations within the civil society sector are able to complement the work done by a statutory agency.  That would be welcome.</p></speech>

This reason alone means that recruitment is constant and ongoing.  I appeal to anyone with an interest in caring for children to visit the Tusla website, <i>www.tusla.ie</i>.  The foster care section is well laid out.  It provides answers for many questions, including the nature of foster care, the diverse group of people who can become carers, how to apply, as well as videos of children, parents and a social worker.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will join me in paying tribute to those who do come forward.  The reason recruitment is constant is we need as diverse a group of carers as possible because children themselves are a diverse group.  We also need both long-term and short-term carers.</p><p>The criteria for assessing suitability to become a carer are based on a person's willingness and ability to care appropriately for a vulnerable child.  An assessment is carried out, irrespective of nationality, race, religion, sexual identity, marital status, disability status or whether someone is already a parent.  Latest figures show there are 4,816 foster carers providing care for 5,834 children.</p><p>Most Tusla teams have sufficient numbers, but achieving the diversity I outlined can be challenging.  It is for that reason that recruitment is constant.</p><p>I am also happy that the outcomes for children in foster care here are much praised by professional colleagues abroad, especially in terms of school completion, stability, family centred care and progress in third level education.</p></reply>

On the figures given by the Minister, it is good to know that generally the numbers are sufficient.  However, I raise the question because of concerns I have heard about finding foster parents in some situations.  The social workers involved were confident they would be able to find foster parents, but they were having difficulties in some instances.</p>  <p>  I ask about the provision of adequate support and even training for people who are coming forward as foster parents.  There could be a concern that we have a system of guardians in court for children, but what happens after that?  That is where foster parents have additional difficulties and challenges with some of the children they are fostering.  To follow on from the previous question about social workers, is there enough support and training available for them?</p></speech>

I am aware that concerns have been raised, even in some of HIQA's reports which identified that things were not as good as they could be.  Regarding foster care committees in particular, HIQA identified some concerns and ways in which improvements could be made.  My Department is working with Tusla to ensure it is developing an alternative care strategy to guide improvements.</p><p>My Department is fully involved with Tusla on oversight with regard to required improvements and the Irish Association of Social Workers has produced a report outlining necessary improvements in foster care services.  My officials have engaged with the Irish Association of Social Workers to hear its views and we are also in regular contact with the Irish Foster Care Association in order to ensure we can move forward in terms of those improvements.</p> <p> I can address the other question raised by the Deputy better when dealing with the next parliamentary question.</p></speech>

If somebody presents to be a foster parent, it is necessary that there is training for them, particularly for those who are not parents and have not had that experience, although there are parents who could also do with extra training.  In addition to training, however, they also need support.  We know that, in some cases, they are being presented with very challenging young children, particularly teenagers, and looking for foster parents for teenagers can be particularly difficult.  Foster parents need extra support and this is connected to the point on whether social workers also have the support they need to carry out that work.  There are so many cases coming to social workers, whose work is already very difficult.  It is a question of ensuring the supports are there.</p></speech>

In answering some of the other questions, I have tried to identify ways in which members of Tusla are supported themselves in the work they do.  While I am not saying there is no room for more of that, and I have identified the ways in which my Department is working with Tusla to find room for improvement, there are supports in place for foster carers.</p></speech>

Of these, 5,819 are in a supportive family network.  Obviously, they have come to this situation through some trauma in their own lives.  I want to pay tribute to the many thousands of foster families who have dedicated their lives to rearing other people's children.  Does the Minister believe foster carers are being given the required supports to care for the children in their care?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400029#BB00700"><p>To follow on from the last exchange, foster carers are acknowledged as the backbone of our child care services.  Foster care is, by far, the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection.  It is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  At the end of March this year, 92% of children in care were in a foster care placement.  More than a quarter of these children are placed with relative foster carers and the rest are with general foster carers.  Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system.</p>  <p>  It is vital that all children in care and their carers receive adequate support to ensure a successful placement.  Key elements of the support provided to foster carers include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a child and family social worker for each child in care.  It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs.  In some situations, respite care for children may be arranged, if and when it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training is compulsory for all foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care.  Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately in recognition of the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care.  In addition to these supports, foster carers are entitled to specific support in the event of an allegation of abuse or neglect, or a serious concern being made relating to the quality of care provided or experienced.  For foster carers, this may include being  supported by the support and mediation service provided by the Irish Foster Care Association.  Tusla has initiated a new national policy to guide social workers in how they should deal with allegations about foster carers.</p></speech>

I have already mentioned that no matter what leads to a child being in foster care, there has been some type of chaos within their family situation.  There is no doubt many of these children need psychological services and extra medical services to help them reach their full potential.  This is not always the case, however, and I have to share with the Minister the heart-breaking case that only recently occurred in my constituency of Kildare South.</p>  <p>  A nine-year old boy from Dublin, who we will call John, was placed with a family as their very first foster child.  This was possibly the first mistake because John had many needs and perhaps it should have been a more experienced family at that point in time.  John had lived a very chaotic life.  Both his parents were drug addicts and his father was in prison.  He arrived into a loving home and a huge bond was formed, despite the many issues he had, such as the fact he was never taught to use and toilet and that he pulled a knife on his foster parents.  In spite of all of this, he did not miss a day in school and the family were in constant contact with a very supportive school.  He joined a local football club and he loved it.  However, the foster family begged for additional psychological supports and they did not receive them.  When I put this down as a parliamentary question, John was still in his home and his foster parents were begging for these supports.  Since then, he has been removed and put in a residential home.  He has to start in a new school.  He has no football club.  This is a disgrace.</p></speech>

It is important to note that most foster carers have a link social worker who provides a support to them.  It is the case that Tusla has identified that the priority in terms of link social workers is for new placements, children nearing 18 or children with challenges such as disability, mental health and situations where there are difficulties regarding access.  That additional support is important in those types of cases.  In addition, Tusla is providing funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p></speech>

I will be in contact with her office in regard to this specific situation.  I have listened to the tears of the heart-broken foster mother, who really felt she was the last chance for this young boy.  I would share the foster mother's concerns about this little boy surviving and having a life that a young boy of his age should have.</p>  <p>  I know Tusla and the social workers operate in an environment of uncertainty and I accept that, in many cases, the social workers are not getting the supports they need.  As the Minister acknowledges, it is hugely important that the interventions take place.  The supports that are needed have to be readily accessible.  I believe John's foster situation was doomed to fail before it began because of the lack of assessment of his needs and the failure to put supports in place.</p><p>These foster families absolutely need to have all they can to sort out the chaos of these children's lives.  As my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, said, it is so important to link in with EPIC, Sugru and Care Leavers' Network with regard to their life experiences.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the issues raised.  With regard to the answers I have been providing, generally in the process of identifying foster carers, providing supports, preassessment, ongoing training and the provision of the link worker the supports are there.

This year, Tusla will allocate &euro;22.1 million for the provision of services tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This represents an increase of &euro;1.5 million over 2016.  It will assist in increasing capacity and improving access to emergency accommodation and other support services for women and children fleeing domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla facilitates a range of services to victims of domestic violence and their families, including 155 family units, comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and eight emergency non-refuge family units.  The remit of these services is to provide safe emergency accommodation on a short-term basis.</p>  <p>  I highly value the work of service providers who work with victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is important to break the cycle of violence, as children who grow up in an atmosphere of violence can be affected for many years to come.  Refuges provide a place of safety for families in this situation, but a refuge is not a home.  We know that the well-being of children is best supported by enabling children to live safely in their own homes.</p>  <p>  My Government colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, has responsibility for Rebuilding Ireland, which contains a commitment to provide additional emergency refuge accommodation spaces for victims of domestic violence.  This is in addition to those emergency refuge spaces already supported by Tusla.  I worked very closely with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, when he held this brief, and I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on it now.</p>  <p>  While there is no verified data, anecdotal evidence from service providers indicates the current homelessness crisis is impacting on the length of stay of families in refuges.  Tusla is very concerned about this situation.  My officials are in regular contact with Tusla, and we share the same motivation, which is to do everything we can to alleviate the concerns of families in refuges, and those families who are seeking refuge spaces.</p></reply>

What prompted me to ask the question is in my constituency we have a women's refuge that covers counties Carlow and Kilkenny, but because it is being used as emergency accommodation, last year it had to refuse 321 referrals.  The housing crisis means women fleeing domestic violence are not able to access accommodation.  They might be able to access secondary services but accommodation is what is crucial.  Unfortunately, many of the women will end up going back into the situation, which will have a detrimental effect on them and their children.  Will the Minister ask Tusla to do an audit to ensure where there are domestic violence refuges that they are being used for that, and that alone, and that they are allowed to get on with that very important work and are not are not being used as an overflow for the housing crisis?  It is a crisis, but it is a different situation and should not impact on domestic violence services for women and children.</p></speech>

She knows that the challenges involved in providing longer-term housing for those who find themselves homeless can impact, as I have said, on the length of time a family stays in emergency refuge accommodation.  Of course this can have a knock-on effect on spaces for those with acute safety needs seeking access to a refuge.  I am concerned that the level of demand for services in the Deputy's region is greater than the current available capacity, and I appreciate her raising the matter.  Tusla will allocate funding of &euro;493,000 to the refuge this year, and it is committed to ensuring there is more equitable access to the services, but it will also work in partnership with local organisations, such as Amber Kilkenny Women's Refuge, to obtain the best possible supports for families experiencing domestic violence in Ireland.  As part of its approach it is assessing the level of need throughout the country and is working closely with key stakeholders to develop an appropriate service response.</p></speech>

It is important that we have an audit of the services to ensure they are being used for their purpose.  I invite the Minister to visit Amber in Kilkenny.  It would definitely appreciate that.  Because it covers the two counties there are huge difficulties for women leaving a domestic violence situation in County Carlow because, realistically, if they want to leave the situation they must uproot with their children and move 30 minutes away.  Many women will not do this.  It is not realistic to move children going to school to a different county.  I invite the Minister to come down and see the service and see the work it is doing on domestic violence.  It is important a nationwide audit is carried out.  One refuge for two counties is not adequate and I am sure it is happening in other parts of the country.  It is important that we carry out an audit so domestic violence services can deal solely with domestic violence and not have to take up the burden of emergency accommodation for housing.</p></speech>

As I have already indicated, Tusla is conducting a needs analysis.  I appreciate what the Deputy has said about her particular region.  I want to put on record we will have further specific plans in place by the end of the year.  I confirm that five additional family accommodation units will be available in the Dublin area in early 2018.  This is with regard to providing more refuge places for women and children fleeing violence in their homes.  We also plan to have an additional five units in Galway, which should be ready by September next year, and additional accommodation comprising five units will come onstream in Clare by the end of next year.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire will be happy to hear the midlands and Cork are the priority areas we are examining.</p></speech>

Children living in direct provision remain in the care of their parents.  If any concern is raised regarding the safety, well-being and welfare of a child living in direct provision it is reported to Tusla and the case is treated as any other referral would be.  Tusla has located an experienced team leader child protection social worker to the Reception and Integration Agency to better support access to Tusla services for vulnerable families in direct provision and to provide advice and guidance to staff working in direct provision.</p>  <p>  Under the D&aacute;il resolution of 10 November 2016, we have committed to bringing separated children seeking asylum to Ireland.  This vulnerable cohort requires specialist support and care and Tusla has supports and facilities in place to identify, access and receive separated children seeking asylum.</p><p>Up until the end of June, we have received 22 young people under this programme, all boys between the ages of 13 and 17 years.  They come from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria and South Sudan.</p> <p> Separated children seeking asylum may also come to Ireland through the Irish refugee protection programme.  My Department has joint responsibility with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to identify and provide supports for separated children seeking asylum who are part of this relocation programme.  So far, six children and young people from Iraq and Syria have been received into care.  A child may also present at an Irish port of entry seeking asylum.  In this instance, he or she will be referred to Tusla for assessment and appropriate care.</p> <p> To best meet their needs, all children on arrival in the State are placed in a small residential assessment unit to ensure social workers can get to know them and understand their needs.</p></reply>

I know that we have responsible landlords, but, unfortunately, I have seen some appalling private rented accommodation in which there is serious overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.  I was thinking of children living in these settings who do not have the access to the activities and services of which other children can avail.  I am thinking of sports, arts, music and drama.  Just this morning, I was in a family resource centre in Dublin 1.  It is working with families who come from direct provision centres.  There is play therapy and a summer project available for the children.  It also connects the dots with various other services that the children need.  My question was about access to the other activities and services our children have which are difficult to access for those in direct provision centres.</p></speech>

My understanding is there are efforts aimed at outreach and engagement in other settings.  That is what we want and hope to do.  As well as the education and welfare supports children in direct provision centres require, Tusla has a commitment to the principle that every child residing in Ireland should have equal access to services, regardless of nationality or status.  Places such as family resource centres provide resources to do this.  The Deputy&rsquo;s story will help me to go back and ensure it is happening in other places also.</p></speech>

It looked at people who were living in the area with foreign nationals and providing the same range of services and activities for all of them.  There are parts of the Dublin Central constituency where the non-national population is more than 51%.  As the Minister addressed a conference in the Gresham recently, she knows the ongoing work being done on the issue of integration.  For organisations such as the family resource centres, a little extra funding, particularly at holiday time, would help in including children from direct provision centres or other non-national children and allow them to have access to those outings and activities in which Irish children take part.  That was the point my question sought to address.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il has been contacted by Children&rsquo;s Liver Disease Ireland, a voluntary organisation the aim of which is to support families who have a child with liver disease.  It is a small group as liver disease in children is uncommon.  Nonetheless, for those affected, it is a serious issue for them and their families.  Children have to travel to the United Kingdom for treatment for serious liver disease, with liver transplantation and Kasai procedures the main treatments.  All families know the worries that go with the transplantation process, but they have been compounded by other factors recently.</p>  <p>  In early January staff shortages in the Air Corps resulted in serious pressure being exerted on the ability of combined services that compromised emergency medical transport services.  The impact of this pressure means that, despite a professional and dedicated team, the air ambulance service cannot guarantee that a child will be transported to the United Kingdom in the six-hour window period allowed for the donor of a liver.  Parents of children affected had this explained to them and, understandably, some of them have taken the decision to move to London while their child awaits a transplant.  Children&rsquo;s Liver Disease Ireland believes the Health Service Executive, HSE, has made decisions about the air ambulance service which will impact on children's plans.  It does not believe a reliable service will be available to children awaiting a transplant for many months.  One mother who lived through having a child on a transplant list told us how she knew how those who did faced many dilemmas and risk factors.  It is not unreasonable that the system should represent their decision about a risky transport system as their opinions are respected in medical decisions about their children.  </p>  <p>  Obviously, the cost of living in a different city, as well as absence from work and home, are significant.  A child can be on a transplant list for many months, even up to a year, but may not require hospitalisation.  I understand the Department of Health has instructed the HSE to provide these families with financial support on a case by case basis.  However, I understand the families which have moved to London have been informed that they do not meet the criteria for the provision of this financial support.  I also understand that initially all liver transplant children were told that they did not meet the criteria.  Following queries to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children Hospital, Crumlin, some but not all liver transplant children were granted financial support.  There was no explanation given of the criteria used.  The families need clarity at this stressful time.  Will the Minister of State respond to the questions I have raised?</p></speech>

I know that she has a good record on health and disability issues.  It gives me the opportunity to inform the House on air ambulance services and the supports available to families of children receiving medical treatment abroad.</p>  <p>  The United Kingdom and Ireland share a common organ pool base.  When donor organs become available, they are submitted to the common pool for transplant to the most appropriate patient on the waiting list.  The United Kingdom provides paediatric transplant services on behalf of Ireland and they are organised through the treatment abroad scheme.  In 2016 nine paediatric liver transplant and eight cardiac patients were treated under the scheme.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the co-ordination of transport logistics for paediatric transplant transfers rests with the National Ambulance Service, NAS.</p><p>The NAS uses three providers for these transfers: the Irish Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard and private air ambulance companies.  The NAS prepares an individualised transport logistics plan for each patient and keeps the plan updated.  This logistics plan takes into account the patient's location, medical requirements and the time window available in which to complete the transport.  The timeframe to transfer a liver patient is six hours, whereas a shorter timeframe of four hours is available for cardiac transplant patients.</p> <p> As the Deputy will be aware, the Air Corps is currently experiencing manpower challenges and has been unable to sustain the level of service previously provided for the transfer of priority paediatric transplant patients.  While there is significant work under way in the Department of Defence to increase the capacity of the Air Corps, this reduction in the availability of the Air Corps resource is problematic.  I accept the Deputy's point in this regard.  I can assure the Deputy that the NAS has taken every step possible to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place in light of the reduced Air Corps availability.  In that regard, the NAS is working closely with the Irish Coast Guard and private providers in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with the transport of patients.  However, the NAS medical director is of the view that, given the current difficulties, all cardiac transplant patients should relocate to the UK in order to guarantee access to transplant surgery.  He has also recommended that decisions regarding the relocation of liver transplant patients be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the location of the child.  I understand the decision to relocate is a very difficult one for any family, not least the family of a sick child.  Given the exceptional circumstances with regard to air ambulance transfers, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has asked the HSE, through the treatment abroad scheme, to make a financial contribution to families who are advised to and who choose to relocate.</p> <p> In the meantime, I understand that every effort is being made to address the shortages in personnel faced by the Air Corps, and a plan is in place to allow it to return to full strength.  The Deputy may wish to note that following a recent notification from the Irish Coast Guard of reduced availability for inter-hospital transfer services due to scheduled fleet maintenance, the Air Corps rosters were changed at very short notice to provide additional cover, in case an organ became available for a transplant patient.  This arrangement, at very short notice, illustrates the strong interdepartmental co-operation evident in the provision of the air ambulance services.</p></speech>

From what I hear, funds will be made available to families through the treatment abroad fund.  The cardiac cases are approved but the liver patient decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the location of the patient.  Will there be two different approaches for those in the west and in Louth?</p>  <p>  Both liver and heart conditions are very serious.  Regardless of whether a heart or liver is to be transplanted, the child has to get from Ireland to England.  Regrettably, air transport is currently provided only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and there is no weekend service.  The Minister of State reassured me there is a private air ambulance company employed.  I am sure he can guarantee me it is available 24/7, when requested.  When Crumlin hospital states a liver or heart is available in the United Kingdom for a child, are we in a position to provide the transport and meet all the standards of delivery, even if the child is living at home?  Many of the liver patients are in the home setting and do not need to be in hospital at all.  One can totally understand the concerns of the families.  They are very concerned over the fact the air ambulance service is not the service that existed last June or July and they are concerned given what came to light last January.  The families need to know they have support, including financial support.  It is a huge commitment to uproot a parent and child and leave half a family behind.  Some people must walk away from their job to do what is necessary until such time as we have a full air ambulance service again.</p></speech>

They are very worried.  I accept the Deputy's point that they need clarity.  On the funds, the assessment and the point the Deputy made about Galway and Louth, I will raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Harris, because we need total clarity on this issue to reassure the families.</p>  <p>  May I make four other points that are important for families to know?  First, where a family is experiencing undue hardship, it may, of course, apply to the Department of Social Protection for an exceptional needs payment.  It is understood that, in general, exceptional needs payments are approved when the applicant is already in receipt of some sort of income support.  Second, owing to the air ambulance difficulties, we have asked the HSE to provide financial assistance to the families required to relocate.  It is a difficult situation.  Where a child is in hospital and the hospital cannot provide accommodation for a parent, or where the child is not hospitalised, the family will be offered a subsistence payment of &euro;169.22 per night per family.</p>  <p>  Third, while the financial contribution is generally directed at the families of cardiac patients, the HSE has also been directed to consider the requests for financial assistance for the liver transplant patients, and this is very important.  Fourth, the Irish Coast Guard provides capacity for the inter-hospital transfers on an as-available basis from Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo.  This is where the private providers come it.  They are used regularly to supplement both emergency transfer patients, who are a priority, and scheduled transfer patients.  The HSE acute hospital division has identified a comprehensive list of private air ambulance providers.  This is updated continuously.  The Deputy can reassure the families that lists of reliable people have been drawn up and that the service is being given.  </p>  <p>  I will bring the other concerns raised by Deputy Rabbitte back to the Minister, Deputy Harris, to obtain further clarity.</p></speech>

Last year, the acute lack of proper respite facilities in Louth reached a crisis point.  Families in my area are suffering from ongoing unacceptable distress as the crisis continues to escalate.  I am aware that the Minister of State has been contacted by many of the families and care groups.  Let me outline some of the severe hardship cases that my office and other Deputies in Louth are dealing with.  Most important, I ask the Minister of State to provide the funding for a facility that has been identified to provide care for 30 people.  It would cost &euro;800,000 to provide care for 30 people per annum.  The service provider Praxis Care is ready to provide the service, and a premises has been identified.  It just needs confirmation from the HSE that the funding will be provided.  The facility could be operational within three to four months.  The service would provide respite to young adults in Louth, Meath, the north midlands and north Dublin.  The premises identified is just off the M1 in Drogheda.</p>  <p>  I want to give some examples of the extreme hardship the families are going through without access to respite care for their loved ones.  A family with a severely disabled 26 year old daughter has been looking for respite care for three years now.  Her mother rang up giving four months' notice to get four nights' respite for a trip planned for her wedding anniversary.  The family was told immediately there was none available even though ample notice had been given.  She was not able to get respite in May to enable her to attend her granddaughter's Holy Communion.  Recently, the family was granted two nights, which was not enough time in which to plan anything meaningful.  Two nights is not enough of a break for the family.  The mother said she was too exhausted to do anything with the time.</p><p>She is distraught.  There is another mother who has an 18-year old son and she is very conscious that as yet there are no specific plans in place for how adult respite will be delivered to her son.  She is aware of many other families in the same predicament.  Her son continues to display high-risk and challenging behaviour.  Respite is a complete lifeline to them and they are extremely worried and worn out.</p></speech>

I appreciate his commitment, which we share, as does Deputy Adams.  We have met regularly with the HSE and with Drumcar and St. John of God's to try to get a solution to the problem that continues.  It will continue until adequate and proper funding is provided.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State and the Taoiseach to deal with this issue, but the scale of it is huge.  There has been no increased investment by the HSE into respite care since 2008.  The estimated number of new places required nationally by 2020 is 2,133.  In our own HSE area, that number is 316.  There is no sign of any of these places at this moment in time.  There is huge distress, upset and concern.  There are people crying on the phone, elderly people breaking down at meetings and parents in their 80s distraught and terribly upset.  People are listening and Ministers are listening, but we need the action and we need it now.</p></speech>

I want to make it very clear that this Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.</p>  <p>  The provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in the past number of years.  I accept that point.  An increasing number of children and adults are now seeking access to respite, and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact as they, along with the rest of the population, are living longer lives.  The HSE acknowledges, as do I, the need for additional respite for adults and children with intellectual disabilities and the difficulty experienced by families with regard to the lack of respite places available.  The HSE is working with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.</p>  <p>  To support these alternative ways of providing respite, funding has been provided to the HSE to provide 185 new emergency residential places and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.  The HSE&rsquo;s social care operational plan for 2017 aims to provide 182,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services, in addition to 41,000 day respite sessions.</p>  <p>  HSE Louth disability services have recently received a draft costing proposal submitted by a local service provider.  The nature of the proposal is for the provision of a residential respite service for young adults with complex needs and challenging behaviour.  No discussion has been had with the service provider regarding the costings as received for the proposed provision of a respite house that the service provider is considering developing in the Louth area.  The HSE has confirmed in local discussions with the service provider that it is not in a position to give assurances to any provider regarding the independent commissioning of such a service outside procurement.  The service provider was advised that if the organisation were to proceed to develop same, it would be the organisation's decision to do so.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that further discussion is ongoing at CHO 8 level regarding the emerging need for additional respite services and the options to be developed to meet these needs.  The HSE has advised that additional funding would be required for the development of respite services in Louth, but there is a problem with regard to that.  As Minister of State, I intend to seek additional funding for residential and respite services as part of the 2018 Estimates process.</p>  <p>  Only yesterday, I had a meeting with the Taoiseach on the social service plan for 2018.  This item was at the top of our agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400033#FF00600"><p>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response as it is deeds and actions that are needed, not words.  I could go on for the next hour about cases that have come to the attention of my office.  The Minister of State has been written to about many of those cases.  For example, two social workers left Drumcar last December and since then no social worker had been there at all until last week.  Just one social worker was appointed to facilitate the needs of these families.  If the Minister of State cannot give a commitment to give the money needed to solve the problem in Louth immediately, I want to make a suggestion to him and I ask him to consider it.  In the short term, could he not allow retired accredited intellectual disability nurses provide respite for these families in their homes?  While it is not an ideal solution, that would alleviate the distress and worry of these families.  Most important, I call on the Minister of State to get the funding to which I have referred to provide the facility that has been identified.  Let us get action on this.  Words are no good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400033#FF00700"><p>I absolutely agree with everything Deputy Breathnach has said.  It is universally true in every home in Louth where there are people with disabilities.  There is an absolute lack of clarity, support and services.  Yet, at the same time, more than &euro;30 million is spent on the services of St. John of God's.  It is reducing its services but is not giving the funding back to the HSE or to other groups that want to provide the services.  It is not doing its job.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the Minister of State's commitment to increased funding for Louth.  What the Minister of State needs to do is attend the meeting with us, the HSE and Drumcar to sort it out once and for all.  These families deserve better.  No later than this afternoon, I got a call from a constituent who has a 21-year old disabled son who never got respite.  Despite applying for it, they got no answer this year - no answer at all.  It is a disgrace and is unacceptable.  I appreciate the Minister of State's hands-on involvement in all the issues we bring to his attention.  I ask him to please deal with this issue.  We will talk to him after this debate to get action and commitments.</p></speech>

Even in the last couple of days, I have written to the CEO of and people directly involved in St. John of God's about the management of money.  That is a separate debate but, at the same time, I am not happy with the way some of the money is being spent on services.  It is unacceptable to hear that a family has told Deputy O'Dowd that they have received no respite.</p>  <p>  The management of money in services is very important.  I take Deputy Breathnach's point about the retired nurses.  That is a good idea.  There are 101,000 families claiming the carer's grant, which is worth &euro;1,700 and was restored recently to those families.  They could use some of that money to pay for respite while we get the long-term issue resolved.  However, I accept the point that we need action on respite services.  We need good management of the resources.  We do not need all the money going to senior managers in St. John of God's services, because the people on the front line deserve the respite services.  That is the direction I want to go in.</p>  <p>  I also appreciate sensible ideas.  We could use some of the nursing support hours.  In this year's budget, I got an extra &euro;16.2 million to support 395 people through funding for the new home support, which is in-home respite for emergency cases.  Perhaps some of that money could be used for those ideas.  I saw a group of nurses in north Dublin recently who have retired from St. Joseph's intellectual disability service in Portrane and are doing an excellent job of helping out the services that are in crisis.</p>  <p>  I will talk to Deputies O'Dowd and Breathnach about meeting those directly involved, in particular parents who have not received the services.  I would like to hear from them first hand.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute;im ag cur an cheist &aacute;rachas margaidh os comhair an T&iacute;.  Early this morning, it was confirmed that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission carried out a series of raids on insurance companies and brokers and their representative body, Insurance Ireland.  The raids are part of an ongoing investigation regarding suspicions of the existence of price signalling or price fixing within the insurance sector in this State.  This suspicion is most evident in motor insurance prices, which most of us have had to put up with over the past number of years.  However, it is far from being limited to car insurance.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State is very well aware that Donegal has a very long and proud farming and agricultural heritage.  The diversity of land use within the sector reflects the physical diversity of our landscape.  From largely dairy farming in the north to crop growing to the east and throughout the Finn valley to cattle rearing in the south to grazing lands to the west, few counties can boast such a mix and range of farm types.  As a rural county, this tradition is not only widely known but widely celebrated because even to this day, the industry remains at the heart of the local economy in many of our smallest villages and towns.  The local farmer's mart is at the centre of this industry.  Many of our biggest towns such as Letterkenny, the twin towns, Raphoe, Milford, Donegal town, Ballyshannon and others owe much of their success down through the years to the influence of the local livestock co-op or mart.  In fact, many of them remain open for business today.  They are local trading hubs - institutions in their own right - where farmers and traders come to do business, to socialise and, in most instances, to continue a long and lasting family farming tradition.</p>  <p>  Despite this, all is not well at the local livestock mart.  It is a business which finds itself coming under increasing financial pressures as a direct result of what is fast becoming the cross-sectoral problem of insurance costs.  In my view, the same core issues that have caused the rip off for drivers are driving these increases.  In recent weeks, I have been contacted by representatives from the sector who have stated in no uncertain terms that the crippling costs associated with rising mart insurance premiums over recent years are forcing mart operators to consider their own futures seriously as well as affecting the future survival of the wider institution itself.  Marts are reporting to me that they are coming under heightened demands from their insurers - demands with which they complied in the past and that are still there.  Those demands are to introduce costly structural adaptations and changes to existing practice which it is claimed will help keep the cost of cover down.  However, even though some marts have already carried out those works, they are seeing dramatic increases in their premiums.  Even though they are open for fewer hours than previously, they are seeing the premiums increase year on year.  What will the Minister of State do at this stage of the insurance review to ensure that the plight of marts are brought into the terms of reference?  I have written to the Minister requesting that.  Can the Minister of State comment on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission investigation?  Will he write to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and ask it to look not only at motor insurance but at wider issues, including mart insurance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400034#GG00300"><p>I am well aware of Donegal's farming background, which is one of the most mixed and varied in the country.  Given Donegal's size in an area where there are challenges, we must do what we can about them.  I have been advised by Insurance Ireland that livestock marts have significant exposure to injuries to employees and members of the public.  This has resulted in claims occurring with a level of frequency which has led to a reduction in market capacity due to the hazardous nature of the risk.</p>  <p>  In response, insurers have developed active risk management programmes in order to try to reduce the level of accidents and injuries.  In addition, I understand that insurers have been working with marts with a view to implementing improvements in management practices and facilities to reduce claims as this is the key area in terms of managing claim costs.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has advised that it is not aware of any recent major increases in the cost of insurance for agricultural mart owners.  However, if the Deputy is aware of a specific issue facing an individual mart owner, I recommend that he or the mart owner raise it with Insurance Ireland, which I understand is happy to discuss the issue as part of its free insurance information service for those with queries, complaints or difficulties regarding obtaining insurance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither the Minister nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits member states from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, the Minister is not in a position to review individual cases nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  In terms of measures being taken to tackle the cost of employer and public liability, the Deputy will be aware that this is being examined as part of the second phase of the cost of insurance working group.  The working group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer and public liability insurance claims areas.  The working group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.  The working group has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, which provided a submission to the working group.  This issue was not raised in its submission.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing report.  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.  As it is likely that employer and public liability risks are factors in the cost of insurance for marts, any recommendations emerging from this review should be of relevance to the mart sector.  I met with the IFA in Wexford yesterday and raised this issue with it.  There are two marts in Wexford and two marts that are very close to the border of Wexford so there are four marts in direct proximity to Wexford but the matter has not been raised with me.  However, if there is a specific issue in a specific area, I will certainly take it up to improve matters so that premiums are not unreasonable and unfair.</p></speech>

I will raise this matter with Insurance Ireland and ask the mart owners to do likewise.  However, given that he is the Minister of State with responsibility for examining the cost of businesses, and I note his comments about the IFA, I can tell him that the businesses in Donegal with which I have spoken are seeing dramatic increases in their insurance premiums.  The Minister of State said the insurance industry is working with the sector to ensure that measures can be taken to reduce the premiums.  Many marts have carried out those measures.  They have carried out the costly structural adaptations and changes to existing practices but lo and behold, they see their premiums go up when they are due for renewal.  For example, despite having spent over &euro;12,000 on introducing such changes, operators of one local mart saw their premiums rise from &euro;8,000 in 2015 to a whopping &euro;15,000 for the period 2017 to 2018.  This is an increase of nearly 100% in 24 months.</p><p>That is not sustainable for a mart in a rural area.  This is a business which is important and which supports an agricultural sector.  Another mart has advised that the costs of its renewal is now a staggering &euro;30,000.  This cost is among its biggest overheads for the year and the figure is now unsustainable.  It is telling us that it is unsustainable.  It has scaled back its operating times and cannot scale back any further.  The next step is whether to close the mart.  This is particularly the case for smaller marts and co-operatives which operate only a limited number of days.  Mart owners simply cannot afford to pay such inordinate insurance premiums and many fear that if the issue is not remedied shortly, it will result in their likely demise and closure.  What they are reporting is what we know of, but those in the agriculture sector are at the mercy of a highly concentrated insurance industry which is dominated by a relatively small number of big insurance firms that can charge what they want.</p> <p> What can the Minister of State do?  He is carrying out the business sector review.  His predecessor took on board some of our comments when he appeared before a committee.  Independently of what I have said, I ask the Minister of State to take a sample of perhaps 20 marts across the country to see if insurance premiums have increased dramatically and to look at that when engaging with the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-04a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070400035#HH00200"><p>I did that earlier.  I telephoned two of the marts in the area closest to me.  The cost for one of the largest marts in the country is approximately &euro;12,500 and its owner said its premium had not increased.  I anticipated the question would be about why premiums had increased.  The owner said its premium had not increased because he had not had a claim for 12 years.  That is the primary issue I see.  When I pushed him about his knowledge of other marts, he said from what he has been told, the cost to insure a moderate-sized mart is between &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000.  I take on board the Deputy's assertion that there is probably a bigger issue where premiums for smaller marts, which operate on a smaller number of days and which have a smaller turnover, go from &euro;8,000 to &euro;15,000, thus experiencing a really significant jump.  It is concerning in the extreme if they have done the work required to insure there are no claims or where they have done the work if there were issues to be resolved.  I have a real problem with that.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy supplies me with the details, I will pursue the matter.  I will also take it to the next phase of insurance analysis.  The marts are crucial and are an essential part of rural Ireland in terms of trade.  It is not just the marts because there are shops and other services attached to them.  I am from rural Ireland and an agricultural background and do not want to see any further slippage in this sector.</p></speech>

Will he seriously consider, as part of the capital programme, which I presume will be announced when we come back after the summer recess, funding the N24 to motorway standard?  This road connects Limerick and Waterford.  This is a very valid proposal and given where we are with regard to the national spatial strategy and the national planning framework, which, coincidentally, I kicked off myself a couple of years ago, this would fit right into the plans and requirements set out in them.  It also fits into the plans set out in the submission from County Tipperary as part of that and also submissions and plans from the south east.  The local authorities of Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny have written to the Minister and made a submission on this motorway proposal.</p>  <p>  We need the motorway in order to open up the south of the country.  Not only would it link Cork, Limerick, Waterford and all the towns in between, it would link the ports of Rosslare, Waterford, Limerick, Foynes and Cork.  Based on my knowledge as a former MEP, I think there is potential for funding from the Trans-European Transport Networks, TEN-T, programme because this would link up all the ports and in doing so, meet all its requirements.</p>  <p>  The current N24 is substandard.  It links many towns in Tipperary, including Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town, with many others.  It has slow journey times.  It would be a game-changer because it would link up the whole southern region.  It would also open up Shannon Airport as an access point.  Furthermore, it would create the possibility of opening the M8 and linking it with the M7.</p>  <p>  The Minister has decisions to make on capital funding which will be tight.  He will be under pressure in regard to requirements in Dublin, which are also all valid.  I was in his Department a number of years ago when similar decisions had to be made and when our envelope was much smaller.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister consider doing this motorway?  If he cannot do the whole motorway, will he consider doing a component of it?  The cost associated with linking up Limerick with the M8, for example, would come in at &euro;500 million or thereabouts.  The cost associated with doing the Cork to Limerick road would be much higher and that is a very worthy project in its own right, but the Minister is obviously going to have to fit the projects within the envelope he has.</p>  <p>  This is a fantastic project that would tick all the boxes in regard to the Action Plan for Jobs, the plans for opening up rural Ireland and regionality.  IDA Ireland and those looking to bring investment into this country would be very excited if the Minister could go some way to funding this road to bring it to motorway standard, whether by upgrading the road or, probably more likely, building a new road.  In the coming months will the Minister consider this favourably, if at all possible?</p></speech>

He will be aware that I cannot make any commitment at this stage and that he is putting a case which is competing with many others in what is not a bottomless pit.  I acknowledge the fact he has made a very good case for upgrading the N24, in particular when he mentioned the spatial strategy, which is important, and the fact the road is undoubtedly substandard.  I point out to him, because I do not want to raise expectations and I have had a multitude of requests about roads, that we really have not been able to do anything to even keep up with the steady state in recent years and that will not happen until 2019 or 2020.  We are coming from behind but, as the Deputy said, the capital review will I hope release capital.</p>  <p>  The N24 services the cities of Limerick and Waterford.  The route originates at the junction of the N24 and the N7 at Henry Street in the city of Limerick and terminates at the junction of the N9 and N25 at the Brother Ignatius Rice Bridge in Waterford city.  The overall route length of the N24 is approximately 120 km.  An approximate breakdown of the route length by local authority means that the largest stretch of the route is in the Deputy's home county of Tipperary.  A number of significant upgrades to the N24 were being planned before the financial crisis but were, unfortunately, suspended at route selection stage due to lack of funding.  These included the Bansha-Tipperary-Oola bypass, the Cahir-Bansha road, the Carrick-on-Suir bypass, the Clonmel-Cahir bypass and the Mooncoin bypass.  The Government's capital investment plan, building on recovery, infrastructure and capital investment, provides the financial and strategic framework for Transport Infrastructure Ireland's, TII, activities during the period from 2016 to 2021.  The N24 was not included among those projects which were identified for development during the period of the plan.  However, as the Deputy is aware, mid-term review of the capital investment plan is being undertaken by the Government and the position on the development of the route will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the review and any additional funding priorities that may be identified by the Government for the national roads programme.</p><p>The Department's submission, as part of the capital plan review, includes provision for the development of a project pipeline for national roads.  Among the projects included in the pipeline is an upgrade of one section of the N24, from Cahir to Limerick Junction, which is 27 km.  The capital review process is under way and decisions on the outcome will be made before budget 2018.</p></speech>

One matter on I have great sympathy for him is the issue of roads and capital spending because there will never be enough funding.  Obviously, he has other competing capital public transport projects across Dublin and other cities.  I was in that Department and have sympathy for him.</p>  <p>  I will ventilate some issues for the Minister to put into the mix.  This opens up together all the ports across the south of Ireland.  Given our issues in regard to a range of other areas, including climate change, that should be considered.  Second, it opens up Shannon Airport.  It meets our spatial strategy plans.  We cannot continue developing this country based on the conurbation around Dublin.  We need to open up other parts of the country and I believe turning this into an motorway, even if we have to do it in stages, is critical in order to achieve it.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome what the Minister said.  I am taking it as a move in the right direction that, in consideration of upgrading the road from the Cahir on the M8 to Limerick Junction, which is a road desperately in need of being upgraded, it allows a continuation of the M8 motorway on to Limerick Junction and then from a road from Limerick Junction into Limerick, which is not as bad as the other area.  I implore the Minister.  Even if he could countenance doing that component of it, that would be welcome.  It would open up that part of the country and allow for continuation of the work when more funding is available.  I encourage the Minister to do that.  I believe it would open up the whole area, particularly a part of the country that has not had infrastructural investment.  There are serious issues, for instance, in Tipperary town and the surrounding areas.  We need to allow for greater investment in that whole area and this would do so.  Even if the Minister were to look on it favourably, it would be welcomed by all sides of the House.</p></speech>

I am glad that the Deputy who has been in this position realises that the competing considerations are overwhelming in this case, particularly as the capital plan looms and decisions have to be made in the autumn.  I will certainly bear in mind what he said about the ports and Shannon Airport.  They are strong points.</p>  <p>  The plan provides for a gradual build up of capital funding towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  It will, however, take some years yet to restore the steady State funding levels for land transport.  There will be a significant increase in funding from 2020 which will facilitate the construction of the national road improvement projects included in the plan.  While available funding is not sufficient to address all the demands for improvement schemes, including schemes such as the upgrade of the N24, by the end of the plan period I expect that capital funding for the road network will be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works in the future.</p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the plan period for national road projects, the capital plan review process is under way and my Department is making a strong case for extra funding to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including the development of a project pipeline for national road schemes.  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government as a whole.</p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Charles Flanagan on his appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality.  I thank him for his co-operation while Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I had a few difficult issues to try to get passports and a few matters over the line and thank the Minister and his office for what he was able to do for me at the time.  I wish him well in his new appointment because it is a challenging role.</p>  <p>  If I might be so bold, this legislation might not be one of the Minister's priorities.  My party has looked at it - Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, our spokesperson, has gone through it in great detail - and formed the opinion that it is unnecessary at this time to spend time debating this legislation.  If one looks at various aspects of the legislation and the reasons it is before the House, all one can see is that it is an ego trip and that it is not necessary.  If I reflect what the people of Cork North-West are saying to me on a daily basis, it is about neither the appointment of the judges, nor how members of the Judiciary have been appointed since independence in the 1920s.</p>  <p>  The Judiciary has stood the test of time.  The method of appointment of members of the Judiciary in the past 22 years has involved a selection process.  Following the debacle of the appointment of a High Court judge in 1994, there was new legislation.  That legislation, no more than the system that was there in terms of Government appointment, involved the Executive having the sole responsibility for appointing judges.  If one examines that through the decades, there have been many fine persons appointed.</p>  <p>  The language being used suggests there was some kind of cosy cartel between the politicians and the legal profession out of which judges were appointed.  However, given the system of appointment, the reality is that the court system has served the country extremely well.</p><p>Let us consider any comparison throughout the European Union, the developed world or any system that has measured our judicial appointments or the system that has led from the appointments of the Judiciary.  They have been well received throughout the world.  We have been seen as having appointed excellent judges.<br/><br/>Many people have served on the Bench and have made difficult and controversial decisions on a raft of issues, but they have always taken the letter of the law.  They have taken what we have presented to them as the Oireachtas or by way of referendum.  They have taken the law and conscientiously gone through it.  It is peculiar to think that we are now debating at length this legislation because there is somehow some flaw in the way our judicial appointments are made.  When I talk to the ordinary person on the street I sense the utmost respect for the judges.<br/><br/>Many facets or aspects of Irish society in the past 20, 25 or 30 years have definitely been challenged.  The establishment and some aspects of church and State that had been held on a pedestal for many decades have been challenged.  However, the one that has served us throughout is the judicial system.  When we see people challenging the judicial system, they are always challenging judgments that went against them.  It is by far the better way that judicial appointments have been made.  Therefore, we have appointed singularly capable people to the Benches of all the courts.<br/><br/>We are now left with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  I respectfully suggest there are far more important issues that need to be debated on the floor of the House before we head into the summer recess.  Such issues are pressing on the minds of people.  We had a debate in the House earlier on respite care in County Louth.  The way the respite care system for people with disabilities or the elderly has been run could be extended to the entire country.  Over the weekend many parents expressed considerable concern on the matter.  Such bread-and-butter issues are affecting every family throughout the country, yet they are not jazzed-up enough, sexy enough or controversial enough to bring to the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  They are seen as mundane issues.  However, these are not mundane issues for families at the receiving end of these services.  People ask me at my clinic on a Friday, Saturday or Monday to raise these issues.  Then, I say the whole week is given over to judicial appointments.  The people concerned have the same reverence for the judges.<br/><br/>The judges in turn go through the legislation that they are charged with and they ensure they give judgments.  We have seen many cases, although I have no wish to comment on any individual case - that is not my remit as a Member of the Oireachtas.  We have seen many cases with commentary.  As a case is going on, it is reported in the media.  Judgments are made in terms of how a case is going to conclude and whether persons are going to be found guilty of the offence or found not guilty of the offence.  There is debate on the length of time that is going through it.<br/><br/>We see the judicial system works, the way the jury is appointed and the way advice is given by the judges to the jury.  They always ensure they are implementing the law properly.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should applaud the system in place.  We should applaud the way that the judges have been appointed and how they have administered, by and large, the courts system.  Of course there needs to be further change as time passes.  We can go back to the 1937 Constitution since the provisions were first put into the Constitution.  We should look at how better to do it.<br/><br/>This Bill is unnecessary at this time.  There are some words in it.  It is completely and absolutely unnecessary at this time.<br/><br/>From the crash in 2008 right through to now, many fine people have spoken <i>ad nauseam</i>on radio and television and in the Houses of the Oireachtas about quangos, the amount of quangos, the cost to the State of these quangos and the amount of people appointed to these quangos.  There was discussion on how to reduce and minimise the bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy had created a major cost to industry and to society whether in the services sector or elsewhere.  &quot;Quangos&quot; was the buzz-word.  The front of the Sunday newspapers ran stories on how more quangos must be reduced, scrapped or done away with.  The 2011 election was to be a reforming election that was going to turn the world on its head.  The first thing that was going to be done by the most reforming of candidates was the getting rid of quangos.  There was no longer going to be toleration in society of quangos.  Let us suppose we wanted to press that issue or go through the commentary on that issue.  What quangos would we get rid of or cut?  An bord snip nua was looking at quangos with a view to getting rid of them in 2008 and 2009 after the crash.  What are we doing here and now with this legislation?  We are creating another quango.  We find fault in how judges have been appointed.  We find fault with how the letter of the law and the legislation has been applied to the nth degree since 1995.  How do with find fault with it?  We create another quango.<br/><br/>Other issues arise and I want to develop them also.  One of the main issues that people have in society was discussed here earlier.  It relates to the insurance industry and how the cost of insurance has quadrupled or doubled in recent months.  Today, we learned of various investigations by the European Commission into how insurance and the cost of insurance is being applied.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was put in place 20 years ago or more to try to reduce the cost of insurance.  We were to look at other jurisdictions and we were supposed to mirror the legislation on the basis of what people were advising.  Reference was made to Scotland and some other parts of the British Isles and Europe.  However, we are not looking at best practice there in respect of our insurance industry.  We are not looking at how to minimise cost or how the cost can be minimised for the general public.<br/><br/>Next week we will debate Report and Final Stages of legislation predominately.  That has been the tradition since I came to the House.  Legislation is developed over a period and then it comes to the final week.  It is brought in to ensure it is passed on Report and Final Stages such that it can be sent to the Seanad before the summer recess.  We are now in the second last week of the session and we are debating legislation that has been put into three or four periods of Government time.  This legislation will not be enacted before the summer.<br/><br/>We need to look at what is being proposed and ask whether there is such urgency about it.  What is being proposed is not going to help our cause as Ireland Inc.  The most important question that we should ask as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas with every tranche of legislation is whether in five or ten years it is going to improve the livelihoods of ourselves or our citizens.  Ultimately, as Members of the Oireachtas, we are sent to the D&aacute;il as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, as messengers of the D&aacute;il.  Our job is to ensure we serve the people, whether they live in Cork North-West, Dublin, Donegal or Laois, and that we bring the basic message in respect of what people want.  As in any republic, we are here at the behest of the people to represent the people.  We are here to represent them to the best of our ability.<br/><br/>What is to be gained by adding further layers of bureaucracy?  Let us go back over the years and consider any assessment of legislation that was taken in this House.  There is one thread running through all of it: rushed or hurried legislation or legislation taken because of a specific issue, a political issue or because of someone's vanity ends up being poor legislation, by and large.  Legislation should be teased out.  People should make honest contributions every time in terms of how they want to proceed and how they want to see the best for society.  What we are trying to do as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, no more than any ordinary life, is ensure the Ireland we leave after us is better for the next generation and the generation after that.</p><p>As we spend three or four days discussing this legislation far more important issues in the education and health sectors are being sidelined to put through this vanity project.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is opposed to the Bill because we believe it is unnecessary at this point.  In the past week or ten days, many fine commentators have reviewed this legislation.  By and large, the view is that judicial appointments are at the behest of politicians and that only persons connected to senior politicians can hope to be appointed to the Judiciary.  When one forensically examines the system, one finds that since the foundation of the State all of the very fine appointees to the Judiciary, by all of the political parties, including Cearhball &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, excelled as court judges and they served the State well.  In terms of this legislation, we will no longer be allowed to appoint people to the Judiciary because it might be tainted if the appointees are in some way associated with politics.  The Executive appoints the Judiciary.  That is sacrosanct in the Constitution.  It is the methodology of appointments that is in question.  There has been a rush to denigrate appointments made in the past, despite the fact that those appointed have been excellent judges.  They took the oath and they have carried out their roles responsibly, whether in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or any other court to which they were appointed.  </p> <p> Politics and politicians are held in poor regard throughout the country.  Truth be told, there are many people who wish with the strike of one match they could do away with the Members of this House and all others who practise politics, be that on local authorities or in the Seanad.  Democracy is praiseworthy.  It is the best form of government to ensure that people are held accountable.  We are all aware of the many dictatorships across the world and of the poverty and suffering therein of men, women and children.  Two years ago, when a picture of a child in one dictatorship was shown on the front page of the newspapers there was outrage.  We do not cherish democracy in this country.  We should praise people who have been appointed to the Judiciary because they have not been challenged in terms of the decisions they have made.  They have made very fine decisions and issued fine judgments.  I refer members to the cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six across the water.  We did not have similar cases here because our judges were thorough in terms of how they implemented and practised the law.  It is a disservice to us as politicians and a disservice to democracy and the Judiciary to say there is a need to take the grubby hand of politicians away from the appointment of judges because such appointments would be tainted and so on.  We should be firm in our praise of judges.</p> <p> In regard to free legal aid, there has been outcry in regard to manner in which it is granted.  The free legal aid system was established to assist the many people who were involved in family disputes or needed to defend themselves from scurrilous accusations and so on but were unable to access the courts because of the cost of legal proceedings.  There are people who are questioning the availability of free legal aid.  Rather than putting in place another quango, as provided for in this legislation, we should be discussing legislation to ensure a fairer distribution of free legal aid and greater transparency around that process.  We do not need more quangos.  There is no necessity for this quango which is proposed by the same people who in articles in the public press in 2008, 2009 and 2010, said that this country was being run by quangos and that the decisions being made by quangos were not implemented by politicians being held accountable and so forth.  Over the next of days, as we did last week, we will be debating legislation that seeks to establish another quango that will cost multiples of the cost of the current system of appointment of judges.  Perhaps somebody will point me to the flaw in current system and why it is necessary to make this change.  Is this a vanity project, an ego trip or is it genuinely needed by the people to ensure that we have more rather than less respect for the Judiciary?  </p> <p> While places such as Kanturk or Charleville or anywhere else are faced with many challenges, top of their list is not appointments to the Judiciary or the practices of the Judiciary.  This would be fair from their minds.  We in this House are duty bound to reflect on the concerns of citizens and to act accordingly by introducing legislation, be that legislation to ensure people receive proper respite care and so on.  I know of families who have not received respite care for three or four years.  Is that not as important or more important than the legislation we are discussing tonight?  It is more important, as is the lack of roll-out of broadband across rural communities.  I could speak here for the next 40 minutes about all of the issues we should be debating rather than this unnecessary legislation.</p></speech>

It is still referenced today because it is very pertinent and true.  It is also relevant to this debate.  Although the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is in the Chamber the driving force behind this Bill is undoubtedly his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  His rationale for this legislation is that he wants to take on the judges and, as per his rationale in regard to other crusades on which he has been on during his time in politics, to take on the establishment, do away with the insider appointments and shake things up.  This is the constant theme behind what drives the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in politics.  I wonder if the Minister doth protest too much because having been a Member of the Seanad for many years since the early 1980s he is not exactly an outsider.  Indeed, he would qualify as an archetypal insider.  One wonders why it is he wants to rail against others and constantly protests that he is not an insider.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, is also the leader of the Independent group.  During the election campaigns in 2011 and 2016 there was such a surge of support for the Independents they told everyone when they were elected they would seek to change politics for the better and deliver for the public.  Following the last general election many of them got their opportunity to enter Government but they decided not to do so and they scattered four sheets to the wind.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and some of his colleagues stepped up to the mark and decided to go into government.</p><p>One year on, as we come to the end of this D&aacute;il term, what does the Minister have to show for himself?  What legislation are the Independents in government choosing to expedite with their political capital?  It is the Bill dealing with the way in which judges are appointed with which we are dealing today and which took up a good deal of D&aacute;il time last week.  As the Minister and I both know, that issue was not raised in the general election campaign, nor was it seen as a problem by many of the electorate, yet for the Minister, it is the one item of legislation on which he is hanging his hat.  As such, it is his signature piece.</p> <p> Ireland has made a very strong bid to host the Rugby World Cup.  We are told by the Minister concerned that the legislation to enable that to happen is very important.  We will deal with it before the end of this D&aacute;il term, but why was it not prioritised by the Minister, instead of the legislation before the House?</p></speech>

He wants to get big headlines.  He knows that the media, if no one else, will cover his attack on the judges.  There are column inches in it, which is particularly attractive to him.  Unfortunately, for many years he has been riding his white horse and conducting several moral crusades.  However, as we have seen since he got into government, the white horse has been put out to grass and instead he is on the pig's back in terms of having a Cabinet seat and he is very much enjoying the experience.  He has arrived at a Cabinet position, unfortunately from the public's point of view, but we are not seeing the delivery of any serious measure from him.  We are not seeing any leadership or getting any insight from him on what he wants to deliver in his Department.  Instead, we have seen him being willing to meddle in other issues, including majoring in this issue, but showing no willingness to grasp the opportunity he has received as a Cabinet Minister to make a real difference in the portfolio he was given.  For example, delivery in the areas of transport, tourism and sport has been minimal.  The interest he has shown in those areas has been little to none.  We waited several months before there was any plan of action from him, other than items from other Departments which interested him but none from his Department.</p><p>On recent replies to parliamentary questions from my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, about the Open Skies agreement, the Minister has not been engaging in any dedicated way with fellow Ministers from other European nations to try to protect it.  I see no interest being shown by him in transport projects in my constituency of Donegal.  We have a number of key projects that need to be moved on, yet he prefers to focus on an issue such as the one before us rather than, say, the need for a bypass around Letterkenny, a major town in my county, the need for a link road between Letterkenny and Lifford, or to progress the A5 project from Derry to Monaghan.  He has shown no interest in such projects.  </p><p>On tourism, we are not seeing anything of import coming from the Minister.  There is nothing additional with respect to new investment in the Wild Atlantic Way.  I have raised regularly on the floor of the House the need for an investment package in my county to exploit the potential offered by the <i>National Geographic </i>magazine in announcing Donegal as the coolest place on the planet in 2017.  This helps greatly in promoting the county and presents an opportunity for the Government to invest in it to develop its undeveloped tourism product, yet nothing has been forthcoming from the Minister.</p><p>If it is to be the Department of Justice and Equality that is to take up time on the floor of the D&aacute;il, I advise the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that we should be focusing on the Garda.  We should be spending time debating the need for Garda resources and proper garda deployment, an issue I have raised as it affects my county.  We have seen a 20% reduction in the number of garda&iacute; in the period from 2010.  We had 480 garda&iacute; previously, but the number is now just over 380.  Of the 1,000 new Garda recruits since 2014, only 17 have come to County Donegal.  I have corresponded with the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the issue.  I use this opportunity to highlight the need for the reduction to be addressed as new Garda recruits graduate.  Given that only 17 of the previous 1,000 garda recruits were allocated to County Donegal, the reduction needs to be addressed.  The emphasis needs to be placed on addressing gaps in the system.  I have no doubt that Donegal is not unlike a number of other counties in terms of the pressure garda&iacute; are under, but the problem is particularly acute in my county because of the pressure of policing the Border with Northern Ireland, a problem that is not recognised.  Many Border stations, in particular, have been starved of garda&iacute;.  It is impossible for the Garda force to offer the type of service expected and that the people require.  Over the course of the confidence and supply agreement, the objective is that the Garda force will reach 13,500.  I continue to liaise with the Minister to emphasise the need to address the under-resourcing of the Garda force in County Donegal in meeting that objective.  </p><p>Instead of addressing that issue we are dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and a massive amount of Government time is being devoted to the debate.  I make the point which made by all of my colleagues that Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the need to reform and improve the process by which judicial appointments are made.  In that regard, my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, brought forward a Bill more than a year ago to achieve that objective.  It is a superior Bill to the one brought forward by the Government.  Despite the fact that it was introduced in the D&aacute;il more than a year ago, the Government did not move to facilitate it being discussed at justice committee level by issuing the money order required for that debate to take place on Committee Stage.  It was remiss in not doing so.  Now there is a panic and a big push by it to deal with this Bill that was brought forward at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and on which a great deal of D&aacute;il time is being spent.  One has to ask why that is the case.  It goes back to the Cabinet's decision, taken at the former Taoiseach's last Cabinet meeting, to proceed with the appointment of the Attorney General, without her submitting an application to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board while she sat at the Cabinet table, to the Court of Appeal..  Meanwhile the Minister was happy to sit at the Cabinet table and nod the decision through, yet when the heat was on, we saw him revert to his crusade to clean up politics and the way judges were appointed.</p><p>Deputy Shane Ross has been on a crusade to clean up politics and the way judges are appointed.  The Minister had to restrain himself from laughing when the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in defence of himself after the appointment had been made, said how dare anyone else criticise him when he was only doing what others had done before him.  That is a long way from what he campaigned on and from his main crusade.  He let the mask slip.  He had the comfort of a Cabinet seat and being at the Cabinet table when the decision was made.  The decision of someone not being appointed through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was helped by getting Stepaside Garda station reopened.  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, was quite happy to agree to that thinking that it might well go through on the nod.  However, when he realised the public was not buying it, he reverted to type and went out to the plinth to criticise his own decision and look for a review of how the Cabinet made the appointment despite the fact he fully supported the decision at the time.</p> <p> One of the key differences between the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill and the one proposed by the Government is that our legislation requires the judicial appointments commission to give a preferential order in regard to the nominees it recommends to the Cabinet.  That is something any reasonable person would think is an improvement.  When one goes to the trouble of asking a commission to vet and conduct interviews and assessments on candidates' suitability, it follows and is logical that one would ask it to rank them in order of preference, based on its view and assessment of the most qualified candidates.  It has been pointed out that one of the weaknesses of the current system is that a number of names can go forward to the Cabinet with fairly limited information about their suitability and without being ranked.  It is then left to the Cabinet to decide without the full information available to help it make its decision.  The proposal put forward by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Government restricts it to three names but, as before, those three names would not be ranked.  That is a weakness in the legislation being proposed and one which does not make sense.  Under the Constitution, the responsibility for making the appointment must always rest with the Cabinet and it is entirely within its remit to appoint anyone, even outside of the list of nominations provided to it but when it is provided with the list, it should include details of the order of preference of the commission or board making the recommendation.</p> <p> The other key difference is the treatment of those with a legal or judicial background.  There has been much focus on this not least because members of the Judiciary have come out publicly on the point that the Government's Bill does not have the Chief Justice as the chairperson of the commission, the role being held instead by a lay person.  Also, the President of the High Court and the President of the District Court are not full members of the commission.  The Bill expresses a strong preference for people who do not have a legal background.  As with any other profession, one needs experience to be able to decide who is capable and best suited to carrying out roles, and that applies to the legal profession.  Under the legislation Fianna F&aacute;il proposes, while there would be a non-judicial majority on the commission, there is clear identification of who those lay members should be.  For instance, it includes representatives of the Legal Aid Board and Citizens Information Board, people who have a role and something to contribute to the process.  There is a clear purpose behind why those people are there.  The clarity in our legislation is welcome.  This is a flaw in the Government's legislation.</p> <p> I urge the Minister to take on board the amendments proposed by this side of the House and to look at the structure of Fianna F&aacute;il's legislation which we believe is superior.  I reiterate to the Government and the House our disappointment that this is the Bill on which the Government is majoring, albeit at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross.  It is a poor reflection on the Government that this is its signature legislation for this D&aacute;il term, coming from the Independent branch of the Government.  It certainly does not reflect the mandate it was given by the public or the platform on which it campaigned in the recent election when it sought the electorate's support.</p></speech>

I will take the opportunity to wish the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, well in his new role.  He will bring much energy and vigour to the role.  He was a justice spokesperson at one time.  That was before he backed the wrong horse but he has landed into the hot seat now and I wish him well.  He was taken out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at a crucial juncture and events in the North are not moving satisfactorily.  The Minister was making a positive contribution to that.</p>  <p>  To return to the business at hand, if any Member came into the House and called someone a fraud it would be wrong, especially if the person was not a Member of the House.  It is fair to lay the charge that someone who is a Member of the House is a political fraud.  The actions of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in his crusade, the debate around judicial appointments and the dishonest misrepresentation on which he has campaigned over the years are very concerning to me and many right-minded people.  This is a man who has authored a book on the Judiciary and judicial appointments and has run a campaign for so long, describing the Judiciary as untouchable elites, taking every opportunity to unfairly denigrate our Judiciary.  I am not saying everything is hunky-dory with the Judiciary.  There are challenges but there are challenges in every section in our public service.  We all have an obligation and a responsibility to address those issues.  A judicial appointments commission is badly required and there should be more training for judges and more diversity but to build a campaign and follow it through with proposed legislation is very concerning.  I will not forget some of the commentary I heard after the last general election when the Independent Alliance was in consultation with Fine Gael to form a Government and there were various doorstep interviews outside Government Buildings.</p><p>This was at a time when there were and still are so many issues for discussion, such as homelessness, and we can go right down the line to include water, provision of housing and pay inequality.  Deputy Shane Ross had his Independent Alliance colleagues standing in front of Government Buildings telling the nation that what was between the negotiating parties was the appointment of members of the Judiciary.  It is interesting that during my time as justice spokesman this came up for debate over the years.  Everybody's starting point in the debate was that we have a very fine Judiciary and we are lucky to have such an independent and a fair-minded Judiciary.  People praise the current complement of people serving us on the Bench before ridiculing or decrying the system, in which everything is wrong.  They argue the system is compromised but at the same time we appear to be fortunate to have the Judiciary we have.  It is staggering hypocrisy.</p> <p> I agree with other speakers.  The Rugby World Cup bid Bill is of immense importance but it has been relegated to second place in terms of priority this week, despite the major impact that event could have on this country.  Apart from the criticism I have levelled at the Minister, Deputy Ross, for his crusade against judges and the Judiciary, one can ask what he has achieved outside of this within his Department.  He threw a lousy &euro;1 million to my part of the country to restart the programme for construction for the much-needed M20 motorway to link Cork and Limerick.</p> <p> I can give another example of the blatant hypocrisy with which he operates.  There is a very significant commercial semi-State port in my constituency, the Shannon-Foynes Port Company, and I am told that either at the end of this month or certainly within a number of short weeks, its board will not have a quorum and it will be unable to conduct meetings in a legal sense.  I submitted a parliamentary question in this regard with reference to all State agencies under the remit of the great Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, a number of months ago and there is a raft of vacancies.  What is going on?  These are agencies of State with obligations under company law and many other headings but they find themselves with corporate structures being fundamentally undermined by the inaction of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross.  He has stated applications are with the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p> There is another matter running in parallel to that problem.  A person presented before the committee on which I sit, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who was designated to chair the Health and Safety Authority.  He is a very competent and able individual.  We had an engagement with him prior to him taking his post.  I had no issue with his competence or ability to do his job.  I wish him well and I am sure he is doing a very good job.  He told the committee that he was not interviewed for the post at all and he just applied online before he was offered the job.  That leads to other questions about the system of appointments to State boards.  Is there now a scenario where we cannot have oversight or transparency in how the Public Appointments Service runs processes and competitions to fill these positions?  One would imagine at the very least there would be an interview but there was not in this case.</p> <p> I would like to be discussing other matters with the Minister instead of the judicial appointments process.  For example, there is the major problem with free legal aid.  It is a demand-led scheme, as the Minister knows, but week in, week out in my constituency I must deal with problems of access for marginalised and vulnerable people with regard to the civil arm of the free legal aid scheme.  Criminal free legal aid is absolutely dominant in budget terms and it is an area we must examine fundamentally.  There are battered spouses and people coming from other abusive relationships who need to seek redress or support in the courts but they cannot because when they apply for civil free legal aid, they are locked out or put on a waiting list on the never-never.  It is not really good enough in this day and age as these people's lives are so negatively impacted on.  We can compare this with the hardened criminal availing of the service on a continuous basis over weeks and months for offence after offence.  I know that there is the constitutional matter of having the right to a fair defence.  I would much rather see us discussing that subject tonight.</p> <p> Another matter pertaining to the Minister's Department that we must take seriously is the undocumented population in this country.  The Migrant Rights Council of Ireland tells us, correctly, that there is anywhere between 26,000 and 30,000 undocumented workers in the Irish shadow economy.  Apart from those people being vulnerable, exploited and unable to avail of the protection we have in the labour force, they are also suppressing wage rates because of their work in the shadow economy, which has an impact on people working in the official economy.  It is an area that comes within the Minister's remit.  We published a Bill during the previous D&aacute;il to regularise the undocumented and there was a presentation at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation today from the International Transport Workers Federation trade union, which represents people working in the fishing industry.  It is truly shocking to hear of the exploitation of a large number of workers in that industry and, in particular, a large number of undocumented workers.  We should be discussing such topics rather than this Bill.</p> <p> The differences between this Bill and the legislation proposed by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, is what is coming between our parties.  Nobody is against reform and the process must be reformed.  The key significant differences should be noted, including the ranking of names being forwarded.  There should be a ranking of first, second and third.  There should also be an obligation on the Government to give a reasoned explanation if any names are not put forward.  The Bill emanating from the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, makes a mockery of trying to remove the political patronage or interference he alleges from the judicial appointments process.  The Bill just has the provision for three names that can be rejected out of hand without a reason before going the other route.  At least with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill, there must be a ranking of first, second and third.</p></speech>

There are plenty of reasons for such a ranking process.  I am just pointing to the hypocrisy.  What has the Government got against the Chief Justice who is an independent and reputable person and officeholder in this country?</p><p>Were the President to become incapacitated, under the Constitution, the Chief Justice would form one of the backfills, so to speak, for that vacancy in a temporary capacity, yet the Government and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, believe the Chief Justice should be relegated in that process, which is very worrying.  If he has not already done so, the Minister might explain the reason the Government has moved away from the Chief Justice in that regard.</p> <p> There is no doubt that the Minister is establishing a quango.  Truth be told, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board sits neatly as a sub-set of the Courts Service.  When the Taoiseach sat on this side of the House, I recall him making a campaign out of the need to cull quangos.  That is a fair criticism.  I  cannot recall the exact numbers he cited at the time, but he and his party were going to do the devil and all to deal with what he described as the proliferation of quangos, yet here we are establishing another quango.</p> <p> The controversy about the appointment of the former Attorney General to the Court of Appeal was not properly explained to any of us.  The Minister should take the opportunity to do so.  Why did the former Attorney General not excuse herself from the process?  Why did she not apply in the normal fashion, as provided for under the existing legislation, to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and be approved for appointment were she to meet the criteria?  Apart from assessing candidates' suitability and qualifications, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board assesses other issues such as tax compliance, for example.  Anybody who applies to the board must be able to furnish proof of tax compliance, including up-to-date tax clearance certificates.  Was any of that background checking done as part of the appointment process?  That is a fair question and I do not mean it to be personal.  The appointment was discussed, but that aspect did not arise.</p> <p> The appointment of the lay people who are to sit on the judicial commission represents the major difference between us and the Government.  We have made the point that non-medics would not be appointed to select medics.  People with qualifications, experience and a background in the area are needed to do this.  In terms of the backgrounds of the persons who should sit on the commission, the Bill Deputy Jim O'Callaghan brought forward was the right way forward.  Incidentally, the Legal Services Regulation Bill which was passed by the previous D&aacute;il drew from the same complement of persons in terms of people who were considered competent in the area of law, justice and advocacy matters.  I do not understand why the Minister will not consider people from the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Citizens Information Board, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Human Rights and Equality Commission and the free legal advice centres, FLAC.  That is something he has to take on board because we cannot have a situation where people who know nothing about the operation of the law or the criminal justice system are sitting on the commission.</p> <p> There is something else we should bear in mind.  Who will choose the people in question?  Ultimately, they will be politically appointed, which gives the lie to the way the Minister is trying to remove political influence from the process.</p> <p> To return to my point about the backgrounds from which people who will sit on the commission should come, it was very clever of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan to outline in his Bill the calibre of person who should be appointed as a judge.  He referenced integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness and equanimity.  He rightly pointed out that not everybody would possess all of these skills, but what he outlined would go a long way towards dealing with the criteria.</p> <p> The point my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, and my party leader have made on a number of occasions represents the right position to take from our point of view, namely, that this new quango that the Minister is proposing, with its lay majority appointed through a political process, will not achieve what the Minister has set out to achieve in removing what he calls political influence from the process.  We all recognise that is the Government's choice, but if in the future Fianna F&aacute;il believes it is not working, we are indicating our right to change the legislation if we find ourselves on the Minister's side of the House.  That is something with which I agree.</p></speech>

He is a man of great experience.  He is well suited to his new role in which I wish him well.  On that note, he must sit uneasily with this legislation that has been put before him, given the background and history of the Minister who is pushing it in Cabinet.  It must sit uneasily with a man of the Minister's experience.  If the issues highlighted by Fianna F&aacute;il are not of concern to him - I will revert to them shortly - he must surely be concerned about those who are supporting the Bill.  Those in the ranks of Sinn F&eacute;in are pushing the Bill and supporting the Minister on it.  That must sit very uneasily with him.  If that is not enough to point out that the Bill is seriously flawed, I do not what is.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il believe there is a need to reform the judicial appointments process.  However, the Bill is flawed.  I do not want to repeat what has been said, but not having the Chief Justice as chairperson of the commission does not make any sense.  This is poor, flawed legislation and I ask the Minister to examine it closely and amend it.  Also, it is farcical that the Presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court will not be members of the commission.</p>  <p>  On recommending three people but not pushing forward one over another, in any job for which someone applies there is always a preferred candidate.  That is the way it should be because it works.  This proposal is unworkable.</p>  <p>  Without wishing to rehash everything that has been said by my colleagues in the past few hours, I ask the Minister, as a man of integrity and experience, to seriously examine the issues we have pointed out to him and look at the people who are supporting him on this legislation, their record on the judicial system and the way they have disrespected it for many years.  He should bring forward the necessary amendments to make the Bill workable and worthwhile because in its current format it is not workable or worthwhile.</p></speech>

It is obviously a challenging portfolio in which there have been crises in the six years I have been involved in politics.  I genuinely wish him good luck as he has his work cut out for him.</p><p>I have to confess that when all of this kicked off a few weeks ago, I knew as much as most people about the appointment of judges, which was next to nothing.  I knew that the Cabinet made decisions and that there had been political influence in the appointment of judges for many years.  I had a vague sense that the process needed to be reformed, but I have to admit that it is not an area I really knew.  In the past few weeks, therefore, I have been listening to D&aacute;il debates and commentary in the media and, in preparation for the debate on the Bill before the House, I looked in more detail at the Minister, Deputy Ross' Bill - the Government's proposed Bill - and also at Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal, which is being led by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, whom I commend for what appears to be a serious piece of legislative work.</p><p>There is agreement among the majority of the House, possibly all of it, that the judicial appointments process needs to be reformed.  Unfortunately, my reading of the Bill and the expert analysis of it is that it will not achieve the reforms needed.  That, ultimately, is the problem.  I do not believe the Bill should be supported by the Government or the Oireachtas.  It would be very peculiar if it was voted through by a combination of the Government and Sinn F&eacute;in.</p><p>Under the current process, when a vacancy comes up, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advertises the post.  It receives job applications from lawyers, as only they are allowed to apply to be judges.  The board then determines who is suitable for the role.  This is important.  It does not provide guidance on who it believes is best for the role and does not rank the names on the list it sends to the Cabinet.  Its job, essentially, is filtering out who is a suitable lawyer for appointment to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Court of Appeal.  It provides the list for the Cabinet which then deliberates.  Interestingly, I read commentary by Dick Spring who said that when he was a member of the Cabinet and asked to go through a long list of lawyers for appointment to the Bench, he had no idea who the best candidates were or who might not be good candidates, even though they might be eligible for the job.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board essentially sends a letter to the Cabinet which chooses from the list.</p><p>I believe anyone looking at that process would say it needs to change.  It is not merit-based in terms of rank.  It is based on suitability and then some political decisions and is not very transparent.  We all know that it needs to change.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was described by one of those involved in its creation as a &quot;temporary fix&quot;.  In 2014 the Association of Judges of Ireland acknowledged that the process was unsatisfactory and needed to change.</p><p>The list of suitable candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for the Cabinet includes only those candidates who are suitable and no ranking is provided for the Cabinet, which obviously leaves the process open to political patronage, something we all want to get rid of.  The public, Members of the Oireachtas, the legal profession and the Judiciary all want to see not just suitable lawyers appointed to be judges but also the best, most suitable lawyers, in so far as they would make the best judges.  That means that we need to put in place an identifying body that could identify and evaluate the merits of candidates based on their suitability for the post.  Critically, such a body needs to be independent and completely free from political considerations at the Cabinet.  That is something on which we would all agree.  It is reasonable that we have an independent, expert advisory board that could present a list of suitable and ranked candidates, in terms of who the advisory board thinks are the very best candidates, one that would be completely free of the political considerations of the Cabinet.  It seems reasonable to want this in the appointment of judges.</p><p>Of course, the Bill before the House will not achieve this.  It does not set out the need to interview candidates, which is extraordinary.  I am not aware of any process for appointments to this level of job of this importance under which candidates would not be interviewed.  It is astonishing that this would be the case.  The proposed candidates will not be ranked and thus the process will not provide guidance on the comparative suitability of the candidates whose names will be put to the Cabinet.  Were I a member of the Cabinet and presented with a list of the names of three, five or 20 lawyers and to receive no guidance from an advisory body, I would be at sea in trying to say this lawyer or that lawyer, for the following reasons, appeared to be the strongest candidate.  I imagine that certainly some members of the Cabinet, were they to be honest, would say the same and that they would value some detailed guidance from an expert advisory group.</p><p>The Bill also posits the idea that lay people are better placed to make a judgement on the qualities of a prospective judge than judges or lawyers.  It is a core element of the mindset of the Bill that people who have never been lawyers or judges are somehow better placed to decide who would make good judges than those in the legal profession or the Judiciary.  That seems to be a very peculiar mindset to underpin the legislation.</p><p>Critically, of course, the Attorney General who sits at the Cabinet table is a member of the advisory board.  I not making any comment on a specific person who is or has been in the role of Attorney General or will be in the future.  However, it is as clear as day that if the Attorney General sits on the advisory board and is the only person sitting at the Cabinet table when the list is discussed, we have a direct link between the advisory board and the Cabinet which will make the decision.  By definition, that means that it is no longer independent.</p><p>The Bill before the House is widely recognised as being a proposal brought forward by the Independent Alliance, in particular the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross.  I was very taken by something he said in his statement in the House:</p><blockquote>The objective of the Bill primarily is to reduce, if it is not able to eliminate, political interference in the selection of judges.  This is the primary aim, and to do it as soon as possible. </blockquote><p>The Minister has a Bill and is stating that its primary aim is to eliminate political interference in the appointment of judges, yet we have a direct link between the advisory board and the Cabinet.  In addition, we will have no advice on the best candidates on the list sent to the Cabinet, which leaves the process wide open.  For example, one could say, &quot;We have five lawyers in front of us.  We do not know what their merits are as we are not lawyers and do not spend our time in court, so we do not know which of them would make the best judge of the District Court or the Circuit Court.  However, we know this person because he or she is in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in and that he or she is a good person, so let us go with what we know.  We know that this person is decent, a good lawyer and a person of integrity and think he or she would make a great judge.&quot;  It is political patronage.  If that is the stated intention, self-evidently, the Bill will not achieve it.  The list of names put forward will provide no assessment of comparative suitability.</p><p>This is how the process will work under the Bill the Government is putting forward.  The applicants' suitability will be examined.  There will be no interviews.  There will be a lay majority assessing candidates for roles of which they would have very little experience and understanding of the requirements to be met.</p><p>Critically, under the legislation there will be no representation from the District Court, the President of which is excluded from being a member of the advisory board.  There will be no representation from the Circuit Court, the President of which is also excluded from being a member of the advisory board.  As the Minister knows - I knew even before I started to look into this issue - the majority of judges are appointed to the District Court and the Circuit Court.  On the advisory body there will be lay people who will make decisions about judicial appointments to the Circuit Court and the District Court with no representation from the Circuit Court or the District Court, persons who clearly would be well placed to provide an input on the type of man or woman who would make a great judge of the District Court or the Circuit Court.  There will be no ranking of candidates and the Attorney General who sits at the Cabinet table will be a member of the advisory board.  It seems to be a very peculiar way to achieve the end of removing political interference and ensure we have the best judges.  It just does not make sense to me.  I am not a lawyer and do not spend a lot of time in court and honestly do not know what the best characteristics of judges are.  I would not be able to pick the best candidate from a list of four or 20 lawyers whom I did not know, but I do know enough to know that the process I have outlined is, self-evidently, not the best way for Ireland to select the best judges.  Therefore, why are we discussing it?  Why is this being brought forward by the Government?</p> <p> The Bill further indicates that the Judiciary is, in some way, compromised, that having a majority of professionals on the board will in some way lead to political decisions.  There is no indication that this happens.  Furthermore, the introduction of lay people in no way insulates appointments of judges from political viewpoints.  It is absolutely reasonable for us to assume that lay people with political viewpoints, be they pro-life, pro-choice, pro or anti-European, would look to get onto the board to try to influence the views of the judges we will have in the future.</p> <p> The elements of the Bill we have outlined and which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has gone through in great length simply will not achieve its stated aims, but it does appear that the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill would achieve them.  What does the Bill do?  We will have a lay majority, but there is no indication why that is necessary.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has asked for an answer to be given on this issue on a number of occasions, but, to the best my knowledge, he still has not received a satisfactory answer.</p> <p> It has been stated - I am sure the Minister is sick of hearing the example given time and again - but for a lay person and a non-lawyer like me, if the Minister for Health was to say we would start appointing doctors and hospital consultants using a majority of non-medical people - that we would get somebody from the local GAA club, the local credit union, the local tidy towns committee, the principal of the local school, an eminent lawyer and an eminent human rights activist - to appoint cardiologists, neurologists and brain surgeons, it would not last 24 hours because we would all get that the head of the credit union was not well placed to appoint cardiologists and we would all understand the local school principal was not well placed to advise on the best junior doctor to become a neurologist.  However, because we are dealing with the world of the Judiciary it is complicated.  Most members of the public, including me, do not really understand this stuff, but that is essentially what we are suggesting.  We are suggesting the head of the credit union, the local school principal, a human rights activist and a local fisherman could appoint a neurologist, that we have a majority of lay people on the board and that we also have three doctors on it.  I do not think too many people would feel comfortable in getting sick if that is how we were to start appointing consultants or nurses, or teachers, but that is what we will do in the case of one of the most critical roles in the public service, namely, the Judiciary.</p> <p> Regardless of whether the Bill is passed, the Constitution still gives ultimate power to the Government to appoint judges.  In this case, the logical solution is to ensure it has access to the best possible advice, which means ranking candidates.  I heard the Minister's earlier rebuttal, that if the advisory body was to place candidates first, second and third, what would be the point of the Cabinet even meeting to discuss the matter as the first placed candidate would be chosen.  I would like to receive expert advice.  If I had to make decisions on appointing lawyers to become judges, I would like more than a list.  I would like to receive the expert advice of senior judges and others.</p> <p> The Bill before the House makes a mistake that is made far too often, which is that we identify the minimum standard required to be met.  The JAAB did this, but it should not have done and the Bill does it.  It fails to recognise the failing of this approach, in that it does not identify those who truly excel, the best possible candidates, and, obviously, does not eliminate political interference in the appointment of judges.  On the other hand, Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill would achieve these aims.  It would allow us to avail of sufficient expertise from the legal profession and the Judiciary.  There would be representation from the District Court and the Circuit Court and the Bill would mandate the holding of interviews.  It would also provide for rankings and the giving of expert advice to the Cabinet.  There would be nobody sitting on the advisory board who was also sitting at the Cabinet table.  There would be a mandatory explanation required from the Cabinet if it decided to go with a candidate from outside the list.  Obviously, it would still be the Cabinet's right to do so.  Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill states this could be done, but an explanation would have to be given for it.</p></speech>

While Fianna F&aacute;il fully believes in the need for reform of the judicial appointments system, we also believe the Bill published by the Government is deeply flawed.  Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed legislation to establish a judicial appointments commission, fully independent of the Government, that would make recommendations to the Government based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, who has put immense work into it.  He is an expert in the area.  As Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly stated, we need expertise in making any appointment but particularly in this profession which is critical for the country.  With the proposals for a lay majority and the downgrading of the Chief Justice&rsquo;s position, the Government has let the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, drive forward a spurious agenda which risks undermining the independence of the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 will change the way judges are appointed in Ireland.</p><p>A new body, the judicial appointments commission, will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Serving judges applying to another judicial position will have to apply through the judicial appointments commission.  It is imperative our judicial appointments process is reformed to ensure people are appointed to judicial office based solely on merit.  For that reason, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed legislation establishing a judicial appointments commission, fully independent of the Government, which would make recommendations to the Government based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office.</p> <p> The commission proposed by the Government will not allow for such an independent process of assessment.  That is the most critical and poignant part of this legislation. Among its faults, the Bill will require the Chief Justice to sit on a commission that she will not chair.  This is indicative of the disrespect that the Government has for the Judiciary.  This Bill will exclude the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts from full membership of the commission.  It is also recommended that the majority of the commission should be lay members, namely, persons who are neither judges nor lawyers.  This grouping of judges and lawyers in the same category by the Government ignores the fact that judges are not members of the legal profession.  The fact that they were previously members is not a basis to assume that judges and lawyers, if in a majority, will have a negative influence on this commission.</p> <p> The Bill proposes that the three persons recommended by the commission will not be ranked in order of merit.  The failure to do so defeats the entire purpose of having a commission that seeks to recommend the best candidate.  It is regrettable the proposals put forward by the Government are not for the purpose of achieving genuine reform but, instead, are for the purpose of appeasing one member of the Government whose proposals in this area are ill-considered and deeply flawed.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il remains committed to achieving reform in this area, as outlined in its Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, published in October 2016.  The weakness in the current system means that when a large list of names is presented to the Cabinet, most of them do not know how to go about choosing one person from a list of 24 for a District Court position.  There is no reason politicians should be aware of who is the most suitable or best candidate.  It is true people who have political connections are at an advantage if their names are on the list which goes to the Cabinet.  Many people who are appointed because of political connections turn out to be excellent judges.  We should not have a system whereby because a person is involved in politics, he or she should be excluded from subsequent nomination to judicial office.  We need a recommending body which can identify who it believes will be the best person for the position of judge.  We should have a recommending body that ranks individuals in terms of their suitability for the job.</p> <p> Under the Constitution, which is appropriate, the Government has the final say.  Regardless of what system is in place or how it operates, the Government can disregard the list of candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and appoint a candidate of its choosing.  This is the system which currently operates under the Constitution.  However, we believe it needs to be changed and broadened to ensure it is fairer and that the best people have an opportunity to be considered and appointed.</p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill establishes a judicial appointments commission to recommend to the Government the names of individuals who it believes would be the most suitable, based on merit, to be judges.  For each position, it will recommend three people.  The Government scheme has the same provision.  Under our Bill, however, the three will be ranked in order of one, two and three.  In no way does that offend the constitutional prerogative that rests with the Cabinet.  Under neither scheme must the Cabinet opt for anyone on the list.  However, there is a benefit in the Cabinet being told by a body with expertise that it believes these are the three best people in a certain order.</p> <p> I come from a different professional background in education.  In any interview panels on which I sat or was party to, there was always expertise on them.  That format has to be followed if we are serious about getting the best people in such critical positions in the Judiciary.  One would not put people with no teaching experience or nothing to contribute on a panel interviewing for a teacher, a vice principal or principal post.  Needless to say, the same should apply to appointing judges.</p> <p> There is a further important part of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill which differs from the Government&rsquo;s.  We set out specific criteria if people are to be appointed as judges.  It is important the public be apprised of what qualities one needs to be appointed.  This provision is not found in the Government&rsquo;s scheme.  It is important we set out in our legislation matters that may seem obvious.  One needs integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness and composure.  The greatest judge in the world will not have all these.  However, it is useful for the public to know what is required.</p> <p> A further way in which Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Bill is relevant concerns the membership of the commission.  The body of people most qualified to make recommendations are judges themselves and others who have experience.  Under our Bill, there would be 12 members on the commission.  These include the Chief Justice who is President of the Supreme Court and the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  They would be judicial members.  Interestingly, the Government has adopted hook, line and sinker the language of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, which is all about lay people and non-lay people.  It is offensive to judges that non-lay people, under the Government&rsquo;s scheme, are described as judges and lawyers.  Judges are not practising lawyers.  They were lawyers formerly.  The membership of the commission proposed and advocated by Fianna F&aacute;il is of persons who have the best interests of the people at heart when it comes to identifying individuals who would make good judges.  It is farcical to suggest that judges, such as presidents of the courts, will want to select for recommendation people who are their friends.  They will want to ensure the people chosen are effective and useful.</p> <p> The Association of Judges of Ireland issued a statement to express its concerns at several measures contained in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  The Judiciary is not opposed to the introduction of changes in the system of appointments to the Bench.  However, it believes, as does Fianna F&aacute;il, the proposals going before the Oireachtas are seriously flawed.  These concerns need to be listened to.  Reform of how judges are appointed will have significant consequences for this country that will impact long after the current Government is gone.  Unfortunately, this Bill is misguided and poorly constructed.  Fianna F&aacute;il remains committed to achieving reform in this area, as outlined in our Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  Again, I compliment our justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan, who has put immense work into it.  We should be listening to his expertise as he comes from a legal background and knows what he is talking about.</p></speech>

I know that he will do a good job as he was junior spokesperson in the justice position several years ago.</p>  <p>  I congratulate our justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan, on bringing forward his legislation which also proposes the establishment of a judicial appointments commission.  The Government&rsquo;s Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 will change the way judges are appointed.  A new body, the judicial appointments commission, will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, originally established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Serving judges applying to another judicial position will have to apply through the judicial appointments commission.  It will be made up of 13 members with a lay majority and lay chair.  It will be responsible for recommending a maximum of three candidates per judicial vacancy to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It will replace the current system where between seven to 20 names are submitted to the Minister.  The Bill provides that certain legal academics who have professional legal qualifications will be eligible to apply for judicial office.  The Bill establishes in law that judicial appointments will be based on merit.  An obligation to review the judicial appointments commission is included in the Bill.  The Bill&rsquo;s operation must be reviewed by the judicial procedure committee of the judicial appointments commission and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>
