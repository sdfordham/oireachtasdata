    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100003#A00400"><p>I have tabled this question in the light of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris where a large number of people were killed.  Given the fact that terrorism is global, that, whether we like it, Irish people have been caught up in terrorist attacks such as the one on the beach in Tunisia and that an Irish person was shot at the Bataclan theatre, does the Minister intend to introduce new measures to tackle terrorism as it impacts on us here?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100003#A00500"><p>As I said in the House last week, like other open and democratic states, Ireland cannot consider itself immune from the threat posed by international terrorism.  As the Deputy said, sadly, Irish people have been caught up in international terrorist attacks.  The current assessment of the threat to Ireland from this source is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely, nor is there any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given that the threat is evolving, the Garda Commissioner is carrying out a review and will let me know what additional requirements may arise.</p><p>European Union Justice Ministers held an emergency meeting in the week following the attacks in Paris on 13 November.  Ministers were at one in seeking to progress all reasonable measures to counteract the terrorist threat.  In this regard, the Council focused on several key issues, including the EU passenger name records, PNR, directive, supported by Deputies across the House, firearms, control of external borders and information-sharing of intelligence.</p><p>Co-operation between the police and intelligence services is essential.  Enhanced access for EU police and security services to data and intelligence-sharing has a critical role in the fight against terrorism.  Our involvement with Europol and Interpol is critical in that regard.  That said, opportunities which could further enhance that co-operation must be pursued.  In this regard, I am determined that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have access to the Schengen information system for terrorism and criminal purposes.  I have secured additional funding of &euro;4 million for this purpose.  The necessary steps in this regard will now be taken as quickly as possible by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i></p><p>I also emphasised that early agreement on the EU passenger name records directive will be important to ensure law enforcement services can have access to these data, supported by a robust framework of privacy and data protection safeguards.  The Council also welcomed new common European standards for deactivating firearms and enhanced efforts to tackle the smuggling of illegal weapons.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I am rolling out a very significant programme of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of recruitment, I announced recently that 600 new garda&iacute; would be recruited in 2016, bringing to a total of 1,150 the number of new garda&iacute; to be recruited since the Garda training college was reopened in September 2014.</p><p>Very significant investment has been made in the Garda fleet.  At the end of October I announced a further &euro;5.3 million for the purchase of an additional 260 Garda vehicles before the end of the year.  This will bring to a total of &euro;34 million the money that will have been invested in the Garda fleet since 2012.  I have also secured very significant investment in Garda information and communications technology resources.  Over the lifetime of the Government's capital investment programme, investment in Garda ICT will total &euro;330 million.  This will be essential to enhance and develop An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's capabilities into the future.</p><p>The Garda authorities have been taking all necessary security measures and the relevant agencies here co-operate closely on any threats identified.  Robust emergency planning arrangements are in place to address a large range of emergencies, from flooding to national security incidents.  There is an Office of Emergency Planning situated in the Department of Defence and the Minister for Defence chairs the Government&rsquo;s task force on emergency planning which meets regularly.  Planning arrangements for a range of emergencies are co-ordinated in this framework.</p></reply>

In the past two weeks some people have expressed surprise that the Minister has not attended meetings of the National Security Committee.  I appreciate that political attendance at these meetings has not been a feature until this point.  However, some people have expressed surprise that neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach has attended these meetings or even insisted on attending them.</p><p> I tabled a number of parliamentary questions about the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  One of the replies threw up the information that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not keep a record of the number of officers in the force who could speak languages that might be useful in monitoring the overseas terrorist threat.  Will the Minister comment on that issue?</p> <p> The Minister said she believed a threat was possible but unlikely.  We have no reason to disbelieve her.  However, there is no way of corroborating, examining or informing ourselves more on the level of threat.  What is the position of the Minister and the Government on having the matter of security examined by the Oireachtas or one of its committees?  In the United Kingdom Parliament the Intelligence and Security Committee was established under the Intelligence Services Act 1994 to examine policy, administration and expenditure on the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and Government Communications Headquarters.  It was reformed and amended by an Act of the UK Parliament in 2013.  Will the Minister, on behalf of the Government, comment on the capacity of the Oireachtas to examine security related issues?  As she is aware, we do not have and have not had an opportunity heretofore to question, for example, the Garda Commissioner about them.  There has been no political oversight or input.</p></speech>

For decades they have had to develop a level of expertise in explosives which continue to be placed by dissidents under cars in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will have seen arrests in recent months.  He will also have seen cases before the Special Criminal Court.  He will understand there is ongoing contact with the PSNI where the level of threat remains severe.  The professionals in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces have built up considerable experience in dealing with terrorism.  The new feature is its international dimension and the willingness of those involved to act as suicide bombers.  This is extremely challenging internationally, as is the phenomenon of returned fighters.</p>  <p>  When the Paris attacks happened, the strategic command and control centre of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na swung into action immediately.  On the Friday evening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in touch with its international counterparts.  I spent a number of hours being briefed on the Saturday afternoon.  The National Security Committee has been operated between officials.  The Taoiseach calls his own meetings of Ministers to discuss the information coming from that committee and to bring Ministers together to examine these important issues.  </p>  <p>  On access to language skills, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that garda&iacute; have access to all of the language skills and resources they require to enable them to support their operational activities in dealing with persons who may be a cause of concern here.</p></speech>

It has been reported that up to 30 people may have travelled.  They may have been residing in Ireland and may not necessarily have been Irish nationals or citizens.  Will the Minister give us an overview of this issue?  Does she know the number involved?  How big a complement are we talking about who are potentially engaged in these activities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100004#B00400"><p>The figure in the public arena is that approximately 30 to 40 people are known to have travelled to an area generally described as a conflict theatre which includes Syria and Iraq.  On their exact behaviour once they leave the country, it is known across Europe that many travel to Syria and Iraq by way of Turkey and other countries.  As the Deputy knows, there is engagement with Turkey on the security issues that arise.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would point out that people travel for a variety of reasons.  Some travel for humanitarian reasons, others go to see family while a small number travel to engage more directly in the conflict.  A number of people who were previously resident here, although not necessarily Irish citizens, have died abroad.  Furthermore, a number of people have travelled to the conflict zone and have returned to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very alert to any security concerns that might arise and is carefully monitoring all situations that might give rise to a threat to this country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100005#C00400"><p>The Government, as the Deputy knows, published a roadmap to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 21 October 2015.  The roadmap details the legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the convention, along with the estimated timeframe involved and a clear and unambiguous deadline for ratification by the end of 2016.  As announced, the Government has inter alia approved the drafting of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to make a range of miscellaneous amendments to statute law necessary to enable ratification.  Work on the general scheme of this Bill is underway, with a view to submission to Government very soon.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that we recently published a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and that we are at phase 2 of a three phase consultation process that will lead early in the New Year to the adoption of a new disability inclusion strategy.  I am committed to continuous improvement where equality and human rights are concerned and the development of this new strategy is an opportunity to bring about real improvements for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  While clearly there is a substantial legislative agenda across a number of Departments to get through, as set out in the roadmap, and a lot of work to be done to prepare a new inclusion strategy that can have a real and measurable impact, I can assure Deputy Mac Lochlainn and the House that we have the drive and enthusiasm to get it done.  I am glad that ratification of the convention is a common goal.  All political parties support ratification and I am pleased that the Deputy put this issue on the agenda for discussion today.</p>  <p>  Civil society groups and stakeholders are also keen to see the convention ratified.  Equality is about creating the circumstances that ensure that every individual has equal access to the enjoyment of their rights, with employment playing a central role in that regard.  We will maintain the momentum on ratification of the convention, as set out in the roadmap, to make sure that the rights of all persons with disabilities will be protected in our laws.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100005#C00500"><p>Prior to the last election five years ago, the then leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore were asked what their priority issue was and both said it was rights for people with disabilities, particularly the rights of families of children with special needs.  This Government has repeatedly introduced legislation in a matter of weeks, with some Bills going through all Stages in a single day, but legislation that would empower and protect people with disabilities and give them tangible and clearly defined rights has not been enacted.</p>  <p>  I note what the Minister of State said about enthusiasm and energy.  In fairness, the current Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality have been in office for just over a year and a half.  However, collectively, this Government has failed to address this issue.  There are only a few months left in this Government's term and I do not understand why we cannot proceed to ratify the aforementioned convention.  What is objectionable within the convention?  Why can we not ratify it?  Is it a case of civil servants, yet again, in the ear of the Minister of State saying that there may be unknown or unforeseen consequences and urging caution instead of proceeding and doing what is right?  This should have been done many years ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100005#C00600"><p>I assure the Deputy that nobody is having a word in anyone's ear urging caution.  The reality is that Ireland takes a different approach to these matters.  There are many countries around the world which will ratify this convention but it will have no meaningful effect.  Ireland does these things differently.</p><p>This means that effectively when Ireland ratifies a convention it has material effect.  Other countries can ratify it but it is a meaningless statement.  Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and is one of three EU member states yet to ratify.  I agree it has taken too long and have no difficulty in accepting that, but different countries take different approaches.  We take our international obligations very seriously and we do not ratify until we can guarantee compliance.  We sign conventions as a declaration of our commitment that we want to apply the convention concerned in Ireland but we ratify when we can guarantee to our international partners that we are meeting our commitments.  We could ratify in the morning, but we still have a number of steps yet to take.</p> <p> Under the Constitution, the conduct of international affairs is the responsibility of Government, and this includes ratification of international conventions.  However, the sole prerogative of legislating for the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  This is also reflected in Article 29.6 of the Constitution, which states that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State, save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.  That is how we do things in Ireland.  When we ratify, it has meaningful import.</p></speech>

The five-year term of this Government is now almost complete.  A range of legislation has been drafted, identified as a Government priority and pushed through ahead of recesses and, sometimes, pushed through all Stages on the one day.  We are not going to resolve this by arguing here today.  What needs to be agreed by all parties, on all sides of these Houses, is that in the term of the next Government, whatever its make-up, we collectively commit to ratification of this convention and to addressing the legislative issues, and that we give that commitment to people with disabilities and their families, as well as the disability NGOs.  As the Minister of State can probably guess, it is the disability NGOs that are demanding the meetings with the political parties.  They are saying that we in these Houses have failed to address these matters and, ultimately, this Government has failed.</p>  <p>  I am not saying the Minister of State or his senior colleague care less about people with disabilities than I do.  However, we have to accept there has been a failure in this Government term and it cannot happen again in the term of the next Government.  We cannot make people with disabilities a second, third or fourth priority.  They need to go to the top of the priority list the next time.</p></speech>

While I take the Deputy's point about the ratification of the convention, I have stated the reasons that Ireland has a different approach to other countries.  In terms of the equality agenda, in every area I and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, deal with, from LGBT rights to people with disabilities, to Travellers and to migrant issues, employment always comes up as a central issue for all people on the edge of society who want to get involved in the mainstream.  In particular, this includes dignity at work, access to the labour market and protection within work.  That is why the comprehensive employment strategy was key to the Government's work in this area.  If a person has a disability that does not restrict them from entering the workforce, or if a person is in the workforce and acquires a disability, the person can be a part of the workforce.  We feel passionately about that, which is why we place so much emphasis on it.  That is a key part of this Government's commitment to people with disabilities and will continue to be so.</p></speech>

I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Mizen was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a national co-ordination office to provide appropriate policing responses to maintain public order and to ensure the safety of all involved in protests against water charges.  In this context, one approach which the Garda authorities adopt is to make use of open source information.</p><p>Open source information is generally and publicly available on the Internet and social media platforms, not just to the Garda but to anyone, anywhere.<br/><br/>I am further informed that Operation Mizen does not engage in technical surveillance or interception and I can confirm that no public representative or member of the public is subject to such surveillance by Operation Mizen.</p></speech>

I seek clarification from the Minister.  She said one of the approaches adopted involves making use of open source information.  What other approaches are used by the Garda to monitor protesters?  She also said that she was further informed that no public representative or member of the public is subject to such surveillance by Operation Mizen, which refers to technical or interception surveillance.  Is any member of the public or any public representative subject to another form of surveillance?  The only thing ruled out in the Minister's response is technical surveillance.  Are there other forms of surveillance?  For example, is there monitoring of people's whereabouts, etc., which people come under?</p></speech>

It was set up by the Garda to support national co-ordination of its management of water protests from a public order perspective.  While there have been many lawful and peaceful protests against water charges, there have also been some very unfortunate examples of unacceptable and violent protests, including outside the gates of this House.  The Garda must take whatever appropriate measures it considers necessary to facilitate those who want to protest peacefully and to ensure public safety where necessary.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has made it clear to me that no public representative or member of the public is subject to technical or lawful interception by Operation Mizen.  I am sure the Deputy would agree with me that it is essential that people obey the law and demonstrate peacefully, whatever the issue at hand.  There is no question but that the right to protest is fundamental in any democracy and we must protect and facilitate it.  However, that right must be exercised peacefully.  The function of the Garda in respect of public protests and demonstrations is to facilitate them taking place in a peaceful and orderly way, without undue disruption to the daily life and business of others.</p></speech>

Are members of the public or public representatives subject to any form of surveillance by Operation Mizen or the Garda as a result of participating in anti-water charges protests?  The Minister referred to one of the approaches involved, making use of open source information, but what other approaches are used by the Garda to gain information on anti-water charges protestors?</p><p>This goes back to the story originally reported in the <i>Daily Mail,</i>which referred to six months of monitoring of protestors, the compilation of profiles and the gathering of intelligence on their whereabouts from sources.  The simple question is: is this taking place?  Are protestors subject to surveillance other than lawful interception, which is denied by the Minister, as a result of being protestors?  Is that the case?  If the Minister is refusing to answer that question, is it not extremely sinister that people would be targeted for surveillance by garda&iacute;, through the use of taxpayers' resources, as a result of participating in protests?</p></speech>

It carries out its normal activities as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this country in order to ensure that the protests are peaceful.  A total of 188 arrests have been made since November 2014 in regard to water charge protests and within that number some individuals have been the subject of arrest on multiple occasions.  The majority of arrests made relate to public order offences and breaches of section 12 of the Water Services Act, although there have been arrests for more serious offences.  Obviously, in order to ensure people can participate in peaceful protests, garda&iacute; go about their business as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and deal with situations as they arise and take the appropriate action to deal with them.  As I said, since November 2014, 188 arrests have had to be made in regard to peaceful protests.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na goes about its normal business of keeping the peace, whether it be at a water protest or in another situation.

I ask this question in the light of the publication of the CSO crime statistics which we are now getting independently verified and on a quarterly basis and also against the backdrop of a number of high profile incidents which have been reported in the news, for example, the conviction of the gang in Clonmel recently and the death of a constituent of mine, Mr. John O'Donoghue, during a burglary on his own property in Doon, County Limerick.</p></reply>

The Deputy will have seen the advertisement this week for 600 new garda&iacute; who will be recruited early next year.  We have already received expressions of interest from thousands of people.  I am looking forward to the initiative going ahead.  It is very important that the moratorium on recruitment to the Garda training college in Templemore has ended.  The Taoiseach and the Government have committed to ongoing continuous recruitment.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Government's strategy to tackle this issue, we are getting tougher on serious and repeat offenders.  Investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the law effectively is critical.  The Deputy saw the launch yesterday of the JARC, the joint agency response to crime.  The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill is before the House and provides tougher measures to target repeat burglary offenders.  A further initiative has been taken by the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  Significant new resources in manpower, vehicles and surveillance activities were announced on budget day and the capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021.  As we now have a more stable economy and the public finances are in better shape, we can begin to invest again and have done so in the past two years.  There is a budget of &euro;1.1 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which was increased last year for the first time in several years.  All of this enhances capacity.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor is also critical.  Its five strands include intensive community involvement by way of Muintir na T&iacute;re text alerts and whole-of-community engagement in responding to the challenging issues communities face.</p></speech>

Many of those involved in the Garda Reserve will welcome this and will be glad to see some progression.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the unfortunate passing of a man in Doon in my constituency, Mr. John O'Donoghue.  With the Minister's colleague and a number of other public representatives, I attended the launch in Doon yesterday of the text alert scheme.  Senior Garda personnel from the Limerick division were present.  The message coming back to them was that people wanted to see more garda&iacute; based in the community and backed up by resources.  Everybody in this House subscribes to that view.</p>  <p>  We know that there are about 1,500 garda&iacute; who are eligible to retire today or any time soon and that the Minister is recruiting up to 600.  It is my party's position that we would like to see the force being brought back up to a figure of 14,000 in the lifetime of the next Government.  What is the Minister's view on that proposal?  Will a vigorous recruitment campaign be undertaken for the 1,100 members of the Garda Reserve?</p><p>There are many people who are ready, willing and able to partake and give of their service to their own communities to address concerns like those we heard in Doon last night.</p></speech>

A figure of 14,000 should be arrived at in the lifetime of the next Government.  Clearly, there is always a number of potential retirements in any given year but more people are being recruited than are retiring.</p>  <p>  When one looks at crime trends and recorded crime figures from the CSO for quarter 2 of 2015, it is important to note that homicide offences are down by 35%; robbery, extortion and hijacking offences are down by 8%; and public order offences and other social code offences are down by 4%.  I am glad to say that weapons and explosives offences are down by 3%.  The decrease in controlled drug offences is not as great but it is a decrease of 1%.  </p>  <p>  We need to look at the successes of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the areas that are challenging.  It is very important that we pay tribute to the work we hear about on a daily basis and that we now see being undertaken through Operation Thor where very effective policing is being carried out in the country.  Sometimes the amount of arrests made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the huge successes it is having in respect of some very serious crimes can be underestimated.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister and I will not agree about the Government's policy of closing Garda stations and we have debated this issue on many occasions in this House and beyond.  I will raise an issue I have raised previously.  Given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was to have carried out a review after the closure of Garda stations, a review that has not taken place, does the Minister not consider it would be proper and appropriate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the remaining Garda stations that have not been sold into private ownership to discover the impact of the closure of these stations on the communities like Doon that now find themselves without a Garda station?  This issue was raised last night.  Will the Minister agree to ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to do this?</p>  <p>  Text alert is a huge success and it was great to see the launch last night in Doon.  Does the Minister not think we should have a national directorate with the funding to co-ordinate organisations like Muintir na T&iacute;re; the IFA, which now has a dedicated crime prevention officer; and the various community and text alert groups throughout the country to give them national co-ordination?  </p>  <p>  Could the Minister comment on a Bill I published last week?  It would require the National Roads Authority, which is now known as Transport Ireland, to put cameras on exits and entries to motorways as an added facet in protecting communities from roving gangs who are using the motorway network.</p></speech>

In respect of Garda station closures, let me make the point that I understand the sense of security people get from having a Garda station in their area.  Let us look at the crime figures.  Garda analysts have done this work.  A total of 41 Garda stations were closed in the west and the figures for the western region show a 8% reduction in burglaries.  I am not correlating one with the other.  I am just saying that this is a fact.  Modern crime has a lot of different elements.  Clearly, it involves local criminals and local knowledge is very important.  However, very often, mobile gangs operate as well and they need to be dealt with through a different type of modern policing - one that is informed by number plate recognition, which is very important.  The garda&iacute; would tell me that it is more important than the information they would get immediately from CCTV on the motorways.  This issue is being examined to see whether there are locations where it would be helpful to have extra CCTV.  The vehicles that are coming on stream have number plate recognition and if the Deputy speaks to his local garda&iacute;, I am sure they will tell him that it is hugely important in terms of dealing with criminal activity.</p>  <p>  In respect of national co-ordination of the text alert scheme, I have doubled the funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re this year and it is reverting to me in respect of how it believes this extra money should be used.</p><p>I do take the Deputy's point, which is important, that support for the text alert schemes by way of national coordination is important and is probably one of the routes we need to go to develop the schemes and support those involved.  Garda&iacute; are doing excellent work on that.</p></speech>

This initiative went far beyond anything which any previous Government has done and was a genuine effort to have an independent examination of many cases which Deputies had on their desks, were concerned about and which were brought to the attention of various people.  It was not established as a commission of inquiry or investigation.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  It was open to the IRM to suggest any form of statutory inquiry it thought might be necessary and the garda&iacute; and others cooperated fully with it.</p>  <p>  The panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to it and has therefore largely concluded its work.  I am sure I will receive several other cases shortly.  I started sending out letters on 29 June.  To date, 298 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases.  Letters will continue to issue.</p>  <p>  I have accepted the recommendations of counsel in all cases and this outcome will be communicated to all complainants; and I have previously assured Deputies where further investigation is recommended by the review that will occur.  There are quite a number of recommendations in the various cases.</p>  <p>  Some complainants may not be satisfied with the outcome of the review of their complaint.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation to me and the letter I have sent out has been overseen by a judge.  I did not summarise the advice, it came to me and a judge was satisfied with the way we were communicating with people.</p>  <p>  The cases referred ranged considerably from tragic deaths to property disputes.  There were many that did not fall within the criteria laid down; they were not particularly about Garda behaviour.  With respect to the cases for which the panel has recommended no further action by the Minister, it should be noted that the reasons for this recommendation vary greatly but include the fact that the complaint disclosed no allegation of any wrongdoing by the garda&iacute;; the case related to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is independent of the Minister in relation to decisions as to whether or not a prosecution is warranted; or the case related to the courts, which are also independent.  There are many cases which have already been through the courts, up to the highest level of court, and have been through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  Where the recommendation was for further action, I have acted in all instances on that.  They vary quite considerably. </p></reply>

I have met some of the families and the cases are appalling.  I have five or six cases here but I was struck by a new one that came to me yesterday.  Other Members would have received the letter too.  The family's comment says it all.  They were utterly dismayed at the review.  No one spoke to them, no one asked them for any information and they know from a query to a named body that the files were not requested from the panel.  How can the Minister stand over a review mechanism that does not even talk to the people concerned, does not ask for more clarification or documentation and does not go to the body concerned to read the original files and make a recommendation to her?</p><p>How can Members of these Houses stand over this process and call it an independent review to deal with the scale of concerns some of these families have about appalling experiences?  I ask the Minister to stand over what the correspondent wrote, namely, that no one had spoken to the family and that no one had asked them for any information.  Moreover, no one has approached the agency and looked for the case files, yet the panel made a recommendation to the Minister and she stands over it.</p></speech>

As I stated, it was never intended to be a commission of investigation.  The Deputy may give the details of a particular case in the Chamber, but what the Government decided to do and what I did as Minister was to set up a completely independent process in which the cases were looked at independently by legal counsel, examined and triaged to ascertain whether there was further action one could appropriately recommend to me as Minister that should be taken on them.  That is a completely independent process.  I made it absolutely clear from the outset that it was a review of all the data available.  If the panel had further questions or needed information from other bodies, it could ask them or get it.  A huge number of individuals provided further information and that is one reason the process took longer than I thought it would take.  It was then necessary to give that information to the panel which in quite a number of cases considered further information received.  Moreover, in quite a number of cases, for example, a report under section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act has been requested.  In many cases, there has been a referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, under section 102(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  There has also been a general review of Garda practice and procedures under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  A series of recommendations have been made and acted on.  While I cannot discuss individual cases, some of the cases the Deputy may be discussing may have been through a range of court processes-----</p></speech>

I find it unbelievable Members of the Oireachtas are being asked to stand over an independent review mechanism that does not speak to the people who make allegations, does not seek further information and does not visit the bodies about which allegations sometimes are made to seek access to files.  How can this be a review over which Members of these Houses can stand?</p>  <p>  To be clear, I have stated many times that the vast majority of the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the years have been of the highest standing, that is, they have been wonderful people who have served the State.  However, a tiny minority have been a disgrace to it and when people have and abuse power, the consequences can be devastating for families.  It is alleged that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na colluded in the murder of people's loved ones, covered up and did not properly investigate, with devastating consequences for the families concerned.  They had hope that, at last, the wall of bureaucracy would come down and that this process could start to get answers for them and put serious pressure on those who had abused their power.  Instead, there was another layer of bricks on that wall of bureaucracy.  They are devastated by their experience of the review panel which has been a failure for the cohort of cases that are genuine.  The process might have cleared out a pile of cases that were not genuine; that is fine and let those cases be cleared out.  However, there is a cohort of serious cases in which citizens of the State were abused and failed by some in power who were a disgrace to the uniform.</p></speech>

It was a genuine attempt to look with a wide lens because all of the approximately 350 cases referred to the Department were taken into account.</p><p>I think the Deputy accepts they covered a very wide range of issues, including property disputes, probate issues, disputes between neighbours, dissatisfaction with the outcome of civil and criminal court actions, decisions of the DPP and outcomes of investigations by GSOC.</p> <p> In the cases the Deputy is describing, he is talking about a particular cohort.  All of the cases were looked at previously in detail.  If there was evidence or a route forward in terms of further action that could be taken, it would be recommended to me by this panel.  There were no limits in what it could recommend.  It could and would have done that.  The Deputy has said that some of the people who received the letters were dissatisfied.  I understand what he is saying, but many of these cases go back to before 1969.  Quite a large number of them are before 2000.  There is a sort of historical dissatisfaction with particular cases.  I completely understand how people who have lost a loved one in tragic circumstances continually try to get to the bottom of that, the reason it happened and who was involved.</p> <p> In many of these cases they have been through the courts.  That process has been carried out.  If the people reviewing this wanted me to have a commission of inquiry, a further inquiry or a statutory inquiry, they could have recommended this.  If they do in any of these cases, I will, of course, act on it because I have accepted every single recommendation.  There has been no interference and in fact I have gone further than that.  I have asked a judge to oversee the letters going out so that there is no dilution of the recommendation by me or my Department.  Of course, there would be no intention to do that, but I introduced that separate safeguard when it was raised here in the House.</p></speech>

Each confidential recipient was required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner.  Only where a confidential report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner was it transmitted to the Minister.  Obviously there were many safeguards in place, as the Deputy knows.</p>  <p>  We now have the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the system and the protection of the whistleblower, which is central to the efficacy of the entire process.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding alleged wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  I would be very concerned if I felt that the whistleblowers who are having their complaints investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were not being dealt with in the context of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  It was brought in to ensure proper treatment of whistleblowers.  The Deputy will have heard the Garda Commissioner and other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na talk about encouraging whistleblowers to come forward, confirming that they will be dealt with properly and their complaints will be assessed in keeping with the legislation as it stands.</p><p>That clearly is the intention and if there is information to the contrary, I want to know about it.</p></speech>

The case has gone on for so long that he is no longer getting any pay from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He is on social welfare.  After he made his complaint, the Garda initiated proceedings against him, dragged in a domestic, family matter and made dirt of the individual.  Will anyone be answerable for how he has been treated?  It is a given that this man will be proven correct in the long term.  The Minister must realise that.  In the meantime, some of the garda&iacute; he complained about are suspended on full pay in Athlone and the midlands area.  I understand that is the normal process.  However, the whistleblower is getting no money from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of how things have been dragged out.  It is interesting that a court order demanding the release of documents, which was supposed to be delivered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na six weeks ago, did not happen.  How in God's name could that happen?  These two individuals have been put through hell.  We have been worried about their mental health.  It is just not true that proper protections are in place for these people.  There is no protection for them.  They have been treated abysmally.</p></speech>

He is obviously doing that because he thinks it is the right thing to do.  I cannot comment on individual cases but we must be very careful in this House in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  There is legislation in place, which is very new.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to implementing the legislation, which gives full protection to whistleblowers.  If it emerges that it does not, it might well need to be amended but right now that is the legislation we have in place.  The legislation on whistleblowers offers protection.  It prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central.  Deputy Wallace has heard what the Garda has had to say about dealing with complaints and putting robust procedures in place to examine cases.  I am assured that is what is happening in relation to any cases being dealt with at present.  Deputy Wallace is obviously being given other information.

I have got the very same reply from the individual who made a complaint in Kilkenny.  We have a serious problem.  The absence of sanctions for indiscipline among senior garda&iacute; is glaring.  It seems that senior garda&iacute; are untouchable in their own divisions and districts.  There is no effective system to discipline senior garda&iacute; who misbehave.  They are lawless.  I do not say the Commissioner is responsible for it all because I would say she does not even know what is going on half the time.  There is a serious problem in how the organisation works.  It is not the rank and file garda&iacute; who are the culprits; it is senior garda&iacute; who are not being held to account.  These two people have been put through hell by senior Garda authorities and pressure is still being applied to them.  They are not being treated properly.  There are no protections for them.  The Minister can talk about legislation until the cows come home.  We have building regulations in this country as well that are the envy of the planet but when we do not apply them and we do not investigate building work, they are worth zero.  The same applies to the legislation unless the rules and regulations are applied on the ground but that is not happening right now.</p></speech>

That has to be done.  If a whistleblower goes to management, the case has to be taken seriously, it has to be investigated and a report has to be made.

I am seeking for this State to implement a sentencing council, similar to what is in place in England and Wales, where clear sentencing guidelines are issued to the Judiciary based on consultation with the public and key stakeholders to ensure we can have accountability and consistency in the sentences handed out by the Judiciary.  Does the Minister support that proposal?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100014#M01500"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose the appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender in that process, identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The superior courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the Judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties across court jurisdictions.  That system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the Judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned.  I very much support that initiative, led the Judicial Research Office.</p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, which as the Deputy will know I published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  The majority took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the Judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  I recognise that the Deputy has published a Bill on this issue.  A sentencing council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its report on mandatory sentencing, which was published in June 2013. </p>  <p>  I advise the Deputy about a matter, which is not that well known, namely, that in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and, in that respect, it is appropriate for the courts to consider the provision of guidance on sentencing matters.</p></speech>

The Minister should think about what a sentencing council is.  The majority of members on the sentencing council in England and Wales are members of the judiciary and that protects the independence of the judiciary.  They consult the public and stakeholders and issue guidelines so that every judge - in this State that would be the District and Circuit Courts up to the Supreme Court but, in particular, the District and Circuit Courts - is clear that he or she is accountable for the decision he or she makes in regard to the category of offence before him or her.  We can think about some of the sentences handed out to people guilty of very grievous sexual offences in this State in recent years and of the insult that was to the victims, first and foremost, and to women who were horrified by what had happened.</p><p>The Government has not introduced a judicial council Bill or dealt with the issue of the appointment of members of the Judiciary, even though it has promised to do so time and again.  The Minister has said that, in the context of a sentencing council model, the Judiciary is independent.  It is calling for a judicial council Bill.  The Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham, has called for it, yet the Government will not introduce it.  Clearly, during its five-year term the council has been de-prioritised.  The Minister has walked away from accountability for the Judiciary and consistency in sentencing.  The response drafted by her officials is a massive disappointment.</p></speech>

We have not walked away from the Bill on which work is ongoing.  I take the Deputy's point that it is an important Bill.  I do not agree with his comments on my reply which shows how the Judiciary is addressing this issue in a variety of ways.  The Deputy will obviously be aware that the range of criteria to be taken into account in considering a particular sentence varies considerably.   He has to acknowledge that no group that has examined this issue in recent times, including those with a lay majority or judicial representatives, has suggested the route he says is an option.  I refer, in particular, to the reports on penal policy and law reform.  I recognise the fact that he has published a Bill in this regard and that there will be an opportunities to tease out and discuss these issues further, but no report I have received has stated we need a sentencing council.  Ireland is different from the United Kingdom in that we have a constitution.</p></speech>

We need to hold the Judiciary to account.  Judges cannot be a law unto themselves; they need to be held to account.  In fairness to the Judiciary, the judicial council would be a mechanism to do this.  I asked whether the Minster could incorporate a sentencing council into the judicial council, but we do not have even have that Bill before us.  It has been another wasted opportunity.  We have had another full Government term of almost five years with no reform of the way sentencing is dealt with by the courts or the way judicial appointments are made.  Whoever drafted the response talks about the Judiciary being independent.  However, judges are also accountable but not according to the Government.  We are wrapping up in the House.  We have a few more weeks left and will be into an election campaign in the new year.  This is a massive failure on the part of the Department and the Government in the past five years.  I have put forward a good model that is used in England and Wales and which is democratic, fair and accountable.  However, I am being lectured by departmental officials who have utterly failed in their responsibility to reform judicial sentencing and guidelines in the State.</p></speech>

The Deputy has said they must be held accountable, but they are independent; that is the reality.  We bring forward legislation that outlines the sentencing we think is appropriate to a variety of crimes.  All of the expert information available to me indicates that mandatory sentencing is not the way forward because of that very point.  What does consistency in sentencing mean?  It is a complex matter and many variables must be taken into account.  Where, for example, we, as legislators, believe the appropriate sentence is not in place, it is up to us to legislate.  That is what I am doing in the burglaries Bill.  I am providing that it will be more difficult to get bail and that consecutive, as opposed to concurrent, sentences should be served.  If we do not think the maximum sentence for a crime is appropriate, it is up to us, as legislators, to address that issue.  However, it is absolutely clear that the Judiciary is independent.</p><p>A judicial council Bill would allow them to deal with complaints effectively and the various elements that will be in it are necessary.  We will come to that in due course.</p></speech>

It must be recalled that the primary security threat facing the State is from so-called dissident republican paramilitary groups.  These groups are inextricably linked to organised crime in order to fund their activities.  At present, over 40 people are before the Special Criminal Court charged in connection with subversive activity.  In view of the nature of this activity, I am having the necessary arrangements put in place to set up a second Special Criminal Court to reduce delays in listing trials.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have the appropriate resources available to them to tackle threats from these sources but given the evolving nature of the security and organised crime threat, the Garda Commissioner is carrying out a review and will let me know of any additional requirements that may arise.  I have secured an extra &euro;4 million so that we can be part of the Schengen information system, which is a very important database with real life active information on it about current threats.  </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is the security force in this State, will take all possible steps to deal with any threat to this country, combining a strong intelligence base with a well-trained, armed, special intervention and support capacity, and a range of other local and national policing and investigative resources dedicated to countering both security threats and the activities of organised crime gangs, whatever their origins.</p>  <p>  A primary response capacity is the Garda's emergency response unit, which is specially trained in counter-terrorism responses and hostage-type incidents.  The armed regional support units, the special detective unit, the drugs unit and organised crime unit also have key roles to play in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau has a particularly important role to play in tackling organised crime and has been successful in targeting the assets of those involved.  Since its establishment, it has secured a total of &euro;28 million from persons who have been associated with the Provisional IRA in the past.</p></speech>

There will be further meetings this week.  It was made clear that international co-operation is key to dealing with this issue.  Exchange of intelligence information, identification of the travel routes of suspects, the use of Interpol and Europol databases and the Schengen information database are all very important responses.</p>  <p>  Nationally, people also need to be aware that the Garda has a response unit, the emergency response unit, which is specifically trained and is the first line in counter-terrorism.  I will say again that its members are specifically trained in counter-terrorism responses and hostage-type incidents.  The armed regional support units, the special detective units and the drugs and organised crime units would also be involved in rapid response.</p><p>The Defence Forces can be called in as an aid to the Garda and civil authority.  They have a range of expertise which they have been using during the years to deal with the type of terrorism seen on this island.  As I said, they have much experience of dealing with explosive devices being placed in a variety of locations across the country.</p></speech>

Is there an early warning system that will detect potential criminal movement in sufficient time to enable the Garda to become alert to a threat?

Following the Paris attacks on the Friday, I was briefed on the Saturday by the national response unit which was dealing with the information that was coming through.  It was already in contact with Interpol and Europol.  Interpol had asked for information from Ireland but no specific information emerged on a threat to Ireland or any person here who had been involved in the Paris attacks.  The Garda was immediately alerted to this and involved.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that enhancing the capacity for developing good intelligence and intelligence-sharing internationally is increasingly important.  There is definitely room for greater co-operation in that regard.  At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting the point was made that it was extremely important to have a database of radicalised individuals who were returning to Europe from the Middle East and to ensure the authorities were aware of those who presented a danger to European societies.  A further point, one that is continually made by international police forces, is that quite a number of terrorist attacks have been prevented because of good intelligence sharing.  That is obviously the position we want to reach to prevent attacks, as opposed to dealing with the tragic aftermath of such attacks, as we saw in Paris recently.</p></speech>

It builds on the substantial investment, restarted by the Government, in recruiting new garda&iacute; and vehicles.  All of these resources are available to the Garda Commissioner to delegate, as she sees appropriate.</p>  <p>  This year the Clare division has been allocated ten newly attested garda&iacute; and extra vehicles.  The 2016 budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new garda&iacute; next year, on top of the 550 recruited since the Government reopened the Garda College in 2014.  It will also provide additional funding for special operations such as Operation Thor.  This builds on the high level of investment of &euro;34 million we have seen already.  In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources available in any one county, although information is available on the extra garda&iacute; locally.  Extra garda&iacute; have been allocated to every division following the new recruitment drive.  This week another 600 recruit places have been advertised, in which there is already significant interest.  This will allow for further operations across the country.  Operation Thor involves disrupting mobile gangs across the country and we are already seeing some successes under it.  I will have a report shortly on its first month in operation.</p></reply>

It was followed by a series of crisis meetings on homelessness and housing and declarations by Government that definitive interventions would be made to reverse the trend and improve the situation.  A year on, those working at the coal face and those on the streets are clear about one thing.  The homelessness crisis has deepened and got worse in the 12 months since the sad death of Jonathan Corrie.  Those who are on the streets know that the Government's interventions and policy have failed to halt the deepening crisis.  The number of people sleeping rough in Dublin is on the increase.  It is also on the increase in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and across the country.  I have pointed out to the Taoiseach time after time that the most shocking phenomenon and development of recent years has been the number of families with children losing their homes.  This has been ongoing and has been shocking and distressing to many.  Approximately 800 families with more than 1,500 children have, essentially, been made homeless.  Approximately 70 to 80 families a month are losing their homes as opposed to 30 to 40 families last year.</p>  <p>  One of the key issues over the past year has been the rent issue.  Rents have increased by approximately 30% in this city alone.  Many families have lost their homes because they could not pay the increased rents.  The simplest of interventions would have assisted.  Rent supplement needs to be increased.  The Government's intervention has been too little too late and has no since of urgency or joined-up thinking.  The plan for social housing will be approximately 1,000 houses short before the end of the year.  There are 3,000 vacant local authority units across the country, which are still not ready for housing, and NAMA has no mandate to deliver social housing.  Will the Government change its position and agree to increase rent supplement?  Will NAMA be directed to build social housing as opposed to private housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100018#Q00300"><p>One should not confuse the situation in so far as rough sleepers are concerned and the question of homelessness in general.  There is a difference in the situation that applies to those on the streets.  The fundamental problem is supply of accommodation, be it private or social accommodation, voided units or whatever.  People are entitled to have access to warm, comfortable and properly insulated accommodation, which has not been the case, and a great deal of work has gone into dealing with this issue and quite a deal of progress has been made.</p>  <p>  It is clear the supply problems are the crux of the issue.  A targeted development contribution rebate scheme has been introduced in Dublin and Cork.  New apartment guidelines to improve the viability of this type of development are contained in the Bill, which will be passed this week.  There are amendments in the Bill to increase flexibility when dealing with the supply of housing in the strategic development zones.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund will support the delivery of housing related infrastructure in large scale areas.  This will also deal with the question of supply.  NAMA aims to deliver 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020.  As Deputy Martin is aware, the Government increased the current allocation for social housing by &euro;69 million to &euro;414 million.  This funding will enable local authorities to secure accommodation for an additional 14,000 households.  It is not as if they have not been given instructions or the facilities or finance to do it.</p>  <p>  The current allocation for emergency accommodation for homeless people has been increased by &euro;17 million.  This will bring Exchequer support to &euro;70 million, which is up 56% since 2014.  On top of that, there is funding for 35,000 new social housing units, which are to be developed by the State.  A new vacant site levy will be introduced to compel developers sitting on serviced and zoned lands in demand areas to develop their sites.  We have reduced development contributions in the Dublin area because they were a real problem for contractors.  There has also been a reduction in Part V planning obligations.</p>  <p>  Last week I visited the Digital Hub campus to see the new development by Dublin City Council.  This intervention will be significant for rough sleepers.  Up to 150 beds will be available in pristine quarters.  When a person goes into the building, he or she will be met courteously and properly and will also be registered.  A facility with a doctor and a nurse will be available as will proper food.  A locker will also be provided to each individual and clothes and garments will be washed.  There are really good accommodation facilities being provided with beds for males and females and potential to expand if necessary.  The intervention by the city council in this particular regard is one to be commended and it should mean that there will be no rough sleepers in Dublin this Christmas.  I cannot speak for every individual, however, because some people want to be on the streets and are in very particular circumstances.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of families becoming homeless because of rent increases, stability has been brought to the area by the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill will be passed this week and this will provide a degree of stability to the sector.  The situation on voided units being returned has been operating successfully.  I understand there are some objections to modular housing units being put in place for 22 families.  These units would provide them with warm, decent and comfortable accommodation.  The Government is concerned with all of these matters.</p>  <p>  There is no intention of increasing the rent subsidy.  It is necessary to deal with the supply question.  The Department of Social Protection provides assistance when dealing with individual cases where the issue is brought to its attention.</p></speech>

If one speaks to people from Threshold, FLAC, the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust or anyone else dealing with families, they will say that rent supplement is a key issue.  It was a key issue 12 months ago.  The Taoiseach spoke about stability being brought to the issue.  What was going on for the past 12 months?  Rents have gone up by 30%.  Families who could not afford to pay those rents lost their homes because the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, did not intervene.  There was a row going on between the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, for a full 12 months.  What went on for the 12 months before that?</p></speech>

The ideology that it cannot interfere meant the Taoiseach allowed families to lose their homes.  That is an undeniable reality.  The case-by-case approach has simply not worked because the problem has got worse.  If the case-by-case scenario was working, what was 30 to 40 families losing their homes 12 months ago would not be 70 to 80 families losing their homes now.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Taoiseach allowed the problem become a crisis through inaction and by failing to intervene early enough.  He did not have a proper, clear solution.</p>  <p>  My second question was if the Taoiseach would direct NAMA to build social houses.  He states that NAMA will build 20,000 houses in the private market.  There is a social dividend provided for in the legislation establishing NAMA. </p></speech>

Our thoughts today are with Jonathan's family and his loved ones.  His death justifiably sparked outrage at the Government's inaction and failure to tackle the ongoing housing crisis.  We heard lots of assurances from the Taoiseach and his Ministers that things would improve.  The Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Alan Kelly, said the Government would end homeless by 2016 but since then the homelessness crisis has escalated, with chaos heaped upon chaos by this Government.</p>  <p>  This morning the CEO of Dublin's Simon Community, Mr. Sam McGuinness, said that the homeless situation is going to get worse.  Homelessness has increased by 80%, the number of children who are homeless has doubled, with 70 to 80 families per month becoming homeless.  In Dublin alone there are over 1,500 children in emergency accommodation.  That is 1,500 children who have nowhere to call home this Christmas.  We are also witnessing the fastest level of rent increases since 2007, including in my constituency in Louth where rents have increased by 13.5% in the last 12 months.  In Louth there are almost 5,000 people on the housing list.</p>  <p>  The Government promised to build at least 1,000 social housing units this year.  Reports indicate that just 20 social houses were built in the first half of the year and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has conceded that there will be a mere 200 built in 2015.  This is a disgrace and it is unfair.  The Taoiseach must surely accept that there is a need to declare a housing emergency.  Why does the Taoiseach not liaise with the European Commission to have the housing crisis declared a national emergency so the Government can speed up its procurement processes for the construction of social housing?  It could then fund the construction of social housing outside the existing fiscal constraints.  That is one way to resolve this crisis speedily.  It is the Taoiseach's decision; why does he not opt for that?</p></speech>

People are entitled to have decent accommodation made available to them.  Deputy Adams is aware that we were building between 90,000 and 100,000 units a number of years ago but that collapsed entirely, with construction down to only 8,500 or 9,000 units.  To get the sector to step up to the plate has required a great deal of effort and work.  Many contractors went out of business and there were issues with the building and planning regulations.  All of these are independent processes in so far as planning is concerned.  The Government has put its money on the table in respect of social housing.  Instructions and directions have been given to local authorities to get on with that job and both the Minister and the Minister of State have met representatives of various local authorities in that regard.</p>  <p>  In respect of the rent situation, Deputy Martin feels that just increasing the rent----</p></speech>

Second, even where a landlord has not increased the rent in the last 12 months, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill currently going through the Oireachtas precludes landlords from increasing the rent beyond the market rate.  Third, landlords cannot seek to set aside these measures by pricing in a rent increase to a level which is above the current market rate.  If he or she does so, a tenant is quite entitled to take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  The rent will remain at the current level until the board adjudicates on the matter.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams has a different solution.  I note that Sinn F&eacute;in, in its housing proposals, would fund social housing with money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  That is Deputy Adams's answer.</p></speech>

If one does not build houses, either social or private, then one does not deal with the supply of houses.  If one cannot deal with that then the pressures on the existing housing stock will increase and raising the rent subsidy is not the answer.</p>  <p>  I repeat again that there is a difference in the categorisation or classification of homeless and rough sleepers.  Nobody wants to see families or children or anybody on the streets.  In respect of the people who sleep rough on the streets, a great deal of effort has gone into it.  I do not see any reason why the facilities and opportunities available now would mean that anyone should be on the streets of any city this winter and I hope they will be the case.</p></speech>

I asked him a very simple question and Sinn F&eacute;in will be releasing a policy document on housing later this week.  I asked the Taoiseach why he does not liaise with the European Commission to have the housing crisis declared a national emergency in order to speed up the various procurement processes for the construction of social housing.  The Taoiseach ignored that question entirely.  In his answer he talked about bringing stability to these families but the Government has brought chaos to the lives of tenants and families who are homeless as a result of its policies.  The Government's policy is not to build social housing.</p></speech>

They were passionate and inspiring, and were saying all the right things.  However, saying is one thing and doing is something else.  We know that climate change is happening, we know that it is extremely dangerous and we know the negotiations have been going on for over 20 years.  As there has been mainly talk the reality is very grim.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us that, if we continue as we are, 50 million more people will be at risk of hunger by 2050, and the World Bank states that, in 15 years time, 100 million more are going to join those who are already in extreme poverty.  When we look at the CO2 emissions in metric tonnes per capita, Uganda at 0 .1, India at 1.2 and Ireland at 10.5.</p>  <p>  We know those countries which contribute least to greenhouse gases are the most impacted by climate change, and they are already suffering conflict, hunger, desperate poverty and ill-health.  We also know that it is human activities in the developed world, such as burning fossil fuels and emissions, that are the main causes of global warning.  We have so much evidence of the devastating effects.  Ban Ki-moon said yesterday that bold climate action is in the national interest of every single country represented but the submitted pledges are not enough to keep warming below 2&deg;C and the EU's pledge of at least a 40% reduction is too low and should be 55%.</p>  <p>  My question relates to finance.  We made no contribution in 2015 to the Green Climate Fund and while we have pledged &euro;2 million in the 2016 budget, there is nothing for subsequent years.  The average EU pledge is $12 per capita, whereas ours translates to 50 cent.  Was Ireland's contribution to the Green Climate Fund not discussed at Cabinet level before the Taoiseach went to Paris?  Will we commit to the fund in line with pledges made by similar developed countries?  Will we consider the climate justice fund which was recommended by the environment committee in 2013, especially as the Taoiseach himself committed to climate justice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100020#S01200"><p>The situation that applied in Paris at the climate change meeting yesterday was unprecedented in its seriousness.  It was very different to what happened in Copenhagen, which had not been as well planned or thought-out in terms of what is to happen.  What was involved yesterday was the setting out of a road map for the future, led by the great powers of the world and the leaders of the governments.  That road map is to be filled in over the next two weeks by the officials, the diplomats and the Ministers of the different governments in respect of the issues they point out as being of importance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned a number of countries.  I spoke to the former Uachtar&aacute;in, Mary Robinson, at the meeting.  While she was not directly involved in the negotiations, as the Deputy knows, she is an ambassador for climate change.  The former President's real priorities are climate justice, human rights and gender and education.  I support that very strongly and referred to it in my contribution to the meeting.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that Ireland has given &euro;34 million in respect of public finance for climate change.  We have signed on for the green fund and will increase our contributions to that over the coming years, as well as in respect of the developing countries.  I make the point that, irrespective of how difficult the situation has been in the last number of years, Ireland, and in particular those who work in the different sectors and regions around the world, have put together a very high reputation in terms of the work our people do with the peoples of different countries, many of them in exceptionally difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's point about the changes that are coming in the next 50 years, it is important to note the population of the world is expected to grow to 10 billion.  Those people have to be fed, so food security is of critical importance.  There is a balance between what we can produce and how we can have the transfer of smart technology, in the agri-sector in particular, so that other countries can avail of this.  To take the case of Syria, it has other problems due to the increase in temperature and the drought in recent years.  Without any other conflict or brutal regime, people in their thousands have had to move from what were formerly food producing areas to cities because of the change in temperature.  That is not unique to that country and applies in so many others as well.</p>  <p>  We are committed to contributing to the green fund and committed to increasing our initial contribution over the coming years.  As the economy improves and strengthens we will take those things into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100020#S01300"><p>I am not sure NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam and Friends of the Earth will take much heart from what the Taoiseach has just said.  On Leaders' Questions some months ago, the Taoiseach said to me: "[W]e must challenge ourselves in measuring up and being recognised as a country that really is fulfilling obligations in respect of climate change".  The one positive thing that came from what the Taoiseach was saying yesterday was that Ireland would be involved in legally binding agreements.  However, that is not much if those agreements are diluted.</p>  <p>  What is needed in the agreements is that human rights are integrated in all climate-related actions.  We have to commit to food security, not just an increase in industrial food production.  There can be no ambiguity around emissions.  We need a 100% renewables goal and the phasing out of fossil fuels because the biofuel strategy has been a disaster in some countries.  We also need independent assessment of the individual country commitments, with the assessment to begin in 2018 with regular reviews.</p>  <p>  Ireland has got considerable praise for securing international agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals, ten of the 17 of which are about climate change.  We are acknowledged as a champion in countering hunger but unless we walk the walk on climate change, we are guilty of being hypocritical.  It raises a question about policy coherence that on the one hand, we are going to give development aid, which gives us a feel-good factor and on the other hand, we are taking back in that we are not delivering on climate change.  What do we do?  Will we just keep giving foreign aid and pay millions, if not billions, in fines to the EU because we are not meeting targets?  Environmental sustainability has to be an indicator of progress, both nationally and globally.  Will we commit to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100020#S01400"><p>That is an important point and the Deputy has made a valid contribution.  The situation is that our profile in terms of what we produce and can produce from the agri-sector is disproportionate to other countries.  No other country, with the exceptions of New Zealand, Uruguay and, to an extent, Denmark, match Ireland's profile in this regard.  The point is that the targets set for Ireland of a 20% reduction by 2020 on 2005 figures are not realisable.  They are not realisable because the European Commission overestimated the extent of what could come from the agriculture sector and the fact we have had a lost decade of investment in research, innovation and changes to deal with this.</p><p> Whatever the level possible of our achievements by 2020, what we need is not a way out nor an escape clause but an understanding that we will meet targets that are achievable, fair and sustainable.  However, we are going to need some time to do that from 2020.  If the current situation applies and the 2020 targets - which we will not be able to meet - are imposed on Ireland, whoever is in government in the years between 2020 and 2030 could suffer very serious fines.  My point is that while we will not be able to meet all of the targets set for 2020, as the economy improves we will be able to catch up much more rapidly than others because we are doing the research and bringing in innovative smart technology in the agri-sector.  Also, the fact is that we can produce so much more high quality food to feed people in other places and the research and the technology that we use can be transferred to others.</p> <p> I listened to a view expressed this morning that the 45,000 beef farms we have in this country, whose carbon footprints are now all being calculated, should be planted with forestry instead.  If we followed that line of logic, we would decrease the capacity to produce food by thousands of tonnes and would transfer the opportunity for more rain forests to be demolished and levelled for food to be produced to inferior standards with much higher emissions.  Balance and common sense is required here.  I am all for ambitious targets but I want targets that we can achieve.  In that sense, we need to have some hard bargaining to reach an understanding with the European Commission within the next fortnight.  These targets will be set down by mid-February and once set down, they will be exceptionally difficult to change. </p> <p> For the reasons I have given, what was put on Ireland's plate when these targets were set originally is not acceptable to me or to the Government because they are unachievable.  We want to achieve targets that are fair and sustainable and which take into account what we can supply to other countries in terms of education, research, innovation, knowledge and food.</p></speech>

Following this, in February 2014 the Government presented a package of proposals on Seanad reform to the Leader of the Seanad for submission to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad.</p>  <p>  In addition, in February 2014 the general scheme of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill was published for consultation.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable implementation of the 1979 constitutional amendment to extend the Seanad franchise to graduates from institutions of higher education in the State that do not currently form part of the Seanad university constituencies.  This Bill is due for publication in 2016.  More recently, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2015, whose purpose is to amend the Seanad electoral Acts inn regard to nominations for panel member elections and candidate election posts for university member elections and to amend the Electoral Act 1992 in regard to the supplement to the register of electors.</p>  <p>  In order to further progress the Seanad reform process, I established an independent working group in December 2014 with a focus on possible reforms of the Seanad electoral reform system within existing constitutional parameters as well as on exploring ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann generally and the manner in which it carries out its business.  The working group published its report on 13 April last and it is available on my Department's website.  The associated draft Bill and explanatory memorandum prepared for the group were also published on my Department's website on 14 May.</p>  <p>  I issued a statement when the report was published in which I welcomed it and described it as being innovative and radical and as containing some far-reaching recommendations about how Members are elected to the Seanad and on how it should perform its functions.  I indicated there needed to be a public and political discussion and consultation on the report.  To that end, I requested that the working group make a presentation to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad.  On 5 May last and again on 8 July, statements on the report were made in the Seanad with the chairman of the working group and former Senator Joe O'Toole, a member of the group, in attendance.</p>  <p>  I also said that I intended to meet Opposition party leaders to discuss the report's contents and this meeting took place in July.  Arising from that meeting, I gave a commitment to have a debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the working group's report and it is my intention that this will take place before the end of this session.  The report recommended that the commencement date for the new arrangements, were they to be accepted, should be immediately following the next Seanad general election.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100021#T01100"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  It is an extraordinary situation that since the Taoiseach got that wallop two years ago from the electorate, he has been extremely lacking in terms of bringing forward any substantial reform to how Seanad &Eacute;ireann works, how people are elected to it and the work it does.  We met the Taoiseach on this issue last July and while I do not want to upset the Taoiseach, it was one of the most farcical meetings I ever attended in terms of the Taoiseach's lack of any notion of what he wanted to do himself.  He had the independent report and put it on the table and asked us for our opinions but had no real opinion himself.  It then emerged during the meeting that the Government had no position on the independent report.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, who was representing the T&aacute;naiste, said the Government had not even considered it, yet the Government was asking the Opposition for commitments on specific aspects of it.  At the end of the meeting, we asked the Taoiseach whether he would support the elements of the independent report that referred to direct franchise for citizens having a say in electing Senators.  He demurred at that and eventually Deputy Ross put it to him that he was up for anything.  The Taoiseach used the phrase that he would "consider anything".</p>  <p> The meeting was very incoherent and many of us left it scratching our heads because it was clear to us that neither the Taoiseach nor any member of the Government knew what they were doing with regard to the Seanad or the independent report the Taoiseach had commissioned.  The members of the independent group who produced the report were busy lobbying everybody and felt they had got the green light from the Government and were encouraging the Opposition to play ball and agree with the recommendations made, although we would not have been entirely happy with all of the recommendations, particularly some of those to do with the compromise in regard to the direct franchise rather than the better solution that was produced here in legislation, both before and after the last referendum. </p>  <p>  I understand from what the Taoiseach has said today that the legislation concerning the university panels will not now be finalised before the next election, although he committed to bringing it forward at that meeting.  He has said today that it will be published in 2016.  Will he confirm that means it will not be introduced before the general election, but that it will be left to a new government to implement it?  Is it clear where the Taoiseach stands on this issue?  Will he indicate whether he supports all of the recommendations of the independent working group he established, particularly in regard to the direct franchise and allowing citizens have a say in electing Senators?</p>  <p>  This goes to the heart of the democratic revolution we were promised but never got from the Government.  The people rejected the Taoiseach's proposition to abolish the Seanad, which he only thought up before the last general election to try to gain some momentum for his party.  Most of the Taoiseach's party did not agree with the proposal but he went ahead with it.  The public said "No" and the reason for that was that they valued alternative voices in democracy and valued debate.</p><p>They value of the idea of politicians having a platform and capacity to articulate ideas about society and about how things should evolve.  The Seanad has played that role in spite of all of its challenges and difficulties.  It has been a platform for alternative voices down through the years, from party-affiliated Members, as well as Independents.  The people did not want to suppress that voice, even though the Taoiseach wanted them to do so.</p> <p> The Taoiseach's failure on the Seanad is evident, particularly since his commitment to the party leaders following the independent review group.  Nothing has happened.  We have not been called into any meeting.  There are about two weeks to go in this session, yet he throws out in his reply that he intends to have the debate before the end of the session.  There are so many things supposed to happen before the end of this session that I am getting dizzy.  There are letters coming from Ministers wanting to rush through emergency legislation and so on.  There are a load of guillotines lined up for next week.  The Chief Whip contacted me this morning to say he wishes to guillotine five or six Bills.  That goes to the heart of democratic revolution.</p> <p> The Taoiseach's reluctance to engage in proper debate on these issues, or to facilitate a genuine parliamentary democracy, is at the heart of it.  Since he got the wallop when the people said no to the abolition of the Seanad he has thrown his hat at it and does not seem to want to progress any reforms, despite the fact that every Opposition party told him they would co-operate with the legislation.  The Taoiseach was asked a direct question about it at the meeting but he did not answer.  We do not know where he stands.</p> <p> I received an invitation and I am sure the Taoiseach also did, to take part in the general election debate on TV3.  I am prepared to do that but he is not.  He has laughed.  His view is that if he avoids those debates it is better.  The public and the younger generation think that politicians should debate issues in the D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and that we should allow alternative voices to have their say.  The Taoiseach belongs to a sort of cute hoor form of politics that says the more one ducks and dives, the less----</p></speech>

I have asked him to report on his proposals to reform the Seanad, and to report on his comments that he did not think it would be possible to introduce the planned reform of the Seanad before the next general election.  We will not discuss the Taoiseach's cuteness or any other matter except, if possible, these ones.  I have never accused the Taoiseach of being cute.</p>  <p>  I join the Taoiseach in thanking those who participated in the working group on Seanad reform.  He will recall that it was established after the electorate gave him a wallop and defeated the proposal to abolish the Seanad.  The working group was given very tight terms of reference and was to consider submissions and previous proposals for reform; look at the role of a reformed Seanad; its powers and functions; the method of election; selection of Members; and any such matters the working group saw as relevant.  Despite the limitations imposed on it by the terms of reference, there were some important recommendations.  These include recommending that a majority - 30 - of the panel seats be elected by popular vote on the principle of one person, one vote; and that the principle of one person, one vote be extended to include Irish citizens in the North and holders of Irish passports living overseas.  The working group argued for a system of online registration of voters and downloading of ballot papers.</p>  <p>  Although the recommendations may have fallen short of what Sinn F&eacute;in and others believe is needed to make the Seanad a genuinely democratic and representative, accountable elected Chamber, they are nonetheless important.  We disagree with the Taoiseach retaining the privilege of appointing 11 nominees, and with the failure to deal with university representation, gender representation and the representation of ethnic groups, particularly the Traveller community.  That is a summary of what was reported back.</p><p>A promise and proposals were made in this regard as far back as Bertie Ahern that citizens in Northern Ireland should also have Oireachtas representation as of right.  I recall the meeting on 8 July to which the Taoiseach invited us.  It was a waste of our time.  When the Taoiseach asked us what we thought of the report, I asked him what he thought of it.  The Taoiseach did not have a view.  It became clear in the next few moments that the Government had not even considered the report.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, made this clear and said that the Labour Party had not decided what its position was and the Government had yet to apply itself to this.  I remember telling the Taoiseach that the Government should sort out its position on this and bring it to the D&aacute;il when we could have a debate on it.  I believe my memory of that is correct but this has not happened.  The Bill was published on 5 May, which was seven months ago.  In response to me at the time, the Taoiseach promised a debate on the issue but there has been no debate.  It is now clear that no legislation will be introduced or passed by the D&aacute;il in respect of the Seanad before the next general election.  Arguably, we would not even be having this discussion if we had not put down the questions at this time.  I see no evidence to suggest the Government and the Taoiseach are serious about D&aacute;il reform.</p> <p> I also think the John McNulty affair shows how all the old tricks continue to work in the new dispensation because that was an abuse of the Seanad, particularly in respect of those citizens who would serve on the cultural panel.  There is still a chance.  The Government could still schedule a long overdue debate in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the working group report.  I do not have the details but our Whip reported to our last group meeting that there would be a series of guillotines this week on motions and proposals that the Government is bringing forward.  </p> <p> Going back to my original question, will the Taoiseach tell us why it is not possible to introduce the planned reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann before the next general election?  Will he report on his proposals to reform the Seanad?</p></speech>

Former Senators Manning and O'Toole, and the former Minister, Mary O'Rourke, made very cogent arguments as to why this should be but also as to what it would mean for the electorate and the way it might do its business.  Deputy Gerry Adams is quite entitled to have a view that is very different from that report and that is fair.  It is not just a case of the Government saying that this is its view because one wants the arguments and discussion for and against, which is natural.  I would have thought that the report of people from all the different parties, who gave long years of service, would be one that would be acceptable to the Members in this House and be implemented.  That is what they said.  They said it should be done after the general election.</p>  <p>  I always thought it unfair in respect of the universities panel.  A referendum was held in 1979 and the Bill was published.  However, as it will not be implemented before Christmas, it will fall to the next Administration to make its decision regarding Seanad reform.  The parties can set out all their points.  Obviously, we will set out our points.  I hope that in the early part of the next Administration, some changes can be made that will make Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which is here to stay by virtue of the people's vote, more effective and allow it to do its work in a different way in the times ahead.</p></speech>

I think that following the referendum most people were of the view that reform was required and should happen.  That was the overwhelming perspective received from the people.</p>  <p>  At the meeting in July, to which all the leaders were summoned by the Taoiseach, the only people who did not have a view on the independent report were the Taoiseach and the Government.  That was explicitly stated by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White.  He was very clear in making his point - almost to the point that one detected a certain sense of annoyance on his part about how things had unfolded.  All those on the Opposition side agreed that they were in favour of the legislative approach, legislating for direct franchise to the Seanad.  That point was put to the Taoiseach very clearly.  The Opposition agreed it would run with this report's recommendations, particularly on direct franchise to the Seanad.  As the Taoiseach did not follow through on that in any shape or form, we need to be very honest and straightforward about that aspect of it.  There has been no follow through since that meeting in July.  The Taoiseach did not come back to us about any aspect of this in terms of building a consensus because it is also agreed that a consensus is required.  The Opposition was willing.  The independent group kept putting pressure on the Opposition because it had a sense it had got a green light from the Government.  However, the reality we experienced at the meeting was completely at variance with what it expected would happen.  That is my sense of it.  I did not get any sense that the Government is seriously considering the independent report at all.  </p>  <p>  In terms of reform in politics generally and the points about debates, I am not talking about myself.  I am talking about any leader here.  I will debate with anybody.  It should happen, if somebody else comes in.  We tell young people to get involved in politics.  We go to schools and tell students to get involved and interested in their community and in the world and they expect that from all political representatives.  That is what people expect.  They expect politicians, regardless of who they are, to debate passionately about whatever they believe in or disagree with.  The example they get from Government is an orchestrated and choreographed response that is really designed to avoid any meaningful debate or engagement.  That is the point.  This speaks against the whole value of parliamentary democracy and democracy in general because it allows others to come to the fore.</p></speech>

That is contrary to what he told me seven months ago when he promised that we would do this.</p>  <p>  I was at a meeting last night in Ballymascanlon called by the local county branch of the Irish Farmers Association to deal with rural crime.  I will not take us along that road although it is an issue worthy of debate.  What struck me was the anger at the politicians who were in attendance.  All the main parties were there but we had been instructed not to speak.  Towards the end of the meeting that instruction was relaxed.  The reason there is so much anger, not just about rural crime but a range of issues, is the high-flown rhetoric the Taoiseach employed when he talked about political reform and spoke of Paddy needs to know, a democratic revolution, never doing things the way they were done in the past, doing them differently and that honesty was going to be the policy.</p>  <p>  Then we come to the issue of Seanad reform and, as we were reminded a moment ago, the referendum question put by the Government did not include the ability to vote for reform, which was our preference.  The question was either retain it or get rid of it.  One would think, given how the electorate responded to that, and given that this working group was set up that the Taoiseach would have responded speedily but he did not.  He has had the report - I will not repeat what happened at the meeting that took place - for seven months and he has not brought it forward.  That is why so many citizens are cynical about politics and angry about some politicians, on top of all the other policies the Government has employed.  It is not enough to say the working group did not see this being brought in until after the next general election.  That does not stop us from priming ourselves and getting the best legislation possible.  Why did the Taoiseach not bring forward the report?  Was that a real promise he made in May when he agreed to do so or was it just off the top of his head?  Was he serious?  Why do we not have this issue addressed, including the legislation and the debate that is required in order to fulfil the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to political reform and the democratic revolution?</p></speech>

It is not "might" or "would" or "maybe".  It is not a question of asking people do they want to consider abolition of this entity or not, and by the way they might consider something else while they are at it.  It is a straightforward question.  I am quite sure that many of the people who were at the meeting in Ballymascanlon last night, a place I know well, voted one way or the other as they were perfectly entitled to do, in response to the question they were asked.  They gave their answer and Seanad &Eacute;ireann is here to stay.

The committee last met on 8 October.  The next meeting of the committee has not yet been scheduled.  For reasons of Cabinet confidentiality, it is not appropriate to comment on specific issues discussed at particular meetings.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on Construction 2020, housing, planning and mortgage arrears was established to monitor implementation of the Government&rsquo;s construction strategy and to oversee effective implementation of the Government&rsquo;s response to the issue of mortgage arrears on a whole-of-government basis.  In addition, matters relating to social housing, homelessness and associated issues are discussed regularly at the Cabinet committee on social policy and public service reform.</p></reply>

The structure the Taoiseach has in place, and the number of times that committee has met, are inadequate when measured against the degree to which this problem has escalated in the past four years and grown to crisis levels in respect of homelessness and rough sleeping, families with children becoming homeless and the failure to construct an adequate supply of houses.  Several Departments are privately admitting they did not see this coming and got it wrong three or four years ago in respect of the crisis we are experiencing.  They felt then that there was no need to invest in social housing or to deal with the supply of housing in the private market.  Instead, what happened was the decision to reduce the rent supplement and to impose a rent supplement cap, which made the situation more difficult for tenants in certain accommodation.  Given that rents have increased by 30%, the Government has created a crisis with many families ending up homeless because they could not afford to pay the rent.  We have been pointing this out for the past three years.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have been very stubborn about it.</p><p>The Taoiseach has consistently been missing the point that those who are renting and perhaps on low incomes or in receipt of welfare payments cannot cope with increasing rents.  He pillories me for stating this, but I am not the only one who says so.  Those involved in helping homeless families have been stating it consistently since the Government changed strategy on rent allowance.  It reduced it, brought forward restrictions and failed to increase it.</p></speech>

That is why we are experiencing chaos for many families and crises in dealing with homelessness across the board and in housing supply.  The Government's own targets for social housing have not been met and in the past three or four years fewer than 1,000 social housing units have been built in the entire country.  The Taoiseach should contrast this with the 14,000 social housing units built between 2007 and 2010 as there is a huge difference between the two figures.  It appears as though the structure has not worked and that the Cabinet committee system has not worked because, by any objective yardstick, what was a problem or challenge a number of years ago has evolved into a full-scale crisis, notwithstanding that the committee has met eight times or nothwithstanding the Cabinet sub-committee structure the Government has established.  Does the Taoiseach accept the basic point that what the Government put in place was not adequate and that the number of meetings held simply has not been adequate to deal with this growing and escalating crisis for many families nationwide?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100025#X00400"><p>The question of homelessness and rough sleepers is dealt with under the social policy and by the public service reform committee which also meets.  This is not to state the question of housing and construction was not discussed directly by the Cabinet.  I refer to the discussions that normally take place on reports from individual Ministers.  I was not aware that Departments were admitting privately to the Deputy that they did not see this coming.  Obviously, when 90,000 houses were being built per year and when that figure fell to 8,000 or 8,500 per year after the crash, it became perfectly obvious that there would be a supply problem.  As I stated previously to the Deputy, rent supplement was an issue that put a lot of pressure on people to move from houses because the opportunity, on foot of lack of supply, means that there is pressure for space.  The rent supplement scheme supports 63,000 people at a cost of almost &euro;300 million, a significant amount of money.  Properties are secured under the scheme and 17,200 rent supplement tenancies were awarded this year, which is an important consideration for families.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, a review of rent limits earlier this year found the impact of increasing limits at a time of short supply would increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer, with no new housing being made available to new recipients.  Rather than increasing limits, rent supplement policy, therefore, obviously will continue to allow flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits both for existing customers and new applicants for rent supplement.  As I have pointed out many times, circumstances are considered on a case by case basis and rent supplement amounts are being increased above the prescribed limits as is appropriate.  This flexible approach has helped 4,700 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation.  These are some of the people who have approached the offices of Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, Ricahrd Boyd Barrett and Gerry Adams, as well as mine.  They are under pressure from their landlords to get out, but because of this flexible rental system, the rent supplement amount can be increased above the limit.  This has helped 4,700 families, which is an important consideration.  Moreover, the rent limits for the homeless under the housing assistance programme, HAP, pilot scheme were also increased to allow homeless families in Dublin to move out of hotel and emergency accommodation to find homes.  For those families in emergency accommodation in Dublin city, HAP payments will be allowed to 50% above rent supplement levels.  In addition, they are being increased in Cork, Galway, Kildare and Meath, where flexibility allows.</p>  <p>  I do not accept Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's assertion that the structure is a failure.  From my perspective, it has allowed Ministers, their Departments, agencies and Ministers of State the opportunity to respond at Cabinet sub-committees on issues of the day or issues that are important.  The Deputy may have a different view.  The system that used to operate previously was that Cabinet sub-committees met highly irregularly and normally met on a Tuesday or a Wednesday.  I found that the agendas were long and that they were unable to make decisions because other issues piled up during the course of a normal busy parliamentary week.  From my point of view, I leave available one Monday per month for whatever Cabinet sub-committee meetings are necessary.  The next meetings will be held on next Monday which allows for six or eight to be held from 8:30 a.m. onwards.  Ministers, Secretaries General and senior civil and public servants attend and personnel from different agencies or organisations, as need be, can also attend, if appropriate.  In that sense, it clearly has helped with the Action Plan for Jobs, the regional action plans and the development of and bringing to a conclusion proposals that have been put to the Government to be accepted.  The Deputy may have a different view, however, to which he is entitled.  I must state that perhaps the responsibilities of the committees might be slightly restructured in a different way.  The Government has changed the remit of a number of them because things have changed.  While families are still dealing with the issue of mortgage distress and so on, it is no longer of the same scale, as was the case two years ago.  Consequently, that matter has been put with housing and construction sector planning.  Across the entire range of Cabinet sub-committees I have found it to be a highly effective way to put propositions, set timescales, demand responses and move on to the Cabinet, where necessary, to seek decisions.</p></speech>

I put it to the Taoiseach that there probably is no sub-committee of the Cabinet of which he is a member that is guilty of a more spectacular failure and gross incompetence than this one and all those involved in it.  The result of its endeavours or lack thereof is the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State.  The position has worsened every single year since the Government took office and since the sub-committee has been deliberating on the issue of housing, as well as overseeing and informing the housing policy of the Government.  When one considers what is happening, is this not proof of gross incompetence and utter failure?  First, the problem concerns the response to the unprecedented crisis we face, with families and kids in record numbers sleeping on the street or in hostels and with housing waiting lists having spiralled out of all control to the point that one is now facing spending 18 to 19 years on a housing list.  When the Taoiseach took office, the list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire was approximately 12 years long.</p><p>It is now 18 years long.  That indicates how many people have come on to the list and how little social housing the Government has delivered.</p> <p> When these points are put to the Taoiseach, he says, "We inherited a crisis.  It is not really our fault.  We are now trying to deal with it."  That is just not an honest response.  He is not telling the truth about what the Government did, which I can only assume was based on advice from this committee.  When the Government came into office, it made a policy decision in July 2011 to cease construction of social housing.  It is in a circular issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which made clear that the intention and belief of the Government was that it would be possible to provide for the social housing needs of the State by leasing from the private sector.  It was stated explicitly.</p> <p> Is it not the truth that policy has led us to the mess we are now in?  The belief was that somehow the private sector would deliver the social housing when it self-evidently was never going to do that and has not done this.  Based on that misguided belief, the Government stopped building social housing.  Even now is the Taoiseach not being dishonest with this House and with the public when he says he switched to a policy of delivering social housing?  I keep trying to alert anybody who is interested in this debate to the fact that when we read behind the Housing 2020 strategy and the Government's claim to deliver social housing, the actual figures make it absolutely clear that 80% of the housing the Government hopes to deliver, it hopes will be delivered by the private sector through leasing.  That is a fantasy.  That cannot happen.</p></speech>

I am asking whether this committee is responsible for the misguided policy of believing that leasing from the private sector in general is capable of dealing with the problem when it self-evidently is not.  This is something the Taoiseach repeated this morning and I heard it on Leaders' Questions.  How can he possibly state that delivering private housing will provide social housing or deal with the social housing and homeless crisis?  I just do not get the mindset.</p>  <p>  Is it not obvious that the way to deliver social housing and deal with homelessness is for the State to provide it and provide the resources to deal with homelessness?  The Taoiseach continues to make the bizarre assertion that by providing private housing through the State via NAMA is somehow an answer to the social housing crisis and the homelessness crisis.  From where is this stuff coming?  Is it not time to admit that the ideology informing these policies has been a spectacular failure and must be abandoned?</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance, in consultation with NAMA, has reached agreement that 20,000 private houses would be provided by NAMA between now and 2020 on lands owned by NAMA and with contractors contracted to NAMA.  That is private housing.</p></speech>

The Government has put &euro;2.5 billion on the table for social housing and has called all the chief executives of the local authorities together and instructed them to get on with their targets and objectives and to start building.  That is separate development of infrastructure from the private housing sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will have seen an announcement by a major firm intending to build significant numbers of houses in his area.  They will be private housing, I assume.</p>  <p>  The strategy for social housing was published in November of last year.  That strategy indicated a target of 110,000 social housing units, as the Deputy is aware, through the delivery of 35,000 social housing units and meeting the needs of 75,000 households through the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme.  Those two together will deal with nearly 90,000 claims for social housing.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that it is not on for anybody going on the housing list today in 2015 not to get a house until 2037.  We will deal with that issue.  That is why the Government has put up serious amounts of public money to build social housing in order that these things can apply.  The Minister has commented on this.</p></speech>

That is in addition to those who received accommodation and assistance during 2015.</p>  <p>  For 2016, the housing allocation has increased by 18%, or &euro;125 million, from &euro;686 million to &euro;811 million.  That accounts for more than half of the budget of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is a very significant amount of money, translated in reality to houses on the ground for people who need them.  An additional &euro;56 million has been allocated for capital programmes and there is also a significant increase in current spending.  A further &euro;112 million is coming from local authorities.  I hope they get on with this business.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the Government's allocation is designed to meet the target of 22,882 social housing units by 2017.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and his departmental officials have had significant engagement with the local authorities about this.  So far in 2015, nearly &euro;500 million in capital funding has been allocated to local authority and approved housing body projects.  These projects will contribute to delivery in 2016 and when taken together 17,100 units will be provided next year.</p>  <p>  It is not as if Government was sitting back and wondering what should happen here.  There has been a raft of measures, including legislation, incentives, changes in the structure of the welfare system and now direct finance to the local authorities from public funding to build public housing for social housing through the registered housing authorities together with NAMA and the private sector in general, to meet the demand.</p></speech>

It can be useful to have a core group or a sub-committee dealing with these issues but it is results that count.  It is not a question of the structures but the results of their deliberations.  Despite the eight meetings and the frequency of Government press releases, we are now in a live crisis.  Last December 40 families lost their homes.  It is now between 70 and 80 families each month.  A year ago more than 300 families, including 726 children, were homeless in Dublin.  In May this figure had risen to 900 children and almost 1,500 adults.  I do not have a huge amount of time to go through all these statistics.</p><p>Two weeks ago, a major European report, the European index of exclusion 2015, found that the State had the second highest rate of rent and mortgage arrears within the European Union.  One in five citizens is affected by this.  Of the 28 EU member states, this state is the second worst, with almost half of the poorer households paying out more.  At the end of June almost 100,000 mortgage accounts were in arrears and just over 70,000 households were in arrears of more than 90 days.  All of the bad policies contribute to children being at risk of poverty - 34% compared to the EU average of 28%.  Regardless of the structure and the number of meetings, the fact is the Government has favoured the private rental market as opposed to building social and affordable houses in which to house people.  The dependency on the private rental market, which is for profit, has driven up rents.  Unscrupulous landlords have exploited that and pushed down conditions for those who are renting the accommodation.  The committee is not working.  The crisis is getting worse day by day and there is no strategy to deal with it.  Will the Taoiseach consider standing down the membership of that committee or, as I said to him previously, go to the European Commission to have the housing crisis declared a national emergency?  I put that suggestion to the Taoiseach twice today and he has not even had the good manners to answer me.  Even if he said to me, "That is nonsense, Gerry, forget about it," but he did not even answer me, he just ignored the suggestion.  Would that not be something the Construction 2020, housing planning and mortgage arrears Cabinet sub-committee could consider in the time ahead?</p> <p> As the Taoiseach and other Members were speaking, up came the magical year of 2016.  What would any of the signatories of the Proclamation think of the statistics, which are living people, citizens, and the way they are being treated?  They cannot even have a home, a roof over their heads, and they are in danger of poverty on the Taoiseach's watch.</p></speech>

Those who are in difficulty have had very little contact with the lender in the first place.  That is why the insolvency agency practitioners and MABS are working with each individual case to take them out of the distress and remove the fear which had led to the situation where letters are unopened.  I hope that in the time ahead the remaining membership of that group, where there are distressed mortgages, can be dealt with.  The signatories of the Proclamation in 1916 will ask whether the Government responded to the housing crisis.  Given the scale of the collapse that took place, with the loss of 100,000 jobs, emigration haemorrhaging all over the place, us being blocked out of the markets, the people, in accepting the scale of the challenge, have pulled the country back from that brink to a point where we are in a very different position now.

As the Taoiseach is aware, members of the ASTI, the TUI and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors voted to reject the proposals.  The question now arises as to how their members will be treated from January when the agreement comes into force.  As a result of the commencement order being signed, will the Taoiseach confirm that the members of the three unions will not lose out on incremental pay rises due next year?  Will he also confirm that secondary schoolteachers will receive their &euro;1,600 in supervision and substitution allowances which are due to be introduced in two phases next year?  The Taoiseach will agree there is no precedent in the State's history for treating public sector employees differently, based solely on union membership.</p>  <p>  Given that more than 100,000 families are still in mortgage arrears, it is surprising and very disappointing that no fines or other financial penalties have been imposed on banks found to be in breach of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The code is far from perfect, but it does offer a level of protection to borrowers who are in difficulty with their mortgages, and banks and financial institutions should respond accordingly.  It is a very weak approach so far.  The Central Bank's report in June found a litany of breaches of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Some of the instances were very shocking, for example, in terms of lenders continuing with legal action against their customers although they had already agreed repayment deals.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that he finds that behaviour shocking?  When will the financial services (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be published?</p>  <p>  In the programme for Government the Taoiseach committed to introduce legislation on a tenancy deposit protection scheme to put an end to disputes concerning the return of deposits.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is to be debated in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that legislative commitment in the programme for Government will be introduced either via amendment or by other means in the context of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill?</p>  <p>  We have all received correspondence concerning the review panel established by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>Some 320 cases were referred to the review panel set up by the Minister, to review cases where families believed a miscarriage of justice had occurred or that garda&iacute; did not act appropriately in their individual cases.  Some have received notification that their cases are closed but many more have not been contacted at all.  There is a great deal of stress as a result of that.  People are anxious, disillusioned and frustrated with the entire process.  The criminal justice (victims rights) Bill could help in this regard.  Can the Taoiseach give any indication when the process regarding the review panel will be completed and when that legislation will be introduced?</p></speech>

Not everybody will be pleased with that given the nature and length of time many of these cases have been through different fora, but I will confirm that for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p>  <p>  I will come back to the Deputy in respect of his question about members of unions who voted against the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, although that Bill has gone through.

Ta ceist eile on the promised emergency legislation in respect of the commission of investigation into the IBRC.  The Taoiseach's promised to establish a citizens convention to discuss changes to the Eighth amendment of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  On the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, yesterday the Taoiseach told the Paris Climate Change Conference that he wants an ambitious and binding agreement that ultimately, will limit global temperature.  At the same time, however, he confirmed that the State will not meet the previous goals for a 20% reduction in emission targets for 2020.  It is reported that we have only achieved a miserly 5% reduction, and this will cost the State &euro;600 million in fines.  In the light of those clearly contradictory positions and the importance of the Paris conference for this and future generations, will the Taoiseach agree to a D&aacute;il debate on the Paris conference before Christmas?  I asked the Taoiseach this question last week and again he did not answer it.  Will he also confirm that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill will be brought to the D&aacute;il next week? </p>  <p>  On the issue of emergency legislation in respect of the commission of investigation into the IBRC, the Taoiseach will recall that he refused to accept responsibility for the chaos around the setting up of the commission.  He also refused to publish the legal advice from the Attorney General upon which the commission was established.  It is clear that the Attorney General and the Government missed the issues involved entirely or, as is my submission, the Taoiseach did not want to have a proper investigation into these matters.  However, he said in response to my question that he expects to bring to the Government a response taking into account all the parties' views next Tuesday.  Was the issue discussed at this morning's Cabinet meeting, and what steps does the Government intend to take to put in place a proper legal context for the creation of the commission to allow the commission get on and do its work?</p>  <p>  At the weekend the Taoiseach said he is planning to establish a citizens' convention to discuss changes to the Eighth amendment of the Constitution.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports changing this Article but there are already four outstanding reports from the Constitutional Convention that have yet to be even debated in the D&aacute;il.  Now, despite the Government being in clear breach of the timetable it set itself for these, the Taoiseach is announcing another convention.  Last March he told me - we are now into December - that all the matters arising from these reports have been completed by the relevant Departments.  All the delegate citizens who came together in the Constitutional Convention did such a good job and the relevant Departments of Government scrutinised all of this, but still we have not had debates here.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that these reports will be discussed before this D&aacute;il concludes for an election, and will he consider meeting the Opposition leaders, but on a proper cl&aacute;r or agenda, to discuss any new constitutional or citizens' convention to agree a format and maximise the potential for positive change?</p></speech>

I gave him an undertaking that we would have those debates before the House rises for this session and we will do that.</p>  <p>  In regard to the question of the climate change Bill, the amendments from the Seanad will be taken on Thursday morning here in the D&aacute;il and I would expect that the Deputy will be able to make reference to the question of the meeting in Paris of the different political leaders and the roadmap set out for climate justice, climate change and so on.</p>  <p>  In regard to IBRC, the Government did consider that this morning.  There are a  number of issues involved.  First, I thank the leaders of the Opposition parties for the letters I received from them but the question of confidentiality, the issue of legal privilege, access to information from the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange, the revisions to the terms of reference, the definition of capital loss, the liquidation of Siteserv plc, conflicts of interest in the appointment of an additional member to the commission, the management of the workload, the resources required and the timeframe for reporting are all matters that were raised in the interim report of Mr. Justice Cregan and which in many cases were referred to by the Opposition parties in their response.  I have considered all of these issues and arising from that as there are clearly a number of difficulties and complications, I intend to set out, as I see it, what they are, in writing, later this week for the Opposition leaders.  We then need to meet on that issue with an opportunity for the Deputies to give their views as to how the wish of the Government and the Oireachtas can be followed through to achieve our intention of having complete transparency and accountability about the questions that were raised and about the reason for the commission being set up in the first place.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the matter of the Eighth amendment of the Constitution, I was referring here to individual party positions and I have set out what my own party's position will be.  Clearly, if the people decide to re-elect the Government, as is their prerogative to do so or not as the case might be, it would be, of course, appropriate that there would be a full-scale involvement of everybody in respect of any formation of a citizens' assembly or citizens' convention.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy was happy at the meeting in Ballymascanlon to point out that &euro;200 million would be allocated to the Garda for information sharing and information capacity enhancement.  We have joined the Schengen information system, which will mean every garda on the beat will have that information.  The college in Templemore is open with 600 people to be recruited next year.  Money has been allocated for proper vehicles and facilities for garda&iacute; to do their job.  These issues are discussed and commented on by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

This relates to the various bodies that can undertake the construction of public authority housing or private authority housing.  Could the Bill include a provision whereby local authorities could be eligible for consideration as approved bodies?</p>  <p>  Another issue that has begun to gain air time recently is the apparent hardening attitude among the banks in respect of outstanding mortgages in particular cases where borrowers have consistently striven to meet their payments.  In such cases, they should have been entitled to favourable treatment at this stage, but that has not necessarily been the case.  In the context of the Central Bank consolidation Bill, could there be a review of the situation with a view to ensuring borrowers who have made consistent efforts to discharge their debts are given helpful treatment?</p></speech>

There is no reason, as has applied for many years, local authorities should not be in the business, or getting back into the business, of building houses.  I recall as a member of a local authority there always being a serious housing development programme before the approved housing bodies came along.  That Bill will be published next year.</p>  <p>  There is no date for the publication of the Central Bank consolidation Bill.  The issue the Deputy raised has been dealt with in a number of other ways.</p></speech>

He outlined that he proposes to include additional heads in the misuse of drugs (amendment) Bill, which is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  He goes on to state, "It is expected that the Bill will be published in early 2016," but he could not say for certain whether it would be enacted before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  This is an urgent matter.  As the Minister of State stated in the letter, "The practice is unhygienic and poses a significant health risk to the drug users and through the discarding of needles, also poses a significant health risk to the general public."  Can I have clarification on whether this Bill will be enacted before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

There are people listening in the Visitors Gallery and a little decorum might be called for.</p>  <p>  Last Tuesday evening, I had a meeting with a couple, Catherina and Stephen McGarry, from Sallynoggin, Dublin.  On November 27 1991, 24 years ago, their daughter Jennifer Anna was born in the Coombe hospital.  It was a forceps delivery and it went badly wrong.  Jennifer Anna&rsquo;s spine was badly damaged and just over ten weeks later, on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 1992, she died in her mother&rsquo;s arms.  Incredibly, her death was not reported to the coroner.  In addition to this, Jennifer Anna&rsquo;s brain and spine were removed from her body without the consent of her parents.  Catherina and Stephen only learned of this in 2012, 20 years later.  In 2009, the national audit of retained organs and post mortem practices occurred but they were not informed of it.</p>  <p>  The Coombe hospital has now apologised in a somewhat qualified way to the couple over Jennifer Anna&rsquo;s death.  The hospital now accepts that Catherina should have had a caesarean section at an earlier stage.  If that had happened, it is likely that Jennifer Anna would have been born without injury.  It is clear too that she would be alive today.  The qualified apology by the Coombe, while welcome, does not go far enough by any objective yardstick or for Catherina and Stephen McGarry.  They want justice and accountability and are anxious that their daughter&rsquo;s case be independently inquired into.  They would also like a meeting with the Minister for Health to put their case.</p>  <p>  They have written to the Minister on several occasions seeking a meeting but he has always refused their request.  In a letter on 2 November last, they were told in a letter from the Minister, &ldquo;there will be no further reply to correspondence on this matter.&rdquo;  I have read the hospital's report.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his previous refusal to meet Catherina and Stephen McGarry and to meet with them at his earliest convenience.  I also urge him to support their call for an independent inquiry and take steps to ensure such an inquiry takes place.</p>  <p>  After the death of Jennifer Anna, Catherina and Stephen tried many more times to have children but had to endure seven miscarriages.  They also tried to adopt but were rejected on grounds of age.  This entire event has had an enormous and profoundly damaging impact on their lives.  Catherina makes the valid point that if she did something wrong, she would have to be held accountable for it.</p>  <p>  I understand the registrar who delivered the child using a forceps subsequently moved to the United Kingdom and that later, he resigned from a position in a hospital after concerns were raised about his treatment of patients.  There are issues there to be inquired into.  At the very least, an independent investigation is warranted in this case and that those involved and responsible be held to account.</p>  <p>  At the very least, will the Minister meet with the couple to hear their case?  It is evident that without the work Stephen and Catherina did themselves, we would not even have the report or the review that the Coombe hospital belatedly published in the past year.  It is their work and persistence that has resulted in this matter being raised in the D&aacute;il today and in the review being carried out by the hospital.</p></speech>

The Deputy will appreciate that I have a no role in individual cases and do not have access to individual patient files or personal information.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Coombe hospital have been in contact with this family on an ongoing basis for several years and have apologised to them for the death of their child 23 years ago.  In 2012, the Coombe hospital initiated a systems review to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of an infant in 1992.  This review, undertaken in line with the HSE's incident management policy and guidelines, concluded that there were deficiencies in care which contributed to the child&rsquo;s death.  It is important we learn from these adverse incidents as the single most important obligation for any health service is patient safety and improving the quality of care.  That is why the Government is committed to improving the quality and safety of maternity services.  A national women&rsquo;s and infant health programme will be established by the HSE to drive improvement and standardise care across all 19 maternity units.  The maternity strategy under development will provide the policy to direct and underpin the work of the programme.</p><p>There was also an additional &euro;2 million provided to the HSE in 2015 to improve maternity services further and this funding provided for the appointment of additional staff, including additional obstetricians, midwives and other front-line staff.  We will build on these improvements through the provision of further additional resources for maternity services in 2016, the detail of which will be set out in the HSE's national service plan.</p></speech>

It is too cold.  I asked him to meet the couple and he should meet them.  They can inform him on why there are issues across the hospital system.  He is saying he has been informed by the HSE and the Coombe hospital.  The Coombe hospital has not covered itself in glory in regard to this case.  There are fundamental lessons to be learned from this case alone and how the Coombe hospital dealt with it.  As the Minister has put the Coombe hospital and the HSE in charge of what happens in the Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, so it has to be beyond reproach.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge improvements which might have been announced today or last year and so on but this case was not even reported to the coroner.  It was only reported to the coroner in recent months.  That is very worrying.  The apology is a qualified apology and the full story has not come out.  There are issues in terms of what happened here.  There are issues around the registrar.  Did the authorities pursue those issues?  Greater clarity needs to be brought to the situation as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  Just because it happened many years ago is no reason to try to push it to one side and say, "I have been informed" and "I have no role in individual cases", because the Minister does have a role.  I never said the Minister had access to files.  However, when cases such as this one come to light, we all have a role.  I could easily say I have no role.  It was quite incidental that I came across the couple involved.  I did not seek out the case to raise it in this House.  I met the couple on a doorstep and they came to me months later and asked me to raise the matter here.  The Minister should meet the couple.  He may learn something through their experience about how the system works.</p>  <p>  There should be an independent inquiry.  What we have had so far is not an independent inquiry.  The Coombe Hospital has not covered itself in glory in this matter and that needs to be revealed and lessons learned.  Full accountability and answers as to why it was not reported to the coroner at the time are also required.</p></speech>

I have met the families in Portlaoise and Mr. Rowlette and Mr. Kivlehan.  I met the patients' councils at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, and Cavan Monaghan Hospital.  I meet patients and patient groups all the time.  There are, however, 2 million patient attendances in the public health service every year.  If one goes back 20 years, that is 40 million attendances.  It is not possible for me to meet everyone.  I meet people where I have a particular role and can add something and there is a particular purpose to the meeting.</p>  <p>  On the request for an inquiry or inquest, I am advised by the HSE legal services that this case must be notified to the current coroner and that no statute of limitations applies to the matter.  Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick on behalf of the Coombe hospital has written to the coroner officially notifying him of the death.  The coroner responded that he had received the notice and a decision on whether to hold an inquest will be made by the coroner, who is an independent quasi-judicial officer.  I do not have the authority to order an inquest be carried out.  It is a matter at this stage for the coroner.</p></speech>

We know that people get caught up in abusing and misusing drugs and alcohol and many will be come addicted.  While there is a wide range of reasons this happens, we can all agree that no one sets out to become an addict or an alcoholic.  I would like to see everyone in recovery and very much support the work of the Recovery Academy, but the reality is that there are those who will stay in addiction.  We need a wide range of options and services to enable and support stability and recovery.  We also need to do more in terms of prevention and education but that is another day's work.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, I hosted a meeting in the AV room in Leinster House on having a medically supervised injecting centre.  It was difficult to look at someone injecting him or herself but there was no doubt it was done in a clean and safe environment.  People who work in these kinds of centres told me they saw a reduction in the use of heroin, the safe disposal of drug paraphernalia, a reduction in the incidence of overdoses and other health issues being addressed.  The film showed an older cohort of established drug user.  I wonder about the injecting drug users we see shooting up on the streets and their chaotic lives.  Will they be able to get to a centre to avail of these services?</p>  <p>  I agree that this is a medical as well as a health issue and that medical supervision is required.  These centres have been recommended as far back as 2005.  The questions relate to the timeframe, because we are under pressure.  We must ensure the injecting centre does not come out of the current addiction services budget, which has been pretty much decimated.  Location is another issue.  I know everyone will say, "Not in my back yard", but there are areas that have an abundance of services allied with private rental accommodation meaning anti-social behaviour and criminality occurs.  A mobile unit was suggested and the Ana Liffey Drug Project has also made a suggestion.  I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and his availability to task forces, projects and those working in addiction and the launching of reports.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister of State for the way he has handled the matter to date and ask him to clarify further how it will be addressed and delivered.  I have just come from the Joint Committee on Health and Children which has been discussing emerging trends and key responses to HIV in Ireland.  It has been indicated that there has been a substantial increase in the incidence of HIV in recent years, in particular last year and this year.  There is also a younger cohort contracting HIV in various ways, some of which have been identified.  There is major concern that intravenous drug addiction and behaviour is one of the contributory factors.  There is a strong view that having properly supervised injecting rooms would be effective in addressing this situation.  Street injection is particularly dangerous and risky.  It is engaged in by marginalised groups, individuals, homeless people and people with various difficulties and it seems it is now taking place to a greater degree than in the past.</p>  <p>  We must address the issue in an effective manner.  It is time to grasp the nettle and say that this is one way to deal with some of the problems related to drug abuse.  It is not a panacea by any means.  Resources are needed across the board.  Other aspects must also be addressed.  However, we can have safe and supervised injecting.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction recently reported that, in areas where it has been introduced, this can be an effective way of reducing HIV and other harmful problems associated with intravenous drug addiction.</p></speech>

This morning I accompanied Mr. Tony Duffin and other members of the Ana Liffey Drug Project on a walk through the streets north and south of the River Liffey for an hour and a half.</p><p>What I came across was particularly shocking.  I saw drug paraphernalia, human excrement, the result of a drug user's withdrawal symptoms, blood and various other types of drug litter.  What I witnessed today is still very much playing on my mind.  I had been on a walk-around previously with Mr. Duffin and was very much taken aback then.  I was taken aback again today by what I had witnessed.  I will give the official response and we can then discuss the issue in more detail.</p> <p> I thank the Deputies for raising the issue of the recognised problem of street injecting in Ireland.  The establishment of supervised injecting centres has been proposed by the Ana Liffey drugs project.  Such centres are essentially drug consumption rooms where drug injection is facilitated in a clinical setting under the supervision of nurses and counsellors.  Service users are supplied with clean injecting kits and health care professionals are on hand to make an intervention in the event of a drug overdose.  These centres save lives.  </p> <p> Supervised injecting centres seek to attract hard-to-reach populations of chronic injecting drug users.  They are particularly effective in reaching out to marginalised groups, namely, those who use drugs on the street or in other risky and unhygienic conditions and those who have remained out of reach of or who are resistant to higher threshold services.  </p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I have reviewed the evidence on supervised injecting centres and intend to submit a formal proposal to the Government before Christmas.  The aim of any supervised injecting centre is to reduce the incidence of public street injecting and the negative impact it has on those who inject, in terms of their dignity, health and ability to access health and social care services, as well as on the wider community and public service providers such as garda&iacute; and ambulance personnel.   The aim is also to reduce the number of drug-related deaths resulting directly from overdoses.</p> <p> No decision has yet been made on the number or location of such facilities.  I intend to include additional heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to provide for supervised injecting centres.  Drafting of the Bill is under way in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Bill will restore the Government's powers to make regulations to control new drugs.  As Deputies will know, these powers were curtailed by the Court of Appeal judgment earlier this year.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in early 2016 and provide for a legislative unblocking of any impediment to the introduction of medically supervised injecting centres.</p> <p> I agree with Deputy Joe Costello when he says this is not a panacea.  It is not the only response available to us.  There are lots of overlapping concerns, including homelessness, isolation, marginalisation and disadvantage.  A humane response to the issue of street injecting is to take the small cohort of very vulnerable drug users who are outside any mainstream drug programme off the streets, away from corners, bus shelters, parks and playgrounds and provide them with a safe, secure and compassionate setting where they can inject, as they will do anyway.  The aim is to curtail the possibility of their contracting HIV or hepatitis C and to save lives.  Nobody anywhere in the world who has injected in a medically supervised injecting centre has died of an overdose.  There are 88 such centres across Europe and several in Australia and other parts of the world and they work very effectively.</p> <p> I expect the legislation to be introduced in the House early next year, after which we will have to talk about management, the way any such centre would be organised, where they would be located and the funding mechanisms which would have to be put in place to run them effectively.  I envisage one centre being opened in Dublin city centre initially, but representations are being made to my office to have supervised injecting centres opened in other urban centres, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</p></speech>

I still believe recovery is the ultimate goal, but, in the meantime, we need innovative strategies to deal with the people concerned, the kernel of which are compassion and dignity.  I refer to the issue of detox beds and draw the Minister of State's attention to a winter strategy used in London in the 1990s.  Unused office space was taken over and a floor set aside for those who were homeless and had an addiction but who wanted to embark on a detox programme.  The project reached a cohort of extremely vulnerable people.  The criteria for entry into a detox programme do not suit poly drug users who are homeless and who, in many cases, have mental health issues.</p>  <p>  In terms of a timeframe, I hope the Government will not fall before the legislation is passed.  This is World Aids Day and this issue is part of that bigger debate.  I ask the Minister of State to verify that additional funding will be provided and that the centres will not be funded from the current drugs budget.</p></speech>

That is most welcome and it is great to see some action being taken on the matter.  The sooner it happens, the better.  It is welcome that a provision for supervised injecting centres will be included in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister of State is correct in saying there are other areas of the country besides Dublin which would welcome centres of this nature and this should be taken into consideration by the Government.  It must, of course, be done with public consultation because there is something of a stigma attached to drug abuse.  We must ensure we treat this as a health issue rather than as something that inspires fear in communities.  There is important work to be done to reassure people in this respect.</p>  <p>  This is a very welcome development.  It is certainly not a panacea and we must ensure adequate resources are put in place to make it work and that it will not affect existing resources.  This is definitely a step in the right direction.</p></speech>

I thank all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for supporting this initiative.  A memo has been sent to all Departments seeking their observations which should be with us by 15 December.  Upon their receipt, we will proceed with inserting the relevant section into the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill which will be presented to the House in the new year.</p>  <p>  What I saw this morning shocked me.  I saw syringes discarded dangerously on the steps of the Customs House and in alleyways.  I also saw blood and human excrement.  This is our city and the people concerned are citizens of this republic who are, for their own reasons and because of their vulnerability, forced into a situation where they feel they have no option but to access an area behind a dumpster to engage in this activity.  We have to look at this issue from the perspective of the entire community and within it drug users who need dignity and a safe, compassionate place where they can inject heroin in a controlled way in order to take the first step on the road to recovery, safe from contracting HIV or hepatitis C and from the danger of taking an overdose.  It is a compassionate response which will be welcomed by the citizens of Dublin and Ireland who are nervous about the unsightly nature of open injecting.  The retailers of Dublin city are also pushing for this measure.  I do not agree with the suggestion that there should be a mobile clinic because there is a better chance of developing a long-term relationship with a facility if it is located in one fixed spot.  However, that is a discussion we must have after the legislation has been passed.  Once the Bill has been enacted, we can get into discussions about regulation, funding, control and consultation.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for their support and hope to see an historic new section in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in the new year which will provide for an injecting centre in Dublin initially and perhaps, in the coming years, in other parts of the country.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance described it recently as &quot;miniscule&quot;.</p><p>From what I have read, there seems to be a movement in the direction of extending this to towns in some way.  I want to put forward another suggestion, which is to extend the initiative specifically to the counties of Waterford and Limerick.  This is for a number of reasons, one being that they were the two locations picked when the Living City initiative was devised and that choice was based on levels of deprivation in both cities.</p> <p> We should not give up on this scheme.  I believe it will be successful if it is varied in some manner.  Much effort has been put into it and I believe it will contribute to heritage-led renewal and economic recovery.  My guess is that the massive success of the home renovation scheme has affected the take-up of the Living City initiative in some respects.  Where I see a difficulty with extending this scheme to towns, as the Heritage Council has proposed, is due to the incredibly lengthy process with the European Commission the Department has dealt with during the years.  As the Minister will know, it took almost three years to get the Commission to sign off on the scheme.  If there is to be an extension, it should be as simple as possible in a regulatory sense.  That is why I suggest extending it to the counties of Waterford and Limerick, even for a certain period of time.  My understanding is that to do this, it may not be necessary to have new legislation underpinning variants of the scheme and it might be possible with a commencement order identifying the area in question and by utilisation of the Taxes Consolidation Acts.</p> <p> My concern is that if we go down the road of identifying architectural conservation areas in various towns around the country, as proposed by the Heritage Council, we will probably have to deal with the European Commission again, and it could take another three years or longer.  I believe the county version is simpler and more workable and it should be considered.  When the Department of Finance thought up this proposal on the first day, a figure was assessed as to how much foregone revenue would be involved over a number of years.  However, we will not come close to that in terms of take-up, based on the numbers I have seen so far.  I believe we should vary the initiative but do so in a manner that capitalises on what is a very good scheme and, at the same time, waste as little time as possible.  To focus on the two locations this initiative was constructed for at the outset would seem to make most sense.</p></speech>

The Living City initiative was enacted in the Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5 May 2015, following discussions with the European Commission to ensure that the initiative was in compliance with state aid rules.  It is worth pointing out, therefore, that the initiative has been operational for just six months.</p><p>The initial intention of the Living City initiative was to provide tax relief on the refurbishment of inner city Georgian buildings in Limerick and Waterford, both those used for commercial purposes and those that are residential homes.  These types of buildings are traditionally more expensive to refurbish and inner city areas had been suffering neglect due to the relocation of homes and businesses to the suburbs.</p><p>A comprehensive independent <i>ex ante</i>cost-benefit analysis was carried out by Indecon International Economic Consultants, which recommended, among other elements, extending the initiative to rundown areas of other cities in Ireland.  Correspondingly, four more cities were included in the initiative, namely, Dublin, Cork, Kilkenny and Galway.  As I have said all along, the initiative is targeting particular areas of these six cities which are most in need of regeneration and it was never intended as a widespread initiative.</p><p>The Heritage Council recently recommended in its report on policy proposals for Ireland's towns that the Living City initiative should be extended to include the historic core areas of all Irish towns where these are protected as architectural conservation areas and that the specific fiscal measures be tailored more directly to attract people to live and do business in towns.  I considered potential extensions of the Living City initiative in the run-up to budget 2016 but decided not to bring forward changes at this time as this would provide uncertainty about the operation of the initiative and could encourage further demands for extensions.</p><p>I also considered proposals to provide incentives to target rural areas or towns.  As has been seen elsewhere, tax breaks alone will not encourage people to live in an area where there is no work or sustainable lifestyle for them.  A more integrated solution for revitalising rural areas is needed, rather than just tax reliefs.  I believe direct expenditure is a more appropriate way to target support to rural areas for their regeneration.</p><p>It is also important to note that a tax relief only works if there is sufficient taxable income to obtain the benefit.  A grant system, by comparison, can be fairer as it applies to those who pay low rates of tax, those who pay no tax and also higher income earners.  Tax reliefs, for example, are generally not of interest to those in social housing, those who are pensioners and those who pay low rates of tax.</p><p>The Living City initiative is a targeted property incentive aimed at a specific goal: older buildings in urban areas which were neglected and deprived.  Since the initiative has launched, I have received requests to extend the initiative to newer buildings, to other areas and to areas which are not as deprived within those cities.  I do not think a one-size-fits-all approach can be taken when considering tax reliefs.  Just because a tax relief exists, that does not mean it can or should be extended to cover other areas.  I also am very conscious to take care that we do not see a repeat of the days of property-based incentives extended beyond their original target.</p><p>My officials and I are willing to consider suggestions for tax reliefs.  However, I remind the Deputy of both the tax expenditure guidelines and the Department's commitment to evidence-based policy-making.  Any tax incentive needs to carefully considered and used in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></speech>

At the launch, the Minister's former Secretary General, Mr. John Moran, challenged the Heritage Council to identify the role of the small town with heritage attributes in Irish economic recovery.  That is how it came about.  This is the document the Heritage Council came up with.  While it is a very good document, I am not sure the council has a clear understanding of how problematic it was to get clearance from the European Commission on certain matters involving the Living City initiative.</p>  <p>  My main purpose is to put into the heads of Department of Finance officials and the Minister, going into next year, that singling out a county or counties on a certain timeline would make more sense.  I know there have been other proposals to extend the Living City initiative and they have been rejected.  However, I believe the simpler the parameters of this, the better.  I am from Waterford and the Minister is from Limerick, but this is not some selfish political proposal.  The scheme was constructed with these two locations in mind and it makes sense to stick with them, if any variance takes place.  I also know that the Department of Finance is working on a tax relief scheme for older private houses, as that has been publicised today, and believe this matter should be considered in conjunction with that scheme.</p></speech>

There are seven applications in Dublin, one in Cork, none in Limerick, six in Waterford, two in Kilkenny and two in Galway.</p><p>I presume when various tax advisers and professional groups in these cities learn more about the scheme, the take-up will be even more significant, because it has been in place such a short time - since last May.</p> <p> On the issue of extending the scheme, I thought about doing that before the budget.  However, there are many reasons for the decline of rural towns and we need a package of measures to revitalise them.  Tax-breaks alone will not revitalise them.  Unless a town has an economic base, a tax-break will not drive people into it, unless perhaps we go back to the type of tax-breaks that allow an investor to develop a building in a town and apply the tax-break deriving from that development to rental income from investments elsewhere.  That crossover was one of the seeds of the Celtic tiger.  In that situation a developer could build houses on the upper Shannon and not occupy them but could write off the cost of construction against rental income in Dublin city, for example.  He or she could also then sell his or her tax credits to another developer if he or she had not enough tax to cover them.  That created a kind of market.</p> <p> I agree on the particular problem identified by the Deputy and, God willing and if we are all back here after the general election, I would like to work with him to see whether we could come up with a more broad-based solution.  There is a problem, but there are few policy initiatives targeted to remediate it.</p></speech>

We have seen a shocking increase in crime, particularly in the number of burglaries carried out by mobile criminals driving high speed cars.  The recent official figures indicate that Kildare ranks in third place in terms of the number of burglaries per county, while my county, County Laois, ranks in sixth place out of the 26 counties.</p>  <p>  The map produced last weekend shows clearly that communities adjacent to motorways in these counties are hardest hit.  The significant shortage of garda&iacute; on the ground does not help matters.  We have a serious shortage of garda&iacute; in terms of trying to deal with this problem.  The shortage is not just in the overall number of garda&iacute; but in the number of garda&iacute; in rural areas or on the beat.  People in rural areas are being terrorised.  I have come across several who have been burgled a number of times in the past couple of years.  In areas around Camross, Borris-in-Ossory, Monasterevin and Kildangan, I have seen farmyards turned into fortresses.  I have spent a good bit of my time in rural areas and this is one of the big changes I have seen.  Not only are people turning their farmyards into fortresses, they are taking more extreme measures to protect their houses and themselves.  People now keep a German Shepherd or two or a Rottweiler in their yards and they tell me and others that they are keeping a shotgun in their bedrooms at night.</p>  <p>  There is no easy solution to this problem, but we must try to get back to a situation where we make communities safer.  More garda&iacute; have been promised, but I recognise it will take time to deliver on that promise.  None has materialised to date.  In the Laois-Offaly division, there are far fewer garda&iacute; than there were a year ago, following the closure of Ballinakill and Ballacolla garda stations.  In the station in Monasterevin in south Kildare which services that area and the hinterland around it out to Kildangan there are only three garda&iacute;.  We need more garda&iacute; on the ground and a more visible and active presence in rural areas.   The community alert and text alert schemes do great work, but I would like to see these developed further.  I would also like the Government to develop some initiatives in regard to text alerts, because they are a help in preventing and solving crime and I have seen their benefit at first hand.</p>  <p>  I suggest cameras should be placed at junctions and slip roads along our motorways and on the M7 and M8.  Cameras should also be placed at other strategic locations in co-operation with the community alert schemes in rural areas.  We cannot place cameras everywhere, but they could be placed at key locations being used by mobile criminals to gain access to rural areas.  If we targeted these locations with proper high quality cameras, that would be a help.</p></speech>

She is grateful to the Deputy for raising this important matter in the House.  She is aware of the concerns about rural crime, burglary in particular.  She considers that burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, particularly in the very distressing situations where householders may be assaulted by the criminals involved.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, following an urgent review of the overall approach to dealing with burglary, the Minister published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015.  This legislation targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law-abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.  It is hoped to have this new legislation enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The new legislation will underpin the concerted drive which is now being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na against those involved in burglary and other property crimes, which is co-ordinated under Operation Thor.  Operation Thor is a new multi-strand national anti-crime operation which will entail a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders, as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  The Garda approach includes additional high visibility patrols and an increase in checkpoints to tackle criminal gangs using the national road network.  Garda&iacute; are also making important use of technology to target suspect vehicles, including automatic number plate recognition, as well as deploying new high powered vehicles for use by the armed regional response units.  In addition, a high profile national crime prevention awareness campaign is under way as part of Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  The full suite of policing and awareness measures is made possible by the increased investment in policing by the Government, including an allocation of &euro;5 million to specifically support Operation Thor.  This follows the investment of &euro;34 million in Garda vehicles since 2012, with 640 new vehicles becoming available this year, as well as an investment of &euro;1.75 million in airborne surveillance technology.  In addition, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a very significant investment in new Garda technology and information systems as well as the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, amounting to &euro;205 million over the lifetime of the plan.  Operation Thor is further supported by the decision of the Government to end the moratorium on Garda recruitment, with 550 new recruits having already been taken in and a further 600 to commence training next year.</p>  <p>  In regard to the use of CCTV, Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the identified operational needs and priorities and decisions in regard to these systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Some community based CCTV systems have been implemented in previous years and in this regard the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has recently made an announcement regarding piloting the provision of CCTV in rural areas, to be funded from the Rural Development Programme 2014 to 2020.  In addition, having regard to the value that communities place on CCTV, the Minister for Justice and Equality has instigated a review of the effectiveness of the community CCTV scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  This review process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I have outlined the determined strategy she is pursuing to confront and disrupt those who attempt to prey on law abiding householders.  All of these measures, including new legislation and targeted Garda operations, will support a robust response to criminals, enhance public safety and provide communities with the reassurance of a visible and determined police force.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need for extra vehicles and it is welcome that 550 new recruits have started their training.  It is important that these measures continu on a rolling basis until we get numbers up, but that alone will not bring about a solution.</p><p>The other part of policing is legislation.  The legislation being brought forward on repeat offenders is obviously a positive move.  We have seen the statistics and a relatively small cohort is creating most of the mayhem and havoc, terrorising people in their homes.  I emphasise that we can recruit as many garda&iacute; as we like, but unless they are out on the ground it is no use.  I know there are specialist units working behind desks doing research or whatever and I understand the logic of that.  However, the absence of garda&iacute; on the ground in many counties is a huge problem.</p> <p> The third strand concerns partnership with the community.  Several community groups have already raised essential funding to erect cameras.  Under the pilot scheme, one group in south County Laois has been given &euro;50,000 to erect cameras.  That group is located adjacent to a motorway as well.  I am appealing for a more modest funding scheme for a number of groups that are adjacent to the motorway.  There are a lot of groups which, if they got &euro;10,000 funding, would be able to put up specialist cameras in conjunction with the garda&iacute;.  That certainly would be of great benefit.</p> <p> I am asking that a scheme of grants be put in place for community alert schemes located adjacent to motorways, to help catch the criminals, to prevent crime and to strengthen partnership with local communities.  That will be a missing piece of the jigsaw if we do not get it right.  I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot be here, but I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, to bring back to her my suggestion of a scheme of modest grants for community alert schemes operating adjacent to the motorway corridors in Laois, Kildare and other such counties.</p></speech>

I am familiar with many of the points the Deputy has raised.  Just last night I attended the Louth IFA meeting in the Ballymascanlon House Hotel in north County Louth to discuss these very issues.  Reference was, in fact, made by a senior IFA representative to the south County Laois pilot scheme, funded by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  I hope that will be an effective measure for the community in south County Laois and elsewhere.  It is certainly something that should be given wider consideration.  Let us assess the efficacy of that measure when we are in a position to do so.  Any measures that can give reassurance to members of the community in rural Ireland should be given serious consideration.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned, the issue of community CCTV is under review.  I have already set out the comprehensive strategy the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner is implementing to confront those who engage in burglary and similar crimes at the expense of law-abiding citizens, who form the majority of the population.  Operation Thor has been given great prominence and I hope it will be successful.  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with communities and partners across the country such as the IFA and utility companies to target other crime trends.  These include metal theft and the theft of machinery from dwellings, farms and business premises.  In addition, there is long-standing support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the many community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes the Deputy outlined.  These groups are key partners in working with the Garda.  The very successful text alert scheme which the garda&iacute; operate involves more than 700 groups and 130,000 subscribers.  I know how effective those schemes are in my own county of Louth.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, does wish to underline her determination to continue to oppose criminals who violate people's homes and property.  She will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as we all will in this House, through both improved legislation and the allocation of increased resources which the Government is now providing to combat crime across the country.</p></speech>

Our starting point has to be that housing in Ireland has been in crisis for the best part of 15 years.  When the Government came to power it had an opportunity to begin to untangle some of that and deal with it but the opportunity was wasted.  It was the perfect time for ripping up things and starting again but we had the continued crisis in social housing, with a complete collapse in any development in that regard.  There was failure to seize on the idea of a well regulated rental sector and, I would say, minimal efforts to deal with the mortgage crisis.  We have a rush job on the eve of a general election.  There is talk about regulating rent but what we have before us is piecemeal.  It is a bit of a stunt and could, in some ways, make the situation worse.  It is a lost opportunity.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the Government has bent to the real estate investment trusts, REITs, and the big vulture funds that have come in and begun to dominate the rental market.  It has been exaggerated and aggravated by the role of NAMA in selling whole swathes of property below cost price to some of the serial renters who have operated as a cartel in this and other cities around the country in driving up rents.  The measures before us are insufficient for dealing with this crisis.</p><p>I will deal with my linked amendments as they appear and hope I am getting this set-up right because it is very confusing.  My first amendment relates to Seanad amendment No. 47 and deals with the definition of market rent.  I am seeking to insert a new provision that defines market rent as the average price per square metre of property with equivalent fittings and finish in the same municipal district or local electoral area, as applicable.  It provides that the average price per square metre shall be calculated using the data gathered and published in accordance with section 151(b)(c), as amended by section 37 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  The theory behind this is that section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act, the principal Act, sets out that in setting the rent for a property, a landlord cannot charge more than the market rent but this definition is very loosely defined.  It refers to dwellings being of a similar size, type and character to the dwelling and situated in a comparable area.<br/><br/>My problem is that size should be the dominant definer of what dictates a market rent.  If one looks at <i>daft.ie</i>or similar websites, one will not see the size in square feet or metres of any rental property advertised.  Nobody collects data on this in respect of the price of rental properties in Ireland.  Nobody is under any obligation to state the size of a property hef or she is letting out.  Instead, the number of bedrooms acts as a proxy for size.  However, in Ireland, a two-bedroom apartment can be anything from 40 to 100 sq. m.  A two-bedroom unit can be a one-bedroom unit with a plywood partition across the bedroom because there is no real regulation of this and no enforcement of standards.  One of the girls in my office came across an advertised two-bedroom property in the past few days in which the second bedroom was so small the chest of drawers was nailed to the wall above the single bed because there was nowhere else for it to go.  There has been no enforcement of standards in this regard, which is not good enough.  We are saying that this is market rent to which we are pegging prices but it is a charade and a nonsense.  The definition I am putting forward is far better in that regard because it would enable us to regulate renting in a serious way, set prices and gather the information in that regard.  In Germany landlords can charge 11% more if they add a certain amount of insulation to a building or add other benefits that improve the property.  Using the price per square metre for comparable properties, as has been put forward in the first amendment in this grouping, is the only fair way to come up with a figure for market rent and would assist us in collecting the data that are necessary in order to drive standards up.  <br/><br/>I also believe this approach would tighten things up.  What is a municipal district?  The Act refers to a comparable area.  What is that?  Is Sandymount comparable to Clontarf?  How do we know what we are talking about?  If the Minister of State is serious about regulation and if we are going to make it fairer, we need more data.  Amendment No. 2 to the Seanad amendment would do this in a far better way.  <br/><br/>Amendment No. 3-----</p></speech>

I tried to ask the Ceann Comhairle.  The way this is done is head-melting, but I think this is right.  Unfortunately, I have a large number of amendments and I am working my way through them in this section.  It is very difficult.  Amendment No. 3 to Seanad amendment No. 47 belongs to the Socialist Party, but it is linked with my amendment, amendment No. 5 to the same amendment, and amendment No. 4.  These three amendments to Seanad amendment No. 47 all try to get rid of the self-destruct clause the Government has placed in this legislation.  The clause says that the measure around rents can only be reviewed and increased every two years instead of every year and that it will cease to have effect in four years time.  This grouping of D&aacute;il amendments deals with that issue.</p>  <p>  I am aware that he other Deputies from the Socialist Party have taken a different interpretation of this, namely, to delete this section in its entirety.  I seek to do something that is slightly different.  I believe the idea of a self-destruct clause is ridiculous.  Why is it four years?  Why not three, two or one and a half years?  It does not make any sense.  While deleting subsection (5) is one way of dealing with it, what I am proposing instead is to put forward a review of these measures in four years time.  I would be happier if this review took place in a year's time, but if this amendment is passed, we will go with four instead of one.  </p>  <p>  The review proposed in the amendment creates the possibility that the next government will review these measures and possibly decide that they are not good enough and do not go far enough.  The amendment specifically provides for this as any review must be carried out with a view to the housing situation in the country at the time, the social good and the principle of housing as a human right - none of which seem to have been considered by the Seanad amendment.  While deleting the subsection entirely is one approach, I believe a review in the hope of enshrining the principle that the rental market and the housing market as a whole should be subjected to serious and regular oversight by the Oireachtas is not a bad thing.  It should be comprehensive and bound up with the social good, which is what my amendment seeks to do.  It is a bit rich that the Government inserts a self-destruct clause and comes up with a random four-year idea.  It is completely meaningless and insulting to the Oireachtas because it is an outgoing Government.  The next Administration will decide whether the legislation stays in place.  I hope the next Government will abolish it and start again from scratch, but there does not seem to be any sense in this.  </p>  <p>  Amendment No. 6 to Seanad amendment No. 47 would make it impossible to raise the rent during a tenancy above the rate of inflation or 5%, whichever is lower.  The figures used are based on the practice in Germany, which is widely seen as one of the most tenant favourable countries in the world.  There are two types of rental contract in Germany - index rental contracts and stepped rental contracts.  Index rental contracts are linked to inflation while stepped rental contracts allow for a certain percentage increase each year up to a maximum of 20% over three years in some parts of Germany and 15% over three years in other parts where there might be more rental demand.  This amendment seeks to combine both approaches.  It would mean that rents could not increase above inflation and that if it ever came to pass that inflation sky-rocketed, rental increases would be controlled to below 5%.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has had inflation of negative value since 2014, but at the beginning of the last quarter, annual inflation in terms of rents stood at 9.3% nationally and was 15% in Dublin in mid-2014.  It is now 13.5% higher than a year ago.  It is 12.2% in Cork city, while it stands at over 11% and 9% in Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  Rent increases and increases in wages are wildly out of sync.  A couple earning &euro;42,000 per year who want to rent a three-bedroom house in Dublin will have to spend 47% of their after-tax income on rent at current prices.  The situation is completely unsustainable.  This is a couple on &euro;42,000 who are probably doing better than many others.  We need more than rent certainty; we need rents to be controlled.</p><p>We have all heard the stories of landlords upping the rent by phenomenal amounts, 20% and more, in a short space of time and saying to tenants that if they do not like it, they can move out.  This is obviously contributing to homelessness, causing huge social disconnection for families, with children having to move schools and so on.  In 2014 the report of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, on rent stability in the private rental sector stated rent controls would destroy supply, something which has been echoed by various Government spokespeople since.  There is, however, a very curious line in the report, explaining why, in its view, rent controls would do this.  It states the difference between the control price and the market price is essentially a subsidy for consumers and that, therefore, consumers demand more of the product than is necessary.  I have never heard anything like it for ludicrousness, that rent controls will lead to decreased supply because tenants will get greedy and start to want to rent more properties than they need.  That is obviously utterly ludicrous and completely against the notion of housing as a human right.  We know also that huge rent increases mid-tenancy have knock-on effects on the alleged market rate, that landlords can point to comparable properties nearby which command higher rents thanks to huge mid-tenancy increases and that they can start a new tenancy at an upper limit.  This will not do what it says on the tin and assist tenants in that regard. </p> <p> In this group of amendments we have not pushed for the type of rent controls that have been introduced in Berlin where at the commencement of tenancies rents cannot be set higher than 10% of the local area average, but that is the direction in which we need to go.  The amendment has been put forward as a modest gesture to which the Minister of State could not object.  I do not see any reason why he would.  </p> <p> Rent controls are ultimately the only way forward.  We need to take our complicated housing mess into account.  We have a variety of landlords operating in the State, from the big real estate investment trusts, REITs and the professional landlords to the hard-pressed person who has an apartment, cannot sell it, is in negative equity, got married and moved to another place and is letting the apartment just to pay the mortgage and is not even succeeding in doing that.  There are many buy-to-let properties in arrears, but the issue of the reluctant landlord needs to be addressed.  I appreciate that it is not possible to address one aspect only and that there is a bigger picture, but we need more than is being done and the amendments would seek to help to do so.  </p> <p> The last group of my amendments to Seanad amendment No. 47, amendments Nos. 8 to 11, try to achieve the same thing.  They seek to insert a retrospective clause into the rent certainty measures being discussed.  Rents rose at the fastest rate since the boom in the months before the Government&rsquo;s introduction of this measure.  Due to the dithering and the public row in the media the Government has succeeded in making things worse for tenants with this legislation.  This group of amendments seeks to fix this a little bit and make it such that increases that take place 60 days or less before the legislation comes into effect would be null and void.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy and the way it handled this issue were so bad that it could not be that incompetent and divided.  It is hard to draw any conclusion other than that the dilly-dallying was deliberate to allow rogue landlords to drive up their prices and in a backdoor way to appease them.  Sadly, the hard-pressed tenants are the ones who will pay the price for this.  These are the most important of my amendments. </p> <p> I have also tabled amendments to Seanad amendment No. 48 which also, unfortunately for me, are included in this group.  They are generally of a more technical nature.  The first seeks to inserts a provision that a landlord must make a statement to the effect that any rent increase mandated after a rent review is not more than the rate of inflation or 5%, whichever is lower.

The first is to section 18(1), to delete &ldquo;, for the duration of the relevant period,&rdquo;.  We are proposing the amendment because we do not believe it should end in four years.  There should not be a guillotine.</p><p>Amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 47 seeks to delete subsection 3 of section 18.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, promised that there would be no rush by landlords to increase rents in the last few weeks before they knew the Bill was being brought forward and that, therefore, the Government would make this provision retroactive to prevent that from happening.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in an interview in <i>Breaking News</i>: &ldquo;Alan Kelly will be able to do these things under law [to stop this happening, but the alert was given weeks back that rents were to be increased in the run-up to the Bill] ... He will be able to make legal arrangements to prevent (that practice from) happening.&quot;  Now we have to insert amendments to get the Government to do what it stated it would do.</p><p>The rent increases forced on tenants in recent weeks have been well publicised by several high profile journalists.  I met two women in an apartment block whose landlord had sent a letter to the 15 apartments in the block stating rents would be increased by 20%.  This letter was dropped in last week and was obviously to bypass this law.  The way to take that load and burden off people is to make the Bill retrospective.  Homelessness charities and others stated landlords could increase rents immediately.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, told Galway Bay FM that that would not be a problem, that people had rent reviews on a certain date and that landlords could not choose to gazump them.  He talked about people going to the PRTB.</p><p>However, this has happened and through this amendment, Deputies Paul Murphy, Higgins and I are asking the Minister of State to deal with it by not having the law come into effect the day after but to backdate it.<br/><br/>As for the other amendments my colleagues and I tabled pertaining to Seanad amendment No. 48, it is explicitly stated that the provisions in Seanad amendment No. 48 will not be retrospective and that any increases or evictions already notified under the old rules will stand.  Consequently, in amendment No. 5 to Seanad amendment No. 48, it is proposed &quot;In section 19, to delete subsection (2)&quot;, that is, to delete the clause specifying that rent increases notified before the Act comes into force are valid under the old notice period.  The Minister of State could do this to prevent the kind of gazumping that has happened in respect of people's rents recently.<br/><br/>Another amendment my colleagues and I have tabled in respect of Seanad amendment No. 48 is to extend the notice period from 90 days, which is not much time for people to find alternative accommodation, to a period of 180 days.  This is to allow people to remain in the home and find alternative accommodation.  All Members are aware of families that have been economically evicted and a key deficit in this Bill is that although it is for this reason that most people now are becoming homeless, the Government is not really dealing with it because obviously it must be bowing the knee to the landlords in this regard.<br/><br/>The other amendment my colleagues and I have tabled to Seanad amendment No. 48 proposes that rent increases would be allowed only if the resulting rent would not be greater than the rent charged on the dwelling whenever rents were lowest since the onset of the recession.  The reason for this provision is that even if rent certainty, as the Minister of State calls it, is introduced, it will not bring down rents and they must be brought down now.  Real rent controls must be introduced that allow people to live a decent life.  Rents of &euro;1,400 and &euro;1,500 are being demanded in many housing estates in my constituency.  The Government suggests people in such circumstances can save, for example, for a deposit for a house but it is impossible to so do when one is paying such massive rents.  Consequently, in amendment No. 3 to Seanad amendment No. 48, my colleagues and I have proposed, in section 19(1)(b), the deletion of paragraph (c) and its substitution with the following:</p><blockquote>[to]include a statement by the landlord that in his or her opinion the new rent is not greater than for a dwelling in the Dublin area (as defined by the Private Residential Tenancies Board Rent Index) the rent charged on the dwelling in Quarter 1 2011 [the reason for this is that is when rents became somewhat realistic after the crash], or for a dwelling outside the Dublin area (as defined by the [PRTB]) the rent charged on the dwelling in Quarter 2 2013, with the addition in either case of allowance for the general rate of inflation according to the Consumer Price Index</blockquote><p>and it goes on.  The point is these are not really the most comprehensive of amendments because Members have been forced to amend whatever came from the Seanad rather than providing for comprehensive rent controls in the manner they would wish.<br/><br/>The other amendment I will mention is brief - I believe it is amendment No. 2 and think it also is listed in this group at the outset.  It is just a question and perhaps the Minister of State might clarify.  I will explain the reason my colleagues and I tabled this simple amendment which is to delete &quot;being&quot; qualified for social housing support and instead to insert &quot;having&quot; qualified for social housing support.  The query in this regard is that voluntary housing tenants are now to be put under the protection of the private rented sector.  In some cases, I believe this will give them greater protection, but my colleagues and I were afraid this clause would be used to make people in the voluntary housing sector not qualify for social housing if their income, for example, rose above a certain level.  Consequently, the purpose of this amendment is to give people greater protection.  For example, if a council tenant's income rises, he or she still is considered eligible to remain in his or her home.  The danger of the wording, &quot;being&quot;, is that people would no longer be considered eligible to be in voluntary co-operative housing tenancies, assisted housing bodies etc.  It was more to clarify this point, as we consider this wording to be better and would give people more support.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Members are being obliged to rush through many items here and to deal with them in one go.  As stated, it is somewhat unfortunate the Government did not introduce many measures, but Members will come to the issue of evictions in the debate on Seanad amendments Nos. 50 and 51.</p></speech>

In return, I will try to give a comprehensive reply to each of the Opposition amendments that are proposed to Seanad amendment No. 47.  The first element of amendment No. 1 to Seanad amendment No. 47, tabled by Deputy Dessie Ellis, proposes that a review of rent may not occur more frequently than once in each period of 24 months.  This already has been provided for in Seanad amendment No. 47.  The second element of the Deputy's amendment would remove the sunset clause provided for in Seanad amendment No. 47.  The sunset clause provides that the new provision will cease to have effect on the fourth anniversary of the introduction of this provision.  The removal of the sunset clause also is the subject of Opposition amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 11 to Seanad amendment No. 47.  Amendment No. 5, tabled by Deputy Clare Daly, provides for a review of the provision in four years time.  The inclusion of a sunset clause sends a clear signal that the 24-month review provision is a temporary measure that will expire in four years' time.  An amendment to remove this provision or to introduce the notion of a review in four years' time would send a negative signal to the market and would have an adverse impact on investment decisions by precipitating uncertainty for investors.  The effect of this would be to have a negative impact on supply, thereby further increasing rents and significantly diluting the effectiveness of this provision.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p>  <p>  Seanad amendment No. 47 provides that rent reviews commenced prior to enactment will not be affected by the new provisions.  In general, the intended effect of Opposition amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, to Seanad amendment No. 47, tabled by Deputy Clare Daly, and Opposition amendment No. 7 to Seanad amendment No. 47, tabled by Deputies Paul Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins, is to provide that the new provisions regarding a 24-month period between reviews will apply to rent reviews commenced prior to the enactment of the Bill.  A landlord who has legitimately commenced a review in accordance with the 2004 Act prior to the enactment of the Bill before the House is entitled to complete that statutory review process in accordance with the law as it currently stands.  The retrospective application of the new provisions to reviews that already have been commenced or completed would interfere in the substantive vested right of the landlord to continue the statutory process.  For this reason and on foot of legal advice to that effect, I cannot accept these amendments.</p>  <p>  I refer to the group of Opposition amendments to Seanad amendment No. 47 that seek to link rent increases to the consumer price index and rate of inflation.  Amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly and amendment No. 3 in the names of Deputies Paul Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins generally seek to link rent increases to the rate of inflation.  The proposals to introduce a limit or control on the amount of the review by reference to the annual rate of inflation would break the link with the fundamental mechanism for determining rent under the Act.  The Government decided on an approach that would bring stability and predictability for the tenant but without changing the fundamental mechanism for the setting and reviewing of rent as laid down in the 2004 Act.</p><p>The Government is mindful of the need not only to protect tenants from the circumstances that currently exist, but critically also not to deter investment in the rental market.  I believe Government amendment No. 47 achieves that balance.  The longer period of predictable rent means that tenants who have had a review in the past 12 months will now not face a review until 2017.  Based on average rents and the trends of increase, tenants will save between &euro;470 and &euro;1,400 in a full year depending on the location of the rented property.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.<br/><br/>Opposition amendment No. <i>2</i>to Government amendment No. 47 and Opposition amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, to Government amendment No. 48 propose providing new ways to define rent.  Under the current law, landlords may not charge more than the market rent for a dwelling under the Residential Tenancies Act and the Government amendments reinforce this provision by obliging landlords to present information that supports the proposed new rent.  These provisions, collectively, will help to stamp out instances of landlords taking advantage of tenants, who may not be fully aware of their rights under the Act, by attempting to increase rents by a multiple of the current market rate.  I do not propose to accept the deletion of subsection (2A), paragraphs (c) and (d).<br/><br/>As for the new definition of market rent, and the rent not being in breach of the proposed new subsection (7), I have outlined that the Government has decided not to alter the mechanism for the setting and reviewing of rent as laid down in the 2004 Act and has decided on an approach that balances the needs of tenants, and landlords and investors alike.  Therefore, I am not accepting these amendments.<br/><br/>The Opposition has proposed an amendment to provide that notice of new rent will be 180 days.  Government amendment No. 48 provides that tenants will now be given 90 days notice of a new rent rather than 28 days.  As I mentioned, this amendment is being introduced on foot of a recommendation in the DKM report entitled, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector.  The proposed Opposition amendment No. 1 seeks to compel a landlord to give six months notice of a new rent.  I believe a 90-day notice period is a balanced and proportionate measure and as such I do not accept this amendment.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 5 to Government amendment No. 48 seeks to apply the new 90-day notice period to notices of new rent that have been already served on tenants by landlords.  A landlord, who has legitimately issued a notice of new rent in accordance with the 2004 Act prior to the enactment of the Bill before the House, is fully in compliance with the law as it currently stands.  The application of this legislation to that process would retrospectively affect the legal actions of an individual under the law as it currently stands.  For that reason and on foot of legal advice, I cannot accept the amendment seeking to provide that notices of new rent issued in accordance with the law before the enactment of the Bill would be rendered null and void.</p></speech>

However, I am sure the Minister of State is aware that many staff have been taken from the PRTB in the past 18 months - I believe it has halved in recent years.  I would be concerned that it does not have adequate funding or personnel to deal appropriately with the increased requests that may emanate from this legislation.  What provisions, if any, have been made to deal with any such additional requests by the general public especially by tenants?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State confirm that the staff has been reduced by up to 50% since the Government came into office?  Will he confirm that the funding and resources available to it has been reduced greatly?  Will he confirm that there is a waiting list for its services?  If so, how long is it?  By association, how long are people waiting for adjudication on existing disagreements on leases between landlords and tenants?  Will this new legislation impose a further workload?  If there is to be a further workload, how does the Minister of State envisage the PRTB being able to deal with it?  If he cannot clarify that this evening, it renders meaningless many of the mechanisms between landlords and tenants to agree increases where agreement does not take place because there is no way there can be adequate recourse to fair and independent assessment of them.</p></speech>

I do not believe amendment No. 47 is adequate in just extending the contracts to two years.  Unless that is tied to the CPI, it is not worth the paper it is written on because there has to be some control.  Unfortunately as new people come in, they will be charged differently from the people who are supposedly being protected.  It lacks bite and will not work, as the Minister of State will see very shortly.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 48 increases the time period for notification for new rent to 90 days.  Many people have an awful job trying to get themselves sorted out when they receive notification.  I think it is a sensible move to increase it and give a reasonable amount of time.

That is the only possible explanation for what he has said.  He said the idea of deleting or, in the case of my amendment, reviewing the four-year clause would bring uncertainty for investors.  I do not accept that is the case.  If it does, so be it because security of tenure is more important in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State also said the amendments seeking rent increases to be curtailed to either the rate of inflation or 5% would again be a problem, not for the tenant but for the investor and that the existing mechanism is generally better.  The reason the Government is rushing through this legislation is that the existing mechanism is not better and is substantially flawed.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not deal with the points I made about getting to grips with a different approach to housing in the State.  We should look at the price per square metre of every registered rental property and so on rather than bedroom size and we should accumulate data on the quality of units.  To move forward and come up with the best ideas we have to get a full picture of where we stand now.</p>  <p>  I accept there is more than one type of landlord in the State.  I know that many people have been left as reluctant landlords simply because they have been left with a property in negative equity that they cannot sell.  We know people who may have bought a property to rent it as their pension, for example.  They are subbing the rent payment every time.</p>  <p>  In the main, landlords are good, but there are some absolutely ruthless landlords who have exploited the current situation to fleece people who, in some instances, have been loyal tenants of theirs for up to a decade.  They might have purchased the house years ago and do not need that increase.  They are only doing so to profit.  The only logic one can draw from this is that those who are calling the shots are the REITs and the big investment trust funds which now form a cartel in this city and country.</p><p>The reason the Minister is afraid to introduce anything more clear is not the ordinary Irish landlord who had a property or two and was pottering around during the years but the big boys who are coming in from abroad and dominating the market.  I am sorry, but the interests of Irish tenants and decent Irish landlords are more important than that.  A fixed price is not going to damage any decent landlord.  </p> <p> As I can speak again to the amendments, I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

The private rented sector has grown massively under the Government's watch, mainly because people cannot get mortgages and have been forced more and more into the private rented sector.

They are the people about whom I am more concerned than landlords, developers and others who became involved in speculation.  There is considerable fear.  I received many queries from people in the past two weeks about when the Bill would come into force and what would happen.  We have had situations where landlords effectively doubled their increases, knowing that they would not be able to increase rents for two years.  That is effectively what has happened and the Minister of State has not mentioned it at all, yet two Ministers promised that that would not happen.  The Minister of State should accept the amendment.  The legislation should be backdated to when the announcement was made three weeks ago, when the Government set landlords off on a course of panic and rack-renting because that is effectively what has happened.</p>  <p>  In terms of what the Bill does not contain, the way the Minister of State has proceeded has left most of us in total and utter confusion in trying to understand what is before us.</p></speech>

It is most disappointing, as people had hoped the Minister of State would take some action.  I appreciate that there are landlords who are in over their heads, as many people became landlords from 2006 onwards when they were encouraged to do so by the previous regime and the Government.  However, there is also a considerable number of landlords who own multiple properties.  That was revealed in the context of the property tax payments, that people had massive and multiple properties in this country.  It is somewhat unfortunate that the Government seems to have catered more for their needs rather than those of people who are facing economic eviction and rent increases.</p></speech>

I also wish to correct what Deputy Ruth Coppinger said.  I did mention tenants as a very important element of the legislation.  The reason the Government has introduced the Bill is to provide for a balanced approach and an integrated and appropriate set of changes to the sector designed to give rent certainty to the tenants referred to by the Deputy, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity for both tenants and landlords, whom the Deputy also mentioned, in terms of their rights and obligations.  What is required is a balanced approach that does not negatively impact on the supply side because, as we all know, increasing supply is vitally important to meet existing demand.</p>  <p>  Based on current average rents and the average annual rate of increase, extending the period of review to 24 months, as we are doing, will save the average tenant &euro;750 in 2016.  For a renter in Dublin, the savings will amount to &euro;1,400 over the course of next year.  It is not correct to say the provisions will not have a positive impact on tenants because they will.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly inquired about the accumulation of data on housing needs, demographics and the type of accommodation that will be required.  I agree with her.  That is why the Housing Agency will be engaged in carrying out a deep housing needs assessment early in 2016 and every year thereafter in order that we can match supply and demand and inform policy properly.  It is important that we do this, but until supply increases, we will not be able to meet the need in the way we want.  That is the reason the Government has launched the &euro;3.8 billion social housing strategy that we have debated in the House and which we will continue to debate.  It is important that we do so.</p>  <p>  On rents increasing in advance of the legislation, I wish to make it clear that a landlord can only review the rent payable once every 12 months.  Therefore, any landlord who has reviewed the rent on a property in the past 12 months cannot review it again now.  That is simply not possible under the current legislation.  Following the enactment of these new legislative provisions, landlords will be precluded from reviewing the rent again until 24 months have passed since the previous review.  Any landlord who has not increased the rent payable in the past 12 months is still precluded from increasing the rate to more than the market rate.  As such, landlords cannot seek to negate these measures by pricing in or doubling up, as Deputies have suggested, a rent increase to a level above the current market rate.  If they do and Deputies are aware of it, the Government encourage tenants to bring their disputed cases to the PRTB for attention.  The rent will remain at the current level until the PRTB adjudicates on the matter.  It is important that the House note this because there are protections under the current law in that regard.</p>  <p>  That leads me to Deputy Barry Cowen&rsquo;s question about cases that might be referred to the PRTB.  I consider this to be a fair question.  The reduction in staffing in recent years, as the Deputy outlined, was not in the context of cuts but due to a new online tenancy registration system and dispute application services and the outsourcing of certain activities.  In 2012 the PRTB awarded a contract outsourcing its call centre activities and the processing of hard copy paper registrations which allowed the board to focus on its core activity, namely, its dispute resolution function.  For the information of the Deputy, currently, 30 people are employed on the PRTB account by the outsourced service provider.  Given the increase in demand for the PRTB&rsquo;s services which have been correctly outlined, approval was provided in 2014 for an additional nine permanent staff.  The board is in the process of recruitment to fill these posts which will bring the number of personnel up to 42.  Most recently and in the context of the Government&rsquo;s publication, Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply, sanction for a further five staff to establish the deposit protection scheme and three additional staff to administer the new rent stability arrangements was secured.  Additional resources are being provided for the PRTB.  That will bring the staff complement back up to 50 and ensure the board will be well resourced to perform its functions.  My Department will continue to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the board on this matter because it is a very important component of dispute resolution for both tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  Some Deputies raised the matter of delays in PRTB adjudication hearings.  In 2014 some 80% of cases were processed or closed within five to six months.  Only 7% of the most difficult cases took longer periods of up to nine months to process.  The PRTB continually reviews measures to further reduce processing times and in 2015 the position continued to improve, with half of all cases dealt with in two months or less and 83% completed in four months or less.  Only 2% of the most troublesome cases are taking in excess of six months to complete.  Substantial progress has been made in reducing the timescales for adjudication hearings, but the Government is committed to keeping in contact with the PRTB to ensure it has adequate resources to deal with the demand it faces.</p></speech>

It is precisely because the rental market has gone mad.  The price of even a modest dwelling in any town is beyond the limits of those who have what we call a decent job.  This legislation is supposed to be an effort to deal with that scenario, not to mind help those who are below the middle income category, for want of a better phrase, who are really struggling and cannot come up with the money to keep a roof over their heads.  The reason the issue is so critical is successive Governments over-relied on the private sector to deliver housing to put a roof over people's heads, a social need which should be treated as a right.</p>  <p>  We are supposed to be dealing with the issue of rent certainly in this legislation and the reason we supposedly cannot talk about rent controls is a previous Supreme Court ruling but that ruling was not about rent controls, it was really about rent freezes in a scenario where people would have security of tenure indefinitely.  Rent control or rent certainty is a different element.  What we should be trying to do in this legislation and what I am seeking to do in my group of amendments is to allow for increases but to stop a free for all.  Increases have to be gradual.  They have to be pegged to the rest of the indicators in the economy such as, for example, the rate of inflation.  I do not see what is unreasonable about this.  That must be the starting point.  This legislation is being dealt with against a backdrop where this has not been happening.  We have had a scenario, in some instances, where rents have risen by 50%.  We know that, on average, rents nationally have increased by 30% since 2011.  Rent control involves a tacit acceptance of a few factors, namely, that a house or one's home should not be seen as a commodity, rather it should be seen to fulfil a social need; that the rental market leaves renters in a vulnerable position and that there should be regulation in that regard; that an uncontrolled rental market is bad for landlords and tenants and that permitting massive rent hikes does not really suit anybody.  We are trying to acknowledge these factors in this group of amendments.</p>  <p>  There are two types of rent control - there are controls within a tenancy and controls on the commencement of a tenancy.  Let us take the example of Germany which is held up as the gold star model.  It provides for rent controls within tenancies for many years and they have worked quite well.  For example, much more stringent rent controls were brought in in Berlin this year to control rents at the beginning of a tenancy, precisely because a massive influx of foreign capital looking for a safe haven in the wake of the financial crash caused an imbalance in the rental market in the city.  That is precisely the situation with which we are dealing, whereby rents are being driven up beyond people's capacity to pay.  In Berlin landlords cannot now set the rent for a new tenancy at more than 10% of the prevailing local average, as contained in the rent mirror produced by the local authorities.  In Ireland we need both types of rent control, but in these amendments we are only providing for mid-tenancy controls.  We are being incredibly modest; we are not even dealing with the full picture.  The reason for this, which I understand and appreciate, is that the market here is a little more complicated because of the numbers of accidental or reluctant landlords or those who bought buy-to-let properties for pension purposes.  Some landlords are even renting elsewhere, which is ridiculous.  </p>  <p>  Controlling initial rents at a particular percentage above the prevailing local average is something we must aim to achieve, but that is not factored into the legislation.  We must have a comprehensive review of the market to ensure controls would be balanced and would not have unintended consequences in the economy, but we need to engage in that research.  That is why a review provision that I put forward for consideration in the amendments is necessary.  We need to take account of the need for control of initial rents also, which is not provided for in the legislation.  My amendments are relatively modest in their objective.  They seek to ensure people would be a little more secure in their homes and also to put a break on the most unscrupulous of landlords, but we should be conducting much more detailed research into how we can ensure the situation would be far better across the board.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referenced a few times that the biggest problem was supply, but I cannot take this seriously from the Government when I note what it has allowed NAMA to do.  In the past month it has allowed the Project Arrow portfolio to be sold to Cerberus for less than &euro;1 billion - &euro;800 million - when it knows that 50% of that portfolio comprises residential units.  On the other hand, it is telling NAMA to use money to build 20,000 units over five years in the private market.  Again, there will only be a 10% social housing component, which is utterly ludicrous.  What is needed is not an increased supply but more certainty and an increased supply of social housing.  The private sector cannot deliver and meet people's housing needs, which is why, even under the capitalism system, in the rest of Europe the situation can be regulated and managed.  Surely to God we could do the same.</p>  <p>  I refer to the Minister of State's comments about the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which is the biggest joke in this society.  It is a disgrace, whether by design or ineptitude I do not know, but it has been toothless in defending tenants and decent landlords because of the way in which it has been set up.  Possibly it is as a result of the fact that it has been set up without enough teeth to compel people to come around the table to enforce judgments being made, not only in respect of tenants.  Tenants are, in many instances, hard done by, but a large portion of small landlords are incredibly hard done by also.  There are instances where people who receive rent supplement payments from the State fail to give them to landlords or where people who trash a dwelling are then left in it for months at a time and do not attend PRTB hearings and so on.  That is not good enough.  We need to tighten up on the security element and foster decent relationships between landlords and tenants.  Unfortunately, the legislation in this area favours unscrupulous landlords and tenants, but the bulk of people are not in that category.  Most tenants are decent and just want to have a roof over their heads.  Many landlords are okay also; they just want to have their investment protected and receive a certain return on it.  </p>  <p>  The moral of the story is that we want to meet people's housing needs, we cannot rely on the market.  Sadly, these measures will not give them the certainty that they need and deserve.</p></speech>

That level of rent is not sustainable and is way above what it should be.  We see this across the board.  We can talk about keeping people in their homes and increasing rent supplement, but the reality is that the rental market needs to handled in the proper way because it is has gone out of control.  These rents are out of reach of the vast majority.</p>  <p>  We need a root and branch review of the rental system.  That is part of what we have proposed in some of the amendments.  The German or Berlin model under which the rent charged by landlords is based on the size of a property - they charge per square meter - is the one to which we should be looking.  There are 27 sq. m units in the inner city which could be called dog boxes for which the rent payable is &euro;800 and &euro;900.  What is the justification for this?  It is ridiculous.  The average rent in my area of Finglas and Ballymum is &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300.  </p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State that supply is a big issue, but there is a supply of properties available.  I will give him an example.  A total of 22 modular units are being built in Ballymun at a cost of &euro;191,000 each, but it is possible to buy properties in the area for less than &euro;120,000 and there are units for sale.  We are missing opportunities.  Nearby in Hampton Wood the owners have 30 units for sale which are cheaper than the cost of building modular housing and they have not been approached properly.  It does not make sense.</p>  <p>  There are options.  The Minister of State and his party, in general, are opposed to rent controls or "rent certainty", as they like to call it.  They believe in the private sector setting the rate.  That is not working and people are paying through the nose to rent accommodation.  We will have to examine this issue in the future because the Minister of State's method, whereby contracts will be increased over a two-year period while maintaining a certain rent level, will not work.</p></speech>

That is readily evident, and pressure on rent will continue until housing supply is increased.  That includes the supply of both social and private housing.  A substantial increase in supply and investment is needed, with the Housing Agency identifying the need for at least 21,000 units per annum.  That is why this package of measures was introduced by the Government on top of the commitments made in the social housing and Construction 2020 strategies, which will take time to deliver the construction projects that are badly needed.  However, in the meantime, these measures will bring certainty and enhance the rights of tenants and the notice periods that are required for tenants.  The package also ensures that the PRTB is best placed to resolve disputes and manage the much sought-after deposit protection scheme, which no Deputy has welcomed yet.  This has been welcomed by Threshold and other agencies and they have acknowledged that the scheme will help alleviate the pressure on people to find homes when they move.  The scheme will introduce protections for tenants, who will have access to their deposits in order that they can rent again.  That measure alone will improve matters, but I did not hear Deputies welcoming it.   I thought I would because they called for it.</p></speech>

The figures speak for themselves and I have read them into the record.  The board's adjudication times have improved in dispute resolution.  The PRTB is an important agency in ensuring a fair and balanced dispute resolution process is in place.</p>  <p>  Another provision in the legislation permits the referral of disputes under the board's remit to the District Court instead of the Circuit Court.  That will improve the time it takes the courts system to deal with disputes, and quicker decisions will be arrived at.</p>  <p>  The legislation also introduces and strengthens provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.  Deputy Daly mentioned the issue of people trashing houses.  There will be stronger provisions in this legislation, once enacted, to deal with anti-social behaviour in a fair way and in a way that ensures people take responsibility and are accountable for their actions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised queries about NAMA and its contribution.  The agency has delivered 1,600 houses and apartments to local authorities and AHBs for social housing use and it has invested more than &euro;40 million in making those properties ready for purpose.  NAMA is committed, and is firmly on track, to delivering 4,500 new residential units in the greater Dublin area by the end of 2016, and in 2014 the agency funded more than 40% of the total new housing output across the four Dublin local authorities.  However, NAMA alone cannot meet the lack of housing supply.  It is important that the property sector returns to normal and functions properly.</p>  <p>  I have outlined the reasons we cannot accept the amendments.  We need a balanced approach until supply improves.  We believe this legislation is fair and it ensures added protections for tenants and certainty until the property and rental markets normalise.

These provisions were included in the published Bill, but amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, redraft those provisions to make it clear that for the purpose of the application of the Residential Tenancies Act to dwellings let by AHBs, the Act does not apply to the tenancy between the local authority and the AHB but does apply to the tenancy between the AHB and the social housing tenant.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 4 clarifies that the relationship between the AHB and its tenant is that of landlord and tenant and is not a sub-tenancy.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the application of the Act to AHB tenancies.  Amendment No. 18 is a technical amendment to the definition of "approved housing body" to provide for this relationship, and amendment No. 100 is a consequential amendment to section 65 of the published Bill.  Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 15 and 16 are drafting amendments to correct errors in the published Bill, while amendment No. 19 is a consequential amendment.</p></speech>

With regard to the Opposition amendments to amendments Nos. 4 and 5, the purpose of amendment No. 4 is to provide for the tenancy relationship between an AHB and a tenant who qualifies for social housing support where the dwelling let by the AHB to the tenant is owned by a local authority.  Amendment No. 4 provides that, in those circumstances, the relationship between the local authority and the AHB is not governed by the Residential Tenancies Act but the relationship between the AHB and the tenant is, which is important.</p></speech>

There have been lots of references in Government documents to the fact that people should not be long-standing or permanent social housing tenants and that the Government would like to move to a situation in which somebody might be a social housing tenant for a short period when their income is extremely low but that if their circumstances improve they could be moved to the private sector.  The purpose of this amendment is to guarantee security of tenancy for people in social housing.  It exists for council tenants because if one's income changes, one just pays a higher rent and a higher percentage of one's income.  I am wondering why there is a differentiation for people who are tenants of approved housing bodies.</p></speech>

When one applies it to local authority tenants in approved housing bodies, they have their own mechanisms under which rent may be increased, as Deputy Coppinger has said.  I hope and expect that there is no overlap or legal issue with this.  The Minister of State has said that the provisions within the Residential Tenancies Act will be applicable in the context of it being enforceable for tenants of approved housing bodies but there are means, methods and formulas by which rent is increased or decreased, whatever the case may be, in whatever circumstances, for which local authorities have the wherewithal within existing laws.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, having done away with the tenant purchase scheme in 2012 it was reinstated.  A new scheme has been put in place, which I welcomed at the committee meeting last week.  I further welcome the fact that the funds derived from each local authority can be reinvested by that same local authority.  Has the Minister of State consulted with housing agencies and associations on applying a similar scheme to those housing units?  Unfortunately, it is applicants to local authorities who are assigned these units and they do not have the same rights as local authority tenants will have when they are more than a year into a tenancy agreement.  That is something that I and others have been calling for over the last number of years.  I would have thought that at this stage there would have been ample time for the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State to engage with those authorities with a view to coming up with a scheme that offers those people the same opportunity as others to own their own home, take advantage of the scheme that is in place and the discounts that would be applicable, and also generate activity in local authorities for funds to be raised to be reinvested in housing.</p></speech>

When Government is drafting legislation, it takes advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the wording.  I recognise Deputy Coppinger's attempt is a genuine one to strengthen tenancy protection in terms of who is qualified for social housing support, which the Deputy's amendment phrases as &quot;having&quot; qualified for social housing support.  The amendments that Government drafted were drafted to ensure conformity with the wording of the Housing Acts in respect of qualification for social housing support.  I have been strongly advised that the current draft uses the correct wording and achieves the policy objectives.  I do not propose to accept the Opposition amendments for that reason.</p><p>In this legislation, the Government is not proposing anything that changes the local authority tenant relationship.  As the Deputy will know, the local authorities operate their own differential rent schemes.  There is no attempt to interfere or change that in any way.  We have ensured that the legislation makes clear, as I have already outlined, the tenancy landlord relationship between tenants and the approved housing bodies.</p><p>That leads to Deputy Cowen's next question which is an old chestnut.  Can a tenant purchase scheme similar to that being introduced for local authorities be introduced for approved housing bodies?  The information I have is that the approved housing bodies are organisations that are approved under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to provide social housing support in conjunction with local authorities.  Under the terms of the various capital funding schemes, approved housing bodies are the <i>de facto</i>owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  My Department cannot unilaterally make provision for their sale to tenants.  Any such decision would have to involve the AHBs by agreement and have regard to the mortgage on their property.  On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property.  That is an important point to note.  There are currently no proposals or plans for a tenant purchase scheme for the existing AHB housing schemes.</p></speech>

Do I understand from it that there has been no effort on the part of the Government or its representatives to engage with those housing associations with a view to devising such a scheme?  It would be of mutual benefit with regard to the mortgage they are expected to dispose of and would also create an opportunity for their tenants, who are not in a position to avail of the same opportunities as their counterparts who came off the same list but are renting from local authorities.  Is it an abdication of responsibility on the part of the Government not to pursue that?</p></speech>

Is he saying that if the approved voluntary housing groups were to see out the mortgage on the properties, they could then become available?  Is he saying that if the approved housing bodies see out the mortgage, they could sell them off as a result of that?</p></speech>

In quarter one of 2015, there were 20 local authority and 117 voluntary and co-operative houses built.  In quarter two, no local authority houses were built and 40 voluntary and co-operative houses were built.  My point is that more and more social housing now comes from these approved housing bodies.  I am becoming a little bit concerned, because of the wording of the Bill, that tenants of these housing bodies could find themselves told to vacate social housing as they are no longer considered, to use the words in the Bill, as "being qualified for social housing support".  Words are always very important.  The Minister of State may think there is no danger of that happening but it is the Government strategy - if one looks at HAPS or RAS, one is not necessarily a tenant forever; one is a tenant for a period of time.  When Deputy Alan Kelly spoke previously on housing, he talked about people who are quite poor and quite in need of social housing.  It is not like in the past when many of us lived in council housing and people had jobs and everyone worked.  We all know there has been a change.  I am concerned that if the Minister of State does not accept this amendment, people who are put into social houses of these voluntary housing associations could find themselves being asked to move on if they get a job which puts them in the position of no longer being qualified for housing support.  I ask the Minister of State to accept that amendment and give people security of tenure and tell us that will not happen.</p></speech>

Their core purpose is, essentially, the provision of social housing.  Any agreements entered into are written into their articles of association to ensure that this will remain their function, namely, to provide social housing.</p><p>Deputy Barry Cowen asked if the Government is not engaging with approved housing bodies.  Under the social housing strategy announced recently, the approved housing bodies will have an enhanced role in the provision of social housing.  We will see further involvement from them on many fronts.  The focus in tenant purchase schemes up to now has been with the local authorities.  It has generally been welcomed, although not by everyone, that the scheme has been opened to long-term local authority tenants, who have the means to purchase their homes, to have the opportunity to do so.</p><p>Deputy Dessie Ellis asked if the approved housing bodies can sell the houses at the end of the mortgage.  Technically, they can because they own the properties.  However, by their articles of association and their core <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, which is to provide social housing, they continue to rent them in conjunction with the local authorities, taking people off the housing list.</p><p>It is acknowledged there is a need for regulation in the approved housing bodies sector.  That is why the Government brought forward the housing (regulation of approved housing bodies) Bill in September which will provide for an independent statutory regulator to be established with an overall emphasis on improved governance and financial viability for the approved housing body sector.  The drafting of the Bill has just commenced and arrangements are being made for pre-legislative scrutiny of its proposals before the joint Oireachtas committee.  Deputies&rsquo; views on this will be welcome.</p><p>Essentially, approved housing bodies are independent and an important component in dealing with supply for housing demand.  They have the capacity to deliver housing off balance sheet.  Deputies opposite ask why the Government does not spend more resources on building houses.  While we are spending substantial Government funds on building housing, we have limits set by European regulations, meaning so much of it must be kept off balance sheet.  The approved housing bodies are an important component which can deliver substantial capacity in the supply of houses and apartments.  We are beginning to see these coming to fruition.</p></speech>

Naturally, the Government has conversed with the approved housing bodies on the formulation of the housing strategy announced last year and the role they will have in providing social housing.  However, did Minister of State discuss with them the possibility of the tenants of such houses having the option to purchase them in the future?  Will it always be the case that they will be leased units?</p>  <p>  Deputy Ruth Coppinger&rsquo;s point is well-founded.  Will the Minister of State explain if a tenant could be taken out of a unit if he or she goes above the income threshold under which he or she initially got the unit?</p></speech>

I am not in favour of selling social housing, particularly in the current economic climate when no social housing is being built.  That is not in the Bill but this wording is.  The Minister of State has not given any reassurance that it does not mean what I think it could mean.  Will the Minister of State confirm that people will have security of tenure in these approved housing agency homes?  Most people are being put into these types of housing, whether they want to be or not.  If they wanted a council house, they do not have a choice.  They are coming off the council list and going into the Respond Housing Association, the National Association of Building Co-operatives or whoever.  Could they find themselves being asked to vacate the property if their income or circumstances improve?</p></speech>

In fact, it strengthens the law for tenants in that if there are any disputes over, say, unpaid rent or whatever, that they have the access to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to deal with them.  Previously, that was not as clear and that is why these provisions have been introduced in this legislation.  It strengthens the rights of tenants, giving them the protection of the PRTB, in the same way as if they were the tenant of a private landlord.  They will have access and the right of referral of a dispute to the PRTB which is underlined in the legislation.  It is important as it brings clarity as I outlined earlier.</p>  <p>  The housing (regulation of approved housing bodies) Bill will deal with concerns around governance, financial viability and sustainability of approved housing bodies.  As I stated on several occasions already, their core function is to provide social housing.  It is written into their articles of association and agreements.  When they are allocating houses, they have to do so in compliance with the local housing authority, namely, the local authority.  That has been working well and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  This Bill strengthens tenants&rsquo; rights in legislation.  As regards Deputy Barry Cowen&rsquo;s queries about approved housing bodies, they are independent and own the properties.  Technically, they can sell those properties but their core function is to provide social housing.  What we hear from them regularly is that they want to retain those properties for the provision of social housing.</p></speech>

Approved housing bodies generally use a differential rent scheme as applied by local authorities to determine the rents of their dwellings.  Under this system the amount of rent to be paid by a tenant is based on the income of the household and the provisions in the 2004 Act, including section 19 which deals with market rent, conflict with the scheme.  As the differential rent scheme is more advantageous to approved housing body tenants than the provisions relating to rent in the 2004 Act, they are excluded from these sections.  Approved housing body rents for their social housing tenants are set when the approved housing body signs an agreement with the housing authority to house those tenants.  Those agreements are made under section 6 of the Housing Act of 1992.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 20 inserts a new section 19A into the principal Act to clarify that this is how approved housing body rents are to determined.  Amendment No. 21 inserts a new section 20A into the principal Act which provides that any review of rent is determined under this agreement and that where no review of rent is provided for in the agreement, that either party may request a review.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 12 are technical, drafting amendments while amendment No.11 is a consequential amendment to amendments Nos. 20 and 21.  Amendment No. 22 provides for the notification of new rent to approved housing body tenants, while amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are consequential.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100049#WW00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  Last week we had the anniversary of the tragic death of Jonathan Corrie.  Ever since his death, the homeless situation and the number of those sleeping rough have continued to spiral.  It is clear the Government's policies are not working and that it has failed to deliver.  Under current housing legislation, there is no definition of a person at risk of homelessness, which limits the introduction of preventative measures.  This means measures to address homelessness are focused exclusively on those who have already lost their homes.  This leads to a cycle of people coming in and out of homelessness without any effective measures to reduce overall numbers through preventative measures.</p>  <p>  Rents are not solely to blame, as they have been widely inflated by the shortage of social housing.  However, inflated rents are now the main cause of people losing their homes and becoming homeless.  The over-reliance on the private market to provide housing by the current and previous Governments has left poor and low income families vulnerable to the whim of the market, which has no care for their basic need for a home but cares only for profit.  Rents have soared in recent years, to a point where many tenants pay in excess of 50% of their income in rent and suffer the hardship this causes, while all the time fearing the next rent increase will be the one that sees them homeless.  Their desperation is only compounded by the absolute lack of options, as social housing is not being built and private developers show no interest in bringing any affordability to the market.</p>  <p>  We are faced with many facets of a serious housing and homelessness crisis, but it is clear that the Government is not doing enough and what it is doing is being done far too late.  The Government will attack this Bill, but the numbers make the reality clear for those who care to look at them.  We have 130,000 people on social housing waiting lists, some 40,000 more than when the Government took office.  We have nearly 100,000 people receiving some kind of rent support, amounting to approximately &euro;500 million in subsidised rents for landlords every year.  This is the same as was provided in 2011, but under a different name.</p>  <p>  We have fewer homes for rent than ever before and higher rents than ever.  Some 17,000 homeowners face eviction.  Buy to let mortgage holders are in crisis, with tenants also facing losing their homes.  The banks are riding rough shod over mortgage holders and any tenants they may have.  We have at least 5,000 homeless people and over 100 people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin each night.  All this time, the Government is building fewer homes than for decades.  Rent supplement has been cut twice and the Government has reduced Part V responsibilities for developers.</p><p>This needs a comprehensive response and a major package of investment and regulation by the Government.  All we have been offered is window dressing, spin and more spin.</p> <p> Whatever the solution is, it has not been proposed by the Government.  That is why we have brought this Bill before the House tonight, not as the one true solution but as a moderate, simple and positive measure which improves on what the Government has accepted is needed.  If Government Deputies are serious about preventing homelessness and providing certainty for renters, they will support this Bill.  If they do not, then it will be clear that they are talking out of both sides of their mouths.</p> <p> As I have said, this Bill is no silver bullet that will solve all of the problems in the rental market.  It will not end homelessness in isolation or deliver housing where there is none.  It does not claim or set out to do those things, and neither I nor my party claim that it will.  It will, however, provide for preventative measures against homelessness and give certainty to tenants who have seen their rent go up repeatedly over the last five years.</p> <p> This is a proposal that has long been called for by groups such as Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Peter McVerry Trust and Threshold, among others, which are on the front line of homelessness and housing issues.  Although the Government might not accept those groups' expertise in this regard, it is all too ready to hand off responsibility for providing housing to such bodies, along with supports for those who are made homeless by Government policy.  Focus Ireland and Threshold are good enough to run the Department of Social Protection's schemes to help those on rent supplement who are unable to afford increases, but it seems they are not good enough to be listened to on how to resolve the wider issue of unaffordable rents.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, famously remarked on his irritation at their critique of his failures.</p> <p> This Bill should not be looked at in isolation but as a part of a wider strategy to deal with the housing crisis through intervention by the State in terms of both regulations and the provision of real social housing through local authorities.  Some Members of the Government will try to pretend that rents are no longer an issue due to the Minister's plans to delay rent reviews for an extra 12 months.  They will describe this as a rent freeze, but everyone else can see that it is simply kicking the can down the road.  It is welcome only in the sense that it provides the space for more comprehensive and effective policies to be implemented under a new Government.  Many tenants have already seen their rent increase considerably in recent months and weeks, as the foot-dragging of Fine Gael and the Labour Party allowed landlords to prepare for these new measures.</p></speech>

The Government's measures could easily have included a section to nullify rent reviews carried out within a few weeks or months of the enactment of the law.  Better still, they could have included rent controls and rent certainty and it could have happened months if not years ago.  Back then, there was not an election around the corner as there is now.</p><p>The Government's plan continues with the failed model of allowing increases within what it calls the market rate.  This has been heralded in the media as a new check on rent levels, but it is the same ill-defined model that existed before and does nothing to regulate increases when a rent review happens.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called for Government intervention in the private rental market to deal with unaffordable, spiralling rent rates.  We were told originally it was not a problem at all and now we are told the Government will solve it by doing the bare minimum and hoping someone will build a few thousand extra houses.  It certainly will not be this Government building them; it has only built a handful of houses this year and intends to build just 1,750 by the end of 2017.  It has built less in five years than in any single year preceding its tenure.</p><p>In government, Sinn F&eacute;in would have invested substantially in the construction, acquisition and refurbishment of social housing for the last five years, creating jobs, providing homes, generating rental revenue and making savings in rent supplement and emergency accommodation by doing so.  We would have introduced rent controls to limit the amount that can be charged per square metre based on local area rates and would have limited increases to the rate of inflation.  If this had been done, rents would be significantly lower right now and we would not need to spend &euro;70 million a year just to stand still on the homeless crisis.</p><p>The provisions of this Bill are the absolute minimum Sinn F&eacute;in would do in government and that is why we have put it to the House tonight.  We know that the Government is opposed to building social housing; it has shown this in the last five years of inaction and undermining of local authorities.  We know it is opposed to intervention in the private rental market because it has allowed rents to increase by at least 35% during its tenure, and up to now its only response was to cut rent supplement twice.  The Bill asks very little of the Government, though supporting it would be very positive.  It asks that the Minister recognise the need to properly support prevention measures for homelessness and support for those at risk of homelessness.</p><p>The amendments to sections 2 and 10 of the Housing Act 1988 were proposed by a coalition of housing and homelessness charities and advocacy groups, but this was ignored by the Government as homelessness spiralled out of control.  Now that we have 1,500 children in hotels and bed and breakfasts, will the Government see the merit of such provisions?  With 80 new families becoming homeless each month, can we ignore the need for preventative measures?</p><p>In the joint document Preventing Homelessness: the Need for Legislative Change, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and the Simon Community concluded that:</p><blockquote>Actions to prevent homelessness must be at the forefront of all homeless services.  Housing advice and advocacy have a critical role to play in minimising the need for, and the time spent in, emergency accommodation.  Tenancy support has an equally important role to play in assisting people in sustaining their existing accommodation, or retaining it where they have moved out of homelessness.  While the importance and cost effectiveness of these interventions is widely accepted [...], the current wording of Section 10 of the Housing Act limits the scope of such interventions, with the result that they are underdeveloped and piecemeal.</blockquote></speech>

I have changed the names of some of the individuals, obviously.  One of the problems with the housing and homelessness crisis is that so many people do not want their names mentioned or their faces put to these issues.  It is quite shocking that the responsible Minister is not in the Chamber to listen to this debate.  We do not have the Minister, Deputy Kelly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Given that they are the Ministers supposedly in control - which is very debatable - they should at least be here to hear the discussion.</p>  <p>  These are some of the cases I am dealing with in my own constituency at the moment.  Tom and his partner are both in their 20s.  She is 32 weeks pregnant.  They have a total income of &euro;200 a week.  They are each on a jobseeker's payment of &euro;100 and they pay &euro;25 each to the council to live in their parents' seriously overcrowded house.  They are trying to find a house but cannot.  They cannot save for a house or for the imminent arrival of their new baby.  Even with their income and rent supplement, every landlord in the county knows they simply do not have the money to rent any accommodation.</p>  <p>  Caitr&iacute;ona was transferred to Meath from another county by Women's Aid for her own safety.  She cannot go back to her county because she is danger.  The council will not accept her housing needs, so the refuge can no longer fund her place.  My office spent most of today ringing the Department and the council to see if we could get her some level of accommodation.  Today Caitr&iacute;ona is on the streets because there is no place for her at the moment.</p>  <p>  Sorcha is living in a bed and breakfast since May with her partner and young kids.  This is the second time she has been homeless in the last while.  Her older kids are staying with relations.  She has a young daughter who, at six years old, has changed school three times.  Because of that forced change, her parents see that she is now having major difficulties building friendships with the kids in her class, as she is unsure how long her new school is going to last.</p><p>The family is on the telephone all day but nobody is getting back to them.  </p> <p> Fionn and Sonia are 55 years of age.  They worked all their lives to make a living.  Sonia has just become sick and Fionn is now her carer.  Their home is being sold and they cannot find anywhere else to live.  While the family is suffering from sickness, they are showing people around the house from which they will be evicted very shortly.</p> <p> Eilis and Eoin have been waiting 12 years for a house.  They have been sleeping in a tent in the Ramparts in Navan, a walk the Minister of State will know because I have met him there previously.  That is not a safe place for anybody after dark.  They have been in bed and breakfast accommodation and other accommodation that was just not safe.</p> <p> This is another issue.  Councils rely on accommodation for people who are homeless that is in poor condition.  Councils feel they have no choice but to use it because if they take this poor-quality accommodation out of circulation, as should be the case in normal circumstances, there will be no place for these individuals to go.  I know of another individual in his 60s named Se&aacute;n who is very ill.  He has multiple tumours and limited mobility and has been put into bed and breakfast accommodation.  He has now been told to move to the homeless hostel in Drogheda.  Noeleen is expected to live in her ex-partner's parents' house.  She feels really unwelcome in that house but she has nowhere else to bring her children.  She cannot get another house because she is deemed to be accommodated at the moment.  Rita has seven children who are living in three different houses because she cannot find a single house for them.  She is travelling the country bringing them to school and picking them up.</p> <p> This is the hidden homelessness that exists in counties around the greater Dublin area.  There are dozens of families who are simply trying to find a place to live.  One in six mortgages in Meath is in distress, which is a major cause of homelessness.  A total of 4,500 people are on the waiting list in Meath while 700 people presented as homeless in the county last year.  There is no homeless shelter for men in the county at the moment while women must go to the refuge.  This puts pressure on the refuge because it has less space for its intended use.  Rents in Meath have increased by 13% to 14% under this Government.  According to EUROSTAT, Meath is one of the places where rent is highest as a proportion of income.</p> <p> What have the Labour Party and Fine Gael done to try to fix this in our county?  With 4,500 people on the housing waiting list, their objective is to have 133 new properties in circulation in the county by 2017 through acquisitions and building.  That is an abysmal effort compared with the size of the crisis in Meath.  On 2 September, I, along with a number of Deputies, met in the county council office to discuss the humanitarian crisis in County Meath, although the Labour Party Deputy did not make it.  I put forward a motion that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government meet the elected representatives in Meath to discuss the homelessness and housing crisis.  Ninety days later, the Minister's response to the elected representatives in Meath has been zero.  Not only has he not been here, he will not sit in a room with the elected representatives in Meath to discuss the housing crisis.  That is not a snub to me.  What the Minister thinks of or says or does not say to me is neither here nor there.  It is a snub to the thousands of people we represent in County Meath and a direct snub to people on the margins of existence with regard to housing and homelessness in my county.  That the Minister has not even rung to say he will meet us on a particular date shows a phenomenal level of arrogance.  I appeal to the Minister of State, who is in an adjoining constituency that shares some services with Meath, to talk to the Minister and to ask him to discuss these issues the people of Meath.  It is very important that the Government focuses on housing and homelessness in Meath and throughout the country.  I appeal to it to put the proper investment into it.</p></speech>

I can sympathise with the feeling of one's child being at risk.  Many mothers and fathers in this State are experiencing this to a grave extent.  They worry where they can scrape the few extra cent from every month to pay their rent and keep a roof over the heads of their children to provide them with a sense of security and safety.  We must take a step back, look around and realise the exact nature of the situations people find themselves in.  In my county of Cork, rents have increased by 13.5% in just over one year.  The average rent is now &euro;950.  These ever-increasing rents put people to the pin of their collars.  The research shows that the failure to address the reality has led to ever-increasing numbers of families presenting as homeless.  In June of this year, the number of families who were homeless was 531.  That is double the figures for the same month last year.  The stories in the papers and on television and that are heard anecdotally are all too common.  The shock of hearing of these tragic stories has been replaced with a sense of disdain and disenfranchisement.  I am afraid it has become just another election issue in the eyes of some rather than the crisis it is.</p><blockquote>Six years of recession has seen the income of many families fall sharply due to job losses, pay cuts and/or reduced working hours.  The cost of living has shot up and there are more additional taxes to pay such as property tax, USC and pending water charges.  Thousands more families are struggling on very low incomes or social welfare and many are falling into serious housing difficulties as rents continue to rise.  Some families are becoming homeless as Rent Supplement payments fail to cover the rent.  They fall into arrears and end up losing their home. </blockquote><p>These are not my words.  I am quoting directly from Focus Ireland.  As a result, these rent increases, which in some cases are astronomical, put children at a higher risk of homelessness.  The implications of this can, unfortunately, be viewed throughout the country.  There is no doubt in anyone's mind that this can be detrimental to any child's development.  Due to the sporadic and disorganised nature of the way these families are being placed in temporary accommodation, children suffer severely.  Developmental restrictions are put in place in respect of the accessibility of schools, a space at home which is conducive to learning and doing school work and what must be a highly strung atmosphere among family members in such small and confined places.  Considering the ever-increasing numbers of families presenting to homeless services and that the time families are spending in homeless services is increasing, it is rational to say that the current structures are failing these people.</p><p>We are crying out for a different tack that focuses more on a preventative strategy rather than a knee-jerk reaction, as was done through the introduction of expanding the time span between rent reviews which does nothing in respect of striving towards affordability but rather prolongs inevitable and extortionate increases.  A report, entitled Family Experiences of Pathways into Homelessness: The Families' Perspective, by Dr. Kathy Walsh and Brian Harvey was launched in September by the Housing Agency.  The researchers concluded that, &quot;a striking feature of this research was the families we consulted had a sense of powerlessness when dealing with private landlords&quot;.  The researchers said that, &quot;any argument with the landlord about their 'rights' was perceived to put that prospective reference immediately at risk&quot;.  These are only two quotes from what appears to be a particularly damning report.</p><p>We also must highlight the issue of child protection and how 1,500 children in this country are potentially subjected to danger as a result of the lack of regulations.  It puts these children in potentially harmful positions.  This Bill calls for a more preventative approach to stem the flow of people presenting to homeless services and to give those at risk a sense of financial and social security.  We must protect our most vulnerable to the best of our ability and I sincerely hope for cross-party support in this regard.</p></speech>

I am asking the Government to support this Bill because the people who are homeless in this State need it.  The human suffering caused by high levels of rent and the current shortage of social housing is too much for people to bear and is too serious a matter to play politics with.  The crisis is out of control.</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, who is responsible for homelessness promised 1,000 social housing units this time last year when Jonathan Corrie's body was found outside this building.  He delivered 20 in the first six months of this year.  In Tralee, there are 1,500 people waiting for one and two bedroom houses or flats.  There are more waiting for three and four bedroom houses in the town of Tralee.  More than 5,000 people are on the waiting list in the county.  Every one of these people is being disadvantaged by being homeless.  Children who are homeless will suffer the consequences for years, in their schooling, social skills and their lack of familiarity with normal family life in a normal family home.  The solution to this crisis is to build houses.  It is not complicated.  It is very simple.</p> <p> More than 130,000 people are in need of housing in this State.  That is a little less than the entire number now housed by local authorities.  That figure represents families, couples, single people and children who are all in need of secure, adequate and affordable homes.  The Taoiseach likes to shout about the &euro;2 billion being invested in housing but he does not mention how the first &euro;1.2 billion of that sum does not go to build houses, the proper and simple solution.  It has been allocated to coax landlords into providing housing.  It is earmarked for rent allowance, rental accommodation schemes and housing assistance programmes because the Government does not want to build social housing.  It would prefer to subsidise landlords and allow its precious market rule over all even if that means people living in overpriced, badly constructed, damp, cramped, under-managed housing units or couch surfing with family and friends.</p> <p> Real people are suffering from these policies.  I know of one case in my constituency, a mother who lost her husband and one of her children tragically a few years ago.  She lives in family accommodation with her four children, one being treated for cancer in Dublin.  There are six children and two adults in that two and a half bedroom house.  One child is prone to contagion from other illnesses as a result of the treatment for cancer.  Nothing has been done despite the best efforts of Kerry County Council.  Nothing has been made available to this woman or her children.  It is an absolute disgrace.  Some years ago I visited the homeless section of Kerry County Council maybe 18 months after it had been set up.  It had separate offices.  I was the first and the only elected representative from this House to visit it.  It does tremendous work despite all the obstacles put in its way.  Some months ago, during the festival of Kerry, there was an unprecedented number of people homeless in Tralee and surrounding areas.  Kerry County Council told me it was getting no support or help from the Department.  That is an indictment not just of the Department but of this Government because it has failed miserably to look after the people most in need. </p></speech>

There has been much talk of the human stories and of a crisis.  We all know it is an emergency but is it really a crisis?  It is not a crisis if it is a policy.  That is the problem: refusing to invest in social housing has been a policy of this Government.  This was planned for.  Refusing to think beyond the next budget is the Government&rsquo;s policy.</p>  <p>  I have recently quizzed various Ministers about how their Departments have responded to the housing crisis.  The figures are shocking.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, know this well because they have reigned over failure after failure in respect of one failed scheme after another to help the struggling homeowner who is facing eviction and homelessness.  We all know the results, unfortunately, as has been outlined by my colleagues.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Party's then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and under the present Minister, Deputy Kelly, a State-wide mortgage to rent scheme was launched to give struggling home owners a chance to move from mortgage to renting while staying put in their family homes.  The State banks were to be forced to make this work and councils were to be given a fund to help them participate.  We were told the mortgage to rent scheme was one of the main planks of the plan to take us out of the mortgage crisis.  The Labour Party told us 3,500 families would benefit.</p>  <p>  What happened under Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and the present Minister, Deputy Kelly?  More than three years have passed and only 246 families have been able to avail of this scheme.  Only three homes in the whole of Donegal have been helped by this scheme in three and a half years.  Not a single successful conclusion under the scheme has taken place in Galway, Longford, Monaghan or Sligo.  We were told it was being revamped in July and was now fit for purpose but since then, only 53 homes have been moved from mortgage to rent under this scheme.  The Government owns 99% of AIB but the bank has concluded only a grand total of five sales.  We own this bank and can give directions to it but the Government sits on its hands.  Of the &euro;20 million fund for local authorities to participate in this scheme, only &euro;6 million has been spent.  It is a shocking failure the Minister has presided over for the past few years.</p>  <p>  Surely a Labour Party Minister for Social Protection would have protected the advice services available to people feeling the housing crisis.  Surely in times of a debt crisis the State steps up to the mark and makes sure the vulnerable people are protected.  That is not the case with this Government.  When this Government came to power, we had an excellent Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, on which many people relied.  It was funded to the tune of &euro;18.3 million per year.  In 2013, it received &euro;19.1 million and yet it has received a 7% cut from that point to today.  More than &euro;1 million has been taken away from the MABS budget.  When people needed it most, the Labour Party stood over cuts to the advice services to struggling families.</p>  <p>  MABS is not alone.  Over the term of this Government, Citizens Information has suffered a 10% cut at a time when MABS in 2013 reported a quadrupling of demand for its services.  If anybody needs reminding, the Labour Party promised that MABS would be strengthened to a personal debt management agency with strong legal powers but as Deputy Rabbitte would say, that is what people say at election time.  When people were down, the State was not too long about keeping them down.  We see the results in the numbers waiting for housing now.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Social Protection&rsquo;s other great initiative was to set up the independent financial advice service to help struggling home owners and others.  She told us the banks would foot the bill and it would cost them &euro;10 million.  She told us a crack team of 2,000 accountants would be available; that this was going to be the panacea and the saviour.  What happened?  Based on the figures the Minister gave me last week, it appears that each of these 2,000 accountants has given advice to one person over the term of the scheme, which is another spectacular failure.  When I asked the banks how much of the predicted &euro;10 million the scheme had cost them, I was told they had not even bothered accounting for it.  That is how little they thought of this scheme from the Labour Party. </p>  <p>  I do not have the time to go into the further failures of the Labour Party but the words of Deputy Gilmore when I first raised the issue of rip-off interest rates in 2011 ring in my ear.  He told me then that I need be in no doubt that this Government will act decisively and forcibly with the banks.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Labour Party might let us know when that is about to begin.  How many families have been thrown to the wolves as a result of their inaction, of their not acting decisively or forcibly with the banks?  When will the penny drop and when will they start dealing with this homelessness crisis, which is now at emergency level?</p></speech>

A secure warm family home should be a right and not a privilege to be granted or withheld by any government.  I would see it as being a constitutional right and it should be a constitutional right.  However, Members should look at the litany of horror that can be seen in this country.  Almost 5,000 people are homeless and 90,000 people are on the waiting list for local authority housing, which equates to approximately 130,000 people when one takes into account partners and children.  More than 100,000 people are in mortgage distress, a large percentage of whom are in a serious state of mortgage distress.  It is estimated that 12,000 such people will end up in court and 5,000 of them will be forced to surrender their mortgages and will end up depending on the Government to provide a home.  No accurate figure is available for the number of people and families who are privately renting at present but are paying a rent they cannot afford and are holding on by their fingertips.</p>  <p>  I sometimes think it is a pity Ministers apparently do not hold clinics to which people with problems call in because were they to so do, they would be aware of the impact of all this on these people.  It is scandalous that it should be necessary for a family to be reared in a hotel room in any country in the world.  That constitutes a scandal in any civilised country.  Can Members imagine a child going to school in the morning without knowing whether he or she will be returning to the same hotel that evening?  It is impossible to put oneself in the place of such people.  Can Members imagine if my grandchild or child was obliged to live life like that?  Yet, what do we do?  We issue reports and consider the job done, as a good report has been issued.  Such reports set out what will be done next year and in the following years but always in the future.  Members should imagine how these people feel when they hear the Government crowing about the great wee economy we have, about this growing economy, about the numbers returning to the workforce, as well as the swaggering about how Ireland is the best little country in which to invest, to visit and in which to live.  Members should imagine how those people feel when they hear this swaggering and they undoubtedly will hear a great deal more of it as the election draws closer.</p>  <p>  The job of Opposition Members is to put forward alternatives to bad policy and for nearly five years, Deputy Ellis and Sinn F&eacute;in have been doing that.  However, just as the Government is not listening to the pain of people in the community, neither is it listening to the constructive suggestions of the Opposition party called Sinn F&eacute;in.  Perhaps if it did listen and take on board some of Sinn F&eacute;in's suggestions, we would not now be in the crisis we face.  This crisis was caused by the policy of the present Government and its predecessor to place the safeguarding of the powerful and the wealthy above the interests of the citizens.  It is as pure or impure but certainly as simple as that.  It was accurately stated in a commentary following the bank collapse that the banks were too big to fail and the people were too small to matter.  The banks still are too big to fail and the people still are too small to matter.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Kelly, has come into the Chamber for the last few paragraphs of this debate.  He must make sure that something more than reports outlining what is going to happen in 2016, 2017 or 2020 will happen.  He must ensure this is treated as a crisis.  On behalf of the Government, he must tell the banks, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and landlords that this crisis will be solved and the Government will make sure those tens of thousands of people never again will be obliged to be in this position.  He must ensure no mother will be obliged to turn around to her children to tell them she was sorry she could not rear them in a home with a garden but that they were obliged to go to a different hotel room that evening and that she was sorry this State has let them down.</p></speech>

At the outset however, I thank Deputy Ellis for providing this opportunity for Members to discuss again what they all will agree is an extremely important topic, as well as the major reforms the Government is implementing in the private rental sector in Ireland to provide rent certainty for both tenants and landlords and the wide range of actions I and my colleagues in government are implementing in respect of homelessness.  This is a top priority and dealing with housing and homelessness is my number one priority.  While they are complex and broad issues, it is the number one issue that takes up most of my time each day.  Much has been achieved in this regard in a short space of time and I will set out some of the aforementioned measures taken by the Government to tackle this real problem.</p>  <p>  Before doing so, however, the Bill before Members this evening clearly is fundamentally flawed in many aspects, including the way in which it is constructed and the way in which it is written.  In many ways, its desired outcomes also are suspect.  Taken in its entirety, it is so badly thought through that I would go so far as to state it basically is just another attempt to be opportunistic and to attack the Government, rather than actually to find some real, workable solutions that would have an impact in a real way on a day-to-day basis.  I also believe it would give rise to unintended consequences and consequently once again when a problem arises, Sinn F&eacute;in are strong on rhetoric, as always, but weak on workable solutions.</p></speech>

They are complex and will take time.  Houses take time to build.  I would love to have a miracle and for them to be up immediately, but there is a time lag between the actions being taken and delivery of new housing on the ground.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in claims the Government has created the problems in the housing market, which is complete nonsense.  The Government is dealing with the consequences of a dysfunctional property market, where rents have increased due to, among other reasons, strong economic growth with unemployment at 8.9% and a property sector which was wiped out during the crash caused by our predecessors in government.</p>  <p>  However, the House will be aware that some weeks ago, the Government took significant action and I addressed a Private Members' motion on the topic again recently.  We have adopted a series of measures to tackle the problems in the housing sector by taking steps to boost supply and give rent certainty to tenants.</p>  <p>  The Government is bringing rent certainty by introducing amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 to address the issue of increasing rents in the private rented sector.  Many of the Deputies may have been here for part of the debate on that Bill with the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, earlier this evening.  The rapid increase in rents seen in recent years is being caused by a mismatch between levels of supply and demand for rental accommodation in the areas where it is most needed.  This is quite obvious.  We are addressing the supply problem, but it will be some time before that supply comes on stream.  As I said, houses take some time to build.</p>  <p>  The primary measure on rent is to change the provisions for rent reviews so that instead of taking place every 12 months, they will occur every 24 months.  This innovative measure will give hard-pressed tenants certainty and stability pending the supply of houses coming on stream.  The proposal includes a sunset clause that will see the measure expire on the fourth anniversary of its introduction.  It will be open to the Minister of the day to deal with that.  This is a crucial provision that sends a clear signal to the market that this is a short-term measure pending the restoration of equilibrium in the market as supply starts to come on stream.</p>  <p>  In providing for an extension to the period in which rent reviews may occur from 12 months to 24 months, the Government decided on an approach that would bring stability and predictability for the tenant but without changing the fundamental mechanism for the setting and reviewing of rent as laid down in the 2004 Act.  Government is mindful of the need not only to protect tenants from the circumstances that currently exist but also not to deter investment, which will limit the increase in supply that is needed.  Unlike the Deputy's Bill, the Government approach balances the need to protect tenants with the need to ensure that more supply of housing comes on stream.  Therefore, I will not be able to accept his flawed proposal.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ellis's Bill seeks to amend the Housing Act 1988 with a view to introducing a definition of a person who is at risk of becoming homeless and creating a role for housing authorities to give such persons whatever financial and other support is required to assist that person remain in occupation of their home.  The Bill's proposal to define legislatively someone as at risk of homelessness is far too broad to be workable within the remit of housing authority functions as laid down.  Most households could be liable to be at risk of homelessness for reasons that may materialise which are beyond their control, for example, job loss and other economic factors, mental health issues, addiction issues or anti-social behaviour.  The list is endless.</p>  <p>  The premise of the Bill would create a legal obligation on the State to support financially an indeterminable range of risks, which is simply unworkable.  It is not economically tenable and the Bill offers no qualifying criteria or limitations with regard to the circumstances or level of support to be put in place.  For example, the wording of the Bill is so loose that it suggests that housing authorities should provide financial support to households with unsustainable mortgages of unspecified amounts.  This goes far beyond the current role the State plays regarding housing need and private property.  If these flawed proposals were adopted, the State could easily end up bankrolling unpaid mortgage debt on trophy homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in has not done its homework here and if the Bill were to be passed the State could be open to all sorts of liabilities.</p>  <p>  I am also curious about the provision that bodies other than housing authorities could determine whether a person should be considered at risk of becoming homeless and therefore eligible for the range of supports, including financial assistance, which would see that person remain in occupation of their accommodation.  What seems to be suggested here is a potential - I am shocked to say this - privatisation of the means both to determine eligibility and to provide financial assistance but in the absence of any meaningful detailed criteria.  This again suggests that this flawed Bill was not properly thought through and was put before the House opportunistically.  Of course, it would not be the first time that Sinn F&eacute;in was strong on rhetoric and weak on substance.</p>  <p>  In addition to many other flaws in the detail of the Bill's drafting, it also demonstrates a lack of awareness of the existing suite of tailored supports, offered by a range of Government and other funded services to deal appropriately with the various personal, social and economic issues that can lead to people being in the unfortunate situation of homelessness, for example, the health and social care services offered by the Health Services Executive and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, economic supports available through the Department of Social Protection, Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service and others.  The Bill would undermine the existing services and expertise that are on offer for specific circumstances and would instead place financial and support responsibilities on housing authorities for a range of complex causative factors, which would be a step in the wrong direction.</p>  <p>  The Bill ignores the existing prevention measures which are operational through the Department of Social Protection for those in receipt of housing supports.  Under the Department of Social Protection's interim tenancy sustainment protocol, which is currently operational in Dublin and Cork and is being rolled out to other areas, and national tenancy sustainment framework, uplifts - an increase in the level of rent supplement normally allowable - have been granted to more than 5,000 households in the past 18 months.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Bill shows a lack of awareness of the range of tenancy-protection support and advocacy services currently funded through the various housing authorities that do such excellent work.  These include the housing authority-funded tenancy protection service which is provided through Threshold, the housing NGO.  This service operates in tandem with the Department of Social Protection's interim tenancy sustainment protocol.  The service is aimed at individuals, couples and families living in private rented accommodation that are experiencing housing problems and are at risk of homelessness, especially due to rent increases.  They do fantastic work and I want to acknowledge tonight that Threshold does amazing work  Under the arrangements, Threshold provides advice and advocacy for tenants who are at risk of losing their homes prior to the case being referred to the Department of Social Protection.  This is sufficient in many cases to secure the tenancy.</p><p>There are many cases of that kind.  The extension of the excellent Threshold service to Galway and the commuter counties outside of Dublin is currently being developed, and it is under consideration to extend it further afield as well.  I wish to see it rolled out to further areas because it is such a good protocol.  New legislative provisions are not required to allow housing authorities fund proactive housing support services.<br/><br/>Public awareness is a most crucial aspect of homelessness prevention.  Research commissioned this year by the Housing Agency found that the surveyed homeless families had little or no prior knowledge of their tenancy rights or of the various State and NGO services that could have assisted them before the loss of their tenancy.  Public awareness campaigns have been an important part of the homelessness prevention efforts during 2015.  That is something I dialled up, and insisted was dialled up, and through the range of measures I announced a number of weeks ago to protect tenants, we will be dialling up even more.  The awareness of their rights by tenants will be part of the process by which tenants and landlords agree their contracts in years to come.<br/><br/>Deputy Colreavy said it is a pity Ministers do not hold clinics.  He should be aware that I hold clinics all over Tipperary, in many towns, in my constituency offices and further afield in all the parishes.  One comes across housing issues all the time.  I am always struck in some cases by the lack of knowledge and awareness of tenants' rights.  Given those rights are quite good, broadening awareness of them is something on which all Members should collectively work.<br/><br/>Two public awareness campaigns have been undertaken by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to advertise the services it funds, including public advertisements on Dublin Bus and many hoardings, to ensure members of the public are aware of the services that are in place that could help to support them at a time of distress or crisis in their lives.  A significant level of media coverage was also generated, and while that is often critical in tone of State-funded services, it ultimately serves the purpose of creating awareness and building on awareness.  We should all be advocates of raising awareness.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection has been proactively engaging directly with its clients while undertaking a communications campaign to ensure that rent supplement clients, who are worried about losing their home, are provided with information on the supports available.  Initiatives have included text messages to approximately 50,000 rent supplement recipients; the availability of updated website information; information made available through social media in various formats and also through third parties on social media; and updating of the Citizens Information website and its micro site <i>keepingyourhome.ie</i>.  A national poster campaign was also implemented, with posters distributed to social protection offices, post offices, citizens information centres, MABS offices, credit unions and to every Member in both of these Houses for use in their clinics.<br/><br/>The Private Residential Tenancies Board has been overseeing a &euro;300,000 national advertising campaign to make tenants aware of their rights and landlords aware of their obligations because it is a two-way street.  It is not just about making tenants aware of the vast rights they have under the legislation and the improved legislation that is going through the Houses, but also to make landlords aware of their responsibilities.  This campaign, which ran across print, broadcast, online and outdoor media, has been developed on the back of recent research which found that 36% of tenants were not fully aware of their rights as a renter while many landlords are small-scale operators, with 65% owning just one property and 84% having two or one.  Sometimes the 65% category is referred to as the &quot;accidental landlords&quot;.<br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes.  We all agree on that.  The Government's social housing strategy 2020 was published in November 2014.  The six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion - since then we increased the amount of funding - and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, <i>inter alia</i>, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Hundreds of sites are under way across the country, which were announced in recent months.  In addition, the strategy envisions delivering up to 75,000 units of long-term, quality accommodation to meet housing needs through local authority housing support schemes.  There is a range of other measures as well.<br/><br/>We all know the lack of sufficient construction activity in the Dublin and Cork regions, in particular, has been a major contributing factor to the current lack of housing supply, with knock-on impacts in terms of homelessness that are obvious to everyone.  A number of important measures have been taken already, such as initiatives to improve financing, legislative changes around the vacant site levy, of which I personally am a huge advocate, reductions in development contributions which were announced in recent weeks, and amended Part V provisions which deliver real homes instead of giving options to local authorities to take revenue for use in different areas.  The new provisions will deliver real homes, turn-key homes, which is to be welcomed.<br/><br/>These measures, and the units earmarked under the social housing strategy, will take time to fully impact on supply, and in the meantime shorter-term measures must be implemented.  The measures will include the enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels; new national apartment planning guidelines to reduce the cost of apartment building in Dublin city by approximately &euro;20,000 per unit and; changes to aspects of the operation of strategic development zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements.  All of those measures are very positive and could have a real impact on supply in years to come.  Collectively, they could have a significant impact in particular in the areas where we have such demand, namely, the greater Dublin area and in Cork city.<br/><br/>This debate also requires that we acknowledge the significant activity that is, and has been, taking place to address issues of homelessness during 2015.  Homelessness is a complex phenomenon and measures to address it require an integrated approach across Government, agencies, many NGOs, local authorities and many Departments.  A range of measures is being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation for homeless households and to mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's 2016 target.  These measures have been identified in the Government's implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness, and in last December's action plan to address homelessness.  The plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with the issues associated with homelessness, namely, the many aspects of housing and intercepting people, the welfare of all those who find themselves in a vulnerable situation and in health care, because many people, in particular rough sleepers, have very complex needs that have been discussed in this House by many Deputies on all sides.</p><p>It should be noted that of the 106 measures identified in the two plans I referenced, just 80 are still in progress while just 13 have yet to commence.  This demonstrates the scale of activity in a very short space of time, with half of the identified measures already dealt with.</p> <p> I want to refer briefly to a number of actions that we have taken.  There has been a 32% increase in direct emergency homeless funding for 2016 and an increase of more than 50% over two years.  This is funding with respect to my Department for emergency accommodation and so on.  Much more funding comes across the whole of Government, all the agencies and local authorities.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive pilot of the housing assistance payment, HAP, including recent enhancements, allows an increase in the limits available to 50% above rent supplement levels.  This increase will improve the competitiveness of homeless households on HAP in the private rental market and increase their likelihood of being able to transition to stable tenancies.</p> <p> I also want to remind members of the ministerial direction I put in place requiring key local authorities to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control.  That obviously has had a significant impact.  Under this direction the Dublin region authorities must allocate at least 50% of tenancies to homeless and other vulnerable households, while the authorities in counties Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have been directed to allocate 30%.  We analyse these percentages quite a bit and we can recalibrate as we see fit.  </p> <p> The significant programme of restoring void local authority units - units that are boarded up and not in use - to productive use is in operation nationally.  This is something in which I have taken a direct personal interest, because turning around such voids, as we all know in the political sphere, is the quickest way of developing new units anywhere in the country.  We have exceeded targets in this respect.  A total of 2,333 void units were returned to productive use during 2014 and the expected figure for 2015 is in the region of 2,500, which is nearly 5,000 units in two years.  I say again in the House for the umpteenth time that Dublin City Council and the other local authorities in Dublin have been notified by me that they can establish as many teams as they want to open as many voids as they can anywhere across this city and that funding will be provided directly for that.  </p> <p> The high-level task force on social housing and homelessness, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, meets weekly.  This task force has overseen the identification and delivery of properties to accommodate homeless families in the Dublin region, including the delivery of a NAMA property which is now operating as a 65-unit homeless facility with a single assessment centre for homeless families, and the acquisition of approximately 100 units ring-fenced for homeless households.  </p> <p> The provision of modular housing is another such action designed to provide immediate options.  The Government has approved the delivery of 500 units of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin.  This programme of modular housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing number of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.  These units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, with each unit providing accommodation for a single household at a given time.  While the placement of households in these units will be on a temporary basis, such placements will offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  This is an innovative solution that will help deliver new units for homeless families in as short a timeframe as possible.  It is yet another example of the determination of this Government to tackle the problems in the housing sector and to tackle homelessness as quickly and effectively as possible.  I mentioned moving on people who have come through into homeless services.  I acknowledge that hundreds - a thousand, by the end of the year - families or individuals will have been moved through emergency accommodation into accommodation by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  I particularly acknowledge the work of Cathal Morgan and all his team, who do fantastic work every day of the week.</p> <p> I thank the House for again providing me with an opportunity to update Deputies on all actions that are being taken to address homelessness and in the area of housing, and the pressures in terms of housing and rent.  I am acutely aware of the values held by our society and the threat that is posed to these values by homelessness, and we are taking urgent action across a range of areas to tackle it.  It takes up most of my time every day.  We are all appalled - I am no different in that respect - that anyone would sleep rough on the streets of our capital or any other city or town in the country, and that there are children who will spend this Christmas in emergency accommodation.  However, it is a very positive reflection on our society and our political culture that an ongoing debate is taking place.  There are very few nations across the world that place such an emphasis on the plight of the homeless, and fewer, even among our EU colleagues, that are so effective in implementing responses and bringing about solutions.  When one has discussions with one's counterparts who deal with this issue in other countries, one will find that too, as I have on a regular basis.  </p> <p> On that note, I will conclude by referencing the Dublin Region Homeless Executive cold weather action plan, which is now in place. This proactive measure sees an additional 175 beds in place throughout the winter period.  Accordingly, no one should sleep rough in Dublin this winter unless it is through their own personal choice.  There are beds available for anybody who wishes to avail of them, and transport is available to take individuals to safe, suitable facilities. We are the only capital city in Europe that can guarantee a bed for anyone who is sleeping rough who wants one and will take one.  Unfortunately, there are small number of individuals who obviously are in distress and have complex needs, mainly as a result of addiction, mental health issues or other complex issues, who do not want to avail of emergency accommodation.  All efforts are made to assertively engage with such individuals and to direct them to the appropriate HSE health care and social services.</p> <p> The issue of homelessness is complex and is about much more than simply having a roof over one's head and much more than just funding and money, as I have said many times before.  I reassure all Members that I and my colleagues in Government will continue to do our utmost to tackle the ongoing and intricately connected problems in regard to homelessness, rent and the supply of housing for the future.  Let no one have any doubt about the determination that I have, and that this Government has, to tackle the problems in the housing sector.  We need to boost the supply of housing, both social and private, and I have set out above the many measures the Government is taking to do just that.  The Government has also taken action to stabilise rents and to give rent certainty to renters, and to give additional protections to tenants.</p> <p> Despite Deputy Ellis's best intentions, I believe this Bill is deeply flawed, has unintended consequences, is ill thought out and, clearly, does not represent anything like a workable solution to the problems in the housing sector or homelessness.  Therefore, on behalf of the Government, I will be opposing this Bill.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Ellis on its introduction.  I heard Fr. Peter McVerry on "Morning Ireland" this morning talking about the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corrie.  He said also that this month a year ago, 40 families a month were becoming homeless.</p><p>A year later 73 families a month are becoming homeless.  Mike Allen of Focus Ireland described this as "the changing face of homelessness" as many families are now becoming homeless, as distinct from individuals.  Fr. Peter McVerry went on to say that even though additional beds had been opened, the number of homeless was higher than last year.  He said on "Six One News" that, "As regards rough sleeping, very little has changed."  He rightly talked about the prevention of homelessness and the need for radical action.  Examples he gave were renovating and refurbishing vacant houses, expanding the mortgage to rent scheme and, especially, giving people their own space in the provision of housing.  This is one of the important issues that should be put to the Minister.  Fr. McVerry gave the example of 50 people sleeping on a floor, which is unacceptable because there are issues relating to people's dignity and the security and space they need.  As he said, people can be terrified staying in dormitory-type accommodation.  That is what happens in emergency accommodation.  If people are sharing rooms, they fear for their safety and experience a lack of security.</p> <p> I spoke recently about the increase in rents in County Galway.  Rents increased in Galway city by 12% between July and September, because of which families lost their accommodation.  The supply is not adequate, an issue which has to be addressed.  The Minister announced the construction of 54 houses in the Galway County Council area this year and I hope money will be provided to allow construction to start because the issue of housing supply is so important.  The county council has a waiting list that is eight to ten years long and the city council has an even longer waiting list.  When people make inquiries and are told they will have to wait eight to ten years, it is hard to take.  It is more difficult for a homeless family to make inquiries in these circumstances.  People are moving nine or ten miles outside the city where rents are also increasing but where there are more opportunities to secure housing.  It was interesting to read headlines in local newspapers about students at the end of August.  One headline read "Rental Chaos for Students".  They should have been able to find accommodation in the city, but they had to move nine or ten miles from it.</p> <p> The Minister's party colleague, Deputy Derek Nolan, spoke well about the 50% increase in rents in Galway in the past four years.  He gave an example of a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  The rent increased from &euro;800 per month in 2011 to &euro;1,300 per month this year.  This follows a housing shortage and house price increases.  What has happened in Galway is similar to what is happening in other parts of the country.  There might be some one-off housing constructed by people on their own sites and a small number of properties developed by NAMA.  Can the agency not do something about the social housing issue?  We want more social housing, not just private housing.</p> <p> Threshold states rent certainty measures could be introduced by making amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and points out that the law, as it stands, does not protect tenants or landlords from rapid increases or decreases in market rent levels.  This creates a risk of homelessness for tenants and uncertainty for landlords as to their rental income.  Rent certainty measures must achieve a fair balance between the property rights of landlords and the interests of the community at large.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-01a.677" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="22:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120100057#EEE00200"><p>Like Deputy Michael P. Kitt, I welcome the opportunity presented by Deputy Dessie Ellis and his party to discuss this issue and the contents of the Bill, to acknowledge their right to do so and to compliment them on their efforts.  I would not call the Bill "flawed".  Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and many others have made suggestions in the past few years and if they had been taken on board, we might not have reached this juncture.  If the Bill is adjudged to be opportunistic by the Minister, he should acknowledge that the opportunity was handed to them in the form of a penalty kick in so far as it was plain for them to  do so.</p>  <p>  It is important that rather than attacking the policies, proposals or suggestions made by the Opposition in the past few years, the Minister adequately attack the problem and allow us to look back in any given year at improvements that might have been made.  It is particularly poignant that the Bill is being discussed on the first anniversary of the death of Mr. Jonathan Corrie.  We, again, collectively send our condolences to his family.  I acknowledge the hurt, difficulty and trauma experienced by many people on a regular basis and their families who are affected by the terrible dilemma that is homelessness, the threat of homelessness, the worry and fear of being left without a home and the greater trauma and frustration of knowing that should that eventuality become a reality, the State will not be in a position to help with what some have rightly described as a human right.</p>  <p>  With many others, I hoped this terrible incident 12 months ago would be a watershed moment and the catalyst for the Minister to act where the Government had failed to act in the previous four years, albeit with different Ministers, namely, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and former Deputy Phil Hogan.  However, having played a small role in the negotiations initiated by the Minister, for which we commended him with the best of intent and which were conducted in good faith, a year on the commitments to end homelessness or go a long way towards it, unfortunately, have not been realised.  That is not just my opinion or that of various Opposition Members; it is also coming from those at the coalface.  Others have referred to the commentary by stakeholders earlier today on Mr. Corrie's anniversary, including the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland, Simon and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Local authority officials will tell the Minister that this problem has not gone away and that it has deteriorated further.  It was a problem initially, it became a crisis and has now become an emergency which the Minister seems unable to unravel, which is most unfortunate.  The resolutions he eventually brought forward in recent weeks were too little and too late.  The vacuum in the meantime, not to mention the vacuum created by inaction in the previous two or three years, has resulted in significant increases in the rents being sought and paid by many, as previous speakers said.</p>  <p>  The immediacy of the problem remains, notwithstanding the Minister's efforts, some of which have been commendable, as late and as little as they were.  Rent certainty, rent controls and the deposit protection scheme are welcome developments which should have happened long before this.  Somebody who could not afford to pay the rent or who was finding it difficult to do so six or eight weeks ago before the Minister's announcements still finds it difficult and many people cannot do so.  We discussed the details of the Minister's proposals in the debate on the residential tenancies legislation earlier, but unfortunately they do not address the dilemma faced by the people concerned.</p><p>The Taoiseach refused the suggestion again today, as he, the Minister and others have continuously done over the last 18 months to two years, and will not entertain the possibility of increases in rent supplement.  We accept and acknowledge that the supply situation will take time to unravel despite the late start that has been made.  I reiterate that it has been a late start.  It was too easy to say that the funds were not available.  It is too easy to say that the Government would not help the construction sector during that time because it owed it something because of the association with a previous Government.  That, at least, is the picture the Government wants to paint.  It held water with the public and was an excuse for inaction on the Government's part and for many other issues pertaining to the previous election.  That election campaign could be re-run in the next election.  People will not buy that anymore.  They are not interested in it anymore.  As I have often said, people gave the Minister, his party and Government colleagues a huge majority and asked them to take their role seriously.  It asked all members of Government who were given the responsibility and the privilege to enact legislation, to address difficulties, propose initiatives, put policy in place, allow it to be debated with colleagues here and the Opposition, to allow legislation to be scrutinised and amendments sought and accepted and ultimately to put better legislation in place to address these issues.  The Government has let itself down in many areas in that regard.  I can point to the highest level of guillotining of any Government.  That was the sort of arrogance that took hold.  It has been reiterated and repeated on several occasions against a backdrop of, supposedly, a 6% growth in the economy, of us having gone into recovery over 12 months ago and of an extra &euro;1.5 billion being pulled out of the hat in the recent budget.  The Government believes that budget is one which will allow the Minister and his Government party colleagues to be re-elected, because it has addressed the USC and taxation issues and has put more money in people's pockets, or so it believes.  The increasing car insurance, let alone health insurance, puts paid to that.</p> <p> Let us forget that scenario.  The Minister has failed to listen to the best suggestion for addressing this issue in the short-term and for addressing the immediacy of the problem in order to stabilise the situation to allow the Government's building programme eventually to take hold, namely rent allowance and subvention.  It will be the Government's greatest downfall.  Only today the Taoiseach refused to entertain that suggestion.</p> <p> There is no doubt there will be many Departments across Government which will come in under budget in the coming weeks.  That is the election war chest that will be used to fight fires as they arise, if they arise, around the country in various constituencies.  It should be incumbent on the Minister today to recognise the fact, on this day of all days on the anniversary that occurs, that in an area where the Government has failed miserably it should correct that wrong.  Funding should be sought and collected from those sources and set aside to address this rent issue immediately in the form of rent supplement.  That, at this late stage, would be welcomed by all sides of the House as a reasonable method by which this issue could be stabilised and people could be prevented from becoming homeless.  That is what is being faced.  There was also the eventual correction to the insolvency legislation whereby the bank veto gave them the power to ensure that families were put at risk, against the backdrop of housing not being available.</p> <p> I do not understand why the Government is allowing the sale by NAMA of Project Arrow.  A portfolio worth &euro;7 billion is reputedly being sold for &euro;1 billion, with 50% of it being residential units.  They could be available for people on housing lists if the Government got them for &euro;100,000 a pop.  That is on the basis of the Government having been informed by NAMA in recent months that there will be a &euro;2 billion surplus or dividend available to the Government when its work is complete.</p> <p> They are just some final suggestions, at the eleventh hour, in the hope that the Minister might take them on board, despite the fact that he has failed to listen to them and acknowledge them in the past.  I add my voice and support to the Bill.  There may be elements that could be amended but that is what I would expect a caring and understanding Government to do.  That is something I can live with.  Any Member of the Opposition is entitled to play his or her part by virtue of the opportunity he or she been given by the electorate to represent them in a fashion that they see fit.  If a Member sees fit to put forward legislation, a Bill or motion, that seeks to address the inaction of Government over five years which has brought us to this scenario, he or she is more than entitled to do so and deserves my support at least, if nobody else's.  </p></speech>

I know from my office and those involved directly in homelessness and housing that things are getting worse.  There have been a number of strategies to prevent homelessness over the years, all of which have been unsuccessful.  A preventative strategy is needed, a system whereby the local authorities can engage with people before they become homeless.  It is acknowledged that section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 is now out of date.  As the Minister said, housing advice, advocacy and tenancy support are all important.  They are effective and cost-effective but interventions are limited in the current section 10.  If the measures were as robust as the Minister said in his speech, we would not be seeing a worsening situation.  The reality is that in the third quarter of 2015, rents rose by 3.2% and are increasing every month in Galway and Cork.</p>  <p>  The lead in to the rent certainty was far too long.  It should have been introduced almost immediately, overnight if necessary, with a lengthy discussion on it here.  By doing so, the landlords would not have had the opportunity to increase rent, which is what we are seeing.  I am losing count of the number of calls to my offices because of rent increases.  The rent supplement has increased in some 5,000 cases but the Government is adamant that there is no blanket increase in rent supplement.  I do not want to see extra money going to landlords for substandard accommodation but are there figures comparing the cost of increasing the rent supplement to the cost of emergency accommodation in B&amp;Bs and hotels?</p>  <p>  I wish to make a point about children in homeless accommodation and the long-term damage that is doing to them physically, mentally and emotionally.  In my community, there are calls from various groups for extra supports to go to those parents.  Like other Members, I was outside when the protest took place tonight.  One image that really struck me was when somebody on the stage asked how we have got to the point now where we have normalised individuals and couples sleeping in doorways and in sleeping bags on pieces of cardboard.</p></speech>

It is not an accident that today is the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corrie on the doorstep across the road.  We in this House should all remember that tragedy.  The people who supported the demonstration tonight outside this House include Help 4 the Homeless, Ballyfermot, North Dublin Bay Housing Crisis Community, the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland, the Dublin Simon Community, Brother Kevin Crowley from the Capuchin Day Centre, Housing Action Now, Merchant&rsquo;s Quay, the Young Workers' Network, Dublin Council of Trade Unions, SIPTU, Right 2 Change unions, and the Migrant Rights Centre.  They are all people who are experienced on the ground and they say that one year on the situation is getting worse rather than getting better.  If that does not register with the Government then there is something desperately wrong.  The point was made tonight that in 2013 approximately 20 families were presenting as homeless.  In 2014, the number increased to 40 families per month and in 2015 it increased to 80 families per month.  There is something desperately wrong.  There are 3,500 people homeless.</p><p>That is just the tip of the iceberg.  Many families are couch-surfing.  I have families attend my constituency office every day of the week with their children when they find themselves homeless.  One particular family from Walkinstown was offered a place in Clontarf.  Their children go to school in Walkinstown, meaning the cost of travelling across from Clontarf to the children&rsquo;s school on social welfare payments would be impossible.  The family in question ended up staying with their parents, which is causing untold problems in the home.</p> <p> The demands are simple: house the homeless, introduce rent controls, and build social and affordable housing.  The Minister said that it takes time to build housing.  Only yesterday, at the housing committee in Dublin City Council, we were told the modular housing proposed for Drimnagh will not be built until June of next year.  In 2007, a covenant on the land in question in Drimnagh stated it should provide housing for the elderly.  In the time that has elapsed, officials could have had services and housing for the elderly built there.  There is something strategically wrong with the way the Minister is going about providing social and affordable housing.  Fr. Peter McVerry said tonight that the Government will not go to Europe to call for a national emergency in housing because it is too busy trying to present Ireland in a different image to Europe and not the reality on the ground where people are suffering homelessness.</p></speech>
