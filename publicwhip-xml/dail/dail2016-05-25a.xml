I call Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500003#A00300"><p>Yesterday, in response to the barbaric murder of Gareth Hutch, the latest in a series of callous murders across the capital city, the Taoiseach said initially in his response that he could do nothing to stop the killings.  Also, one senior Garda said there was no immediate end in sight.  An interpretation of what the Taoiseach was saying essentially is that the State is almost powerless to stop this and turn the tide against the criminal gangs and the drug overlords controlling parts of our city and country.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a need for the State to really get into the face of these criminals, assert who is in charge of our country and ensure that crime does not pay.  The 2009 legislation is in place and its full implementation is required.  It created new offences in terms of directing a criminal organisation and participation in organised crime, invokes the Offences against the State Act and the utilisation of the Special Criminal Court, and depends greatly on intelligence the Garda has built up over time.  The Garda and the full armoury of the State need to meet these criminals head on and be constantly in their face in terms of ensuring they do not reign with the apparent ease with which they do at the moment when they can run up and murder people in cold blood and in broad daylight.  Therefore, the full implementation of the 2009 Act is called for. </p>  <p>   Second, with regard to the proposal for a mini criminal assets bureau, I know that in a recent reply the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, was careful to avoid any commitment to its establishment and drew a distinction between the new unit profiling people in Store Street and the establishment of locally based criminal asset bureaus that would, again, get in the face of criminals on the ground-----</p></speech>

That is now in the programme for Government, but there is no real sense of any commitment to it.  The community groups we met last week were clear that they got no sense of any commitment to establish mini-CABs.  The term &quot;mini&quot; is used, but these would be locally based CABs that were on the ground targeting these individuals and their wealth and making life extremely uncomfortable for them.</p><p>Thirdly, if I may-----</p></speech>

This has been going on for quite some time.  The main issue on the streets in the north inner city concerns tablets and Z-drugs, as they are called.  A change of regulations is required.  The signing of regulations is required to criminalise that activity and to give the Garda the power it requires to arrest those who are distributing tablets across the city.  Those powers are not there and, incredibly, the Garda is not in a position to move effectively on that particular phenomenon, which is a huge source of revenue to the drug lords and which is damaging young people in those communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500003#A01000"><p>First of all, what I said yesterday was that this was a murderous feud between two rival families.  We have had experience of this in the past.  Pleas to the McCarthy-Dundons, the General and the Gilligan gang did not do anything until intelligence, personnel and investment in resources and capacity were able to take these people off the streets and put them behind bars, and the same applies here now.  At least in those cases, in different years, the criminal gangs were based here in Ireland.  There is now a strong international connection, with hits being ordered from abroad.  This is as much about sending signals internationally about the so-called status of criminal gangs as it is about power and money and misery here.  The sending of people to carry out or to attempt killings for what are in some cases very small sums are really signals from those who live with the trappings and shallowness of wealth abroad and do their dirty business from abroad.  I say very clearly to Deputy Martin and everyone else in this House that the Government will not back down in the face of this.  We have had experience in different counties over the years, and it takes a long time to deal with these things.</p>  <p>  In respect of local resources, the Minister met with all the communities, as did Deputy Martin, quite recently.  I intend to meet the leadership of the communities and all the public representatives myself when it is appropriate.  However, as of 31 March, 598 garda&iacute; are assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region - North Central, of which 251 were assigned to Store Street and 186 to Mountjoy, while 33 newly attested garda&iacute; have been assigned to the north Dublin region also.</p>  <p>   As Deputy Martin knows, Operation Hybrid has been put in place to manage the recent increase in violence and these murderous activities by gangs.  More than a thousand lines of inquiry are being pursued, a significant number of statements and exhibits have been gathered and widespread searches have been carried out.  Arms are being seized, people are being brought before the courts and cases prepared, and the courts will do their duty.  As I said yesterday, more than a thousand extensive armed checkpoints have taken place since February, which is more than 80 a week, and no more than 500 patrols and 400 searches have been conducted under this operation across the Dublin region.  Those checkpoints and patrols are significantly supported by armed support groups such as the emergency response unit and the regional support units.</p></speech>

Arrests have been made, including on 24 May in connection with the shootings of Eddie Hutch Senior and Gareth Hutch, respectively.  This situation is reviewed on a weekly basis.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner and the assistant commissioner to come at 7 p.m. this evening for a full security briefing, particularly in respect of the extra facilities and resources being made available in the north inner city to deal with this issue.  I will inform the House of the ongoing activity.  Believe me, Deputy Martin, the State and the Government will not lie down in front of this intimidation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500003#A01400"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I point out that, notwithstanding that huge effort - I accept the bona fides of the Garda in everything it is trying to do - and notwithstanding everything the Taoiseach has said, there have been seven murders within 100 days in our capital city.  That says it all about the state we are in right now and the degree of power that these people are currently wielding on our streets.  The Taoiseach did not answer the questions I put to him.</p><p>Under the 2009 Act there is stronger capacity to really make life uncomfortable for many of these criminals, who are well known to the Garda from intelligence work and so on.</p> <p> Is the Taoiseach really committed to the excerpt in the programme for Government dealing with the establishment of locally based Criminal Assets Bureau units?  They could really get stuck in to people on the ground, including the lower and mid-level drug pushers who have unexplained wealth, obviously from the proceeds of crime, and who are ruling the roost in their local communities.  They are giving up to &euro;200 or &euro;300 to 13 year olds and 14 year olds to distribute tablets on the streets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1371" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500004#B00200"><p>Will you conclude, Deputy, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500004#B00300"><p>That is what is going on in the streets of the north inner city.  Young children can earn a fortune.  They are told to bring a packet to a certain place and they will then get &euro;200.  They are telling the other children that they are mugs not to be involved because it is lucrative and so on.  We have to listen to the people there.  That is most important.</p>  <p>  I did not get a reply today or yesterday to a third issue.  Deputy Shortall raised this question as well.  The Garda needs powers to arrest people who are selling prescription drugs on our streets.  The Minister for Health needs to sign in to law new regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That is why I called for a multi-agency approach yesterday.  It is not all about security.</p></speech>

Deputy, you need to conclude.</p></speech>

We are being told by community activists that garda&iacute; are saying to them that the force does not have the power to tackle this particular issue.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a need for a multi-agency task force to be put in place involving the local public representatives in the areas as well as community activists?  Does he agree that we need to take a multi-faceted approach, above all, to make life extremely uncomfortable for those who are ruling the roost at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500004#B00600"><p>The last point Deputy Martin raised has been discussed with the Minister for Justice and Equality and all of the groups in the communities.  This is very important.  Some of the groups have been in existence in different parts of the country for many years.  They may need to be reinvigorated in terms of the work they do and so on.  That issue is under discussion.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear on this point.  These gangland crimes and killings, including the orders and attempts to kill, are not being done on a whim or decided in the corner of some kitchen in inner city Dublin.  They are being directed from international sources.  There needs to be a far greater connection and far more vigilant operation with international police forces and intelligence in respect of such gangs.  I will make the point again.  What is happening internationally is as much a signal being sent to other international criminals about the status of a gangland crime from Ireland, involving the Kinahan gang or whatever, and about what they can do.  These gangs are intent on retaliatory killings in Dublin.  My concern is for the people living in these communities and their children in particular.  A school had to be locked down yesterday.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin made a number of other points.  The Misuse of Drugs Act deals with licensed tablets.  We need primary legislation to deal with an extension of the provisions.  That is being prepared by the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner has appointed local investigators in different parts of the country to deal with this issue.  They act as mini CAB units in different locations throughout the country.  I will meet the Garda Commissioner this evening at 7 p.m. for a full security update, including what is being provided and whether the Garda Commissioner and the police force need other resources to deal with this issue.  I intend to meet all the public representatives and community leaders when it is appropriate to do so in respect of dealing with it.  I expect we will get support from all Members because the issue affects everyone.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may recall that a memorial was erected in 2000 to remember the 150 people from that community who died during the previous 20 years from heroin and other drugs.  I commend the organisers of this act of solidarity for a community that has suffered grievously from significant violence and criminality.</p>  <p>  A total of seven men have been murdered as part of a so-called criminal feud.  People are living in fear.  Whatever else we may disagree about in this Chamber, it is important for us to state clearly that the small minority of criminals involved do not represent the communities we serve.  These are not ganglands; these are wonderful communities victimised by criminal gangs.  They are caring communities that deserve better.  They need social and economic regeneration.  In particular, they need the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allocate resources and personnel to achieve this end and put those responsible behind bars.</p>  <p>  This lack of resources did not happen by accident.  The Fine Gael Government, during its last term, closed Garda stations, as did Fianna F&aacute;il.  In the north inner city of Dublin, there are now 140 fewer garda&iacute; than in 2010.</p></speech>

I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the work it does in difficult circumstances, but additional garda&iacute; are needed, as is funding for projects and a comprehensive plan for the community in respect of jobs, councillors, children, in particular, teachers, addiction services and youth groups.  A range of community services that intervene with young people at risk or those with drug addiction have had resources cut.  That did not happen by accident either.  The Fine Gael Government and Fianna F&aacute;il did that as well.  Will the Government commit now to increased funding and an integrated plan for the social, economic, educational and community development of the north inner city?</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Adams about their commitment to make that opportunity available for their children and families.  Why not?  I saw and felt as much when I was at the funeral mass of Martin O'Rourke.  People came up to me and made the very point Deputy Adams has made, and I agree with it completely.</p>  <p>  It is a fact of life and I have said this already.  I intend to see that, in so far as this Government can, with the help of everyone, we turn our face towards dealing with social disadvantage and unfairness.  The children growing up in these areas are at a serious disadvantage to others in many places throughout the country.  We have a position whereby the economy is in a position to deliver better than before.  Really and truly, I hope to make progress by meeting with the community leadership and giving the Garda the resources and facilities to do its job in dealing with gangland crime.  It is exceptionally labour-intensive, costly and a drain on the taxpayer, but it is necessary for the safety, protection and opportunity of communities throughout the country.  We intend to stand by that, and I know Deputy Adams and Sinn F&eacute;in will support us in that regard.</p>  <p>  It is distressing to read of the lock-down of schools and the fears of parents, who are afraid of what is going to happen to their children.  Perfectly innocent young people have been gunned down in the madness of inter-gangland, inter-family rivalry and feuding.  The people who organised the procession the other day did a superb job.  The day before, the Minister for Justice and Equality met the communities and their leadership for over two hours to hear their concerns, feel their anxiety and see whether together we can put in place a process that will deal with this.  As Deputy Adams is well aware, it took years to deal with the McCarthy Dundon gang.  It took years to deal with Gilligan.  It took years to deal with The General.</p><p>It does require information, resources, capacity and courage from young people who join the Garda.  That is why Templemore has been opened.  That is why there will be increased numbers of young garda&iacute; coming through.  That is why I was glad when the Commissioner mentioned to me that the application for the armed unit had been very much oversubscribed by people who have a real opportunity here and a real commitment to dealing with this.  After this evening&rsquo;s meeting with the Commissioner, the assistant commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality to get the update on what extra is being put in here, what facilities are available and the capacity of garda&iacute; to do their job, I want Government to be able to work with those communities and others throughout the country to deliver for their children and their cities in a way that we could say Government will not be intimidated by this kind of murderous feuding, that it will not lie down in the face of that, and that it will deliver for the people and the resources will be there for garda&iacute; to protect those communities and people.  That is our duty and our responsibility.</p></speech>

Yes, we need new tough legislation to deal with the illegal trade in prescription drugs, but the report of the first ministerial task force on drugs, published 20 years ago, highlighted the link between drugs, crime, poverty and social and economic deprivation.  It called for increased investment not only in front-line policing but also in education, treatment and prevention.  Twenty years later, the Clondalkin drugs task force a few weeks ago published a report entitled Outcomes: Drug Harms, Policy Harms, Poverty &amp;amp; Equality.  It is the same old story.  This report is a damning indictment of 20 years of failure by successive governments and it accepts, despite the huge amount of work done by local community workers, addiction counsellors and other key workers, garda&iacute;, teachers, sports coaches and residents, that things are getting worse.  We need increased funding for garda&iacute; but also for drugs task forces whose funding like that of the one in Clondalkin has been cut by 45%.</p>  <p>  This is not only a Dublin issue.  In my constituency of Louth and east Meath there is a serious underfunding of addiction services.  None of this happened by accident.  It is a direct result of Government policy.  Will the Taoiseach commit to bringing forward a plan which will mean there will be a Government-led task force involving local communities to carry out a comprehensive multi-agency strategic plan to reclaim these communities, empower their citizens and regenerate these brilliant communities made up of decent, sound people?</p></speech>

I know of few people in this country who speak with the voice that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, does about social disadvantage and what can be done about it.  She is the newly appointed Minister of State with responsibility for drugs and will lead on the drugs strategy.  She will liaise with the local drugs task forces.  There will be proper public consultation.  There will be a proper strategy for drugs before the end of the year and that involves consultation.</p>  <p>  The first period of the previous Government was spent dealing with an unprecedented economic catastrophe.  We have now moved to a different place.  We need to have the resources to invest in communities and people.  That is why we have been able to put more into the facilities for garda&iacute; to do their job which had been neglected for a very long time.  It is not where it should be but it is better than it was.  In answer to my questioning about the level of resources being given to the Garda Commissioner and the assistant Garda commissioner, they tell me they have what they need.  I will deal with that again at 7 p.m. today.  Now I am interested in seeing that those children, parents and young people are given some sense of aspiration, hope and confidence.  We can only do that by working together.  That is why the new Minister of State with responsibility for drugs has my full support in the way that she knows, as a public representative and a former Lord Mayor of the city, what it takes and will take to get communities focused on where we know they can be and remove that social disadvantage.  Yes, it will take investment, consultation and community leadership, but that is all there and those ingredients are there if we only apply ourselves in a way that I know we can and, I hope, will.</p></speech>

The first duty of everybody here for the people who feel like that in their own communities is to understand that this House and every Member in it not only stands with them but is determined to solve the problems they face.</p>  <p>  I listened with some care to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words.  It is our common analysis that crimes and feuds like this do not exist in a vacuum.  There are criminal gangs based in our city and country, and some based offshore, who thrive like parasites on the deprivation and desperation of communities like this.  Words are not enough today.  There need to be two approaches.  One is immediate, and we are agreed on that, which is a policing response that is intelligent and effective.  It worked in the past in Limerick and other places when there was solidarity across this House in the mid-1990s when Ruair&iacute; Quinn brought in the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, legislation.  We were determined to do whatever was necessary.  We need the people of the north inner city to hear that absolute sense of unity and purpose today.</p>  <p>  Second, in respect of the social disadvantage that Deputy Adams and others have spoken about and to which the Taoiseach has responded, what specifically are we going to do?  I have great faith-----</p></speech>

The Deputy is right to say that crimes do not exist in a vacuum.  The difference between this situation and ones that applied in previous years is the international offshore connection where those who have gained vast proceeds from dealing in drugs live very different lives, with the shallowness of that ill-gained wealth, and give their directions from abroad.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the response now is to focus on intelligence, prosecution, the courts system and getting people behind bars for criminal activities.  As the Deputy well knows, that is a labour-intensive situation.  The Limerick situation he mentions was different because of the international connections now.  I welcome the resolve of everybody in the House to deal with this.  When I have a full briefing from the Commissioner in respect of what is there now and what is required, I will share that with the leaders of the groups here.</p><p>I can confirm that a task force will deal with the local situation in the inner city.  I can confirm to Deputy Howlin that an action-based national strategy to deal with drugs will be put in place and that there will be consultation with local drugs task forces and communities.</p></speech>

I do not just say that; I will prove it.  We will engage with them, hear their views, anxieties and concerns and deliver on them.  In the immediate, medium and longer term, I assure everybody in the House that we will follow through diligently with these actions.</p></speech>

We want it to be immediate and include effective policing with the degree of determination that this House showed in the mid-1990s.  I welcome the fact the leaders of the Opposition parties will be briefed after tonight's meeting.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's second announcement was as important as the first.  I welcome the announcement that there is to be a task force.  We need to know and have input into its terms of reference.  Who will lead it?  What sort of resources will be deployed?  We should not focus on this issue simply because it is now in the public eye.  Rather, we should have a medium and long-term strategy that will resolve the issue in order that these parasites cannot recruit vulnerable people in communities to do their vicious will again.</p></speech>

These discussions have already started.  I would be happy to ask the other leaders and groupings for their views on how we can do this in the best way possible.  The social inclusion units of the Departments of Social Protection and Health are important entities and will form part of the process.</p>  <p>  I hope, arising from what we now propose to do, that we get coherence and a strategy in order that the communities affected will be able to see what will happen in the immediate, medium and longer term.  This is a partnership operation that affects everybody.  I hope the D&aacute;il can show the communities affected that we are serious about acting in their interests.  Dealing with criminal activities requires resources but, more importantly in the longer term, we need to allow those communities to have a life and be able to thrive, move on and provide the opportunities for their children, families and older people to which they are properly entitled.</p></speech>

I last held such a meeting with the Chancellor when I visited Berlin on 3 July 2014 following her visit to Dublin that March.  I have had no scheduled bilateral meetings with my European counterparts since the start of March, although I did of course see and engage with them at 7 March summit with Turkey and at the later European Council meeting of 17 and 18 March.  Several of them have written to me since my re-election as Taoiseach.</p><p>As to the joint statement, the implementation of the measures agreed between the EU and Turkey in March continues, although this process poses challenges for all sides.  In assessing whether the measures are working, it is worth recalling that the core intention of the joint statement was to break the so-called business model of people smugglers profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable and to stop migrants attempting to cross the Aegean Sea.  The latest reports indicate the numbers using this migratory route have reduced very considerably since the implementation of the measures began, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>However, the realities of dealing with a crisis this profound and complex cannot be ignored, and in some areas implementation of the agreed measures has been very slow.  I share the recent assessment of the European Commission and others that progress on the relocation and resettlement of asylum seekers is unsatisfactory.  From Ireland's perspective, in September last year the Government established the Irish refugee protection programme, under which we have agreed to accept 4,000 people in need of international protection.  This allowed us to opt in to various EU measures in solidarity with our partners.</p><p>I am pleased that we are on track to meet our resettlement commitment.  To date, 263 people have arrived in Ireland and the balance of 257 individuals to be admitted under the programme have been selected following a mission to Lebanon in January and should arrive in Ireland by the end of September.  Progress on relocation has been much slower.  Only ten people have arrived in Ireland to date in spite of our best efforts to fulfil our overall commitment.  These delays are due to factors outside our control, in particular the establishment of emergency hotspots in Greece and Italy, and have been experienced by all other member states.  We are working closely with our EU partners to address these issues.  The delivery of commitments in regard to international and European law is rightly undergoing scrutiny and there is close co-operation between the European Union and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p><p>Member states on the front line of dealing with the crisis remain under pressure.  It is essential that all partner countries assist them in managing the practical realities of supporting the significant number of migrants and refugees who have arrived in their countries.  To that end, Ireland's contribution to the overall response, in terms of humanitarian assistance and technical support, are important.</p><p>On the wider situation Turkey, recent developments there have given rise to heightened concerns about respect for human rights, freedom of the media and the rule of law.  I also note the resignation earlier this month of the Turkish Prime Minister.  It remains to be seen what impact these development might have on the delivery of commitments under the EU and Turkey March statement, including visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens entering the Schengen area.</p><p>Therefore, while some of the measures have had an immediate and positive impact, it is important to maintain momentum if the overall package is to make a long-term contribution to tackling the migration crisis throughout the entire region.  We also know that pressures continue on other migratory reroutes.  I was very pleased that the Government agreed last month to the deployment of the <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>in support of the humanitarian search and rescue efforts of the Italian authorities in the Mediterranean, repeating the valiant efforts of our Naval Service last year which rescued 8,592 men, women and children.  The <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>will spend ten weeks in the Mediterranean assisting the Italian authorities.  She commenced search and rescue missions on 12 May 2016 and since that date has rescued almost 400 men and women.</p><p>On behalf of the people, I extend my appreciation and warm wishes to her and her crew for the duration of her mission.</p> <p> The migration crisis rightly and necessarily remains an issue of the highest priority.  There will be a further discussion of these issues at the June European Council and I will report back to the House afterwards.</p> <p> I made a comprehensive statement to the House on 22 March on the meetings of the European Council in February and March and on the two EU summits with the Turkish Prime Minister, both in March.  The conclusions agreed in February and in March have been laid before the House.  To give a brief recap, the two main areas addressed at the meetings were the EU-UK relationship, and the discussions with Turkey on the migration crisis.</p> <p> In February, the European Council also addressed a range of economic issues.  There was a commitment to further implementation of all aspects of the Single Market.  That includes delivering on the Commission's Single Market and Capital Markets Union strategies but also, on a point which is key for this country, and at our insistence, on the Digital Single Market.  Conclusions were adopted on Syria and Libya.</p> <p> The European Council on 18 March also adopted conclusions on climate and energy, recalling the need to reinforce energy security and to sign and ratify the Paris agreement as soon as possible, as well as on agriculture and on the steel sector.</p> <p> I met Prime Minister Cameron bilaterally at the European Council of 18 to 19 February.  Following my re-election as Taoiseach on 6 May, he telephoned me to express his congratulations.  I said that I would do whatever I could usefully do to help in the run-up to the UK referendum on EU membership on 23 June.  I expect to meet him soon, when our schedules permit.</p> <p> The issue of Ireland&rsquo;s housing and homelessness crisis was not on the agenda of the March European Council.  I did not raise it at the meeting, therefore, nor is it generally the practice of the European Council to discuss domestic issues in the 28 member states.</p> <p> The current draft agenda for the June European Council, as it stands, includes migration; jobs, growth and investment; external relations; and the outcome of the UK referendum, which will have taken place five days earlier.  The last item will feature more or less prominently depending on the result.</p> <p> The European Council will review the situation on migration in all its aspects.  In particular, it will look at the external aspects of migration, assess progress in strengthening EU external borders, and take stock of the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement.</p> <p> On jobs, growth and investment, the European Council will endorse the country-specific recommendations as they stand following Council consideration and conclude the 2016 European semester, assess the first results of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, and draw operational conclusions for its future, endorse an agenda for the implementation of all aspects of the Single Market with a view to exploiting in full its untapped growth and productivity potential, address the issue of economic and monetary union, and take stock of ongoing action to fight tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.</p> <p> On external relations, the European Council is likely to discuss developments in a number of countries.  There may well also be an exchange on EU-NATO co-operation in advance of the NATO summit in Warsaw in July.  I will, as usual, make statements to the House both before and after the meeting.</p></reply>

There are a lot of issues involved.  We must be fair to everybody.  I am open to the approach outlined but the discussion could become very general.</p>  <p>  One of the defining challenges of our time across Europe is the growth of populist extremism.  The ideals of free democracies are under attack and democracy generally is under very significant attack across the globe.  Democracies are under attack in Europe in particular.  The defeat of the far right candidate in the Austrian election is extremely welcome but it went far too close.  The European Union is flawed and it often fails to apply its own founding principles.  Those who spend their time attacking it for that reason ignore the much worse, more extensive and more aggressive policies of other countries.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that he will oppose any efforts to soften the European Union's position in defence of Ukrainian sovereignty and also if he will support increased support for civil society and human rights organisations operating in countries bordering the European Union, many of whom are under a lot of pressure?</p>  <p>  I welcome one development in recent years, namely, the European Endowment for Democracy which supports democracy and human rights activists in many countries.  Unfortunately, Ireland is not a contributor to the fund and in a recent vote in the European Parliament Irish Members of the main far left group either opposed or refused to support the fund.  Will the Taoiseach agree to reconsider Irish funding for the European Endowment for Democracy?</p>  <p>  Discussions on the restructuring of Greece's debts are still ongoing with the European Union.  There is no doubt whatsoever that Greece needs a significant improvement in terms of its debt, in both the duration and cost of the debt.  Given how much Ireland has benefited from previous deals negotiated between the European Union and Greece, will the Taoiseach confirm that Ireland is supportive of Greece and is not just blindly following the damaging hardline stance of some of the other countries?</p>  <p>  I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's comments on Turkey.  Question No. 2 relates to the replacement of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu and a clear change in both culture and behaviour within the Turkish political world.  When we discussed the outcome of recent summits, I said the deal with Turkey, in particular relating to the migrant crisis, is not one of which we can be proud, and it is not one we can be confident will stay in place.  The Taoiseach referred to recent developments.  In recent days there has been a dramatic disimprovement in the political situation with a move to prosecute the majority of opposition MPs, thereby giving the ruling party a majority big enough to change the constitution.  Many of the alleged crimes involve so-called "giving offence to the President".  This is a final move effectively to criminalise dissent.  We must end the pretence that this is behaviour compatible in any way with democratic practices or that it is acceptable for a candidate country.  I want the Taoiseach to call this in a very direct and straight way.  He said in his reply that it remains to be seen what will happen.  It is quite obvious what is happening in Turkey and that has been the case for some time.  There has been a move away from the democratic norms and values that the European Union has always said had to underpin any relationship with Turkey, and in particular in terms of visa liberalisation to the Schengen area and also in terms of opening a negotiating chapter pertaining to Turkey's application for European Union membership.  The European Union negotiated at a very weak moment for the Union in terms of its incapacity to deal with the migration crisis.  As the Taoiseach said in his reply, the European Union is now dealing with a regime that has a lot of questions to answer in terms of the very basic issues pertaining to human rights, the freedom of the media and the rule of law.  What is the European Union going to do about it and, more important, what is the Government's position on developments within Turkey and, in particular, on the recently negotiated deal with Turkey?</p>  <p>  In terms of the migrant crisis, the stories emanating from Calais are appalling.  It is an absolute scandal the condition in which thousands of people are living in the Port of Calais alone, notwithstanding the wider issue of migrants coming across Europe.</p><p>In the Irish context, the Taoiseach stated we had accepted or agreed to take 4,000 people.  He should correct me if I am wrong and might clarify this point again but he stated that only ten people have arrived.</p></speech>

Is it the position that approximately 200 had arrived prior to that?  Yet the Taoiseach stated we are on target for the figure of 4,000 people.  He might outline to me whether somewhere within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Justice and Equality or wherever there is an actual timetable or programme putting flesh on the bones of the language, the rhetoric and the commitments that get articulated consistently.</p></speech>

The International Organization for Migration, IOM, estimates that between the beginning of 2016 and 25 April, a total of 196,325 emigrants and refugees have arrived in Europe, mostly by sea.  This is a huge number of people who have landed in Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Spain.  During the same period, 1,359 people died or were lost at sea.  That number is the size of the population of an average small town and the IOM estimates that, last year, more than 1 million people arrived.  One core response to this humanitarian crisis has been the EU-Turkey agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear and has criticised this agreement.  It is against and has spoken out against this agreement and I have raised it here many times with the Taoiseach since it was brought into being.  Turkey is a country with a deplorable human rights record and a history of discriminating against minorities.  As it is clear that Turkey is not a safe country of origin, the European Union should not be deporting vulnerable people to that place.  Human Rights Watch has stated the deportations that already have occurred were rushed, chaotic and violated the rights of those deported.  Oxfam has accused the EU of trading human beings for political concessions.  Here is the rub.  The Government went along with this measure.  This is not something distant that is happening away over there; the Government agreed to it.</p><p>The Government announced the plan to take in 4,000 refugees and Sinn F&eacute;in supported this measure.  However, only a handful of people, a family of ten, have been relocated in this State under this scheme with 31 people expected to arrive in the coming weeks.  In the North, as part of our involvement in the British Government's vulnerable persons relocation scheme, 108 people have been relocated.  While I do not wish to compare these two states on the island, there is a disparity.  It is not good enough in that 51 people came last December, while 75 arrived in the Six Counties at the end of April.  There are more to come and arrangements have been made for the next group to arrive in the coming months.  However, the response of the State and the EU in the face of this major appalling human tragedy has been disgraceful.  Given our history and our memory of coffin ships and of forced exile, the Government's response is shameful.  It is much like the ongoing treatment of citizens in direct provision across the State.  These men, women and children are fleeing devastating war and oppression to get asylum in the EU and yet, with smiles and handshakes, the EU has decided that vast numbers of them will be sent back to Turkey.  The Government should demand that the EU agreement with Turkey be suspended.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do this.  We should continue to press for real support for the humanitarian work that is being carried out in refugee camps.  We also should increase urgently the relocation of refugees here and should continue the work for humanitarian solutions.  The people, the ordinary citizens, are much further ahead than the Government in this regard as there have been 800 pledges to the Irish Red Cross to house incoming refugees.  More than 60% of these were offers to share accommodation, while 30% offered vacant houses and apartments.</p><p>I will conclude by noting that another consequence of the EU's deal with Turkey is that people are starting once again to attempt to cross from Libya to Italy, which is a much more dangerous sea journey than is the journey from Turkey to Greece.  Members should think about how in this month alone the United Nations has estimated that 500 people have drowned.  That is going on and tomorrow it will be more, while the day after that it will be more again.  I welcome the work of the Irish naval vessels and commend the men and women who work these vessels.  They are a credit to the service and I welcome in particular the deployment of the <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>, which was sent there at the beginning of May.  On 16 May, its crew rescued 365 people who were in difficulties, which is wonderful work.  However, I warn that we should have no part in the military actions that are being contemplated, such as the destruction of boats.  No such action should be part of our remit and instead we should do what these men and women have done so well, namely, to save people on these difficult and dangerous journeys.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise these concerns, which are shared by many other Members of the D&aacute;il and within the EU itself.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to demand that the EU agreement with Turkey be suspended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500008#F00700"><p>I also wish to raise what I believe to be the utterly shameful approach of the European Union when it comes to dealing with migrants attempting to get into the European Union.  Since the year 2000, some 22,000 people have died while attempting to get into Europe and that number has escalated dramatically.  The blood of those innocent people is on the hands of European Union and every single leader, including the Taoiseach, in so far as they have co-operated in developing the policy of fortress Europe, the most shameful example of which is the EU-Turkey agreement.  To be absolutely clear about this agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights states that "Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited".  There is no equivocation; it is prohibited but the Taoiseach and other European leaders have signed an agreement that states that "All new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands as of 20 March 2016 will be returned to Turkey".  Ireland has signed an agreement that commits explicitly to the collective expulsion of aliens, which is counter to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Consequently, we are engaging in what is, in human rights terms, illegal action that from a moral point of view is shameful and murderous.  There simply is no other way to describe it and this situation is getting worse.  All the measures, including Operation Triton despite the humanitarian gloss put on it, are about push-back.  The policy now is one of push-back, that is, preventing them from getting in and the Taoiseach stated as much in his opening comments when he spoke of stemming the flow of migration.</p><p>That is the policy now - push them back and if they drown, tough luck.  They are drowning in huge numbers.  The more Europe ramps up its border controls, which it is doing, the more people will die.</p> <p> What is particularly hypocritical about all this is that the number of people who are trying to cross in this manner represents a tiny proportion of the number of so-called illegals in Europe.  I think the term "illegals" is shameful because, in my opinion, no human being is illegal.  However, in so far as one defines illegality when it comes to human beings, the vast majority of so-called illegals are people who arrive on planes with work visas.  When their work visas run out, they become technically illegal.  Their numbers dwarf the number of people who are trying to cross from desperate situations in Syria and north Africa, yet all the focus is on them.</p> <p> Deputy Adams mentioned the numbers that have come in as 190,000.  Some 110,000 people came into this country alone in 2007, which was almost as many as the so-called flood trying to get into Europe.  It is not a flood.  The crisis is created by the EU's push-back fortress policy.  The numbers are absolutely tiny but political cynicism and self-interest are killing those immigrants.  It has to stop.  The EU-Turkey deal is utterly shameful in that regard.  We should demand that the deal be suspended and abandoned, particularly given the utterly shameful human rights record of Turkey in the treatment of its own population.  </p> <p> Did the Taoiseach raise the housing and homelessness emergency with his EU counterparts?  In what has to be the supreme exercise in irony and hypocrisy, the EU Commission staff working document recently criticised the Government here for failing to invest sufficiently in infrastructure.  That is unbelievable seeing as it was the same troika that demanded and insisted on savaging the capital investment programme as part of the EU-IMF bailout.  Nonetheless, they do point to the fact that despite the Government's claim that it is going to do something about housing, the capital investment programme this year will be less than next year's.  With all the talk from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis, he is still using the same figures in terms of the direct provision of council housing as his predecessor, Deputy Kelly.  There is no change. </p> <p> Will the Taoiseach take the advice of the Housing Finance Agency which said that we need to significantly ramp up the level of investment in housing?  If that requires increasing our debt or deficit we need to go to the European Union and say that it is right, that we have an infrastructural deficit, specifically in housing, and we want the fiscal rules suspended, or with flexibility in them, so that we can borrow the necessary money to develop a housing programme that will deal with what is an emergency.  Is the Taoiseach making that argument with the European Union about our need for a dramatic ramping up of investment in social housing?</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his intervention.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin that the growth of populism has created significant challenges for democracy in all its forms in many countries.  I see that reflected in the arguments around the European Council table.  We will strongly defend the right of Ukraine to its sovereignty and have done so at every opportunity.  We will equally support and stand by the sovereignty claims of neighbouring countries.  Many of these, as Deputy Martin is aware, are under pressure for a variety of reasons, particularly since the annexation of Crimea by President Putin.  </p>  <p>  I will look at the question of the endowment for democracy.  I am not sure of the reasons for the decision that was made here.  Ireland is and will continue to be very supportive of Greece.  I have spoken with the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, on every occasion at the European Council meetings.  Obviously we have come through a pretty torrid time ourselves.  I am glad that an agreement was reached at the ECOFIN meeting in respect of Greece.  The Greek people face a challenge for the next 20 years, but at least they are now beginning to move in the right direction and pay their way.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned human rights in Turkey.  It has been raised by me and other leaders at the European Council meeting in the presence of the former Turkish Prime Minister when he attended that Council.  The central point of the argument was that the core of this problem is in Syria with the Assad regime.  As a result of that and the war that is going on there, we have had this massive disruption into southern Lebanon, Turkey and across the Mediterranean.  That is the cause of it all.  When one considers the different forces globally, Russia and Iran are supportive of the Assad regime, while the United States and Europe support the opposition.  The difficulty is compounded when leaders say that 200,000 people have arrived on their shores in a short time and want to move through to Germany.  </p>  <p>  The main intention of all those people was to move to Germany.  As has been pointed out, many of them are professionals moving with their families across different countries.  I understand that 10,000 children have gone missing.  What is happening in Calais is appalling.  We are not part of the Schengen area, though we voluntarily made our contribution both for resettlement and relocation.  They set up the so-called hot spots in Greece and Italy, but when people arrived there they tended to leave immediately with the intention of getting to Germany.  That is one of the reasons only a very small number of people were able to be approved to come here.  I will get the figures as to where we are on that schedule.  As regards the difference between resettlement and relocation, and the 4,000 we said we would take, I will provide Deputies with more accurate information in that respect.</p>  <p>  The real argument at the European Council was because of the endless flood of people coming from Turkey, in particular, due to its proximity to Greece.  Be they from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria or elsewhere, these people have paid large amounts of money to get on inflatable rafts.  It is fine until one hears the Prime Minister saying that they are loaded onto these boats and as soon as they are out on the sea and the first ship appears, in many cases the inflatables are knifed and sunk so they end up in the water and have to be rescued.  That is why there is a NATO operation under way off Turkey.  It has been successful to an extent but not in the way it should be.  </p>  <p>  The reason for the European deal with Turkey in the first place was because they wanted to focus on dealing with people smugglers.</p><p>One can deal with them in an effective way by patrolling offshore while being able to return people entering Europe illegally to where they came from, whereas others who have arrived in Turkey and are based in camps but who wish to be relocated to a European country have whatever the categorisation might be to say they want to be legitimately recognised as refugees or asylum seekers and they want to live and go to Europe.  Those who have paid money to people smugglers and are sent across the short distance to the Greek islands do not have the same intent, whether they are in a camp in Turkey or wherever.<br/><br/>When the Turks came with their requirements for acceleration of the accession agreement, liberalisation of visas and a further &euro;3 billion by the end of 2017, the money being paid by the EU was to go towards the provision of school, health, maternity and other facilities in the camps.  That expenditure was to be supervised by the EU.  In other words, it is not the case that a cheque has been paid into the Turkish exchequer, with everybody just leaving it at that.<br/><br/>Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about the agreement in the context of the European Court of Human Rights.  People were conscious of eliminating people smuggling, which is difficult to do.  The vast majority of refugees intend to get to Germany.  Chancellor Merkel made it perfectly clear that she wanted to accommodate as many as possible in Germany, but they had to go through other countries to get there.  When Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n put up the first fence in Hungary and others followed, with difficulties arising because of the sheer weight of numbers coming through Austria, this exemplified the point made by the Deputy about populism on the right wing in respect of the numbers of migrants.  In 1939, when the Sudetenland was invaded, one ship with 800 or 900 refugees was sent to the US and turned back.  Another was sent to Turkey and most of those on board drowned.  The position here is appalling, but the central feature is the war in Syria.  The vast majority of Syrian people who have been interviewed would love to go back to their own country.  They are educated, intelligent, sophisticated people and they want to live their lives normally, but the bombing patterns by the opposition and so on have destroyed much of the country.<br/><br/>There will be no military action in respect of the <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>.  I have been clear on this.  The Naval Service works in tandem with the Italian authorities and the function of the men and women on the ship is purely humanitarian - search and rescue.  They follow in the wake of the other ships, which have rescued more than 8,000 people.<br/><br/>The Deputy is correct in respect of the numbers who have drowned.  Many of them paid big money on the basis of trusting people that they would be brought to Europe for a better life, and that, obviously, did not turn out to be the case.  Until the root cause of all this is addressed, there will not be a sense of permanent peace.  I understand a couple of hundred thousand people on the shores of Libya want to cross into Europe as well but there is no plan at all for them.  Many of them have travelled from Mali, Somalia and Eritrea up through the Horn of Africa.  The Deputy referred to the 110,000 refugees who came to Ireland in 2007.  Many of them were from EU member states and were entitled to come here under the freedom of movement principle, while some came from countries outside the Union.<br/><br/>The agreement between the Union and Turkey will not be suspended.  It was carefully considered from a legal point of view as not being in contravention of the ECHR, to which the Deputy referred, because there are people on the Turkish mainland who have been there for quite a while and they want to legitimately seek their right to come to Europe, whereas others being sent across the short distance to the Greek islands were loaded onto boats by people smugglers and told they were out of there.  While others have a longer term ambition of coming to Europe, the reason the agreement came about in the first place was to eliminate the so-called business model of people taking big money to smuggle refugees into Europe.<br/><br/>I referred earlier to the fact that issues of great importance domestically are not generally raised at Council meetings and, for that reason, the housing crisis here was not the subject of discussion formally at a meeting.  However, the Deputy can take it that we have set up the Cabinet sub-committee.  We have had two meetings and next week we will have a presentation from the Departments of Finance, to be followed by the Departments of Social Protection, Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We will have a comprehensive strategy with the facilities provided in law and through whatever are the requirements for the Minister for housing, planning and local government to deal with this.  Supply is the key.  I note the Deputy's point about the capital programme.  It is extensive, covering many years, and will cost &euro;42 billion, &euro;27 billion of which will be provided by the State, with a review in 2017-18.  The Government's greatest priority is to deal with the housing crisis.  It is not satisfactory in many forms.  Other member states have national problems that they would like to discuss at Council meetings as well but, generally, the agenda is focused on a more European level.  We will deal with the issue here and report to the House on the progress we are making.</p></speech>

To do this, opposing parliamentarians are being taken out to facilitate the vote.  The country is moving in an unsatisfactory direction, which raises serious questions for the EU and for our country in terms of our approach to this and with regard to freedom of the media, the rule of law and the application of human rights in that jurisdiction, particularly in the context of its citizens enjoying greater visa liberalisation with Schengen area countries and the country's application to the EU and the opening of negotiations on various chapters relating to accession.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned that 10,000 children have gone missing.  Is that in Calais alone or generally?</p></speech>

I was moved by a brilliant article written by two Norwegian journalists, which won the top journalism award in Norway, entitled "The Wetsuitman".  It relates to human remains in wetsuits found on two beaches in Norway and the Netherlands.  It is a riveting article that traces the details of what happened both individuals.  They were young people who left normal, average families in Syria because of the war, persecution and so on.  They travelled all the way to Calais, where they purchased wetsuits in a local shop in the misguided belief that they could swim the English Channel.  It is a sad story.  Those who have different views on migration and what motivates migrants, particularly the fearmongerers, should read the article to get some understanding and feel for the complexity of what is afoot and the terrible human tragedy resulting from the war in Syria, which has given rise to the greatest refugee crisis we have experienced since the Second World War.  A dramatic upscaling of effort by European leaders is needed.  The situation that currently pertains in places such as Calais should not be acceptable in the EU in terms of our basic commitment to human rights and to humanity.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that others would like to contribute and, therefore, I will leave it at that.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could forward the figures and schedule I asked for earlier.</p></speech>

I reject his assertion that the deal between the EU and Turkey will not be suspended.  That may be the case but I ask him to demand that it be suspended.  I want to make it clear that he is not acting in my name when he agrees to a deal that has seen 500 people drown this month as a consequence.  Will the Taoiseach be a dissenting voice - even if it is a lone voice - against this human and humanitarian crisis, which is not happening by accident?  It is happening by dint of policy.</p></speech>

About 50 staff attended the meeting.  They have an average of at least 20 years dedicated service with the CRC.  A total of 50 long-serving staff are on the old private pension plan as well.  These are HSE-sanctioned posts and their salaries are funded by the HSE.  I know that when the Minister for Social Protection was appointed, he made very strong statements about pension provision.  Will the Government intervene in this situation and, in particular, liaise with the officials in the HSE and the Department of Social Protection in order for them to directly intervene to assist staff in the CRC?  An immediate decision was taken by management to wind up the pension scheme and it illustrates the vulnerability of many people in respect of many pension schemes.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment in a programme for a partnership Government to review the existing proceeds of crime legislation.  It states that the Government will ensure that adequate resources are provided to support the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and that it will examine how communities can better engage with CAB on suspected local use of the proceeds of crime and the potential establishment of a smaller criminal assets bureau to target regional assets.  That kind of language in a programme for Government can be interpreted in many ways.  I suspect that Independents or people from various constituencies suggested that this should happen.  It is a demand from many of the communities at the coal face of the drug trade and the crime lords who are ruling the roost.  Their view is that mini criminal assets bureaus would have a huge impact.  Is this a commitment to establish criminal assets bureaus in communities to target local drug pushers or is it language that means nothing will happen because it could be interpreted that way as well?  Could the Taoiseach clarify when that legislation will be reviewed and when we can expect the review and actions emanating from it?  </p>  <p>  The Government announced proposals for the reform of the budget process.  At the end of the statement from the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, it says that the Ministers will make themselves available to the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny to discuss the proposals.  The first meeting of the committee is expected to take place in the coming days.  Our Whip contacted the office of the Chief Whip to be told that this is not imminent and that it all is part of the D&aacute;il reform programme.  </p>  <p>  We were hopeful that the Government would have learned the lessons of indulging in spin over substance or taking elements of the D&aacute;il reform package negotiated by all parties, repackaging it and spinning it as a Government commitment or decision on D&aacute;il reform.  The Government needs to cease this practice fairly quickly.  Can the Taoiseach clarify the position with regard to this committee in respect of budgetary scrutiny?  The statement says a meeting will be held in the coming days but to the best of my knowledge, nobody is clear about that, at least from our side in terms of being notified of it.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House when the legislative programme for this session will be finalised and made available?  </p></speech>

There will be far more involvement from all Members of the House and far more opportunity for them to make their cases.  The first thing is to set up a budgetary scoping committee.

T&aacute; tr&iacute; cheist agam faoi chl&aacute;r an Rialtais.  T&aacute; ceann amh&aacute;in faoi thuairisc McMahon, ceann eile faoi chearta mhuintir na Palaist&iacute;ne agus an ceann deireanach faoi chearta an lucht oibre.  I put the question about the McMahon report to the T&aacute;naiste last week and did not get any sort of satisfactory answer.  The draft programme for Government contained a commitment to implement the McMahon report into direct provision but it was removed from the programme that was published.  The Taoiseach may recall that Uachtar&aacute;n Higgins raised his concerns last weekend about direct provision.  He described the McMahon proposals as reasonable and practical and said if they were implemented it would mean considerable progress.  Mr. Justice McMahon described the refusal to allow asylum seekers the right to access the labour market as absolutely heart breaking and immoral and he described their treatment by the Government as narrow and mean and urged an amnesty for those who are here for more than five years.  I have visited the direct provision centre in Mosney several times.  No one should live there for months, never mind years, yet some children have lived their entire lives in that place.  Will the Taoiseach consider a one-off amnesty and will he reinstate the commitment on the McMahon report to the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will be aware there will be a strike tomorrow by Tesco workers.  The company is trying to force long-serving workers to accept a new contract with less money and worse conditions of employment.  Will he acknowledge that the programme for Government fails to defend the rights of workers and their families and will only assist unscrupulous employers that want to make bigger profits?  There is no mention of a living wage.  There is a vague commitment to tackling the problems caused by the casualisation of work but nothing about "if and when" contracts.  Will he consider introducing fair hours legislation as recommended by the ICTU?</p>  <p>  There is a programme for Government commitment to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict but in December 2014 the Oireachtas voted in support of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.  That was a substantial and very positive development.  It was unconditional because people either have this right or they do not and this Oireachtas believes that the people of Palestine quite rightly have that right.  The peace process has been very limited and there has been no real progress.  The UN has reported the killing of 25 Palestinian children in the last three months of 2015.  By the end of December 2015, 422 Palestinian children were imprisoned and since October 2015, 204 Palestinians and 28 Israelis have been killed.  We can assist the process and the minority Government can accept the will of the Oireachtas by formally recognising the Palestinian state by doing what many other Governments have done, by upgrading the Palestinian mission in this State and add our moral support to the need for a peace settlement in that region.  </p></speech>

The Minister outlined his road map in that regard.  I note the point Deputy Adams makes about the McMahon report.  I do not want to get into any conflict here, either with Deputy Adams or anybody else, but I have appointed a Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, to deal with immigration, migration and the question of direct provision.  Just because it is not mentioned in the programme for Government does not mean the Government does not have every intention to follow through on it because it has.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality will deal with this.  It is a case of understanding that the programme for Government contains 600 to 700 commitments and, obviously, one could put another 1,000 along with that if one wanted to.  We are committed to the implementation of the McMahon report.</p></speech>

I understand the talks at the Workplace Relations Commission aimed at resolving that dispute adjourned on 19 May after 14 hours without agreement.  More discussions took place between Tesco and Mandate in the Workplace Relations Commission on 23 May into the morning of 24 May.  I am informed that those discussions adjourned without agreement so that both parties could go away and consider the position.  I implore both parties to return to the WRC to resume talks before this escalates any further.  I heard some comment on it this morning.  I hope it will be taken up and that they will both return to the Workplace Relations Commission to sort this out.  Obviously the pay claim by Mandate and SIPTU was brought to the Labour Court in early 2016, so the facilities are there.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will be challenged by his requirement to deal with a whole range of challenging areas including the McMahon report.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton is present.  The Taoiseach makes light of the fact it is not in the programme for Government because not everything can be.  The issue is that it was in the draft programme for Government and was dropped.  Why was it dropped?  Does it indicate that the 173 recommendations of Mr. Justice McMahon, which are really important, will be implemented or are to be reviewed or modified?  As the Taoiseach knows, each Government Department takes the programme for Government as its working bible.  If it is not in there, it is not part of the working bible.  Is the report and its 173 recommendations to be implemented in full or reviewed?</p><p>In the new programme the Government has decided to abandon the previous Government's policy of developing new technological universities through the amalgamation of existing institutes of technology.  The mandatory mergers are now to be reviewed.  That has caused grave disquiet in the south east.  The amalgamation of Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology is, as the Taoiseach knows, finally being advanced after many speed bumps.  Will the Taoiseach give clarity to both institutions today that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the establishment of a technological university in the south east, as the previous Government envisaged, based on the amalgamation of Waterford and Carlow Institutes of Technology?</p></speech>

We commissioned the former justice to produce that report.  It is all about people, and some of them have been in the direct provision system, as the Deputy is aware, for 15 years.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, chaired the justice committee, he reported extensively on that over a period.  He is very well acquainted with the report and I expect it will be a central feature of his work.</p>  <p>  In respect of the establishment of a technological university in the south east, this was one of the first decisions the previous Government, of which the Deputy was an esteemed member, made following the closure of TalkTalk.  There were quite a number of difficulties along that road.  The Government is fully committed, as the previous Government was, to the establishment of a technological university for the south east.  I am glad that at long last, after all the difficulties, Waterford and Carlow are getting their act together to establish a technological university with the standards that apply there.  There are other technological institutions in the country that do not want to amalgamate with other institutions and instead want to proceed as technological institutes on the basis of the individual entities.</p></speech>

When they need help to get out of bed they need it immediately; it cannot be delayed.  The programme for Government provides that a review of the operation and funding of national home help services is to be undertaken.  I ask that this be dealt with urgently.</p>  <p>  Operations and serious medical interventions and procedures are being delayed at Cork University Hospital and Mercy University Hospital in Cork due to a lack of beds.  Surgeons are ready and waiting to undertake operations but they do not have beds available for patients after their operations.  I ask that these two matters be dealt with urgently.</p></speech>

They are often related, depending on the nature of the application, in terms of what is the best package for each individual person.  I do not see why those applications cannot be followed through speedily.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, in many cases the people do not have much time left and they deserve to have the best facilities made available to them as quickly as possible.  I will take up the issue with the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The number of cancellations is a small percentage of the number of operations carried out.

First, under the section dealing with the tobacco and alcohol control unit, which, bizarrely, has responsibility for issues in respect of abortion, has the Taoiseach any plans to bring forward legislation to facilitate a referendum on appealing the eighth amendment?  Second, with regard to the same section, what is the status of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which I understand is delaying the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes?</p></speech>

It does not allow for trade union recognition.  It is a form of yellow-pack collective bargaining.  To mention the Tesco dispute, about which the Taoiseach responded earlier, one of the problems the Mandate trade union officials have is that they are denied the right to access any of the shops which would allow them go in, negotiate and deal with the workers.  That is no way to ensure we have proper workers' rights.  We want proper right of access for qualified trade union officials who have a job to do in representing their members in the workplace.  That will only happen if we strengthen workers' rights, as Deputy Adams said earlier, and if we amend the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to allow for the right to access, the strengthening of collective bargaining provisions and trade union recognition.  Is that the Taoiseach's intention?</p></speech>

It was a car similar to that used in the gangland crimes committed in Dublin.  That was disgusting and scandalous, and it should be investigated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Putting garda&iacute; in that position when trying to evict a person from a family home is not appropriate.</p></speech>

I welcome the representatives of Justice for the Forgotten who are here as visitors today.  I commend them on their tireless efforts in seeking truth and justice for the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The date Tuesday, 17 May marked the forty-second anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombing.  Some 42 long years have passed for families affected by this atrocity.  There were 34 lives lost and a further 300 injured, the highest number of casualties on any single day during the Troubles, with lives blown apart and shattered on that terrible Friday evening.  I express again on behalf of the Government our condolences to all of the families of those who were killed and to those injured in these bombings.  I know the people directly caught in these tragic events and their families have had to bear great personal loss and grief over that time.  Despite the passage of time, I know the resulting pain and suffering remains with them to this day.  They still mourn loved ones, they still bear the scars of injuries sustained and they still quest to know what happened.</p><p>I was honoured and privileged to speak at the fortieth anniversary of the bombings in Talbot Street in 2014, when I assured those present that those they loved and who died on that day will never be forgotten.  We will do all we can to make sure they will have the justice that is their right and that their loved ones so rightly demand for them.  I remain committed to helping the families get to the truth behind what happened on that terrible day.  Today's motion reaffirms the shared will and determination of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il to secure progress on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  It also renews the all-party mandate from the House to the Government to actively pursue the matter with the British Government and to seek the implementation of the 2008 and 2011 all-party motions.  The Government is strongly committed to doing that and this is reflected in the new programme for Government.</p><p>I also acknowledge the work of the Barron inquiry, the Oireachtas joint sub-committee that examined the Barron report and the work of the commission of investigation under Mr. Patrick</p><p>McEntee, SC.  Over the years, each inquiry has revealed more and progressed our understanding of what happened and brought us to the important point now where there is strong all-party consensus on what needs to be done to establish the full record.  I have raised the Dublin-Monaghan bombings with British Prime Minister Cameron on a number of occasions.  In doing so, I have emphasised the Government's continued support for the motions of this House, calling for access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also continues to raise the issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p><p>I met a number of the families and survivors of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings in Government Buildings in July 2013 and heard at first hand how their lives have been affected by the bombing.  I have been deeply moved by their stories and the impact of these awful events on so many people who had simply been going about their normal business on that day.  I met Ms Margaret Urwin of Justice for the Forgotten, who I commend on her activities, last year when we had some further discussions on the lack of response of the British Government to our repeated requests on this issue.</p><p>This is the third all-party motion on the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings and follows those of 2008 and 2011, which call on the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  In July 2008, all political parties co-operated to ensure the passage of an all-party motion endorsing the Barron reports.  The motion calls on the British Government to release all original documents.  A further all-party motion was agreed in May 2011.  This endorsed the 2008 motion and again requested the Irish Government to continue to raise the matter with the British Government.  The Government has worked consistently to implement the previous all-party motions.  The full efforts and engagement of the new Government will be devoted to seeking and supporting conditions that would realise the implementation of the D&aacute;il motions at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents related to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings would bring substantial progress to the investigation of the atrocity so far.  It would give the families of victims and the survivors the surety at least of transparency and full disclosure.  Without that, those affected understandably cannot come to terms with the suffering inflicted on them.  I firmly believe that cases, such as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.  Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations with the UK and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have consistently raised with the British Government the obligation to ensure effective investigations of such cases, including in instances of alleged collusion.  Many families continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  That is why addressing the needs of the victims and survivors is at the core of the Government's</p><p>approach to dealing with the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland.  The establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority reflected in the programme for Government.</p><p>The Government believes that the legacy institutions agreed under the Stormont House Agreement offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families impacted by the Troubles.  While significant progress was made, final agreement could not be reached on legacy issues in the talks that led to the Fresh Start agreement last November.  The Government is committed to building on the progress that was achieved in those talks to establish the new institutional framework on the past.  Over the past number of months, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his officials have met with a range of victims' groups from across the affected communities, to hear their perspectives on how best to progress the establishment of the legacy institutions and to listen to their views on possible solutions to outstanding issues, including the issue of onward disclosure and national security.  These consultations proved valuable and will inform the Government's approach in seeking an agreement on addressing the legacy issues.  We are hopeful that a way forward can be found to establish these bodies in the near future.</p> <p> Following the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is working on behalf of the Government to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.  On a visit to Belfast last week, and in Derry today, the Minister is holding discussions about the possible route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  I understand that he will be engaging further with the new Executive in Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on this vitally important issue.  The Government acknowledges the suffering endured by those whose loved ones were killed or injured as a result of the Troubles, and recognises that there are many people suffering who feel they have been forgotten by society and forgotten by the authorities in the midst of all the violence and suffering.</p> <p> To all those who lost loved ones or who are suffering as a result of the violence of the Troubles, I want to put on record that this Government hears them and is determined to achieve progress on the establishment of the institutions for dealing with the legacy of the past.  I assure everybody that this Government is committed to continuing its role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to supporting the consolidation of peace in Northern Ireland, and to ensuring that we never return to the days of violence.  We will continue to support and sustain a lasting peace on this island and will work hard to find an agreement on establishment of institutions for dealing with the legacy of the past, for the benefit of victims and survivors and for society as a whole.  That is why we were able with some difficulty to send up files that were held here by the Garda to the coroner's inquest into the Kingsmill massacre.  Whether or not they will add greatly to the stock of information about what actually happened there, it is symbolic of our willingness to co-operate in providing that information to the coroner in Belfast.</p> <p> If Stormont is to work in practice as it is supposed to work in theory, the files that are held by the British establishment in respect of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings should be made available.  That is where the urgency is in respect of setting up those institutions dealing with the legacy of the past.  That was the understanding when we discussed these matters in Belfast.  Reaching that agreement would also help us to honour the lives of the 33 people who were killed so tragically in Dublin and in Monaghan 42 years ago.  Today's motion makes clear the shared and undiminished will on all sides of this House to seek and establish the full truth of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  It is a positive statement and a positive signal to the British Government.  We will convey this message to the British Government faithfully and seek full implementation of the motion.  We believe that a shared understanding can be reached with the British Government on this, as we have found together on many other issues that stem from the Troubles, in support of genuine and deepening reconciliation on this island, North and South.  We will continue to work tirelessly to that end.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to support this motion, which draws on previous all-party motions in July 2008 and May 2011.  I extend my gratitude to the ongoing work of Justice for the Forgotten in continuing to shine a light on this dark moment in our past.  I can assure those relatives gathered here today in the Gallery or at home that it will not be forgotten here in this House.</p>  <p>  The events of 17 May 1974 occurred against the backdrop of the pitch black horizon of sectarian conflict.  Even in the shadow of the brutal violence that was consuming Northern Ireland, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings were the darkest of hours.  Thirty-four people, including an unborn child, perished as a series of explosions tore through the city centre and Monaghan town.  On an ordinary May evening, with the summer stretching before it, the streets were full of life.  Ordinary workers were making their way home after a long day in the office, pensioners trundled along the way to the shops, parents dragged children in their wake.  These lives were ruthlessly ended in an indiscriminate slaughter.  Entire families were extinguished, lives abruptly taken away or irrevocably changed.  The repercussions of the bombs are still being felt today in silent homes across the country.  The fabric of family life was ripped apart for dozens of households.  Strands of life were cut off for ever.  It was the single bloodiest day of the Troubles which have so deeply scarred this island.</p>  <p>  The bombs erupted in the fraught political context of the Unionist revolt against the Sunningdale Agreement.  As that fragile process was torn asunder by mass strikes, the attacks on our State sent a clear message about the cost of North-South engagement.  It is clear from the evidence that loyalist paramilitaries undertook the bloody deed.  However, the sophistication and co-ordination of the attacks raises serious issues around the potential orchestration of the explosions by elements of British security forces.  The bombs form part of other similar attacks on Dublin, Belturbet, Dundalk, Castleblaney and the savage murder of the Miami Showband during the bleakest period of the conflict.  It is important we acknowledge the men and women impacted by those tragic moments of absolute violence.</p>  <p>  The work of Mr. Justice Hamilton, Mr. Justice Barron and the McEntee Commission have revealed serious concerns regarding the non-co-operation of the British authorities.  This is why the families of those who lost their lives demand and deserve full disclosure by the British Government on the issue.  It is an issue that Fianna F&aacute;il has continually raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, on her visits here.  It is important that this motion keeps the issue alive for all parties in this House.  The ongoing refusal of Prime Minister Cameron to release the relevant documents is a fundamental barrier to achieving real closure.  How long do we have to wait for a meaningful response from the British Prime Minister on the issue?  It cannot just be about conveying messages to the British Prime Minister and then feeling that we have done our duty.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise this in his next meeting with the British Prime Minister.  He should not do this just in a formal manner, but should seek some concrete response to the unanimous views of this House and the need to get a resolution to this, and then report back to us on the actual response of the British Prime Minister to the request to release those documents and files and to facilitate access for an international person of repute.  There are a number of outstanding issues on the British-Irish agenda that have been there for quite a number of years and are not getting advanced in any meaningful way.  Some new initiative and momentum is needed to break the logjam on this and on other issues and to get some concrete response from the British Prime Minister, rather than the stonewalling we have experienced to date.</p>  <p>  The Troubles claimed some 3,600 lives and destroyed countless more.  The poisonous legacy of violence has seeped deep into the roots of many communities.  It has stunted the growth of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland.  The reach of the past is still pulling at the future.  Today&rsquo;s motion deals with one tragic moment from that turbulent period, but it is one among many.  Only this week we saw the opening of an inquest into the Kingsmill massacre.  On a desolate stretch of road deep in south Armagh, ten workmen were raked with machine gun fire, murdered solely because of their religion.  Their families, too, remember the profound dread of the policeman&rsquo;s visit to tell them of their loved one&rsquo;s death.  The bloody chronicle of the past is littered with such terrible moments.  This is why the failure of the Fresh Start agreement to reach a comprehensive consensus on how to confront legacy issues needs to be addressed. </p><p>The relatives who still struggle with the long aftermath of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings share the same strife with countless others.  All across our island there are individuals and families still wrestling with violent events that irreversibly changed their lives.  What is needed is not simply half the truth or a partisan approach to uncovering a shared past.  A divided approach will only serve to exacerbate old wounds and allow historic grievances to fester and grow.  To move on and stop the corrosive rot of the past, we need a clear mechanism to bring closure.  These things cannot be swept under the political carpet. They will always re-emerge to haunt us.</p> <p> The Eames-Bradley Commission, the Haass talks and the original Stormont House Agreement all came forward with clear proposals to deal with these divisive and painful issues.  Innovative ideas have emerged to date such as the creation of a historical investigations unit to inquire into killings during the Troubles, a commission to enable people to learn privately how their loved ones were killed, and the creation of an oral history archive where experiences of the conflict could be shared.  These measures provide a clear path forward to confront and address the painful inheritance of the Troubles.</p> <p> I am concerned that we risk falling into a divided approach to dealing with the past.  We are mired in a sterile debate where both sides call on the other to come forward while showing no willingness to engage themselves.  We are trapped on a roundabout of selective memories with no exit.  To break that perpetual circle there needs to be a clear route to grapple with the dark days bequeathed by the past.  The Irish Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly should revisit the ideas of Eames-Bradley to come forward with fresh proposals.  We need a renewed focus and energy behind our collective efforts to address the past and build for the future.</p> <p> Today&rsquo;s motion is one aspect of that.  The British Government should take the lead and open up its files to an independent international judicial figure.  As part of a holistic, comprehensive process, the whole truth is needed, not a partial or biased account that fails to recognise the depth and scale of the conflict from all perspectives.  It would be useful to know, and it is a pity that the Taoiseach did not put it on the record in his speech today, where the British Government currently stands in relation to our requests.  I sincerely hope that today&rsquo;s motion marks a step forward and not simply a reiteration of old positions.  This cannot be allowed to fall into tired, rehearsed expressions of sympathy.</p> <p> In the aftermath of today's statements it would be useful if the party leaders met to see what could usefully be done to advance this agenda with the British Government in the weeks and months ahead and to try to facilitate a move forward.  It is important we have these statements annually and agree this motion, but it is equally important that we are seen to make some progress.  If our relationship with the British Government is to stand for anything, a unanimous resolution of the House should be responded to in a meaningful way and the responses to date have not been meaningful or far-reaching enough.  Much more is needed if we are to close this black chapter of history and assuage those for whom the hurt is still all too raw.  The families, friends and communities tragically touched by heinous acts of violence like the Dublin-Monaghan bombings deserve to know, deserve to remember and deserve to move on.  Let us give them the opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

I  welcome the fact that, once again, all parties in the D&aacute;il have agreed to a motion calling on the Government actively to seek the release of information held by the British Government relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the three related Barron reports.  These include the inquiry into the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern, Dundalk in which Jack Rooney and Hugh Watters were killed, and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  I also welcome the commitment in the new programme for Government to pursue the implementation of the D&aacute;il motions calling on the British Government to do what is right.</p><p>However, achieving this will require more than rhetoric.  This Government, like the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, is actually in breach of its obligations, particularly in the case of Seamus Ludlow.  The Ludlow family have been compelled to take legal action to force the Government to act on the Barron recommendations following the failure of two Governments to do this.  The Taoiseach acknowledges the work of the Barron Commission and today he declares that addressing the needs of victims and survivors is at the core of the Government's approach.  Despite this, the Government refuses to act on Mr. Justice Barron's recommendations.</p><p>The Dublin-Monaghan bombings were catastrophic.  Thirty-four citizens died, 27 of them in Dublin and seven in Monaghan.  I extend my solidarity and sympathies to the victims and survivors of all those incidents covered by the Barron commission reports and to all those who lost their lives or who were injured in the course of the conflict.  There can be no hierarchy and every one of them deserves justice and truth.  I especially commend the Justice for the Forgotten campaign, the Pat Finucane Centre and Relatives for Justice on their hard work on behalf of victims, and I welcome the advocacy groups to the House today.  They have our full support.</p><p>  The British state has never been open or honest about the role its intelligence services played in Unionist death squads that engaged in the murder of innocent victims.  However, it is now an accepted matter of fact that collusion was policy and administrative practice.  This was also acknowledged by the sub-committee of the cross-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women's Rights.  Despite this, the British Government has consistently refused to co-operate.  This is not only in respect of murders that occurred in this State but also those that occurred in the North.  This is the 25th anniversary of the murder of Councillor Eddie Fullerton, who was a very good friend of mine.  Again, I express my continued solidarity to his wife, Dinah, and their family.  The British Government refuses to give information, which is in its possession, into the murder of Eddie.  The Irish Government has been remiss in supporting the family in their quest for justice.</p><p>The British Government has also failed to establish the public inquiry, as agreed at Weston Park in 2001, into the murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane.  The British Government is also thwarting efforts by the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland to hold legacy inquests.  This is not just a passive British Government, this is an active policy to thwart efforts to get to the truth.  This needs to be matched with positive outreach by the Irish Government.  The refusal to fund legacy inquests or to fund investigations are all in clear breach of the Government's international human rights obligations.  There are also efforts to block the families' access to files which are held in the public archives.  The Government in London closes them down.</p><p>As a co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish Government must use all of its resources, all of its diplomatic services and its access to scores of international bodies, including the United Nations, to exert pressure on the British Government.  In all honesty, I have no great hope that this motion will have any impact whatsoever on the British Government.  Like those that have occurred before, this debate will be ignored.  However, and I have said this many times to the Taoiseach and to previous taoisigh going back a long time, a consistent strategic engagement by the Government with the British Government and the use of the political media and international opportunities available to it can make a difference.  For example, has the Government made arrangements for an initiative with the media in Britain on the back of this particular motion? Has that even been done? It is time for us to act, as the rhetoric which is often used when we debate these issues implies.  We need action and not just rhetoric.</p></speech>

Their struggle and search for justice has been a long and difficult one for the families involved and this continues to be a case of justice delayed by the latest British Government.  The so-called new relationship with Britain does not appear to extend to transparency and the release of the files on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  This is all part of a pattern, as the British Government remains the singular obstacle to resolving many legacy issues such as the public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane, the killing, as mentioned, of our colleague, Sinn F&eacute;in councillor Eddie Fullerton, and the activities of the so-called Glenanne gang.</p> <p> Tuesday, 17 May 2016 was the 42nd anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and on that day I placed a motion on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il.  I welcome that the Government recognised this initiative and drafted today's motion.  We know that in 2008 and 2011 the D&aacute;il unanimously passed motions on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings calling on the British Government to release any relevant files it held on these attacks and calling on the Irish Government to press the British Government again to comply with this reasonable request.  I believe it is important that this Thirty-second D&aacute;il reiterate and agree again a proactive approach on this issue.</p> <p> We know that the Dublin-Monaghan bombings were carried out by loyalists and British agents with logistical and technical support from British security personnel.  The co-ordinated no-warning bombs were designed to kill and resulted in the highest amount of deaths and casualties of the conflict.  No one - absolutely no one - has ever been brought to justice.  The British Government, for its part, maintains its public position of silence and repeats its worn-out and rehearsed words of denial.  It refuses to release the files and information it has on the attacks that killed 34 innocent people, including an unborn child, and injured and maimed almost 300.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, attended a commemoration ceremony and wreath-laying at the Talbot Street memorial on the 42nd anniversary last week.  I was struck by Alan McBride&rsquo;s speech at this year&rsquo;s commemoration.  Alan lost his wife and father-in-law in the Shankill Road bomb.  His speech was emotional and moving.  He appealed for honesty and dialogue and for truth and justice for all victims of the conflict.</p> <p> This will and does involve uncomfortable conversations, not just with friends or those who have a similar outlook, but with those who are enemies and who may have tried to kill or did kill people's loved ones.  There is an imperative on us all to try to move beyond the hurt, acknowledge our collective failure, make politics work and begin a process of truth and real reconciliation.  The Irish Government has an important part to play in that process.  Up to now, the British Government has shown a complete lack of empathy for the victims and a complete disregard for the mandate of the D&aacute;il and successive Irish Governments by ignoring previous all-party motions.  The British Government has also ignored the calls of An tUachtar&aacute;n Michael D. Higgins. </p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Government included a commitment to actively pursue the implementation of previous motions in its programme for Government.  I believe it will find the full support of all Deputies in this regard, but Sinn F&eacute;in and I will be closely tracking how this Government follows through on actions arising from today's motion.  Every avenue must be explored and every opportunity used.  The Government owes that to the 34 men, women and children that were killed, the hundreds that were injured and the families bereaved in these bombings.  The people sitting in the Gallery today demand and deserve truth and justice.  Let us collectively give them our support and assistance in achieving that in the very near future.</p></speech>

Now, here we are again seeking to speak for the victims and articulate on a cross-party basis and in a manner which speaks for all of the people within the 26 counties that we want to assist the victims and their families in seeking truth.  I worry sometimes when I stand before this House speaking on this issue.  It has taken 42 years of debate, cajoling and efforts on the part of the victims and their families, and I hope we will not let another generation go by before we do finally seek truth on this matter.</p><p>I read a speech by the UK Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, recently.  It was given on 11 February 2016.  In the speech she stated, &quot;The Government fully recognises that it will be much more difficult to achieve our objective of building a genuinely shared future for everyone in Northern Ireland unless and until we can find some way of coming to terms with a divided past.&quot;  She went on to say:</p><blockquote>Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it will be pursued.  Everyone is subject to the rule of law.</blockquote><p>However, it would appear that not everyone is subject to the rule of law.  Why is it that we are still talking about this 42 years later, in an era of supposed transparency, where we are trying to deal with the legacy of the past and have been through two iterations of talks?  I was party to those talks in 2014 and 2015 and it seems to me that there is a hunger among the victims and survivors for simple truth and that the issue of reconciliation and moving on as a society will never be attained fully until such time as truth reigns supreme.  In this era, when Anglo-Irish relations are extremely positive and evolving in a positive sense, I do not see why we cannot facilitate people who want that basic and fundamental right to justice.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Oireachtas sub-committee examination of the Barron report, which dates back to 2004, states:</p><blockquote>(ii) ... in all probability most if not all of the perpetrators came from Northern Ireland. <br /><br />(iii) That in all probability information which identifies and which concerns the perpetrators still exists in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.<br /><br />(iv) That in all probability most of the information touching on collusion in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is in Northern Ireland and/or in Great Britain.</blockquote><p>They are three very pertinent points and I do not think the situation has changed between 2004 and 2016 in that regard.</p><p>I know that successive Governments have raised this issue with successive British Governments and I know, having served as Minister for North-South co-operation, that this has been raised very recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan.  I also know, to be fair to the Minister, that he constantly raises this very specific issue, among others, with the Secretary of State.</p><p>I believe strongly that this is a worthy motion.  Diplomacy is very effective, whether it is economic or political diplomacy.  It is important that this House send a message to the British Government on behalf of the Irish people, which is that we will continue to press for justice and truth and that we will allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession pertaining to these bombings.</p><p>These issues need to be tackled if we are to fulfil better relations from an Anglo-Irish and North-South perspective.  I believe strongly that this motion is worthy of support on a cross-party basis.</p> <p> I am keen to acknowledge the work of Justice for the Forgotten.  I know those involved are in constant contact with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I wish to acknowledge their role as one of many organisations in the Six Counties that continue to advocate for victims.  The legacy issues were not dealt with sufficiently in the last iteration of the Stormont talks.  There is an important role for this House to play now on a cross-party basis.  We must ensure that we continue to press for the legacy issues to be dealt with.  Society, North and South, will not fully move on until these issues are dealt with.  We have a duty of care to people within the Six Counties to continue to press these issues with the British Government.</p></speech>

I welcome the relatives of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to the Gallery today.  I wish to express the support of the Socialist Party and the Anti-Austerity Alliance for the relatives in their ongoing attempts to get answers and justice for their loved ones, who were killed so many years ago, as well as for victims of all the other atrocities carried out during the course of the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The bombings in Dublin city and Monaghan town on Friday, 17 May 1974 were absolutely barbaric.  They were designed to kill and seriously injure as many innocent civilians as possible.  The events of that day resulted in the biggest loss of life in the Troubles.  The families of the victims and the Justice for the Forgotten group are to be commended on their ongoing work in seeking justice and answers to what took place on that day as well as the other terrorist attacks in the period.  These included the Dublin bombings in December 1972 and January 1973, the atrocity in Belturbet in December 1972, the atrocity in Dundalk in December 1975, the atrocity in Castleblayney in March 1976 and the killing of the Miami Showband in July 1975 as well as many other deaths that took place at the time.</p>  <p>  The families never got a proper Garda or RUC investigation into these events.  The authorities on both sides of the Border appear to have taken the attitude that these bombings and killings were simply part of the Troubles and that proper investigation was not warranted or required.  The families were left not knowing the full information and were not satisfied with the investigation that took place.  This compounded the grief they have had to endure at the loss of their loved ones.</p>  <p>  My Socialist Party colleague, Joe Higgins, raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions.  I dug out some transcripts today.  It is incredible that 15 and 16 years ago the same questions were asked in this Chamber but there has been no movement whatsoever.  On one occasion he questioned Bertie Ahern, who was the Taoiseach at the time of the Barron and McEntee inquiries.  He called on the Government of the day to take a strong position and demand access to files and documents held by the British authorities.  At the time, Tony Blair was the British Prime Minister.  Clearly, it was a different era, yet we are still seeking answers and there has not been co-operation on the part of the British Government.  Even Mr. Justice Barron concluded that it would not be fanciful to say there was a level of collusion between elements of the British State security services and loyalist paramilitaries.  This is why there is a particularly strong need for the files and documents held by them to be made available immediately for a full investigation.</p>  <p>  All of the victims of the Troubles and their relatives deserve truth and justice.  The demands of the Justice for the Forgotten group need to be supported.  I am also aware of the campaign work of the victims of the Ballymurphy and Kingsmill massacres as well.  We also support the demands of these victims and relatives for investigations in order that truth and justice can be delivered for them as well.  We need this not only for the relatives and victims, but to learn the lessons of the past, the extent of State collusion and what the State is capable of in these circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500018#Q00300"><p>I want to talk about something that is fresh in our memories.  All of us will be aware of the high level of emotion, joy and relief felt by the families of the Hillsborough disaster recently when, finally, they got closure on the case of a cover-up by the South Yorkshire police, a case they had been fighting since 1989.  Not only the community in Liverpool and Britain, but the whole world felt a sense of sadness, relief and joy - all manner of emotions - for that community when they finally got closure after such a long time.  It is true to say that the same happened in Derry when the British Government issued an apology to the crowd at the Guildhall in Derry some 38 years after Bloody Sunday.  These people have had to wait for long periods to get closure on issues that have deeply affected their lives and communities, in particular, their ability to be able to get on with their lives in a full, meaningful and healthy emotional way.</p>  <p>  On the forty-second anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, it is crucial that a strong statement comes from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The motion is clearly supported across all parties.  It is fairly innocuous in the sense that it shows support for the people who have done a great job in keeping this issue on the agenda over the years.  Sometimes, I wonder how they keep doing it after all these years and how they stick with it.  Many generations stick with it; it is not only the same individuals all the time.  I admire them for it and believe it is important that they continue do so.  The heart of the matter is that behind the cover-up of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is years of deep co-operation between the State and nasty sectarian forces in Northern Ireland.  What is referred to as the Troubles was marked by pockets of serious incidents, including killings and attempted killings, directly linked to this collusion.</p>  <p>  Recently, I shared a platform with Bernadette Devlin, or Bernadette McAliskey, as she is now known, at the celebration of Gerry Carroll's victory in west Belfast for People Before Profit.  She reminded us of the time she lay under her bed with 20 odd bullets in her body.  She almost died in hospital at the time.  That was clearly an incident of collusion between the British Government and loyalist paramilitaries, as was the murder of Pat Finucane and many others.</p>  <p>  It is politically important for the families to pursue this issue.  Obviously, it is personally important for those involved but politically and historically it is important to understand the nature of the northern state, the nature of British-Irish relations and to correct the historical record.</p>  <p>  Justice for the Forgotten will continue to establish a mechanism that can persuade the British Government to provide the documentary evidence.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, has recently reaffirmed his commitment to continue to call on the British Government to release the necessary documentation that can give closure and openness to this process.</p>  <p>  Although the motion is good in its content and it has widespread support, we should really question our diplomatic methods.  It is a little like the definition of insanity as the action of someone who keeps doing the same thing but expects a different result.</p><p>Perhaps when we pass this motion - not "if," but "when" - in this new D&aacute;il, we should go at it in a different way.  Instead of asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to call on the British Government to co-operate, we should raise the stakes.  The Taoiseach, and perhaps even the President, should raise their voices and call on the British Government to deliver justice for the forgotten.  This is important in a year when we have seen closure on a very sad period of history for people in Britain.  It is now time for the British Government to give closure to people in this country on an extraordinarily sad and tragic time in their lives.  As well as passing the motion, we should up the stakes.  The Taoiseach and the President, Michael D. Higgins, should lend their voices, loud, clear and strong, to the British Government to give these people closure and open up the documents that are necessary to give us the truth of what happened on those days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500019#R00200"><p>Last week on 17 May we marked the 42nd anniversary of the Monaghan and Dublin bombings.  Thirty-four lives were taken by no-warning bombs placed in busy streets.  This was the largest single-day loss of life over some 30 years of the Troubles.  I extend my continuing sympathy and solidarity with all the survivors and the bereaved of that terrible day.</p>  <p>  These and other British-sponsored bombings have never elicited the release of critical documentation held by the British Government, its armed forces and North-of-Ireland-based agencies.  This is despite the efforts of Mr. Justice Henry Barron, who conducted an inquiry into the atrocities and whose report, when considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, prompted that all-party committee to conclude that "we are dealing with acts of international terrorism that were colluded in by the British security forces".  Television programmes broadcast by BBC and RTE last year showed the pervasiveness of collusion, a practice of the British Government and its security forces, the consequences of which are felt by families and survivors across Ireland today.</p>  <p>  Collusion is not an allegation that can be dismissed as propaganda.  It is a fact of the conflict.  It was committed on a large scale and with impunity.  There is clear evidence that points to collusion being not only practice but policy.  It was planned and directed with full political authority.  This is no more evident than in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The demands contained in two all-party motions adopted unanimously in the D&aacute;il speak volumes of the chasm between the Irish and British Governments on the matter.  The Irish Government collectively demands justice on behalf of the victims and in the name of the people of Ireland, but the latter claims national security reasons for its non-co-operation and even on occasion denies that any such documentation exists.  There are many aspects to engaging with this legacy, but central to the Sinn F&eacute;in approach has been the facilitation of information disclosure, truth and justice for families.  The British Government&rsquo;s blanket veto on providing information to the families of victims of the conflict is unacceptable and remains the biggest single obstacle to dealing effectively with the legacy of the past.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has failed to uphold the rights of families of Irish citizens killed and injured through acts of collusion.  He has failed to hold the British Government to account for its refusal to fully co-operate with the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This is the case despite the fact that he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have a strong mandate from the Oireachtas to pursue this issue with real determination with the British Government.  The Irish Government is not a minor player in the peace process.  It is a co-equal guarantor and partner in that process.  The Irish Government must not let the British Government walk away from its role and responsibility in the conflict.  It must secure the right to truth for all citizens and ensure the mechanisms agreed as part of the Stormont House Agreement are implemented.</p>  <p>  I also note and welcome the fact that at last week&rsquo;s commemoration on Talbot Street, which I attended, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, called for full British Government co-operation in order that the truth could be established and those responsible pursued, if that were still possible.  Actions speak louder than words.  I call on the Taoiseach and this Government to pursue the full realisation of the demands of these all-party motions and to raise the matter again, urgently and with real resolve, with the British Government. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge once again the tenacity and courage of the campaigning group Justice for the Forgotten, and Margaret Urwin in particular.  I wish to conclude by remembering all the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and not least those who lost their lives in my home town of Monaghan on that fateful Friday in May 1974: Archie Harper, Peggy White and Jack Travers, all of whom I knew personally, Patrick Askin and Thomas Croarkin, whose families I know well, and Thomas Campbell and George Williamson.  May the Lord have mercy on all their souls and grant peace and justice to their grieving and campaigning relatives and friends.</p></speech>

They are most welcome here again.  I pay tribute to their great work and their tenaciousness in pursuing truth over these long years.  Any progress that has been made in the search for justice is due largely if not exclusively to their efforts.  They are to be commended on that.</p>  <p>  We have just commemorated the 42nd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I remember the time; I was a child in this city.  Three bombs exploded in Dublin and a fourth in Monaghan, killing 33 civilians and an unborn child and injuring almost 300 people.  Those killed were aged from five months to 80 years.  One of the deadliest bombs exploded in Talbot Street, in the heart of my constituency in the north inner city.  Many people and families today bear the physical and emotional scars of that day.  For them, this is not about the past; it is very much in the present.  The bombings claimed by the UVF had the fingerprints of the British Army and British intelligence all over them, most obviously in respect of their agents and informers, those whom they ran within the UVF and other Unionist and loyalist proxy organisations.  In his report on the bombings in 2003, the Irish Supreme Court judge Mr. Justice Henry Barron pointed his judicial finger at the most likely involvement of the British military and intelligence services in those bombings.  There is no question, for those who care to examine the case, that this was a matter of collusion.  My colleague, Deputy Adams, unfairly said he had little hope that the passing of another all-party motion in this House would have any real effect on the British Government.  It is understandable that his view would be tinged with some cynicism.</p>  <p>  The first question we have to ask is whether the passing of this motion will have an impact on our Government in Dublin.  Sadly, unlike Deputy Sean Sherlock, who commended us and the Government on doing our best, I do not believe that is the case.  We should be and are very critical of the British system for shutting down access and avenues to truth and justice.  That is its form, and there is no sign of that form changing.  We also need to be equally honest about the effort, or lack of effort - the lack of determination - from the Dublin Government.  The Taoiseach, and not alone he, has been passive and has largely paid lip service to this particular campaign for justice.  With another joint motion, it would be intolerable if he were to yet again sit on his hands.</p><p>When inquiries are made of the Taoiseach as to the position of the British system and Prime Minister on these matters, he routinely responds in the Chamber that he has raised the matter with the Prime Minister.  It is not sufficient simply to raise the matter with the British system in some kind of box-ticking exercise.</p> <p> The Fresh Start agreement negotiations were very revealing on a number of counts, in the first instance in terms of where the British position now rests.  Republicans and Unionists cobbled together an agreement to deal with legacy issues, and in came the British system citing matters of national security.  This was entirely spurious and without foundation.  It was given avenues to address any genuine concerns it might have had in this regard, but of course it had no interest in that.  What was equally revealing was the passivity of the Dublin system when faced with that British intransigence.</p> <p> I do not recall any serious effort by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, or by anybody else within the Administration to face down and challenge the blanket denial of truth, information and justice.  If this motion is to mean anything, if the fine words of the Taoiseach are to amount to anything and if those in the Gallery are to have any real prospect of getting the truth and justice they deserve, the first thing that needs to change is the position, attitude and inactivity of the Dublin Government.</p></speech>

Although nobody has been brought to justice for those terrible crimes, it appears highly probable that the murders were carried out as a result of collusion between certain sections within the British state and loyalist paramilitaries.  We know that the Glenanne gang, that in the 1970s was based in Armagh and comprised a group of Northern loyalists who were involved with the UDR, the RUC and certain sections within the British security services, was responsible for a significant number of murders committed in Northern Ireland at the time.  It carried out a sectarian murders against Catholics.  The sectarian murders for which it was responsible were just as heinous and sectarian as the campaign carried out by the Provisional IRA at the same time.</p>  <p>  The bombs in Dublin and Monaghan were not simply an attack on the unfortunate people who were murdered that day; they were also an attack on the State.  They were sectarian attacks that were committed at a time when this State and the North could have regressed into sectarian civil war between loyalist Protestant and Nationalist Catholic groups.  The actions of the people within British intelligence who promoted and colluded in the crime actively encouraged and sought to promote such a conflict, and that needs to be condemned unreservedly.</p>  <p>  We will never overcome the legacy of the past unless the participants from the past decide to admit what happened, and that applies to everyone on all sides of the conflict.  Unfortunately, it appears that is not going to happen.  Part of the reason there will not be an admission as to the wrongdoing of the past is because it is a source of extraordinary embarrassment and an admission of murder.  It is a recognition that what happened in the past was completely wrong.  Why did all those young people in Northern Ireland have to die and what was achieved?  Why did so many people in Dublin and Monaghan have to die 42 years ago and what was achieved? </p>  <p>  Acts of collusion between the British state and loyalist paramilitaries may have started in the 1970s and continued throughout the 1980s into the early 1990s.  It was an illegal response to the equally repulsive campaign being carried out on behalf of the Provisional IRA at the time.  I regret to say, however, that history teaches us that the likelihood is that the British state will not face up to its responsibility in respect of collusion.</p>  <p>  The House previously passed a motion seeking the appointment of a judge to examine the documents available to the British and which could throw some light on these heinous crimes.  We should recall that in Weston Park, the agreement between Ireland and Britain a number of years ago, there was similar agreement that there would be a public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane.  To date we have received no public inquiry from the British state.  Instead, we have had the De Silva inquiry which, while illuminating, is not the public inquiry for which we entered into an agreement.</p>  <p>  It is also instructive to note what happens to people within the British state who seek to expose collusion on the part of certain sections of the British military.  In the 1980s, John Colin Wallace was an intelligence officer in Northern Ireland.  He, along with Fred Holroyd, another British Army officer, exposed serious wrongdoing and illegality on behalf of the British forces in Northern Ireland.  He was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of murder, but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom in 1996.</p>  <p>  John Stalker was deputy chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police and was asked by the British Government to look into reports of a shoot to kill policy.  He was removed from the inquiry after allegations were made against him, allegations which have long since been shown to be false.</p>  <p>  John Stevens was a senior police officer in the Metropolitan police who was asked to investigate certain allegations of collusion.  It is sometimes forgotten that he reached the finding that there was collusion involved in the murder of Pat Finucane.  It is instructive to note what happened to Mr. Stevens the night before he planned to arrest an individual involved in the heinous crime.  His office in the RUC base in Carrickfergus was burnt down.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to give up hope in respect of Dublin and Monaghan, and I commend the people in the Gallery, and the families of those who were murdered, on their perseverance.  It is important we continue to seek the truth in respect of this matter. I can assure the House and the families that Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to pursue that, notwithstanding the fact it may be the case that we will not get co-operation from the British state.</p></speech>

As other speakers have said, it is now 42 years since the horrendous bombings of Dublin and Monaghan in which 34 people died and 300 were injured.  There were three bombs in Dublin and one in Monaghan about an hour and half later.  A number of people from County Tipperary were killed in the bombings.  In a previous bombing in December 1972, a Tipperary resident, George Bradshaw, who was a bus worker from Fethard, died.</p>  <p>  One would wonder why over the past 42 years we have not been able to get to the truth and get justice and answers for those who were bereaved.  It is now clearly and widely accepted that British state security forces were involved in the bombings.  The evidence for that comes from the mouths of former members of the British security forces.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality indicated that it is believed that the bombs were an act of international terrorism involving British state forces.  In his report Mr. Justice Barron criticised the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation and said it was stopped prematurely.  He also criticised the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government of the day and said British security forces were, in his view, involved in the bombings.</p>  <p>  Since then we have been unable to get co-operation from the British Government on this issue.  We have sought files and papers to be made available, but that did not happen.  The Government asked that an independent international judicial expert be allowed to view the relevant papers, but that has not happened.  There were all-party motions in 2008, 2011 and again today.</p></speech>

It does not rely on a means test or social insurance contributions and is paid to the parents of qualified children up to the age of 18 years.  It is paid to approximately 623,000 families for 1.2 million children with estimated spending of more than &euro;2 billion by my Department this year.  Child benefit is not linked to school attendance for children under 16 and the Social Welfare Acts do not require monitoring of school attendance for children aged under 16.  There is no power in the Act to do so.  For older children aged 16 and 17 years, an annual declaration is required from parents, signed by their school, that their children attend school or that they have a disability.</p>  <p>  The monitoring of children's attendance at school is an important child welfare issue but is beyond my remit as Minister for Social Protection.  The attendance of children at school is monitored by Tusla under the Education (Welfare) Acts on a statutory basis on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Any issues concerning school attendance, including the operation of the monitoring systems, are a matter for Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  My Department operates control programmes on all departmental schemes, designed to ensure that payments cease where there is no longer an entitlement.  Child benefit operates a very effective and efficient control programme, ensuring that payment is only paid to families who continue to have such an entitlement.</p></reply>

I do not detect any such assurance in his reply.  Unless I misunderstood the Minister, he has suggested it is a matter for another Department.  Many people are worried about the issue.  They are worried about the statement in the programme for Government that indicates there would be a link between school attendance and payment of child benefit.  The Minister is familiar with the statement in the programme for Government which he negotiated with some of the Government's Independent supporters.  Could he explain what exactly the statement in the programme for Government means and what its implications will be?</p></speech>

Child benefit is a payment that is not means tested and is not taxed and I have no intention of changing that.  The payment will remain un-means tested and it will not be taxed.  Child benefit for children aged under 16 is not linked to school attendance but children aged 17 and 18 do have to be attending school or have a physical or mental disability.  Controls are in place to make sure that is the case.</p>  <p>  I had discussions last week with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the common view of the three Ministers is that those who are involved in educational welfare and monitoring truancy do not believe giving them a further tool with which to enforce school attendance by withholding child benefit payments for children aged 16 or younger would be useful.  As that is a matter for them, I see no reason to change the law given that, in their view, the tool would not be useful, but it is the case for 17 and 18 year olds that the payment is linked to school attendance.</p></speech>

One of the first schemes selected for evaluation was JobBridge.  The aim of the evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of its key objective of improving employment outcomes for unemployed jobseekers.  The evaluation involves a number of elements including surveys of host organisation and participants to capture their perspective on and experience of JobBridge; an assessment of whether JobBridge might be displacing paid employment in the economy; and a comparison of employment outcomes of JobBridge participants matched to a control group of non-participants.  The research is currently well advanced and I expect to receive an interim progress report towards the end of June and the final report in September.</p><p>The JobBridge scheme has been an effective labour market intervention to date.  Some 15,000 interns went directly into paid employment immediately following a JobBridge internship.  Independent research indicates that rose to 29,000 interns, or 61% of all participants after five months, compared to an average of 34% for comparable programmes in other European countries, so it is almost twice as effective.</p><p>I know people who took part in JobBridge and have benefited from it, but it was very much a scheme for its time, and I am planning to replace it with a more appropriate scheme.  JobBridge was launched at a time of massive economic uncertainty and widespread unemployment.  Companies were simply not hiring because they could not afford to recruit, and in many cases insisted on a minimum level of experience.  However, large numbers of recent graduates and people who lost their jobs in the recession could not get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.  That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates are once again finding work.</p><p>Unemployment has fallen below 8% for the first time since the crash.  Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, I am concerned at reports that some employers might be using JobBridge as an alternative to hiring new employees.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>On the other hand, I am very conscious that there are still many people who lost their jobs in the depth of the recession who are struggling to break back into the labour market and schemes like JobBridge can provide a valuable pathway to such citizens, in particular in instances where it is associated with a training programme.  The Indecon review in September will provide an evidential basis upon which to consider what changes should be made to improve outcomes for jobseekers and value for money for the State.</p></reply>

That needs to be done with immediate effect.  We should not wait until September.  It needs to be done barring those who are already on the scheme.</p>  <p>  When I looked at the website this morning, I saw new, fresh positions being advertised.  There was an advertisement for an internship as a deli assistant.  In my day such a position required probably a couple of days training to gain experience but the Minister is asking people to work 40 hours a week over a nine-month period for &euro;50 extra on top of a social welfare payment to train as a deli assistant.  Does the Minister agree that the scheme has fundamentally failed and that it has displaced work?  That is quite clear.  The scheme depressed job creation, facilitated wage avoidance and normalised work for little or no wages.  It has put good employers at a competitive disadvantage.  Does the Minister agree that JobBridge has resulted in the exploitation of workers by some individuals?</p></speech>

No one was ever required to take up a JobBridge internship.  When I was at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, we had JobBridge interns, some of whom went on to full-time jobs.  It is important to ask people who have taken part what they think of the scheme, and 65% of those who took part stated that they would recommend it to a family member or friend, while 89% stated that it had given them new skills.  These are people who actually took part, and it is more important to listen to them than to the activists - who of course have their views, to which they are entitled.</p>  <p>  However, it was a scheme for its time and it is outdated.  I intend to either abolish it altogether or replace it with a more targeted scheme in September.  However, I do not wish to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and I wish to allow Indecon to finish its work in order that it can help inform me on what scheme should or might replace it.  I certainly am open to suggestions from Sinn F&eacute;in as to what it considers should replace it.</p></speech>

What will replace JobBridge?  The Minister stated that he would look forward to proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Last year, Sinn F&eacute;in produced the document I have to hand, Displacing JobBridge, which would see tailored internships as opposed to the one-size-fits-all approach that is part of JobBridge.  Will the Minister examine this document?  Will he examine the primary legislation proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in within this document to provide safeguards for internships?  I have to hand a copy of this document, which I will gladly hand over to the Minister for him to examine so that he can consider the items contained therein.</p></speech>

It is important to wait six or seven weeks to get that review in order that it can be considered fully.  I certainly will take a look at Sinn F&eacute;in's paper with regard to its proposals on what should replace JobBridge.  As stated previously, it was a scheme that was established at a different time, a time when employers, and small employers in particular, could not afford to take on people.  It was at a time when people could not get any work experience.  What happened was that when people took up internships to get work experience, they lost their jobseeker's benefit.  It was a real problem at the time that those who wished to take up work experience lost their jobseeker's benefit, but how else were they meant to get work experience?  It was a double jeopardy for them, and that is why the JobBridge scheme evolved and why it was welcomed initially by many people who subsequently came to oppose it.

Payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund, essentially from the PRSI contributions paid in by those in employment, employers and the self-employed.</p>  <p>  Following the liquidation of Clerys in June 2015, more than &euro;2.5 million was paid under the Department&rsquo;s redundancy and insolvency payment schemes to 134 former employees.  Arising from the Clerys liquidation, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation initiated a twin-track examination of protection law for employees and unsecured creditors to ensure in particular that limited liability or company restructuring were not used to avoid a company&rsquo;s obligations to its employees and creditors.  The Government recently published one of these reports, by Nessa Cahill and Kevin Duffy.  It is my firm view that employers must adhere to the letter and spirit of both company and employment law.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering how the provisions of the Companies Acts, including section 599 of the Companies Act 2014, might be used to recover the moneys expended from the Social Insurance Fund.  Consideration of legal action by my Department must take into account a number of factors, including the burden of proof required, the likely costs and duration of a legal action, and the level of assets, if any, that might be recovered if an action were successful.  Officials from my Department are discussing this approach with the Attorney General's office and with senior counsel to seek legal advice, as there is no precedence in Irish case law on this specific provision.</p></reply>

The operating company was then declared insolvent and went into liquidation.  The employees lost their entitlements without notice or consultation and without payment of their statutory redundancy, but that was fixed up.  In effect, what happened was that a situation was engineered in which people's entitlements and the payment to them of &euro;2.5 million was placed onto the shoulders of the Department and the taxpayers and in which the company got away scot free.  This is not good enough, and workers who had given their lifetimes were dismissed without leave or consultation or anything else.</p>  <p>  Section 599 comes from the 1990 Act and was repeated verbatim in the 2014 Act.  It is about bringing assets of a connected company into a liquidation on the grounds of fairness and equity.  It is used in New Zealand, from where we borrowed it, but has never been invoked.  This is the area on which there should be a focus.  The provision is designed and custom-built for the purpose that arose at Clerys.  It is time the shackles were thrown off and the legislation was used to pursue the issue that has arisen.  If the advice from the Attorney General comes through - and I understand it could be positive - will the State invoke the legislation to ensure this money is recovered?</p></speech>

Section 599 is a mechanism by which it might be possible to recover those funds either from the company or from connected companies.  However, key to this prospect will be the advice of the Attorney General.  If the advice is that we have a good chance of winning the case and that there is a good chance of recovering the money, then of course it would be my intention to proceed with that legal action.  However, I must bear in mind the undesirability of exposing the taxpayer to a further loss by pursuing a case that may not be successful or one against a company that may not have the &euro;2.5 million to repay to the Social Insurance Fund.  These are the factors that must be taken into account - namely, whether there is a reasonable chance of the case being successful, and, if it were successful, whether the companies concerned have the money to pay back to the Social Insurance Fund.</p></speech>

Section 599 has never been used.  It is on the Statute Book for a good reason and it should be used.  If the Government, with the backing of the deep pockets of the State, cannot use it, how can a small business or small company owner use or exploit it?  Let us go for it.  The Government should carry the loss, and if the courts hold against it, Members can amend the law to ensure this situation never occurs again.  This is happening too often; too many companies are getting away with passing the buck and engineering matters to place the bills onto the shoulders of the Minister.  It is important that this action be pursued, and the time to so do is overdue.  People outside the House make the point to me that if the Department were owed &euro;20 or &euro;200 or &euro;2,000 by an ordinary person - an overclaim, perhaps, or on foot of an inadvertent action - that person would be pursued with vigour.  I ask the Minister to pursue this matter with vigour.  I would be surprised if the Attorney General did not give the green light to pursue this action.  What is the sense of having legislation on the Statute Book if it is useless and toothless?</p></speech>

I believe that economic and labour market conditions have changed for the better since the scheme was introduced in 2011 and that the time may now be right for a more targeted scheme.  JobBridge was developed in 2011 in response to the unemployment crisis to serve a dual purpose.  First, it was to help jobseekers to secure work experience vital to enhancing their employment prospects and break the vicious circle of &quot;no experience no work, but no work no experience&quot;.  Second, it was to support employers in taking the first step in recruitment at a time when access to finance was limited and business risk was high.  JobBridge also addressed the anomaly in the social welfare code whereby unemployed jobseekers who voluntarily undertook unpaid work experience or internships lost their entitlement to a jobseeker's payment.  Under JobBridge, participants retain their jobseeker's payment and, in addition, receive a top-up towards the cost of work of &euro;52.50 per week.</p><p>JobBridge has been successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It has helped about 19,000 - mainly small - employers to provide valuable work experience to almost 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were high.  Two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member, and levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were relatively low.  Most notably, the evaluation found that about 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of completing their internship.  This is a high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.</p><p>Notwithstanding these achievements, JobBridge has been subject to a high level of criticism, much of which is based on small-scale surveys by various interest groups.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>I intend to respond to these criticisms in the design of a new scheme.  It is important, however, that the design of a new scheme is informed by the best evidence possible.  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large-scale evaluation of JobBridge currently under way.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and I will announce my proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

I would be the first to concede that JobBridge has done a lot of good.  Will the Minister agree, however, that interns have been exploited?  For example, is he aware of a newspaper study which reached the following conclusions and threw up the following statistics?  The largest user of the scheme over its five-year period was the HSE, which used it 399 times.  The HSE used the scheme to fill 67 assistant psychologist posts.  The ESB recruited a solicitor, two industrial economists, three quantity surveyors, a geological data analyst and a legal executive - all very qualified individuals - via JobBridge.</p>  <p>  Interns interviewed during the study complained about bullying, working more than 40 hours per week, being forced to work outside their job description, and inadequate monitoring.  Does this not smack of exploitation?  Why did the Government renege on its commitment to have regular monitoring of JobBridge?  It did one report in 2002, but nothing for the past four years.</p></speech>

It was a scheme for a particular time and I have no doubt that there has been some degree of displacement.  That is something that I want to ensure changes in any replacement scheme, but any scheme will cause some degree of deadweight or displacement.  That is the nature of any intervention that occurs in the labour market.  Unfortunately, in any workplace, even in a fully paid normal contract job or permanent post, one will find people who complain of bullying, exploitation or being required to work beyond their job description.  In fact, I would say that a huge number of employees in all fields of work may feel that they are asked to work beyond their job description.  I do not think that those things in themselves mean that one can condemn an entire scheme.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that 86 companies were struck off the JobBridge scheme because, quite frankly, they were abusing it.  Nevertheless, they were restored because it was found that the procedures adopted to strike them off were unfair.  In other words, they were restored on a technicality.  Does the Minister regard it as reasonable that five years into the operation of a scheme involving tens of thousands of people, we still do not seem to have a robust method of monitoring it and punishing people who offend?  Will the Minister change the policy to which his predecessor rigidly adhered of not publishing the names of companies and individuals who have been struck off?  A list of tax defaulters is regularly published in the national press.</p>  <p>  When I asked the Minister's predecessor why this rule was not applied to companies that were stuck off from using JobBridge, I was told that it was for commercial reasons.  I imagine that if some businessman is named as a tax defaulter, it will have some commercial impact on him.</p></speech>

The reason they cannot be published or named and shamed in the way a tax defaulter would be is that where they have been suspended from a scheme, it is done on an administrative basis.  It is not that a finding has been made against them in the way a finding may be made against somebody who defrauded the State of taxes.  It is not that anyone who gets audited is named and shamed when it comes to tax.  They must have a finding against them that would stand up in court.  Needless to say, the Department does not want to start naming and shaming companies that would then go to court and sue successfully for having their good name impugned without due process.</p></speech>

If somebody is disqualified from being involved in the JobBridge scheme because they have been found to be exploiting young people who want to get into employment and those who are long-term unemployed, surely they deserve to have their names published.  The Minister is using a different excuse than his predecessor who used the excuse of commercial sensitivity.  I would have thought that if some business person is listed as a tax defaulter, it would have some commercial impact on his business.</p>  <p>  First, will the Minister give me an assurance that in the new scheme he will introduce, he will carefully examine the question of naming and shaming?  That would serve as a deterrent to would-be abusers.  Second, will the Minister give an assurance that under the new scheme, whenever it is introduced, he will have a proper monitoring system to ensure interns get the experience and skills they have signed up for?</p></speech>

In a small number of cases, as a result of on-site inspection processes, the Department formed the view that non-compliance by certain organisations warranted a decision to terminate the internship concerned or to suspend them from future participation for a period depending on the nature of the transgression.  In the cases concerned, the decisions were taken on an administrative basis by individual inspectors.  The host organisation had no recourse to any review of the decision, which is very different from tax cases.  However, it has now been determined, and this is relevant to any future scheme, by the Office of the Information Commissioner that, in future, names of host organisations found to be non-compliant should and can be made available.</p></speech>

This will be achieved by continuing and enhancing a supportive environment for enterprise and employment.</p>  <p>  In particular, the role of entrepreneurs and the self-employed will be central to this ambition. The new programme agreed with our partners in Government contains a commitment to introduce an improved PRSI scheme for the self-employed.  In addition, we will also ensure that the earned income tax credit available to the self-employed will match that available to employees, over a number of budgets.  This process commenced in budget 2016 with the introduction of a &euro;550 tax credit for the self-employed.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure that appropriate sustainable supports are available to the self-employed in the event of certain contingencies arising.  The self-employed already have access to the State contributory pension, the contributory widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, the contributory guardians payment, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit on the same basis as employees.  It is also my intention that they will also gain access to the new paternity benefit, which will be introduced later this year.  They can access jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance on a means-tested basis.  However, unlike the position with employees, they are not covered for certain contingencies such as long-term illnesses or disability and may not avail of treatment benefit.  The former Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published a report in 2013 which examined the options for extension of cover to the self-employed.   This is a valuable contribution to the issue and my Department will be examining all of the available options in the coming months.  This examination will have to include the level of appropriate additional contribution the self-employed may have to make for additional benefits.  I look forward to making progress on this issue in the next few months.</p></reply>

The tenor of the reply appears to indicate that he will do this on a compulsory basis.  I acknowledge that is what the advisory group recommended but I disagree respectfully with the recommendation.  However, is the Minister aware that countries such as Denmark, Germany, France, and Spain and even in recent EU entrants such as Lithuania and Romania have a voluntary system whereby if self-employed people wish to pay additional contributions, they will be included and nobody is compelled to enter the scheme?  There is not a compulsory additional tax on the self-employed as a whole but those who want to sign up to the scheme are allowed to do so.</p></speech>

That is often the difficulty with voluntary contributions.  Only small numbers will contribute and the contributions often have to be high to cover the inevitable risk that occurs.  When something is voluntary, those who are most likely to avail of it are the ones who are most likely to contribute.  That is why universal schemes generally work better and that is why PRSI for employees is not voluntary.  I imagine many employees would love it if PRSI was voluntary and they did not have to pay into the fund but the effect of that would be make contributions much higher for those who do and there would be a risk issue in that those more likely to avail of it would be more likely to pay into it.  The point could be reached that contributions were so high that nobody would make them.</p>  <p>  I was self-employed and I took out voluntary income protection, which is expensive.</p></speech>

I am also aware of the position as it pertains to employees.  On the basis of conversations I have had with a number of self-employed business people and their representatives, they would love the option if the contributions were reasonable.  We have produced figures on this.  The report the Minister mentioned estimated that to bring in a scheme for illness benefit and then gradually extending it to jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed would require an additional PRSI contribution of approximately 1.5% across the board.  According to our figures, in so as we can calculate them, an additional 4.5% to 5% would be required if the scheme were voluntary.  We are examining how this operates in other countries.  Will the Minister confirm that he intends to proceed to bring in a protection system or safety net, particularly for self-employed people who fall ill?  Will he confirm that he will give equal consideration to both options?</p></speech>

I want to publish a proposal before the recess and I want to consult the 300,000 people who are self-employed to ask them what they think.  I am conscious that this is part of the agreement between the Deputy's party and mine and, therefore, I want to do this.  I will seek the Deputy's support in doing this because that will be necessary to get the legislation through.  Perhaps we will meet about it again when I have something more solid.</p>  <p>  There are different benefits and I am considering both compulsory and voluntary options.  It may be the case that some benefits could be extended on a compulsory basis and others such as jobseeker's benefit might be done on a voluntary basis.  It is not even an either-or but I have asked for an options paper.  I intend to publish proposals, ideally before the end of July, with a view to consulting fully with people who are self-employed and other parties because legislation will require a majority in the House.</p></speech>

That is the vision and an example of the changes that will come up about under the Government.  One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a fit for work programme to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.</p>  <p>  The fit for work proposal is based on the findings of a pan-European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs, on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU and the Health and Safety Authority also contributed to the study.  It was a broad representative group.</p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness-disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department issued a set of certification guidelines for GPs in 2015, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. </p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the Renaissance project, which is an initiative of my Department since 2003.  This has shown that early intervention reduced the incidence of progression from the acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants.  While specific proposals for a fit for work programme require further development and scoping out, I assure the Deputy that such proposals will be in line with the wealth of evidence, which shows that, generally, employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and well-being and, conversely, that unemployment is damaging.</p></reply>

It immediately rang alarm bells among the Anti-Austerity Alliance because a similar scheme is operating in Britain at the moment and other elements of the programme for Government were copied and pasted from the Tory Party handbook.  I would like the Minister to clarify the nature of the scheme.  Despite the nice words he just used, the same comments were made about JobBridge when it was introduced.  It was intended to support and help people and it turned out to be an exploitation scheme.  This scheme has huge potential to be even worse because it relates to the most vulnerable people with physical and mental disabilities.</p></speech>

It is not copied from the Tory handbook or any Conservative policy in England.  This plan is completely different from the one used in the UK.  There are many positive elements to this plan, including the involvement of groups like Arthritis Ireland which came on board on this issue.  The key difference between this plan and the one in England is that our plan does not assess people.  It is about early intervention and treatment.  This is very important because the objective is to ensure that disabled people get an opportunity to enter the workforce.  There are many talented people out there with a disability and we want to ensure they are given the opportunity but there is no compulsion involved compared to other projects in England.</p></speech>

This is a labour activation scheme.  It is not an early intervention scheme with people who are unable to work.  It is an adult scheme.  My question, which comes from the Disability Federation of Ireland which held a press conference this morning, relates to who will carry out the assessments regarding whether or not someone is fit to work.  Will it be the HSE or will it be a private company, as has been done in Great Britain?  The Government used a private company in its other labour activation schemes like Pathways to Work.  What will the assessment entail?  Will it be a medical assessment or a functionality assessment?  For many people with disabilities, it is not a question of whether they are necessarily fit to work on a particular day but whether they can sustain a job and have the supports they need to carry on in a job.</p>  <p>  The big danger relates to mental health.  It is very clear that people who do not have a physical disability can easily be forced into jobs they are not fit for.  It is very unfortunate that there has not been time to put the questions.</p></speech>

There is no way that I, as Minister of State for disability issues, would stand over any exploitation of people with disabilities.  I will do my damnedest to defend and protect people with disabilities.  If there are people who want the opportunity to enter employment, I will do my best.  I have a vision over the next three or four years relating to employing people with disabilities.  At the moment, most organisations aim for 3%.  I aim to get every Department, and I said it at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, to go from 3% to 5% so the answer is that there will be no exploitation.</p></speech>

It is paid to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability.  It is currently paid to around 623,000 families for 1.2 million children with an estimated spend of over &euro;2 billion by my Department this year.  Child benefit is an important source of income for families and in Budget 2016, the Government increased child benefit by &euro;5 per month at a cost of &euro;72 million.</p>  <p>  The cost of extending child benefit to 18 year olds in second level education is estimated at &euro;62.5 million.  Obviously, it would be a multiple of that to extend it to young people into their twenties in education.  As child benefit is a universal payment, any such proposal would not target those most in need of help from the State.</p>  <p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including an increase for a qualified child with primary social welfare payments, family income supplement for low-paid employees with children and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low-income families, which is paid at the full-time second level education rate.</p>  <p>  In addition to this scheme, the main financial support available to students attending post-leaving certificate or higher education courses is the statutory based student grant scheme.  This scheme, which is administered by SUSI, offers a means-tested grant scheme that provides maintenance and-or fee support to qualifying disadvantaged students.  The combined effect of these schemes provides effective targeted assistance directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p></reply>

I understand the sentiment in his reply.  The reason I tabled this question is because of a number of people who came to my clinics over the past number of weeks and possibly months.  They were isolated cases who would have had 19 year old children doing the leaving certificate and as a result, they would be above that threshold about which the Minister spoke.  It would not be a large-scale extension of the scheme.  It would affect families with children of up to 19 years of age doing the leaving certificate.  Once they fall out of the scheme, they are unable to avail of the different options.  It is extremely difficult for families to obtain family income supplement and it is a lengthy process.  There are families on very low incomes or social welfare who are really struggling and all of it is associated with school.  They find very difficult and expensive to make ends meet.</p></speech>

I have to double check this but if I remember correctly, child benefit is paid to 16 and 17 year olds but not to 18 year olds.  There would be many 18 year olds in leaving certificate year at this stage, not just 19 year olds, so I do not think we could extend it to 19 year olds but not 18 year olds.  I see the case for it.  When the scheme was introduced, fewer children would have taken transition year so there it would have been far less common for children aged 18 to be doing the leaving certificate whereas it is now quite common.  In the context of the budget, I will certainly examine the possibility of extending it to 18 and 19 year olds who are still in sixth year.  However, resources are always limited and this might be money that could be better targeted at the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, the fuel allowance or supports that target those most in need.  It is certainly something I will look at.</p></speech>

This would be important because while quite a number of families have children aged up to 18 doing the leaving certificate, there is a reduced number with 19 year old children doing the leaving certificate.  As the Minister can appreciate, it is extremely difficult and expensive for families.  I know it all relates to financial budgets and constraints but it is important that the Minister reviews it and looks to extend it, even on a phased basis, so they can get support.  Families are trying to put their children through school at 18 and 19 years of age, which is common for the leaving certificate, and it is hugely expensive and difficult for them.  It would make a big difference to them if it was possible to extend it.</p><p>I hope the Minister will be able to do something in that regard and perhaps have some part of it put in place by the next budget.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the other part of the question on the SUSI grants.  I do not know if that is worth examining into the future in the second phase of the question.  It is relevant and important for those families because they are means tested.</p></speech>

I can certainly see how an anomaly might arise where a child in school turns 18 in sixth year and loses their child benefit, subsequently qualifies for a student grant when they get into college or a post-leaving certificate, PLC, course later that year and there is a gap in between where there is no financial support from the State.  It is certainly something that I commit to examining between now and the budget but with the caveat of the obvious fact that there are potentially other areas of need that also have to be accounted for.</p></speech>

The theme suggested by my Department was how best to engage and support lone parents from an activation perspective.  The IRC sought expressions of interest from relevant academics to carry out independent research on this theme.  Following the IRC tender process, a proposal put forward by Dr. Michelle Millar of NUI Galway was successful.  The topic of Dr. Millar&rsquo;s research is Lone Parents and Activation, What Works and Why: A Review of the International Evidence in the Irish Context.  It is not an impact assessment of the reforms to the one-parent family payment and is not intended to be.  The aim of this research is to identify best practice and innovation for activation, nationally and internationally, that creates good outcomes for lone parents.  The report was tasked with recommending responsive and appropriate measures in the Irish context.</p>  <p>  There has been ongoing engagement between my officials and Dr. Millar on her research.  The first draft report was shared by Dr. Millar in September 2015.  A second draft was forwarded earlier this year and I understand that there was an initial delay in responding because of staff changes within the Department.  My officials will shortly provide feedback to Dr. Millar on the latest draft.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at risk of poverty rate for lone parents by three quarters compared with those who do not work.  The reforms to the one-parent family payment were introduced to reduce long-term social welfare dependency and enhance access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service to lone parents, which is essential in facilitating their progression into employment.  The Department will work with Dr. Millar on this research, including future publications by her.  It is intended that this research will inform how best to engage with lone parents and the future design of education, training and employment support programmes aimed specifically at improving outcomes for lone parents and one-parent families.</p></reply>

That is why I am undertaking tonight that I will only proceed with the measure to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.</blockquote><p>That was in April 2012 but we have seen no Scandinavian child care system put in place in the interim.  Somebody said the nearest one would get to a Scandinavian child care system in this country is the car park in Ikea.  The Minister said that the Millar report will not be a study on the financial impact of the changes for lone parents, particularly working lone parents who are cruelly penalised as a result of these changes.  Will the Minister commission such an impact statement, which would be very relevant and which we would all love to see?</p></speech>

I will not read out the statistics here but what is absolutely clear is that the measures to activate employment for lone parents forced more of them out of employment.  When one talks about reducing poverty, one has to look at it in a holistic way and look at the provision of child care and housing supports in particular.  Housing is in a massive crisis and rents are soaring through the roof.  Tomorrow, there will be a strike in Tesco nationally which is the type of low-paid job that many lone parents are being forced into.  They are forced to seek more hours in those kinds of jobs which pay very badly.  There is no point of talking about pushing lone parents into work and out of poverty unless one looks holistically at the sort of supports that are put in place for them, including child care, housing and the rate of pay they can expect to get in employment, including the low level of the minimum wage at the moment.</p></speech>

That is not what was commissioned.  It is supposed to be advice on best practice and best examples from other countries.  That is the work that was asked for.</p>  <p>  I recall Deputy Burton's comments but not exactly the time they were made.  It was perhaps before the jobseeker's transitional payment came in, which is for lone parents whose youngest child is between seven and 14.  It does not require that they be in full-time work.  Part-time work or education is enough.  It is accepted it is only when the youngest child is 14 or older that it is expected that lone parents take up full-time work.  When it comes to Nordic and Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, which are the models I am most interested in, activation starts much younger.  It starts at two or three, which is impossible in Ireland given the cost and lack of availability of child care.  I absolutely agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point that one must look at it holistically and take into account child care pay rates and housing supports if we are serious about getting people off welfare and into work, but these things should not be used as an excuse to do nothing ever.</p></speech>

The latest figures show that 22%, which is more than one in five, of children of lone parents are living in permanent poverty.  It also shows that almost 60% of children of lone parents, which is three out of five, are suffering deprivation.  They are deprived of some of the things that make up a decent standard of living.  All the experience, both anecdotal and otherwise, shows us that the net effect of the changes introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is that lone parents, especially working lone parents, are worse off so there is a direct link between the rising rate of child poverty among lone parents and these changes.  Will the Minister do a financial impact study?  A number of organisations, such as SPARK, have done very good financial impact studies that show the impact of those changes.  What is the rationale?  His predecessor said it was to get more lone parents out to work.  How does one get more people out to work by ensuring that when they go out to work, they will get less income?</p></speech>

By 2014, that figure had dropped to 36%, precisely because it was costing lone parents more to go out to work than to stay at home and be lone parents in the home.  The measures taken by the previous Minister did not fit the bill for what is required.  When we talk about equality proofing in the budget, we will need equality proofing on the programme for Government, because the programme talks about a new work and family payment.  We have gone from the one-parent family payment to a new payment which includes being able to collect family income support, and now in the programme the Minister is talking about changing that again to a working family payment.</p><p>What we are arguing here is that he should not even dare to move to that until Dr. Millar's report is published and we have a chance to examine its findings.  The Minister said they are not about comparisons and that that is not an excuse to do nothing, but it certainly is not an excuse to make the same mistake again and drive more lone parents, and their children, further into poverty.  As the statistics show, one in five children of lone parents live in chronic poverty.</p></speech>

One of the best aspects of the Department of Social Protection is that we have so many statistics in this area and there has been so much academic study in these areas, albeit, in some cases, from the point of view of a particular ideology.  None the less, it should be taken into account and listened to.  I wish I had had access to such statistics in the Department of Health, because it would have been easier to make informed decisions, but the Deputy has to understand how these statistics are collated.

That is a 10.7% increase in eight years.  Inflation over the seven years to April 2016 was 2.9%, with inflation falling over the past two years.  In the year to April 2016 we had no inflation.  In fact, we have had deflation of 0.1%, as measured by the consumer price index in the past year.</p>  <p>  After a series of very challenging years, improvements for people in receipt of social welfare payments began in budget 2015 and continued in budget 2016.  This included increases in the weekly rates of payment for pensioners and the living alone allowance.  In addition, new initiatives aimed at helping families were introduced, such as the back to work family dividend and a paternity benefit scheme which will commence payment later this year.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the new Programme for a Partnership Government contains a number of significant commitments to enhance the welfare system in the years ahead.  This includes increasing rent supplement limits by up to 15% and above-inflation increases for pensioners and in the living alone allowance.  The programme also supports rate increases for people with disabilities and carers.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government also has plans to extend social insurance benefits for the self-employed and to improve the treatment benefit scheme for all PRSI contributors.</p>  <p>  I want to make progress on these commitments in the forthcoming budget and will seek to do so within the additional resources that will be available.  I also look forward to engagement and input from my colleagues in the Oireachtas on this matter.  I will be holding a pre-budget forum on 22 July next to which I have invited 40 representative organisations.  I look forward to that engagement and will listen carefully to the views of the organisations attending.</p></reply>

That is true, but there has been inflation since 2010 and basic social protection payments have been cut by 8% since then.  There have also been cuts to secondary welfare supports for people of all ages and family types, along with a tightening of the conditions for accessing jobseeker's benefit.  In addition, between 2008 and 2013, the proportion of citizens experiencing deprivation almost trebled to 29%, and over one third of children and one in five working people were classified as experiencing deprivation.  These are stark statistics.</p>  <p>  I reckon I knocked on 20,000 doors during the election campaign, and the level of deprivation I saw in Wexford was frightening.  I was truly shocked.

The changes that happened in social welfare in the past five years can be placed in two categories: those that were part of a reform system designed to encourage more people to become included in society and the economy by taking up work, and others that were done to save money.  In the next couple of years I want to start reversing the ones that were done just to save money.  To reverse them all would cost somewhere between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion, which is an enormous amount of money, but perhaps we can start doing that and restoring some of the basic weekly payments at the rate of inflation or above over the next couple of years.  That is something I would very much like to do.</p>  <p>  We touched on statistics when I mentioned the SILC data.  As the Deputy will be aware, the most recent data we have is only from 2014, but that did indicate that basic deprivation rates were starting to fall.  They fell between 2013 and 2014.

The argument has been made that the Minister is almost trying to protect young people, and people in general, from welfare dependancy.  The Minister said we could all come up with research results that suited us.  Most research shows that young people, and people in general, want to work, but it is the lack of available jobs more than the lack of motivation that is the reason so many of them are not in work.  SOLAS and F&Aacute;S carried out a survey on their training schemes and found that young people as a group were particularly willing to participate in training schemes and that only 36% in the 15 to 24 age group had found work.  I do not expect the Minister to create jobs out of nowhere, but until we can find jobs for people, we need to actively keep them out of poverty by introducing measures to do that.</p></speech>

I intend to make as good a go of this as I can, and while some people may wish to characterise the Deputy in a particular way, I know he has a more open mind and I hope he will give me a chance to do some of the things I believe both of us would like to do, because nobody wants to see poverty or deprivation in our society, and he can be sure that there is plenty of it in my constituency in West Dublin.  I am very aware of it.</p>  <p>  Not everything that happened in the past five years is a reason to be proud, but unemployment has almost halved, from 15% to under 8% now.  More jobs are becoming available.  We need to make sure that those who do not have work are able to get into those jobs.  We need to make sure that those jobs pay by increasing the minimum wage, as we will again, abolishing the universal social charge for those on low pay, which we have started already, and extending to people the kind of benefits that may assist them in staying in work, such as health benefits and dealing with the cost of child care.  These issues are major disincentives to work.  There are a small number of people who perhaps do not want to be in work, and a different approach is required in that sense.</p></speech>

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates to recipients under 26 years of age.</p>  <p>  This is a targeted measure aimed at preventing young people from drifting into welfare dependency.  To guard against the development of welfare dependency, it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme, he or she will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  Young jobseekers who lose work and have an insurance record of paying PRSI receive jobseeker's benefit at the same rate as others.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for quarter 1 of 2016, which was published yesterday, youth unemployment has fallen by almost half since then and now stands at 16.9%.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.  My Department also offers a range of supports and services aimed at assisting individuals who are exiting homelessness or are at risk of homelessness.  Last year my Department made available 2,500 rent deposits and rent in advance payments at a cost of almost &euro;1.5 million, of which almost 590 payments, equating to &euro;315,000, were made to persons aged under 26 years.  That was to ensure they could get accommodation.  At the end of 2015 there were approximately 4,900 rent supplement recipients under 26, representing approximately 8% of total recipients receiving support under the scheme.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br/><br/>These payments, including exceptional needs payments, can be made at the discretion of the officers administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on a case-by-case basis and subject to the individual&rsquo;s specific needs.

Sadly, in Wexford, the rate is over 20% for the general workforce and over 30% for those under 25, which is absolutely frightening.  I do not want to go on a parish pump rant, but I must say this.  People were talking about targeting the deprivation in Dublin's inner city on Leaders' Questions, and that should be done.  I am not one to blame the Taoiseach, the Government or the Garda for people being shot lately in the inner city, but the levels of deprivation in places such as Dublin's inner city and, sadly, Wexford deserve direct targeting for action.  There are some areas that are particularly problematic and probably need very direct action from the Government.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that it is still roughly double the unemployment rate for the entire population.  It is fairly typical, based on comparisons with other countries, for youth unemployment to be roughly double the rate for the entire adult workforce.  That is very much related to the fact that large numbers of young people are in education.  Going back to statistics, when we look at them in a different way, there is a very different figure.  The fact that youth unemployment is double the average adult rate is very much related to the fact that so many young people are in education or doing other things.  Any young person taking up education or training receives a higher payment.  It is important that an incentive exists.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in speaking about the north inner city, as targeted action is required in the area similar to the action taken in Limerick in the past, which may well also be needed in Wexford and parts of my own constituency.  It will be about much more than just increasing welfare payments; there must be a more holistic approach.</p></speech>

As we are discussing youth unemployment, I will add that I met a couple of young people in the past few weeks, aged around 22 or 23, who are leaving the country.  They are not even on the live register, although they have no work.  They are not allowed any assistance because their parents have been deemed well off enough to look after them.  Even for those people who qualify, the rules have moved a bit in the past few years and figures have been massaged in that respect.  The core point remains that nobody can survive in Ireland on &euro;100 per week.  The cost of living in this country is too expensive for that.</p></speech>

If a person takes up one of those options, it is much higher.  We should not have people coming out of school being given &euro;188 per week without any requirement or expectation to take up education, training or work.  The &euro;100 is paid to people who do not take up education, training or a work placement.  These things are readily available, and any person should be offered such an option within four months.  I am not sure where the people the Deputy met were going, but it would be worth taking a look at the rates in Northern Ireland or Britain, for example.  It is a feature of welfare systems across Europe that there are lower rates of social welfare for people under 25, for very good reasons.  Generally speaking, the rate is lower than in Ireland, or there are more stringent conditions.  Unless the people to whom the Deputy referred are going overseas to take up employment-----</p></speech>

It has also refused to allow an independent international judicial figure to consider the files.  At this stage, the families are entitled to know the truth and have answers and justice.  The Government must make this issue an absolute priority and ensure it is solved sooner rather than later.  It must be taken seriously and be a priority for the Government.  We must be proactive and canvass international support, particularly from the US, to ensure these files and papers can be made available and we can know exactly what happened.  The families should be able to get answers to their questions.  The other issue that must be raised by the Government is the referral of these matters to the European Court of Human Rights.  We are at that stage now, as we have gone for 42 years without any answers.  I want to see the Government taking the matter seriously and solving it once and for all by canvassing international support and taking it to the European courts.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his work.  I commend the work of Justice for the Forgotten, which has been a strong and effective advocate on behalf of many victims and families of victims.  Over the years I have worked closely with Margaret Urwin and her colleagues, who have been very effective representatives and advocates for families of the bereaved.  We know very well that the process of trying to get justice for many families has been absolutely frustrating and painful and the result has been totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  For our country to truly move forward, we must put in place mechanisms for dealing with the legacies of the past.  Victims and survivors of atrocities, whether North or South, have a basic entitlement to the truth.  The most evil of crimes, including large-scale murder, were witnessed on this island, perpetrated by paramilitary organisations.  Some British State forces were also involved in the most heinous of crimes.  For the families concerned, the truth must be forthcoming.</p>  <p>  I join other Members of this House in calling again on the British Government to remove all obstacles to full and proper investigations into the bombings and murder of innocent people in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974.  Over the past number of years, I have had meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, and her predecessors, and also with the British Ambassador.</p><p>I raised each time with them the need for the British Government to respond positively to the unanimous call of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for British co-operation with a full and proper investigation of the Monaghan and Dublin bombings.  I took the opportunity consistently in this House to raise these issues and to raise the total non-response by the British Government to the unanimous motions passed here in May 2008 and in 2001 regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the need for an eminent legal person to have access to the papers and files pertaining to them.<br/><br/>We are all aware that in the period known as the Troubles there were many days of terrible anguish, suffering and murder on this island, caused by paramilitary groups, some masquerading as so-called republicans and some masquerading as so-called loyalists.  Unfortunately, many people were murdered through the collusion of the British state forces as well.  I think of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and of the bombing in Belturbet in my own county in December 1972.  Again, we have the British Government trotting out the lame excuse of national security considerations in regard to the details that might become available to the institutions that were proposed in the Stormont House Agreement more than 12 months ago.  It is essential that the methods proposed in that agreement would be advanced and that the British Government would co-operate fully and not put a road block in the way of those institutions, which could be so beneficial if they were established.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned many times in this House earlier today, we are all aware that unfortunately in May 1974 some 34 people were murdered in Dublin and Monaghan and 300 people injured.  Nobody has been brought to justice for this.  Those atrocities resulted in the highest number of casualties on any one day during that difficult era commonly referred to as the Troubles.  The UVF, a loyalist paramilitary group, claimed responsibility for the bombings, but there are credible allegations that elements of the British security forces colluded with the UVF in those bombings.  There have been many incidences in which nobody was brought to justice for horrific crimes.<br/><br/>It is important that we constantly remind ourselves of the very good work carried out by Anne Cadwallader<font color="#FF0000"></font>in her publication <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>, in which she refers to 120 murders committed by loyalist paramilitaries and the clear evidence that some of them were armed from UDR depots.  Only one person of those 120 had an association with a paramilitary group; one person was a member or was associated with the IRA at that time.  The rest were all innocent people, involved in the GAA, the SDLP and other general community groups.  They were murdered by loyalists and in many instances those loyalists were armed from UDR depots.  It is appalling that no progress has been made in bringing about justice and having a thorough, necessary and genuine investigation into the murders.  I also want to quote today, as I did previously, another extract from Anne Cadwallader's book.</p><blockquote>In between the Dublin Bombings of 1st December 1972 and the 20th January, 1973, Fermanagh-based members of the UDR and UVF carried out three bombings within an hour - Clones (County Monaghan) Belturbet (County Cavan) and Pettigo (County Donegal) - all on 28th December 1972.  Two teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly (aged fifteen) [from Belturbet] and Paddy Stanley (aged sixteen) [from Clara, County Offaly], were killed in Belturbet.</blockquote><p>I am very glad that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is here.  She will recall that on numerous occasions I have raised the case of the Belturbet bombings and the need for a full investigation into the horrific murder of two teenagers on that fateful December day.  We need to have the co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities.  People on the street will talk about who was responsible for those murders.  That is no good to the families of those two young teenagers who were murdered on that night.  Again, the Government, through An Taoiseach and at Government level, must insist that the British Government respond magnanimously and positively to the unanimous call of this House in May 2008, in May 2011 and again today.  It is well beyond time that the victims get the truth, which is the least they deserve.  Unfortunately, that has not been forthcoming.</p></speech>

I extend my gratitude to Justice for the Forgotten for continuing to carry the torch regarding this very dark moment in our past, particularly in Monaghan town in my constituency.</p>  <p>  Previous inquiries by Mr. Justice Barron have raised serious concerns over non-co-operation by the British Government, with efforts to uncover who was responsible.  Relatives of the victims continue to campaign to have their claims of state collusion with paramilitaries fully explored, with complete access to British files.  These families and the relatives of the 3,500 victims of the Troubles deserve the truth through a clear, reliable mechanism.  Prime Minister David Cameron has previously refused to release all the files on the issue, stating that all appropriate materials have been released.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has consistently supported the relatives and raised the issue of full access to the files at every available opportunity when meeting with British officials and politicians.  The failure in the Fresh Start agreement to agree on the best mechanism to deal with the past must be addressed.</p>  <p>  Families who have lost loved ones in the Troubles on both sides deserve the truth.  On 17 May 1974, two car bombs exploded in the centre of Dublin.  They were detonated simultaneously and timed and placed to cause the maximum level of carnage and disruption, while leaving escape routes free for the attackers.  Some hours later a fourth bomb, apparently intended to divert police and security forces from individuals trying to cross back from the Republic into the North of Ireland, exploded in my own constituency, in the border town of Monaghan.  Twenty-seven people were killed in Dublin and six in Monaghan.</p>  <p>  There needs to be a clear route to address the outstanding legacy of those dark days of the Troubles.  Today's motion is one aspect of that.  The British Government should take the lead and open their files to an independent investigation.  The families and communities devastated by these atrocities deserve the truth.</p></speech>

Their contributions reaffirm to the House the deep and lasting effects of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings even after 42 years.  I also recognise the members of the families who are here with us today.  These bombings were callous and unjustifiable acts of brutality against innocent and defenceless people.  They were acts of violence that were offences not only against the victims, but against all right-thinking people.  These were terrorist atrocities in the truest sense of that chilling phrase which, tragically, became all too familiar to us over the course of the Troubles.  As contributors to the debate on this motion have stated, the families of those killed and injured have borne the grief of those terrible events and the resulting pain is still being felt by them.  Their suffering has not gone away and the memory of their loved ones lives on with them.</p><p>As has been noted already, the late Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking inquiry into these awful events and, indeed, a number of other tragic atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which many other people lost their lives.  The Barron report provided some of the answers that the families and the public had sought about the bombings.  The subsequent hearings of the Oireachtas joint committee provided the families with a very important opportunity to have their voices heard and to tell their stories.</p> <p> However, all of those families and, indeed, all of us still have some unanswered questions about what happened, why it happened and how it happened.  The Government and this House have already clearly and unequivocally urged the British Government to allow access to its documents relevant to these events.  The Taoiseach, as he has outlined, has raised this issue directly with the British Prime Minister. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has also consistently raised the issue with his counterpart, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and it will remain as a top priority agenda item to be discussed between them.  I reassure the House that the Government will continue to press for a response.  The priority attached to this issue is reflected in the clear commitment set out in the programme for Government.  Dealing with the legacy of the violence of the troubles is not an easy task.  There is, unfortunately, no simple formula of words or actions that can put right such grave wrongs that were suffered.</p> <p> The Good Friday Agreement recognised the need for a particular acknowledgement of the position of victims, and in remembering the victims and their families we should be strengthened in our determination to construct a changed society in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is strongly committed to continuing to work in partnership with our colleagues in the British Government and in the Northern Ireland Executive to develop and establish effective ways to address the legacy of the Troubles.  The Government is fully committed to implementation of those measures agreed in the Stormont House Agreement and I earnestly hope that they may provide opportunities for the families of victims to access further information.</p> <p> As we make progress to a better future for all who share this island and those who live on the neighbouring island, we must not forget all of those who died in the violence of the Troubles, those who mourn them and those who were injured.  This motion sends a message of continued strong solidarity to the families of those who were so tragically killed in Dublin and Monaghan and, indeed, to the families of all those who lost their lives.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and I respect the sincerity of everyone who spoke with evident passion and feeling.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

Mr Justice O&rsquo;Higgins covered his terms of reference in a thorough and timely fashion.  I thank him for his comprehensive report.  Although the matters that gave rise to the commission are well known, I think it would be worthwhile to recap briefly the main points.</p>  <p>  Sergeant Maurice McCabe was serving as a sergeant at Bailieborough, County Cavan, when he became concerned about the force&rsquo;s handling of suspected criminal offences in late 2007.  His concerns were primarily about policing practice and standards relating to the quality of investigations in the Bailieboro district.  In addition, he expressed concern about compliance with proper internal Garda procedures in specific Garda investigations.  He was also concerned about the manner in which his complaints were treated.  Sergeant McCabe made a series of complaints directly to his superiors in the Garda, to the human resource management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to the confidential recipient and to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, in February 2014, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin gave me a dossier containing a note by Sergeant McCabe on a large number of different matters about which he had concerns.  I immediately brought the matter to the attention of the Government and the Government appointed senior counsel Se&aacute;n Guerin, to conduct an independent review of the allegations.  In his report, which was published in May 2014, Mr Guerin recommended the establishment of a comprehensive commission of investigation.  Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Higgins was subsequently appointed as the commission&rsquo;s sole member.  As Deputies are aware, the commission&rsquo;s report was published on 11 May 2016.  The report has been referred to the Garda Commissioner for examination and to indicate what further measures might be taken to try to prevent the type of difficulties outlined in it arising again.  It has also been referred to the Policing Authority given its statutory role in the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, resigned following publication of the Guerin report in 2014.  I am very pleased to acknowledge that the O&rsquo;Higgins report has found clearly that the former Minister acted properly at all times in relation to the handling of allegations made by Maurice McCabe.  In response to a request from the former Minister, I would also like to take the opportunity to correct the D&aacute;il record of 7 May 2014.  I am happy to state on the record that the former Minister, in resigning, did not in fact accept responsibility for criticism made in the Guerin report of the adequacy of the Department and Minister for Justice and Equality in responding to allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  The former Minister set out his reasons clearly in his letter of resignation.</p>  <p>  In recent correspondence, the former Minister, Mr. Shatter, has raised a number of other serious issues regarding the Guerin report.  These relate to ongoing litigation in the courts.  For that reason, it is not possible for me to respond to these points until that process has been completed.  The Government will respond when that litigation is resolved, taking account of the relevant court judgements.</p>  <p>  Mr. Shatter also made a number of suggestions as to how any future preliminary or scoping investigations should operate.  I believe that these suggestions merit further examination and consideration.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise, as I did at the time of his resignation, that Alan Shatter was an exceptionally hard-working, radical and reforming Minister who has left a positive legacy across the wide range of areas for which he had ministerial responsibility.  As Taoiseach, I again thank him for his service, both as a Minister and as a D&aacute;il Deputy over many years.</p>  <p>  The O&rsquo;Higgins report highlights many significant failings in relation to the incidents it investigated and makes a series of recommendations for change.  While it is important that we debate these findings, we must always remember to keep the focus on the victims of crime, many of whom were not well served in the cases examined by the commission.  It is also important to put on record that a significant programme of reform has been under way since these events took place.  Most important, a new independent Policing Authority has been established to oversee the performance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services.  I believe the new Policing Authority will prove to be the key structural change to ensure modernisation and reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the months and years ahead.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, the previous Government held an open and independent selection process for the position of Garda Commissioner.  Legislation was enacted in early 2015 to strengthen the role and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, including the power to investigate complaints against the Garda Commissioner.  The Protected Disclosures Act was part of the previous Government's comprehensive approach to protect whistleblowers.</p><p>It provides a new mechanism for disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now a Garda member may make a protected disclosure to GSOC, which, if it believes it is in the public interest to do so, may investigate such a complaint.</p> <p> The last Government also established an independent review mechanism which has made recommendations on 320 allegations of Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of such allegations.  The Garda Inspectorate has also published a number of reports recommending substantial reforms to Garda operations.  Taking together previous reports of the Garda Inspectorate and the recommendations of the O&rsquo;Higgins report, as well as those of previous inquiries and commissions of investigation, we now have a huge agenda of reform being progressed.</p> <p> I understand that the Garda Commissioner has recently finalised a new transformation programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which takes account of many of these recommendations.  To support the reform process, the Government has also committed to significant capital investment in the Garda fleet, ICT infrastructure and building projects.  I believe the previous Government made significant progress in ensuring that issues of the type that gave rise to the Guerin report and other controversies do not happen again.</p> <p> I wish to assure the House that this Government will build on the progress being made.  The programme for Government commits to a strong and visible police force in every community.  We aim to bring Garda numbers to 15,000, to double the Garda Reserve and to increase civilianisation to free up garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Other reforms we have committed to include measures to increase public confidence in policing, enhancing the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, reviewing the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersal of Garda stations, tackling crime gangs, stopping repeat offenders, and modernising our courts and legal system.  The Government has re-established the Cabinet committee on justice reform to oversee progress on this reform agenda.</p> <p> The O&rsquo;Higgins report is further confirmation of the need for fundamental modernisation and reform of policing in Ireland.  I believe that we now have the structures, resources and policies to make that reform happen.  This Government, under the leadership of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, will focus our energy on delivering a police service fit for Ireland and its people in the 21st century.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500031#EE00400"><p>I welcome this opportunity to debate the report of the O&rsquo;Higgins commission.  Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Higgins is a distinguished retired judge of the High Court, and I take the opportunity to formally record my thanks and appreciation to him for his thorough, thoughtful and clear report on matters which, as we know, were far from clear when this process started.  We were fortunate to engage the expertise, experience and wisdom of a man with decades of immersion in the judicial system and all the insights derived from that.  The O'Higgins commission was conducted to the highest professional standards and the O'Higgins report is clear and unequivocal.</p><p>Last Saturday I attended, with An Taoiseach, a ceremony in Dublin Castle commemorating the 88 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have fallen in the line of duty.  Inevitably, it was moving to be there, and all the more so when collectively we tried to comfort those who had recently been bereaved by the loss of the young garda lives taken away by very evil individuals.  It struck me that whatever controversies arise in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whatever the problems that need to be addressed, we should never fail to show our support and appreciation for the work they do.  Since its foundation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has served this State well.  We in this House are not the people who put our lives on the line to keep our communities safe.</p><p>Yesterday, we saw yet more bloodshed in a gang feud that is being carried out with unprecedented ruthlessness.  This House will have other opportunities to discuss gangland crime in more detail, but I want to make one thing clear: whatever resources are needed and however long it takes, the activities of these gangs and others will be confronted head-on.  Of its nature it takes time, but the Garda has defeated gangs and others who believed themselves untouchable before, and they are determined to do so again.</p><p>I want to express my full support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at every level for the work it is doing to confront these gangs and for meeting the daily concerns of ordinary people in trying to keep them safe.  That, of course, does not mean An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be immune from criticism.  The importance of the work the Garda does makes it all the more vital that it be done right.  However, I believe it is important that the criticism should have a clear aim: to bring about the improvements that will make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the world-class policing service that we all want it to be.</p><p>The O'Higgins commission report sets out real problems which quite simply have to be addressed.  My priorities are clear.  We need to do everything we can to ensure victims are not let down again in the way that is detailed in the report and we need to ensure that where wrongdoing by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is reported, it is dealt with properly and the persons alleging wrongdoing are protected.  We often talk of drawing a line under bad episodes in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not buy that for a moment.  It is not about drawing lines under anything.  Instead, it is about rooting out bad practice and establishing proper, durable and sustainable policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence.  Reform must be the watchword of the organisation, and reform can never stop.</p><p>Since its publication, much of the debate on the report has been overshadowed by controversy about what may or may not have been said during parts of the proceedings of the commission.  I could devote much of this speech to repeating at great length the arguments I made here last week.  We entrusted a commission of investigation with the task of looking into all these matters, and that is exactly what the commission did.  The Commission was held in private session for a very good reason.  In any such examination of the behaviour or misbehaviour of individuals at any level within a State body, it was and always will be vital that witnesses can give testimony and be questioned about it in a safe situation, where they can tell the truth as they believe it, without seeing their evidence in the newspapers the following day.  That protection of witnesses is pivotal - it is crucial - to the establishment of commissions of inquiry in the future.  I will not remind the House of the debates we had here in respect of tribunals versus commissions and why we had the commission of inquiry legislation.</p><p>I believe the right thing to do is to accept fully Mr. Justice O'Higgins's report.  It is hard to see how any public interest is served by seeking to re-run its work. <b></b>I do, of course, understand the concern that has arisen in respect of some of the matters that have been reported, and I believe it is in the public interest to address these matters within the constraints that apply.  I said in the House last week that, despite the difficulties, I was sure the Garda Commissioner would try to put further information into the public domain if it proved feasible and legal to do so.  This morning she has done so, and I have arranged for each Deputy to receive a copy of that statement for information purposes.  I believe she has made a genuine attempt to deal with these matters as fully as possible, given the very real constraints under which she is compelled to operate.</p><p>I welcome the fact that there is a meeting of the Policing Authority with the Garda Commissioner tomorrow and, although I do not wish to interfere in any way with the independence of that authority, it is of course open to the authority to address these matters, within the constraints which apply, at a public meeting at some stage in the future.  It is only recently that the Oireachtas set up the authority as an independent oversight mechanism for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it should be allowed an opportunity to do its work.  I want to emphasise that I continue to have every confidence in the Garda Commissioner.  She faces the same challenges faced in the transformation of any large organisation and the particular challenge of doing so while meeting the daily demands, as we see today, placed on an organisation charged with protecting the people and the State from crime.</p><p>The statement from the Garda Commissioner speaks for itself, but there are two matters arising from it that I want to mention to the House.  The Commissioner has asked me to use the legal powers available to me to ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to investigate matters alleged to have occurred in respect of a meeting in Mullingar involving certain officers.  I want to tell the House that I intend to do this and I am consulting with the Attorney General about the precise nature of such a referral.  I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has requested this action and I recognise, as I am sure other Deputies do, that this issue has led to significant public concern.  It is right that we try to establish the truth of the matter.</p><p>I also want to address the broader issue of whistleblowing.  No one should underestimate the difficult issues confronting any organisation when whistleblowing takes place, which include balancing the rights of those making allegations with the rights of those against whom allegations are made.  There is no point in pretending that these difficulties are not of their very nature all the greater in an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>When a person's job can involve great dangers and she has to confront people who will not hesitate to harm her, she needs to know that those she works with support her in these difficult tasks.  That is human reality.  However, what can be a great virtue in some circumstances can become a great vice in others.  While ranks have to be closed against those who pose dangers to the community, they should never be closed against the truth, however unpalatable that truth is.</p> <p> The lesson from the O'Higgins report is clear.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only benefit from taking seriously allegations of wrongdoing by its members, valuing them and supporting those who bring these matters to light.  We never again want to see the situation in which Maurice McCabe found himself, nor do we want to see people having to live for long periods under the shadow of unfounded allegations.</p> <p> We have changed the law.  The former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, brought in the Protected Disclosures Act to ensure a sea-change in the options open to those who want to report wrongdoing.  Now any garda can have complaints independently examined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and that is already happening.  Of course everyone in the House will recognise that laws of themselves do not change culture.  This requires a relentless reinforcement of the values of the organisation led from the top.  While I believe there has been clear progress, it is in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the public interest to get independent verification of that.  Therefore, I can tell the House today that I will be using the powers available to me under the legislation establishing the Policing Authority to ask the authority to conduct a detailed examination of the procedures and policies around whistleblowing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to prepare a report on the matter to include any recommendations necessary to ensure those arrangements operate to best practice.  We have the law now.  We need to look at the culture and the implementation of that law.</p> <p> Policy is only part of the approach to whistleblowing.  Talk of change must be matched by evidence of real cultural change.  This is how trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be maintained and safeguarded.</p> <p> I will touch on the background to this report.  The genesis of this report was a number of serious allegations made and well-publicised relating to Garda investigations.  The Taoiseach asked Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin to review the action taken in respect of those allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Mr. Guerin reported in May 2014.  His review was an initial non-statutory examination of these matters.  The principal conclusion of the Guerin report, accepted at the time by the Government, was that a full commission of investigation should be established with all of the statutory powers available to such inquiries in order that everyone would know exactly what had taken place.  The Government accepted this recommendation and agreed to establish the O'Higgins commission of investigation.  As a result of the decision taken by the Government at the time in this regard we now know from the commission that there were serious failings and shortcomings in how some of these investigations were conducted.  That is something that I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Government take seriously.</p> <p> Mr. Justice O'Higgins presented his report to me on 25 April.  I published the report on 11 May following legal advice from the Attorney General and engagement with the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure there was nothing in it which might prejudice any criminal proceedings pending or in progress.  The Government and I accept the conclusions of the O'Higgins report and will act on them.</p> <p> I very much appreciate that the events outlined in the report have been traumatic for many people who have been affected by them.  It would be an injustice to those who brought matters to light in the public interest and those who have lived under their shadow for a long time if we did not take on board the lessons from these events.  It is worth reminding ourselves of the balanced findings of Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  He described Sergeant McCabe as a man of integrity who had performed a genuine public service at considerable personal cost.  He is due the gratitude not only of the public but of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this House.</p> <p> The report is clear on serious failings in certain investigations.  Again, we have to recognise the public service performed by having brought these to notice.  However, it cannot go without comment that the report also found certain allegations of corruption against senior officers not to be true.  Indeed, with regard to former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, the report makes this point: "It must be stated clearly and unambiguously that there is not a scintilla of evidence to support an allegation of any type of corruption against the former commissioner."</p> <p> In the case of other senior officers, the commission found that what the judge described as hurtful complaints of corruption were unfounded and pointed out that the people involved had to live for many years under the strain of these allegations.  It is important to put on the record that the report has shown that my predecessor, the former Minister, Mr. Shatter, and the officials in the Department of Justice and Equality acted properly at all times in handling the issues that came to them.  We should recognise the contribution Alan Shatter has made to public life and in particular the many achievements, especially in the legislative sphere, of his time as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Far from finding the slightest fault with the approach of Alan to any of these serious matters, the report uses descriptions such as "appropriate" and "entirely reasonable" to characterise his behaviour in all the matters involved.</p> <p> The report must be considered carefully in its totality.  As I have said already, we must all learn the lessons from it.  The report identifies cases where victims of crime were failed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is as unacceptable as it is disheartening and we must take all actions open to us to ensure these shortcomings are not repeated.</p> <p> I met Mary and George Lynch on Monday.  Mary's bravery both on the night of her attack and since then in telling her story is an absolute inspiration to us all.  I can say as much from having spoken to her and her husband and having listened to her recount her entire experience to me over this period.  Her experience as a victim should be heard by every new and current member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mary told me she had lost trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p> We must re-establish that trust between victims of crime and the Garda.  Victims must be at the heart of the Garda service.  In the past, the needs of victims of crime have sometimes been overshadowed by a focus on apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators.  I have said repeatedly that we need a sea change across the entire justice system in the approach to victims.  We must ensure our response to criminal behaviour is comprehensive while putting the needs of victims at the forefront.</p> <p> The Taoiseach has outlined a number of reforms that have taken place already and I will refer to some of these briefly.  Many are relevant to the findings in the report and the matters it addressed.  We have the new independent Policing Authority.  It has already held its first public hearing.  We have the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  We have the Freedom of Information Act that was extended under the previous Government to include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have had the Garda Inspectorate comprehensive report on crime investigation published in 2014.  I do not have time to go into the details of the actions that have been taken already in this regard.  Suffice it to say that a series of reforms have been undertaken, including the Central Statistics Office, CSO, carrying out work on the figures released by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as a range of other areas.  There is a commitment to increase the numbers in the Garda and the Garda Reserve and investment in CCTV.</p> <p> It is worth reminding ourselves about the investment the previous Government made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including well in excess of &euro;200 million in ICT, an area that had been shamefully neglected but which has now been brought up to date.  This will allow the force to deal with the demands a modern police force faces nationally and internationally.  The purchase of 1,300 new Garda vehicles is being facilitated by a major investment of &euro;34 million.  A total of 720 new vehicles have come on stream since the start of last year.  We have seen the powers of GSOC enhanced.  We have seen how the role and remit of the ombudsman commission has been strengthened, including the power to investigate complaints against the Garda Commissioner.  This is a significant new departure and should serve to increase confidence in the accountability of the Commissioner and the force as a whole.  I believe these initiatives, in particular, the legislative reform, the new authority, the strengthened legislation and the new investment, have helped to increase both the confidence we want to see in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and accountability as well.</p> <p> As I said at the beginning of my contribution, there is no doubt that more remains to be done.  However, I will return to a point I made earlier.  There is no end to reform.  This is an ongoing journey of practical and cultural change.  I have emphasised throughout my contribution the need for that cultural change.</p><p>It is one thing to have policy and law and another to have implementation and the kind of cultural and values change we are speaking about today.  As our country and society change, so too must An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue its journey as an organisation that faces outward, embraces change and protects whistleblowers.  I imagine that is what everybody in this House wants to see.  In most cases, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na depends on moral persuasion instead of armed force.  Moral persuasion depends on public trust and public trust is earned by professionalism, high standards, honesty and openness.  That is what we expect, and that is what I expect, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p> <p> The first Garda commission envisaged an unarmed force dependent on moral suasion.  That requires that every member of the force, every day, wins the trust of members of the public, because trust is the currency of our police service.  I, garda&iacute; and the Garda Commissioner accept that there were failings and there must be change.  I and the Government will do everything possible to support the ongoing reform of the force and I look forward to working with everyone in this House, particularly the new committee on justice and spokespersons on these matters.  Victims must always be at the heart of the Garda service.</p></speech>

I thank Judge O'Higgins and his team for their thorough, meticulous and comprehensive, detailed work.  It is important to point out that there was a cynical, selective leaking of the document in the weeks before its belated publication.  Such efforts to colour and dominate the debate around the findings of the commission are deeply unhelpful and threaten to undermine the lessons to be learnt from the report.  Spin can never replace substance.  There was an attempt to do that in advance of the publication.  I cannot point fingers in any direction, and I am not doing so, but it is very clearly evident.  Subsequent to publication of the report, there was selective leaking of transcripts of evidence given before the commission which caused a public controversy and debate about issues that were not addressed in the report.</p>  <p>  I note today&rsquo;s statement from the Garda Commissioner confirming that &ldquo;An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legal team was not at any stage instructed to impugn the integrity of Sergeant Maurice McCabe or to take a case that he was acting maliciously&rdquo;.  I welcome that.  It was important that the Garda Commissioner addressed the allegations that were made in the public interest.  In her statement, the Commissioner has also referred to the two senior officers who interviewed Sergeant McCabe in Mullingar in 2008 and she has &ldquo;requested the Minister for Justice pursuant to her powers within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to refer those aspects to the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) for the purpose of investigating it in the public interest&rdquo;.  I welcome that too and the Minister's decision to ask the Attorney General for advice on that.  It would appear that if Sergeant McCabe had not produced his tape of the Mullingar interview, the outcome of this commission report might have been very different.  This is not acceptable and should be investigated.</p>  <p>  In the selective spinning in advance of this report's publication there were attempts made to undermine the entirety of the Guerin report.  Mr. Guerin is very straight and he says particularly in his conclusion and recommendations  that "It should be recorded here that the Byrne-McGinn report found that:'No malice on the part of Sergeant McCabe is established in the making of his various complaints'".  He added that all his interviews with Sergeant McCabe led him to "no different conclusion".  He then quotes the testimony of the men and women who worked with Sergeant McCabe.  Chief Superintendent Gabriel Mclntyre said: "I found Sergeant McCabe to be very positive and energetic in his position. He displayed a strong work ethic with a strong emphasis in community policing and to providing a high standard of policing to the community."  Detective Superintendent Eugene Corcoran said: "I found Sergeant McCabe to be capable and enthusiastic in his approach to his duties."  Retired Superintendent Liam Hogan said: "I considered Sergeant McCabe to be an excellent Sergeant and member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He offered 200% commitment and was my one of my most reliable members in the District."  Superintendent M. Lernihan said: "I found [Sergeant McCabe] to be efficient, flexible and committed."  That is important in the context of all the controversy there has been in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  While I accept that everybody has to be tested in their testimony to a commission, if one decodes some of the language in the Garda Commissioner's statement today, there is a strong sense that there was an adversarial approach taken to Sergeant Maurice McCabe in his testimony by the Garda counsel, as opposed to an inquisitorial one, which was advanced to us here the previous week.  That is my sense of a particular paragraph in the Commissioner's statement.  </p>  <p>  The contents of the O'Higgins commission report raises issues of the utmost concern to every citizen and also to the victims of crime.  I urge people to read the full report because it is quite shocking.  The report also makes important recommendations on victim impact statements.  The Minister is correct in her description of Mary Lynch as being an invaluable witness for articulating the degree to which a victim was let down by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this incident.  I have met the siblings of Sylvia Roche-Kelly who were left out of the loop for quite a long time in respect of the murder of their sister by Jerry McGrath.  Even though there is a right to furnish a victim impact statement in all courts, it is not always availed of in practice.  The commission rightly recommends that &ldquo;a victim impact statement where relevant should be furnished in all courts&rdquo;.  The commission also recommends that Directive 2012/29/EU dealing with the rights of victims be implemented as soon as possible.  This should be possible if there is all party agreement to introduce same in the interest of our citizens.</p>  <p>  There is no more important or fundamental role for the State than the protection of its citizens.  The people depend on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to feel safe in their communities and to uphold the rule of law.  We all recognise that garda&iacute; have endured dark and difficult days, standing against profound threats to our State.  On a daily basis, they face immense personal risk.  A total of 88 garda&iacute; have given their lives in the line of duty.  Their work and sacrifice is the cornerstone of a safe and secure society.  That is why it is so important for the national Parliament to hold the force to account and ensure we achieve and maintain the highest possible standards.</p>  <p>  The O&rsquo;Higgins commission report raises concerns that need to be addressed to secure that goal.  The report is 362 pages long and its contents are quite shocking.  Its establishment was recommended by the Guerin report and I believe the commission of inquiry was very necessary as there were too many accusations and too many attempts to sweep very serious issues under the carpet.  This report vindicates the central recommendation of the Guerin report.  There is a net issue between Mr. Guerin and Mr. Justice O'Higgins in terms of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter, and his decision not to go beyond Byrne-McGinn.  Byrne-McGinn's report and its inadequacies are fairly significantly highlighted in the O'Higgins report in several areas.  Given the details around Jerry McGrath's murder of Sylvia Roche-Kelly and the sequence of events that led to it, people should have gone more deeply into this case than they did.  That is my personal opinion.  It is an arguable point but I make it strongly.  It jumped out at me when I read the dossier and what happened.  We have to learn lessons about communication and lack of communication.  The Guerin report did not cause the resignation of the former Minister.  The Taoiseach made clear to the then Minister what had to happen when he presented him with the Guerin report.  The former Minister has focused too much on saying that the Guerin caused his resignation.  That is not what happened.  Even before we discussed the Guerin report in this House, the Minister had resigned, saying he was doing so for political reasons because of the forthcoming local elections.</p>  <p>  The administration of justice has been assailed by a series of controversies since 2014.  There has been deep frustration amongst ordinary rank and file garda&iacute;, as they are demoralised by the onslaught of cutbacks and a series of revelations and issues.  I am also very worried that the cultural change needed in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers or any staff member who highlights the need for change is too slow and in some cases non-existent.  This has to change rapidly.  It is vital that we draw on the lessons contained in this report to renew and re-build the central role our police force plays in our communities.</p><p> Garda&iacute; need to be allocated proper resources and given proper training to do this.  There is an urgent need to improve morale.</p> <p> This report is one of many over the past number of years.  It cannot be condemned to the administrative gulag of the top shop.  At the heart of this commission of investigation are a number of serious cases, ranging from savage attacks on people to a brutal murder.  These cases altered lives, devastated families and damaged communities.  Behind this voluminous report victims are still struggling to patch the torn fabric of their lives back together.  We owe it to them to ensure the recommendations in the report are fully implemented.  The victims need to receive more support to deal with what has happened to them.  Our debate on this matter should not lose sight of that or descend into petty point-scoring.  How we respond to the tragic impact these cases have had on the victims and their families will be the ultimate measure of our success in dealing with this report.</p> <p> In early 2014 I approached Sergeant Maurice McCabe, who had a dossier chronicling a series of fundamental problems in the Bailieborough district.  The scale and depth of the issues raised pointed towards systematic failings in the area.  I found Sergeant McCabe to be a decent, honourable and reliable witness.  On that basis, I raised the issue on the floor of the House.  I discussed the issue with others.  I submitted papers and the dossier to the Taoiseach so that Sergeant McCabe's concerns and allegations could be investigated properly.  At that stage, I called for a commission of investigation.  This was not a partisan political attack or crude agenda-driven stunt.  Rather, it was due diligence and the responsible thing to do.  The detail covered in the report of the commission over some ten chapters illustrates the gravity of the difficulties in the Cavan-Monaghan division, and I understand the Taoiseach came to the same conclusion, having read the dossier.  Policing in the area was critically undermined by myriad errors and inaction.  A cocktail of poor to non-existent supervisory structures, an over-reliance on probationary garda&iacute; and a lack of communication with the victims led to profound failures, including a failure to properly investigate crimes and the murder of Sylvia Roche-Kelly.  The judge commented on the various lines of communication that were not full or comprehensive enough between garda&iacute; in different stations and the courts.</p> <p> The frequency and seriousness of the endemic problems uncovered vindicates the recommendations of the Guerin report that a formal commission of investigation be established.  The lessons to be drawn extend beyond the geographic area covered by the report.  The entire force must ensure that the misconduct and failure of performance charted in the report does not occur again.  Furthermore, the findings of the commission underlined the staunch reliability of Sergeant McCabe and exonerate the former Commissioner Martin Callinan, which is important and which I welcome.</p> <p> It should be noted for the record of the House that the report found that Sergeant Maurice McCabe performed a genuine public service at considerable personal cost, and for this he is due the gratitude not only of the general public but also of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must always remember that dissent is not disloyalty.  Sergeant McCabe had the common good at heart in his actions.  He has endured a turbulent personal period in pursuit of what he believed was right.  His dogged commitment to uncovering the corrosive practices that were eroding the integrity of the force in his area have set a precedent.  His example is one that will be seen by whistleblowers elsewhere, not just in the Garda but in industries, companies and sectors across the country and economy.</p> <p> There were some internal attempts to demonstrate that Sergeant McCabe was an untrustworthy character, but they had no basis.  There was a lot of innuendo at the time, which was unacceptable.  People sidled up to Sergeant McCabe and said things about his character.  There were sinister efforts to pin the blame for the issues in Bailieborough, such as the missing computer in the Father Molloy case, on Sergeant McCabe.  I understand Mr. Justice O'Higgins was quite strong on that, but wondered aloud why Sergeant McCabe was the only individual brought forward for disciplinary action.  That particular chapter is required reading for everybody.  These attempts were rightly exposed in the report.  An earlier section of the report deals with the GSOC investigation into the Mary Lynch case.  Again, were it not for the fact that Sergeant McCabe recorded the conversation, he would have been put in the frame for doing something he did not do.</p> <p> Such petty and damaging accusations send a clear and chilling message to whistleblowers that they will be systematically targeted and undermined.  This cannot be tolerated in any workplace, particularly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has a responsibility to uphold the law.  Against that backdrop, support and backing from the hierarchy is vital to facilitate whistleblowers in calling out problems in their organisations.  I welcome the statement of the Minister in that regard today, which added to the Commissioner's statement on the action that she is taking on the issue.  The chasm between the private and public accounts we have discussed matters.  In the Commissioner's statement today, she confirmed that a protected disclosure manager will be appointed within the Garda, which is welcomed, as is what the Minister said today.  The Commissioner also confirmed that a dedicated team which will be appropriately trained to oversee all matters relating to whistleblowers will be appointed.</p> <p> Efforts to reform and improve the Garda are dependent on the Commissioner's strong and committed leadership.  In the absence of that, moves towards a culture shift will fall on barren ground.  We need real transparency on this issue in order to drive reform.</p> <p> Media reports over the weekend pointed out other prominent examples of whistleblowers in the force and further highlighted what is at stake.  The sheer weight of the claims involved strikes at the core of the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is critical to the long-term integrity of the force that whistleblowers be facilitated and their claims fully and fairly investigated.  We cannot allow future whistleblowers to be intimidated by the prospect of a methodical and comprehensive effort to undermine their character.  The Commissioner is capable of delivering on that and continuing to take the lead on reform.  It is a fertile period for reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are have been some 41 separate reports into the force in the past decade and almost 800 recommendations.  The establishment of the Policing Authority in January this year represents a fundamental shift in the governance of the force.  It offers a mechanism and opportunity to help to bolster public trust in the Garda and revitalise its structures and personnel.  I welcome the statement that the authority will conduct a detailed examination of the procedures and policies around whistleblowing.</p> <p> The Policing Authority is not a panacea.  We need to be careful and keep it under constant review in terms of the impact it will have.  Just because we have set it up does not mean everything will change dramatically overnight.  We have to make sure it has the resources and breadth of remit to bring about change and improvement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, above all, to bring back confidence and self-belief to rank-and-file garda&iacute;.  Despite all of the commentary from the Government about the provision of resources, if one spoke to garda&iacute; the length and breadth of the country they would say the opposite: they would say there is one car for a particular district, or sometimes no car at all.  The recommendations of the O'Higgins report give us a fresh set of measures to implement.</p> <p> In facilitating the minority Government arrangement with Fine Gael, we were very conscious of ensuring that the explicit commitment to ramp up An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na numbers to 15,000, which was in our manifesto, be given effect, because it is absolutely essential to give the Garda some chance of dealing with the major challenges it faces.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-25a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052500034#HH00200"><p>I want to start by thanking Mr. Justice O'Higgins for the comprehensive report he produced.  It is worth noting that this commission of investigation was established on 3 February 2015, yet he was able to conclude his investigation and produce a report for the Minister by 25 April 2016, a total of 15 months.  He had to do a lot of work.  As we know from the report, he interviewed 97 witnesses, and there were a considerable number of serious complaints of regarding wrongdoing in respect of serious criminal investigations conducted by the Garda.</p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out that the commission of investigation procedure under which Mr. Justice O'Higgins carried out his work was a procedure introduced by the House in 2004.  The reason the Oireachtas introduced such a method of investigation was that we wanted something cheaper and quicker than traditional tribunals of inquiry, which can go on for too long.  It is important to point out that the primary difference between the tribunal of inquiry procedure and the commission of investigation procedure is that, in respect of the latter, the evidence and hearings are held in private.  That may be an advantage or disadvantage.  By opting for a commission of investigation we got a cheaper and quicker investigation, but we did so at the expense of ability of the public to see all aspects of the evidence produced before the chairperson of the inquiry.</p>  <p>  It is instructive to recall what would have happened if a tribunal of inquiry had been held.  The public would have been able to see the evidence given by Sergeant McCabe and his cross-examination, the other witnesses and the victims who came forward.</p><p>People in this House may be appalled by that but we should remember that it is highly unlikely that we would be in this Chamber after 15 months discussing this report had we gone down the route of a tribunal of inquiry.  For that reason, commissions of investigation are the way forward so that this House can produce quick and cheap investigative reports.<br/><br/>I am conscious that most people in the country will not have read this report.  It is important, therefore, that the public has an understanding of what the report is about.  It is also important that we as public representatives are aware of our function when it comes to looking at the failings identified in the report by Kevin O'Higgins.  As Deputy Martin mentioned, the report reveals a series of inadequate investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Cavan-Monaghan region.  The only reason those matters came to light was because of complaints that had been made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  It is important to note and to put on the record of this House that the report largely corroborates the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe.  It is also important that we note that what Kevin O'Higgins said about Sergeant McCabe is that he was &quot;a dedicated and committed member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot; who &quot;has brought to public attention certain investigations where the public was not well served.&quot;<br/><br/>Although Sergeant McCabe is an important figure in the report produced by Kevin O'Higgins, he is not the most important person.  The most important people referred to in the report are the ordinary citizens of Ireland who made complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and who were entitled to have those complaints adequately and competently investigated.  Any citizen who goes to the Garda with a criminal complaint is entitled to be confident the complaint will be properly investigated.  Without that, we do not have an adequate justice system.  Unfortunately, the criminal complaints that feature within the pages of the report were not properly investigated.  The victims of crime referred to in the report can therefore, unfortunately, legitimately say that they did not receive justice.  Everyone in this House knows that where an innocent person is wrongly convicted, that is a miscarriage of justice but, similarly, it is a miscarriage of justice when guilty people are not convicted.  That appears to be the implication of what is in the report from Judge Kevin O'Higgins.<br/><br/>It is also worthwhile mentioning on the floor of this House some of the events that were investigated and reported upon by Kevin O'Higgins so that the public will get an indication of the inadequacy identified in the report.  In the case of the Kingscourt bus incident there was clearly a failure on the part of the investigating garda to take statements from witnesses, a failure to take adequate notes, a failure to interview suspects, a failure to inquire whether the suspects had criminal records and a failure to complete an adequate report.  However, what stands out most in respect of that chapter, and it is apparent in other chapters as well, is that the investigating garda who was responsible for the investigation was a young probationer guard.  There was a clear absence of supervision of the young guard in respect of the investigation he was conducting.  One of the most important issues that can be extracted from the report is that the Garda must implement a new system of supervision so that young, probationary garda&iacute;, or whoever is in charge of a Garda investigation, is adequately supervised.  It is not tenable that one can have a garda investigating a serious criminal complaint without the garda being adequately supervised.  It is also unfair on young garda&iacute; coming into the force if they are left on their own without adequate supervision in respect of what they are doing.<br/><br/>Other speakers have referred to the chapter on Ms Mary Lynch, an extremely tragic chapter.  What<b></b>the report indicates is that the vicious assault to which she was subjected on 30 April 2007 by Jerry McGrath should have resulted in a charge against him under section 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, as opposed to a charge under section 2.  That might seem a minor misclassification but it was not; it was a very serious misclassification.  The detail of the assault against Ms Lynch, to which the Minister previously referred, was horrific.  It was a serious assault.  However, by charging Mr. McGrath under section 2, the summary offence, as opposed to section 3, the alleged crime was misclassified on the system as being a minor offence.  We do not know what might have happened in different circumstances, but what we do know is that Mr. McGrath appeared before the District Court in Tipperary in respect of another offence on 30 October 2007 when he sought a bail application, and he was granted bail.  However, as Judge O'Higgins outlined, had it been the case that the judge in the District Court at the time had been informed that Mr. McGrath was charged under section 3, making it a serious offence, which he was not, that might have affected the decision of the court to grant bail.  Tragically, we know that on 8 December 2007, while Mr. McGrath was out on bail he murdered Ms Sylvia Roche-Kelly.<br/><br/>There was also the incident in Cafolla's Restaurant, which involved a complaint by the owner of a fish and chipper about the fact that some men had come in and emptied the bottles of vinegar and replaced them with urine.  She went to the Garda.  She was entitled to have her complaint adequately investigated.  The report, unfortunately, records<b></b>that the garda&iacute; thought the incident funny.  However, even if they did think it funny, it was essential that they carry out a proper investigation.  Ms Cafolla was entitled to have her complaint investigated and she was entitled to be told honestly what was happening to the investigation and not to be told that the file had gone to the DPP when that was not the case.<br/><br/>We also know in respect of the assault in Cootehill, to which Kevin O'Higgins devotes another chapter, that there was a very serious offence in which a 17 year old girl was assaulted when she was walking home.  Again, that criminal investigation was fundamentally flawed.  There was inordinate delay in the investigation, no identification parade even though there was a suspect, the investigation file was incomplete with sergeants failing to provide statements and again, the notes were inadequate.<br/><br/>The incident in connection with Crossan's public house<b></b>involved a man being assaulted outside a pub and sustaining injuries to his head.  Citizens who are subjected to such assaults are entitled to know that we have a justice system that will seek to bring the perpetrators of those crimes to justice.  We cannot get justice unless the Garda conducts the investigation of those criminal complaints in a competent and adequate manner.  We know from Kevin O'Higgins' report that the investigating garda simply did not investigate this criminal complaint.  He then went out of his way to cover himself by asking the complainant to withdraw the complaint, and the complaint was then withdrawn, but it should have been properly investigated, and there was an inordinate delay on the part of the Garda in doing so.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the case of the Fr. Michael Molloy investigation, which involved a complaint by a man that his son had been sexually abused by Michael Molloy.  The investigation had major flaws in that search warrants were defective, there was a failure to have the computer forensically examined and then the computer itself was lost.  As Deputy Martin mentioned, it was surprising that the only person who was subjected to a disciplinary inquiry in respect of the loss of the computer was Sergeant McCabe, even though he was not even the exhibits officer in the case.<br/><br/>The reason I have referred to those examples from the report of Kevin O'Higgins is that we in this House must recognise that those victims of crimes were badly let down by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and they were badly let down by the State.  Our concern is that such errors might extend beyond the region of Cavan-Monaghan.  It is our job as legislators, and it is the Government's job as the entity responsible for the political direction of the force, to ensure that proper management structures are instilled and installed into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not tenable that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can continue as it is without there being a fundamental reform in the management and supervision within the force.  The absence of supervision and proper management is unfair to young garda&iacute; joining the force.  Every young person who starts a job is entitled to be properly trained.  However, it is most unfair to the people of Ireland, particularly those who may be subjected to a criminal attack.  They are entitled to the protection of the State and that protection cannot apply unless the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adequately investigates offences.<br/><br/>A lot of public attention has centred on what the Commissioner's senior counsel said to Sergeant McCabe.  One of the sacrifices the House makes when it opts for a commission of investigation in that we do not get to see the cross-examination and the evidence of the witnesses.  The benefit is that we get the result much quicker.  However, it is worth pointing out that the question about Sergeant McCabe's integrity was answered conclusively in the report.  Kevin O'Higgins viewed him as being &quot;never less than truthful in his evidence&quot;.  It is clear that Sergeant McCabe was a man of integrity.  That question has been answered.  I also welcome the statement made by the Garda Commissioner today in respect of the issue, which did give rise to public disquiet and concern last week and the previous week.  In particular, there is the issue as to what happened in the meeting in Mullingar in 2008.</p></speech>
