Will the Minister focus on the need to develop within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces a dedicated cyber-defence unit?  Could the signals intelligence unit be the body to play that role?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400003#A00600"><p>This is a relevant question in the context of the White Paper and the changing security concerns.  The growth of cyber threats to critical private, government and defence networks requires a co-ordinated response at national and EU level across member states.  There is a need to focus on advanced collaboration between the public and private sectors.  The response to the cyber threat remains a whole-of-government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources taking the lead role and inputs in the security domain from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer works closely with Departments in this regard.</p><p>Following a Government decision in July 2011, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources established a computer security incident response team, CSIRT, to support Departments and key agencies in responding to cyber incidents, including malicious cyber-attacks that would hamper the integrity of their information systems and harm the interests of the State.  The CSIRT also acts as a national point of contact for entities within Ireland and as the point of contact for international discussions on issues of cyber-security.  The scope of the body's activities covers prevention, detection, response and mitigation services to Departments, State agencies and critical national infrastructure providers.</p><p>The Defence Forces provide two<i></i>seconded specialists to assist with the work of this unit.  Its work is also supported by an interdepartmental committee on cyber-security, established and chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, that regularly reports progress on cyber-security issues to the Government task force on emergency planning, which I chair in my capacity as the Minister for Defence.</p></reply>

It is, however, in the Department of Defence that such a unit should be based because the high level of expertise required to secure our cyberspace rests primarily within the Minister's Department.  Since it is ultimately a defence issue it is in the Department of Defence that the continued development of the strategy should be focused and led, rather than in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We all acknowledge the inordinate importance for our economic recovery of companies like Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and so on.  Given the huge amount of information the State itself stores about our citizens it is critical that the material be secure.</p></speech>

A high level interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and including senior representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces is finalising a draft national cybersecurity strategy that will focus on improving cybersecurity capabilities in Ireland.  The draft strategy will be published this year by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in consultation with other key departments and agencies.  This will provide a framework within which the future contribution of the Defence Forces will be assessed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that this is a threat that needs a comprehensive response from Government.  The only issue is which Department should be the lead.  To date the decision has been that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should be the lead Department for cybersecurity but that Department works with other Departments and we in the Department of Defence have a significant input into the strategy, along with the Defence Forces, because we have the necessary capacity.  The Deputy needs to wait to see the detail of the cybersecurity strategy and how it will function.  He will see that the Government is working on a complete response to the issue.</p></speech>

We have see the hacking of the Twitter account of central command in the US and production was stopped at Intel, in my own county, earlier this year following a bomb threat.  Security risks exist now and we need to move urgently to address those risks.  It is very much in the broad national interest that we do so, having regard to the importance of information technology to our economy.  Can the Minister at least agree that, notwithstanding the well kept secrets within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, it is within the ranks of the Defence Forces that the primary expertise exists to develop the sort of strategy that we need?  Will he, as Minister for Defence, appoint his Department as the lead Department in this area?</p></speech>

Yes, there is some expertise within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in this area but there is also a lot of expertise within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It deals with a lot of companies in the private sector on cybersecurity issues and has broad experience across the public sector in the area.  Every country, Ireland included, is looking at cybersecurity issues as the threat evolves and changes and even the most powerful countries in the world find themselves the victim of hacking and other issues relating to cybersecurity.  As the chair of the Government task force on emergency planning, I get regular updates from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on cybersecurity.  We are close to finalising a cybersecurity strategy which will have the input of all relevant Departments, including the Department of Defence, and we should be less concerned about who is taking the lead and more concerned about a complete cross-Governmental response.  It is a current issue and one which needs a response this year.  That is what it will get with the national strategy.  The strategy is no secret as it has been worked on for some time.</p></speech>

Irish citizens and others throughout Europe are opposed to the further militarisation of the European Union and concerned about future developments in the European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy, especially as it works its way towards the creation of a standing EU army.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400005#C00400"><p>First, there is no standing EU army and as there are no plans for one, I am not sure where the Deputy is coming from in his question.  It seems to suggest the informal meeting of Defence Ministers in Riga recently was undercover but nothing could be further from the truth.  The most recent informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers took place in Riga, Latvia on 18 and 19 February.  The informal defence ministerial meeting is not a decision-making forum, rather it provides an opportunity for Defence Ministers to discuss current issues and review ongoing progress in Common Security and Defence Policy developments.  As such, the meeting did not have new implications for the work and-or deployment of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The first working session during the informal meeting was focused on preparations for the June 2015 European Council at which the issue of defence will be on the agenda.  Clarification was provided by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the process leading to the June meeting and the issues she regarded as priorities for Heads of State.  She informed Ministers of her intention to initiate a process to review the European security strategy and produce a new foreign and security policy.  In her presentation to the European Council she will signal the launch of the process.  </p>  <p>  The meeting of Defence Ministers continued with discussions on the importance of strategic communications and the complex issue of hybrid conflict such as we have seen in Ukraine and Syria.  Strategic communications are a key enabler in securing popular support for the activities of the European Union in crisis management operations.    </p>  <p>  During the final working session Ministers were briefed on the ongoing Common Security and Defence Policy military operations.  During this session there was also a forward-looking briefing, linking rapid response and the battle groups with possible scenarios and concrete crisis areas.  In the past few days I had the privilege of visiting, meeting and spending some time with the Irish troops in Mali in west Africa in one of the EU-backed missions.  I take the opportunity to congratulate them on the impressive project on which they have embarked in undertaking a training mission in Mali. </p></speech>

That was not my intention in tabling the question, rather I was trying to find out what had been discussed.  For instance, given that the Council meeting was held in Riga, was there a discussion of the Maltese navy and its call for help from the European Union in dealing with the continuing migrant problem on the Mediterranean?  The UNHCR has stated that this year alone 3,500 migrants will die on the Mediterranean in trying to access the European Union.  Was there a discussion of whether more could be done by way of an EU search and rescue effort?  Ireland recently offered the decommissioned <i>LE Aoife</i>to the Maltese.  Could more be done by neutral states such as ours?</p><p>The Minister has said there is no question of having a standing army, but the Secretary General of NATO stated in his opening remarks, &quot;During these challenging times ... NATO Allies spend more on defence, and spend better.&quot;  Does the Minister agree with him and that it should be the other way around - that less should be spent in Europe on defence, given that more than &euro;200 billion is spent by EU countries during a time of austerity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400005#C00600"><p>They are all very fair questions.  We have an agreement to provide the <i>LE Aoife</i>which has been decommissioned to be used in Malta for security purposes and as part of a more effective response to the migration and human challenges faced by it.</p><p>There has been some media coverage to the contrary but Malta is delighted to accept the vessel.  We will help to train the crew and make sure they are fully trained on the vessel before it leaves from Haulbowline to sail to Malta.  We are confident the vessel will be able to perform the function asked of it for the next four or five years while Malta goes through the process of securing a newer vessel for that purpose.  It is a good example of collaboration between two relatively small European states.  Ireland is not a member of NATO and has no intention of joining NATO.  Any comments from NATO representatives apply to NATO member states.  I will reply further on budgets in the next response.</p></speech>

That was the context in which I was asking the question.  Does the Minister agree with the comments by the President of the European Commission?  Does he believe deepening EU military integration is inevitable and positive?  I have the opposite view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400006#D00300"><p>I can only speak for Ireland and different Ministers will have different views on this.  I do not envisage Ireland being part of the development of a European army.  Through the Partnership for Peace, we are part of the battle groups structure, which is a voluntary structure.  Countries volunteer to be part of a certain battle group and we are part of the Nordic battle group, which is something Ireland has agreed to be part of.  The collaboration, training and interoperability between the member states that are part of the effort exists so that if Europe collectively must respond to a crisis, which we have not yet used battle groups for, we have the capacity to do so.  Various member states contribute to the effort but that is not the same as a European army.  From a military perspective, Ireland is the neutral country and we determine our own affairs.  If Irish troops go anywhere, it is subject to the triple lock and it will remain like that for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  On occasions, the Defence Forces are deployed to Shannon Airport in an ATCP role in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The decision to seek support from the Defence Forces is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  With regard to the two emergency landings mentioned by the Deputy in her question, Defence Forces personnel were deployed to Shannon Airport on both occasions. On 28 February, Defence Forces personnel were deployed following an emergency landing of a US military aircraft.  An emergency landing of a US military aircraft also took place on 6 March 2015.  On this occasion, Defence Forces personnel were already deployed to Shannon Airport for another aircraft at the time.</p><p>Notwithstanding the emergency nature of both landings, the deployment of the Defence Forces in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in accordance with normal procedures and there was no particular reason for me to discuss these matters with ministerial colleagues.  However, I am satisfied that there is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces and between my Department and those of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality regarding security matters generally, including in respect of the Defence Forces' ATCP roles.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, however, we have never addressed the matters which lie at the core of it.  Perhaps the Minister is of the view that his repeating the same banalities on each occasion will encourage us to give up and to stop asking questions.  I assure him that will not be the case.  On 28 February, a US military EC-130H aircraft, described as an airborne tactical weapons system which uses a heavily modified version of the C-130 Hercules airframe and the primary function of which is electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defences and offensive counter-information, landed at Shannon.  How could such an aircraft not be in breach of our neutrality?  When we posed questions to one of the four Departments responsible for this issue, having to some extent been kicked around in respect of it, we were initially informed that a different type of aircraft had sought permission to land ten days previously.  On 28 February, the US military sought permission to land a normal Hercules plane but suddenly a so-called emergency landing was required and an EC-130H, an entirely different aircraft, landed at Shannon Airport.  As commander-in-chief, as it were, of the armed forces, how can the Minister for Defence be of the view that it is acceptable for Defence Forces personnel to be called out to deal with such a scenario?  Is it not his obligation to discuss matters of this nature with his colleague in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who is initiating an investigation into the events to which I refer, particularly in the context of what the US military is up to at Shannon Airport?</p></speech>

The Minister was asked about his particular concerns regarding the two emergency landings to which I refer.  He has informed the House that the did not bother to obtain any information on that matter and that he has no such information with him.  I contest that there were some peculiar circumstances with regard to some of the landings in question.  The Minister has an obligation to Defence Forces personnel who are called out to the airport to investigate matters further and he must seek the input of his colleagues, particularly if ministerial responsibility for this matter does not solely rest with him.  When replying to the original question, the Minister provided the normal response regarding ATCP duties.  Will the Minister clarify whether the Defence Forces personnel who are deployed to Shannon on an almost daily basis are always brought there at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Is it the case that when they are at the airport they are answerable to the authority of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or do they have independent authority and are they responsible for their own actions when there?</p></speech>

When the Defence Forces deploys personnel to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has primary responsibility for security, it does so in response to requests for assistance from the force.  Such assistance is always provided.  When a Defence Forces unit arrives to assist, a lead officer will be in charge and it is his or her responsibility to ensure that the task the unit is requested to perform by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is duly completed.  My understanding is that responsibility for the approach taken by the Defence Forces personnel rests with the lead officer.  However, those personnel are deployed in response to requests for assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter is responsible for making decisions in terms of calling for such assistance in the first instance.</p></speech>

It asks the Minister whether he is satisfied with the capacity of the Air Corps to deal with unauthorised incursions by military aircraft into Irish airspace, whether sovereign or Irish controlled, and the actions that he has taken in the aftermath of the recent two Russian incursions, whereby bombers flew across Irish controlled airspace with their transponders turned off.

The role of the Air Corps as set out in the White Paper is to provide a range of military and non-military air services.  The Air Corps has traditionally discharged a mix of functions based on a need to supply a range of services, such as air ambulance, fishery protection and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to its military roles.  The White Paper found that going beyond this capability would require a level of investment in Air Corps personnel, equipment and infrastructure which could not be justified.  Accordingly the Air Corps is not tasked with or equipped for monitoring or responding to unauthorised aircraft overflying Irish airspace.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing apace on the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  A key part of the development of the new White Paper is consideration of the current security environment and challenges that may emerge into the future.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet them.  This work will inform recommendations on defence provision. </p>  <p>  With regard to the presence of Russian military aircraft in Irish controlled airspace on 28 January and 18 February 2015, it is important to note that these aircraft did not at any time enter Irish sovereign airspace.  The aircraft were in an area for which the Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility for provision, operation and management of air navigation services for civil aviation.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport consulted my Department and other Departments in relation to the incident and developed an agreed response to it.</p></speech>

One would assume there was some engagement by our Government with the representatives of the Russian authorities.  The public were certainly concerned about the incursion.  A security expert, Dr. Tom Clonan, referred to Ireland's airspace defences as Europe's weakest link and suggested that if terrorists took over an aircraft in Irish space, it would be game over.  I fully appreciate the enormous economic and financial constraints under which the Department of Defence must operate but, as we look to the future, what are the Minister's plans to strengthen our air defences or to make the sort of investment that will be necessary for our Air Corps?  Is he committed to that and does he have any sort of vision as to how our air defences should be developed?</p></speech>

I understand the IAA co-ordinated closely with its UK counterpart at all stages during the incident to avoid a risk to any civil aircraft.  I also understand the two authorities are in discussions on how best to resolve this issue through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and that contact has been made with the latter.  In addition, a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Russian ambassador to convey the Government's serious concerns about the unacceptable safety risk which could be posed by non-notified and uncontrolled flight activity.  I understand that the ambassador undertook to bring these concerns to the attention of authorities in Moscow.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's second question, even when there were not expenditure limits in terms of pressure on the Exchequer, there was no decision by previous Governments to build capacity in the Air Corps for air defence because it was perceived as not presenting a sufficiently significant risk to justify such expenditure.</p><p>We must examine expenditure in the context of a new White Paper.  The White Paper is the reason we carry out this exercise every ten to 15 years.  However, I do not envisage the financing of the purchase of fighter jets any time soon.  I do not say this flippantly, but the budgetary consequences of doing so would mean we would need multiples of the current capital defence spend.</p></speech>

If we are to address any challenge, from Russia or anywhere else outside the European Union, we need to consider this issue.  Can the Minister commit to some rolling programme to replace the five Cessnas?  It is welcome that there has been some engagement with the Russian ambassador on this matter.  The issue of public safety is of paramount importance.  Some 75% of transatlantic flights cross Irish airspace, or approximately 1,800 flights every 24 hours.  Therefore, it is extremely reckless for aeroplanes to come into Irish controlled airspace with their transponders switched off, which constitutes a serious danger to public safety.</p></speech>

The only reason we knew they were there was the United Kingdom had informed us.  The focus must be on our capacity to understand and know what is travelling through our airspace.  We do not have long range radar capacity to do this along the west coast.  This issue is being examined and costed and we are in discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the matter.  This must be the first step towards more effective surveillance in order that we will know at any given point the number of aircraft in our airspace and, if possible, beyond this in international airspace.  It is one thing not being able to respond to an aircraft travelling through airspace under the control of the Irish Aviation Authority but it is quite another not knowing it is there.  Surveillance is the first step and we are looking at that issue in some detail.</p></speech>

They volunteered for this difficult and challenging tour and left Ireland earlier this year to fight the worst outbreak yet of Ebola which has claimed over 10,000 lives or more.  What work have they been doing?  When are they due back and will a further detachment be sent to finish or continue their work?</p></reply>

To assist in Ireland's response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa, five Defence Forces medical personnel have been deployed to Sierra Leone for a four month period to participate in the wider international response to the crisis.  Irish personnel are part of a UK-led joint inter agency task force tackling Ebola in the region.  The Irish personnel arrived in Sierra Leone on 17 January following pre-deployment training in the United Kingdom.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces team is working in conjunction with UK military medical personnel at the Kerrytown Ebola treatment centre, just south of the capital Freetown, and at a medical facility at the international security advisory team camp in Freetown.  This facility also provides medical force protection for UK and Irish personnel in Sierra Leone.  Irish personnel are not engaged in the direct treatment of Ebola victims but continue to provide a supporting role for front-line workers who are so engaged.</p><p>In May 2015 it is planned to rotate the Defence Forces team that is due to return to Ireland at the end of its rotation.</p> <p> The Defence Forces medical team comprises highly trained personnel who are making a tangible contribution in assisting in the control of the spread of this disease.  Participating as part of the larger British military medical effort is an effective means to optimise the contribution of the Defence Forces which is going some way in assisting efforts to fight against the spread of this deadly virus.  Under the emergency civilian assistance team, ECAT initiative, Defence Forces personnel have also been deployed to Sierra Leone to assist the Irish embassy in responding to the Ebola virus crisis.  Two Defence Forces personnel are primarily providing security and operational management in the embassy and this has been very well received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

Is it intended to increase the detachment even though the UN Ebola virus mission is suggesting that the outbreak may be over by August?  The Minister mentioned that the next detachment is going out in May.  It may be important to consider increasing the number of personnel, given that there may be other outbreaks in the future.  In what way will the Defence Forces benefit from the experiences of the seven personnel who are currently in Sierra Leone to ensure that the Irish Defence Forces have gained the best possible knowledge in the event of them having to work in other outbreaks in the future?</p></speech>

I have huge time for the personnel who have volunteered to be part of the mission.  This is a new mission on a number of levels.  For example, it is very much part of the UK mission in that this is the first time our medical people have slotted into a UK-managed mission.  I was anxious for our Defence Forces to contribute medical, logistics and management expertise to the anti-Ebola virus efforts in West Africa.  We could not afford to put a full mission together ourselves because of the cost and the resources required.  The obvious way to be of assistance was to slot in with a larger country which had a big footprint on the ground.  The UK has medivac capabilities, hospitals and isolation facilities.  We do not have any plans to increase the number of personnel even though I think the UK would like us to send more personnel because it has been a very successful project to date and the UK is very happy with the level of training and approach of our Permanent Defence Force.  We are somewhat limited in terms of overall resources and human resources, especially in the medical area.  We plan to keep the number of personnel at five but there will be a rotation of personnel in May.  The Deputy suggests that this problem might be over by August; the increase in the spread of Ebola virus will be over by August but there is a lot of management yet in this crisis before we will be able to say that a country like Sierra Leone is free of the virus.</p></speech>

Are the troops in Sierra Leone being given the anti-malaria drug, Lariam?  Is it being used across the whole mission or are some people being given the other drug, Malarone instead of Lariam?</p></speech>

The Defence Forces only use drugs that are approved by the Medical Council.  As I am not a doctor, I take the advice of doctors as to the appropriate drugs for use as protection against malaria for troops.  While the personnel in Sierra Leone are probably using Lariam, it would not surprise me if they were using Malarone, as both drugs are now used to good effect in the Defence Forces.  While some people have expressed concern about the use of Lariam and the drug's side effects, in general it is being used to very good effect in the Defence Forces, especially in Africa.</p></speech>

The basis of a White Paper must be a comprehensive security assessment to identify that which we must defend against.  We must then provide an infrastructure to ensure the State is adequately defended for the next ten years.  That is essentially the approach taken in the White Paper.  The Department has been moving from a Green Paper to a White Paper and has engaged in extensive consultation with other Departments, particularly on the security assessment.</p>  <p>  I established a group outside the Department and Government to advise me on international best practice and put forward other views to ensure I am being challenged in terms of issues that should be considered.  I have asked Mr. John Minihan, the former chairman of the Progressive Democrats Party, to chair the group.  Mr. Minihan is a former officer who served abroad on many occasions, including in Lebanon, and is passionate about defence policy.  The group also includes Mr. Karl Croke, a former Defence Forces officer who has been very successful in the private sector and has particular expertise in human resource management.</p><p> Marie Cross is also on the aforementioned group advising me.  She has a lot of experience, has worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is now deeply involved in the Institute of International and European and Affairs, IIEA.  In addition, Frank Lynch, who is the former flag officer of the Naval Service, is on that group.  It is a group of four highly experienced people, three of whom are ex-Defence Forces personnel and all of whom are ambitious and interested in defence policy and the Defence Forces in Ireland.

However, I envisage that yes, defence spending in Ireland over the next ten years will need to increase.  New challenges must be faced, Ireland has a huge marine resource that must be protected, airspace that must be managed and it has natural resources that must also be part of that security threat assessment.  Moreover, Members have already discussed cybersecurity and so on.  In addition, Ireland has an increasing responsibility abroad in terms of peacekeeping, conflict management, post-conflict stabilisation and so on.  I would like to see an increasing budget for defence to be able to do all those things.  However, that must be negotiated and will not happen in a single year.  My view on the White Paper is that over the next decade, the State will work towards putting in place a modern, well-resourced defence infrastructure which I believe will require increases in budget over time.</p></speech>

In the past three years, it has been called out 595 times, 75 of which times have been in cases of unstable chemicals in schools.  There has been a reduction in the staffing complement of that unit and I wish to ascertain what steps will be taken in the immediate future to ensure there are adequate staff numbers to maintain the four units across the country.</p></reply>

On the actual numbers, I am glad to state there was a significant reduction in the number of call-outs last year.  There were 215 call-outs in 2013 and this number fell to 141 this year.  The number of call-outs for viable improvised explosive devices also fell last year.  There was a reduction from 96 in 2012 to 81 in 2013 and the number fell to 52 last year.  While this is a positive trend, it remains necessary to have the capacity to deal with a significant increase, should that happen for whatever reason.</p>  <p>  Explosive ordnance disposal is the military term used to refer to what is commonly called bomb disposal.  Explosive ordnance disposal is a task assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government and is provided in aid to the civil power.  Within the Defence Forces, the explosive ordnance disposal function is assigned to the Ordnance Corps.  As I stated in response to Question No. 9 of Wednesday, 14 January 2015, the issue of the terms and conditions for entry into the Ordnance Corps has been raised by the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, at conciliation council.  In accordance with normal procedures, the association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p> As discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the details today.  However, it is my intention that recruitment will commence as soon as the terms and conditions have been agreed.</p> <p> In other words there is a dispute, I suspect, over the level of incentive to get people into this specialist training area.  It is dangerous work, quite frankly, and requires about two years of training.  We are going through the usual procedures to agree a way forward and a compromise that everyone will accept and agree upon.  After that, we will be pressing ahead with an active recruitment campaign because we do need to increase the numbers in that unit.  </p></speech>

However, the difficulty is that the last recruits came out of the training process in September 2010, which is four and a half years ago.  It takes 18 months of training before unsupervised personnel can be involved in bomb disposal work.  Is the Minister aware that by the end of April we will have less than 50% of the full complement of those four units?  In light of that, what immediate action can be taken to address this situation?  Is there now a real risk that one of these units will have to be disbanded, at least temporarily, in order to maintain the effective operation of the other units?</p></speech>

We are anxious to finalise the conciliation process so that we can get on with the new recruitment drive.  The Deputy is right in that the numbers have fallen, but there is still a strong capability to do the required job.  Nobody is suggesting that the level of service and response is compromised, but we do need a new recruitment drive.  We need to get some new people in training for these units.  That will be the focus once we can get the conciliation finalised.</p></speech>

On foot of the Minister's last comments, can he reassure the House that the unit based in Athlone is secure into the future?  What does he envisage is the timeline for agreement to be reached between the Government, the Defence Forces and RACO?  When are we likely to see a recruitment campaign commencing?</p></speech>

I have had no briefing or suggestion from anybody that there will be a disbanding of the unit in Athlone.  From that point of view, therefore, I can give the Deputy an assurance - unless I get some briefing to the contrary in the next couple of days.  However, I certainly have nothing to suggest that that would be the case.</p>  <p>  The focus has been on trying to get through a conciliation process which is a fairly normal process within Defence Forces' structures.  We had to go through that process with the 21-year soldier issue, which resulted in a reasonably good outcome for everybody, including a fair compromise.  We need to get through this process also.  I think RACO would be aware that there is a need to move on with this issue now.  We are anxious to move on in order to get recruitment under way again.  The sooner we can resolve the issues the better.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400013#L00900"><p>I answered a similar question earlier.  Under the current strategy which dates back to the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the role of the Air Corps is limited to surveillance and some limited defence capacity.</p><p>If there is a fast-moving military plane coming into Irish airspace, our Air Corps is not going to have significant defence capacity to deal with that.  When the White Paper was put in place back in 2000, the assessed risk of that happening was deemed to be very low and therefore we could not justify the expenditure on putting together significant air defence capacity.  We now have to reassess that in the context of the new White Paper.</p> <p> First and foremost, we need to improve our capacity to monitor what is happening in our airspace and in international airspace for which the Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility.  That is why I mentioned that we are looking in some detail at the cost and equipment that would be required to improve long range radar capacity along the west coast in particular.  That is the first step.  We will have an opportunity in the context of the broader White Paper to discuss what we should or should not be doing in terms of the Air Corps and its future role.  It is important to be realistic.  The cost of putting together a fleet of fighter jets is probably similar to all the defence spending in Ireland put together.  We are unlikely to be pursuing that course of action, although we have to have an open mind.  Instead, we need to look at improved surveillance so that we understand and have a detailed knowledge of what is happening in our airspace.</p> <p> We do have some capacity at the moment.  It should not be suggested that we have no capacity.  We have radar capacity along the west coast that covers the vast majority of our air space, as it happens.  If the Deputy is talking about further out to sea, 30 km to 50 km into the Atlantic and into international air space, he is talking about long-range equipment, which has a cost implication.</p></speech>

A somewhat unstable situation exists globally at present, in that quite a number of trouble spots exist across the globe.  Would the Minister agree that, as a result, neutral countries in particular may be vulnerable?  To what extent is that going to be taken into account in determining the degree to which defence methods and mechanisms can be upgraded in line with international standards, given the urgency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400014#M00300"><p>First, I would not like to give the impression that Irish defence capacity is not in line with international standards in the areas where we operate, because it is.  Training and fitness levels in the Irish Defence Forces benchmark really well with international standards.  Looking at the capacity for Ireland in peacekeeping operations, for example, we are as good as if not better than any other country in terms of our experience and what we bring to many of those missions, whether in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, Mali, Sierra Leone, or wherever we are.  We are very good at what we do.</p>  <p>  The issue is whether to change perspective from the 2000 White Paper on Defence, which limits our capacity in certain areas, to respond to what has happened since 2000 regarding international security concerns and issues.  Cybersecurity is one obvious area that has been raised today.  Migration is another area, and we have to ensure that we have a comprehensive security risk assessment, which will then be the basis for deciding how we respond in the White Paper.</p></speech>

We have some technology companies that are developing and designing new drone technology.  Ireland will be one of the world's leading countries in designing and developing the next drone technology which will actually attract more civil than military use.

He has said this again today.  In the response he also stated, "For security and operational reasons, it is not considered appropriate to make any further comment in relation to how such operations are conducted."

Certainly, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks assistance from the Defence Forces on security arrangements at Shannon Airport, it gets it.  The assistance comes in the form of Permanent Defence Force personnel under the control of the senior officer performing the tasks they are being asked to perform by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I stated, it is the role of the Defence Forces personnel to perform the tasks they are being asked to perform.  I am not quite sure what the Deputy is getting at.  I am not trying to be evasive, but I am just trying to understand what he is getting at.  This is a security operation to provide security for aeroplanes landing, refuelling and taking off at Shannon Airport.  When An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs the assistance of the Defence Forces, it gets it.  It is no more complicated than that.</p></speech>

It goes without saying there is considerable confusion about roles and responsibilities.  Does the person in charge from the Defence Forces have the authority to decide to inspect an aircraft?  Alternatively, would the Minister say Garda personnel have greater authority on the platform at Shannon Airport?  Can they actually decide to inspect an aircraft if they believe there is a good reason to do so?</p></speech>

When it needs assistance in performing its role, it asks for it and gets it from the Defence Forces.  However, the task the Defence Forces are asked to perform by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is managed operationally by the senior officer of the Defence Forces on site.  That is my understanding of how it works.  The duty of making the actual request and overall responsibility lie with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

We understand from the defence in a recent court case in Ennis, taken by the State, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not allowed to exercise discretion at Shannon Airport and that if, for any reason, it suspected an aeroplane needed to be inspected, it was not allowed to do so.</p><p>The garda&iacute; were not allowed to use their own discretion as they would on the street.  They were compelled to contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This came as a surprise to us.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and Deputy Durkan raised the issue of the Russian plane and what we should be worried about coming through our airspace.  Were these people remotely interested in the EC130 Hercules which was armed and landed in Shannon?  Are they remotely worried about the incredible security risk to the Irish people of seriously heavy armoury coming through Shannon?</p> <p> With regard to the role of terrorists, since the end of the Second World War the US military machine has created more terrorism on the planet than the rest of the planet put together.  We are allowing these people to use Shannon and we do not seem to have a problem with it yet we are worried about a Russian aircraft flying down by the west coast.  Give us a break.

Our role, in the Defence Forces, is to respond to specific tasks when asked for assistance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We then manage and operationally take control of these tasks through a senior officer in the performing of those tasks.  It is no more complicated than that.</p>  <p>  There are broader issues and I know Deputy Wallace has a strong difference of opinion with me and with the Department on these issues.  However, they are separate issues.  My responsibility, as Minister for Defence, is to account for the actions of the Permanent Defence Force when it is operationally asked to perform certain tasks by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which it does very professionally.</p></speech>

Has Ireland received any request or does the Minister anticipate a request to be received in this regard?</p></reply>

The honest answer is that I do not know if we will receive a request in the future.  That would be two or three steps away from where we are now.  We need to achieve political stability in Libya first and the European Union is very engaged through a special representative there in trying to achieve this.  If agreement can be reached on a government of national unity in Libya, such a government may need assistance in terms of bedding down and stabilising the governing structure.  The UN will be engaged in this process, as will the EU.  It is only when this happens that we will be asked to look seriously, as a member state of the EU, at how we can support this.  There have been suggestions of sending an EU mission there.  There have also been suggestions that the Nordic battle group could be asked to be part of this and so on.  These are very much suggestions which are made in the absence of two or three decisions which need to happen first.</p>  <p>  I do not anticipate a request to send troops there in the immediate future.  However, if we are requested to do so, and if other European countries are so requested, we will consider the request on its merits.  We will go through the usual consideration process.  As Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l knows, before Irish troops can go anywhere, we will have to go through the triple-lock mechanism which will involve an opportunity for discussion and debate in this House.</p></speech>

Recent media reports suggest that all may not be well within the Red Cross, which emphasises the need for legislation on addressing governance issues to be introduced as a matter of urgency.  I am particularly conscious of the fact that the secretary general and directors of finance and communications of the Red Cross have resigned recently.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s feeling on these resignations and will he reassure the public as regards the governance systems that are in place in the Red Cross, which spends approximately &euro;900,000 of taxpayers' money at home and more abroad?</p></reply>

In accordance with a programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross.  It is proposed that the existing primary legislation, which dates back to 1938, is to be repealed in new primary legislation that will redefine the relationship between the Government and the Irish Red Cross Society.  This will further underpin the independence of the society.  Draft heads of the Red Cross Bill are being finalised.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the society has reformed its corporate governance structures and has in place a governance framework that meets the standards set by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The reforms introduced were facilitated by the legislative amendments made by this Government in 2012, which represented the most wide-ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the society in 1939.</p>  <p>  While the society is an independent charitable body corporate with full power to manage and administer its own affairs, it has without question made substantial improvements to its governance framework in recent years.  I am nevertheless also aware that, despite this progress, there is some concern that other aspects of governance have not moved as quickly and that this is an issue of ongoing debate within the society.  As the Deputy has pointed out, three senior managers at the society have recently resigned from their positions.  With the outgoing chairman's term of office coming to an end shortly, this is a time of change at the society in terms of its board, officers and management.  It is important that the incoming administration find the right balance between the pace of reform and the obligation to manage the society in a way that meets the expectations of all of its stakeholders, including the Government, which commits approximately &euro;860,000-----</p></speech>

The background to this is that, more than one year ago, the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, conducted a report as a result of perinatal deaths at the hospital.  His report, which was an initial conclusion, did not pull too many punches.  He said that families and patients were treated in a poor and, at times, appalling manner, with limited respect, kindness, courtesy and consideration.  He said that information that should have been given to families was withheld for no justifiable reason, poor outcomes that could likely have been prevented were identified and known by the hospital but not adequately and satisfactorily acted upon, the Portlaoise hospital maternity services, PHMS, could not be regarded as safe and sustainable under their governance arrangements, many organisations had information regarding the safety of the PHMS that could have led to earlier intervention had it been brought together, and the external support from and oversight by the HSE should have been stronger and more proactive.</p>  <p>  As a result, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, decided to initiate the HIQA investigation into the safety, quality and standards of service provided by the HSE to patients in the Midland Regional Hospital, a broader investigation in many ways.  Over the past year, HIQA has been engaged in that exercise.  Obviously, the then Minister believed that this was a serious matter, given the report of the chief medical officer.  Eighty-five families have provided information to the HIQA investigation.</p></speech>

I have read the correspondence that has either been leaked or distributed by the HSE, which seems to believe that the investigation should be a joint process between HIQA and it.  Today, the Minister spoke about a bilateral process having been agreed by both organisations - the entity that is investigating and the entity that is the subject matter of the investigation.  There is a certain irreconcilability about such a process.  I want the Taoiseach to confirm something to me.</p><p>I do not think it is a case of the Government being detached from the issue.  The Minister has not affirmed the independence of HIQA in the conduct of this very important investigation.  Its independence is at stake.  Does the Taoiseach accept and affirm the independence of the Health Information and Equality Authority in this investigation?  Will he indicate when he now expects the report to be published?</p></speech>

It is a sensitive issue because it refers to parents and the birth of children.  Yesterday the Minister publicly affirmed the absolute independence of HIQA.  The letters from the HSE to which the Deputy referred have, according to Mr. Tony O'Brien, been published on its website and speak for themselves.  It is regrettable that this has taken place in this fashion.  It is not the first time that agencies of the State have taken legal action against each other.  In the closing paragraph of the HSE letter it is stated that it will withdraw from what it calls the "extraordinary position" of having to seek advice of counsel in respect of going to court.  The Minister has intervened to say it is not appropriate that taxpayers' money should be used to settle a row between two agencies of State.  I am glad that, following a meeting last week, a way forward has been found.  As I said, the Minister has affirmed the absolute independence of HIQA and a way has been found to deal with this matter which involves sitting down and working it out.  I cannot indicate when the report will be published.  It would be wrong to publish what is currently a draft report, but the matter needs to be dealt with taking into account the responsibilities of the HSE, the independence of HIQA and the requirement to send a report to the Minister which he will receive, consider and publish.</p></speech>

This is a draft report which has not been finalised by the HIQA board.  The HSE contests elements of what HIQA has put into the draft report and did intend to proceed to a court hearing on the matter.  The Minister has said this is not appropriate and I agree with him.  It is a case of the HSE answering the charges made in the draft HIQA report and when the discussions are concluded, I expect there will be a report that can be finalised, agreed and sent to the Minister for consideration and publication.</p></speech>

Contrary to the Government's assertions ,citizens are more determined than ever on this issue.  They have told the Government that they cannot and will not pay its water charge and that Irish Water is a toxic quango that should be abolished.  Instead of listening to all of the warnings and the hundreds of thousands who have demonstrated and instead of scrapping water charges, water charge protestors were jailed, local authorities were forced to hand over details of tenants, while landlords were forced to do the same.  The Government wasted &euro;650,000 on a new advertising campaign and gave away &euro;85 million of taxpayers' money to private consultants, as well as wasting &euro;539 million on water meters.  Now the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is threatening to take water charges from people's wages or social welfare payments.  Does the Taoiseach support the Minister in his latest threat?  Will the Taoiseach explain the legal basis for the process he has indicated?  Will he tell the D&aacute;il how the Government intends to distinguish between those who cannot pay the water tax and those who will not pay?</p></speech>

This is not satisfactory, which is why we need an entity that is able to borrow separately from the Government and invest to fix supplies for the future.

He has not yet brought his propositions to the Government for consideration and decision, but he will do so shortly.</p><p>The Government will ensure that the legislation sets out the criteria for full compliance with the law in respect of the modest contribution that is involved of &euro;1.15 or &euro;3 per week depending on the number of persons in the household.  That will come before Government in the near future and it will consider the propositions from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and make its decision. </p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, in cases where people genuinely have a real difficulty in paying, there are always opportunities to give assistance, as has applied to schemes over the years.  </p></speech>

For the people all over the country, the 1.29 million who have signed up, the compliant number of those who are Irish Water customers, they have a sense that this is an important element of our country moving forward.  For those who decide that they will not pay, they are not being fair to those who understand that water is a precious commodity.

In the light of the scandal around the huge sums of public money spent on consultants, will the Taoiseach agree that this is an extraordinary revelation?  During Irish Water's first six months, from April to September 2012, 23 meetings took place between Bord G&aacute;is and the Department but only ten were minuted.  There were four meetings between the former Minister, Phil Hogan, and the Bord G&aacute;is officials, two of them with the Bord G&aacute;is chairwoman.  It is certainly not creditable that meetings took place about the establishment of a major new public utility but no notes were taken at any of these meetings.

Obviously, we will consider and decide on the proposals the Minister will bring to Cabinet.  I support him in what he is trying to do to provide a proper high quality water supply for businesses and consumers alike and to provide our country with an investment capacity to deal with the grossly inferior sewerage systems that apply in many parts of the country.</p>  <p>  In respect of meetings that have taken place, let me assure the Deputy that the independent regulatory authority has signed off on elements of this in terms of the set up costs for Irish Water.  The Cabinet approved all the major decisions in respect of Irish Water and the Minister has already answered many questions on that.  </p>  <p>  As I said to the Deputy, the position is that 1.23 million have signed up and I hope many more will.  About 250,000 of those are not directly customers of Irish Water but they will have the opportunity to claim the assistance support from the Department of Social Protection and, as in any other scheme, equality and fairness is very important here.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, a few months ago he was very much in support of making his payments because he realised the importance of good, clean water but he listened to the populist drum and changed his tack.</p></speech>

Recently, we have seen the closure of small shops, schools, Garda stations and other community focus points, particularly in the rural areas.  Post offices are the largest retail network in the country, with 1,150 post offices employing 3,700 people.  Some 1,100 of those post offices are operated by postmasters who are locally based small and medium businesses providing employment, facilitating economic activity and providing community engagement.  There is a world class IT structure in place in these post offices, which is technically capable of being of the same quality as what is in place in the GPO in Dublin.  That spells out that they could offer the same services as those provided in the central post offices.  Also, 1,7 million customers avail of the services of post offices each week.</p>  <p>  Recently, we have seen thousands of letters coming out from the office of the T&aacute;naiste's and Minister for Social Protection encouraging people to change from their post office financial services to the banks.  That will have a major detrimental effect-----</p></speech>

This is an important issue in rural Ireland.  The world in which we live has changed very much over the past ten to 30 years.</p><p>Some 24 post offices were closed since 2010 and 197 closed between 2006 and 2010, figures that speak for themselves.  Post offices were an important social element of rural Ireland.  In many cases, post offices were part of a small shop, a supermarket, a petrol filling station or other facilities that grew over the years.  In other cases, there was just a post office in the corner room of a house.  Over the years, postmasters and postmistresses moved on and things changed with the digital and electronic worlds.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, appointed a group to look at this.  The terms of reference are to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office, identify new business opportunities for the post office network, taking into account what is happening internationally, to engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the objectives, and to prepare an interim and final report for the Minister by the autumn.  In so far as the Government is concerned, it has no intention of closing any post offices.  </p></speech>

Mr. Bobby Kerr is hugely experienced in this area and he will report to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, by the autumn on the terms of reference as set out.  Some 24 were closed since 2010, with 197 closed between 2006 and 2010.

People are at the end of their tether and they are worried and concerned about the attitude of An Post to the local communities.</p>  <p>  Another retrograde step is that several services have been transferred to multiples on the edges of towns.  People can post parcels and buy stamps at PostPoint outlets and they can pay their bills.  This is causing further erosion and undermining of services in post offices.  Recently, in the town of Listowel, there was a movement of the post office on the main street in the centre of town to a supermarket multiple at the far end of the town.  This takes away the footfall from the centre of the main town area.  This is detrimental to the overall trading situation in the town for all businesses.  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, in many areas around the country, people prefer to go to the nearest town and do their business.  It is a fact of life.  I represent the county where this has happened on many occasions.  From first-hand experience, I know that when a postmaster or postmistress comes to retirement age or no longer wants to do the job and where the families have no interest in it, if no one else from the local area is prepared to take on something that involves quite an amount of work for very little return-----</p></speech>

Deputy Tom Fleming is also aware of the volume of material coming into the country from outside, which passes through the post offices.  The Government does not want to close post offices and the figures, 24 post offices closed since 2010, reflect this.  It is important the network is kept alive but it will not be kept alive by people talking about it in here.  Local communities will keep post offices alive.</p></speech>

In other words, if the economics of a post office are in serious decline and it is not being used, the community should be informed before a decision is taken to close it down.  That is the kind of consultation needed and the community can then see that it will lose its post office unless people change their ways and use it.</p></speech>

The Government closed the that scheme and brought an end to the motorised transport grant in February 2013.  This had an impact on 5,000 citizens and their families.  The Ombudsman had advised that the scheme and the grant were both in breach of the Equal Status Act and the Disability Act as a result of the fact that some citizens, namely, those over 66 years of age, were excluded from them.  Instead of changing social policy and the relevant legislation in order to ensure that all affected citizens would be eligible for the scheme and the grant, the Government closed both, thereby actively discriminating against disabled citizens.  I remind the Taoiseach that this occurred in February 2013.  The then Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, described the Government's decision as a bolt out of the blue and stated that it had given no indication that it intended to scrap the scheme or the grant.  At the time in question, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, informed an Oireachtas committee that a review group would be established to examine the scheme and the grant and bring them into line with the law.</p>  <p>  I m&iacute; Feabhra 2013, d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach leis an D&aacute;il nach raibh aon rogha ag an Rialtas ach deireadh a chur leis an deontas do dhaoine nua ar an sc&eacute;im.

What conclusions have been reached and what decisions have been taken in respect of this issue?  When I previously asked the Taoiseach about this matter I was informed that it would be addressed by means of the health (transport support) Bill.  That legislation was supposed to be produced a long time ago but it has not yet been published.  It is included on the Government's list of proposed legislation but there is no date provided in respect of its publication.  The D&aacute;il can sit through the night in order to resolve issues relating to bankers but drags its feet when it comes to legislation for the disabled.  I have raised this issue on a consistent basis with the Taoiseach and I am seeking to discover whether the Cabinet committee on social policy has given any consideration to speeding up the process relating to the health (transport support) Bill.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea when that Bill will be published?</p></speech>

One could ask 1,000 questions in respect of issues of detail and that which he has now posed obviously relates to a serious matter for those affected.  The scheme involved was ended for good reason and those who were in receipt of payments continue to be paid.  I understand it is expected that a replacement scheme to deal with those who are currently in receipt of payment and those who may placed in that particular category will be forthcoming.  A great deal of work has been done on this matter but it will be after the summer before the new scheme emerges.  However, I may be wrong in that regard because I do not have the relevant information in my possession.  I will request an update from the Minister and then communicate further with the Deputy in respect of this matter.  This is a complex issue and it was necessary to end the scheme because people were being excluded from it.  I will advise the House and Deputy Adams further on this matter when I receive an update in respect of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400021#T01600"><p>It is approximately five months since these questions were originally tabled.  It would be useful, therefore, if the Taoiseach could indicate the number of occasions on which the Cabinet committee on social policy met during the past 12 months and when it last met prior to the tabling of these questions.  Questions to the Taoiseach only take place once a week now as a result of a decision made by the Government when it came to office.  Communities in Dublin and provincial towns throughout the country are faced with the brutal impact of a growing drugs problem.  This is one of the many instances where the Government has ignored a problem until it has become a crisis.  There is no question that this is now a crisis in many parts of the country.  Irrespective of whatever else the Cabinet committee on social policy is doing, it seems to have ignored issues relating to the abuse of drugs in certain communities and to the lack of co-ordination and accountability in terms of providing the relevant services.</p><p>One of the key developments in this area in the past was the appointment of a Minister of State who sat at the Cabinet table and who had responsibility for bringing the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Education and Skills and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs together in a co-ordinated way in order that they might deal with the drugs issue through the drugs task forces, the RAPID programme, etc.  This had an impact and the relevant Minister of State also had responsibility for developing the national drugs strategy and matters of that nature.  Why did the Taoiseach not appoint such a Minister of State in the past four years and why has he not afforded this issue priority?  Will he indicate whether the Cabinet committee on social policy will be meeting shortly in order to give this matter urgent consideration?</p><p>Another key point which springs from my original question relates to the fact that two years ago the Government took the decision to stop producing social impact figures when publishing the budget.  In the preceding ten to 15 years, figures relating to the potential social impact of budgetary measures were provided when the budget was published.  The objective in this regard was to facilitate transparency in respect of the social impact of the budget.  It appears that two years ago the Government ended the practice of supplying the figures to which I refer in a bid to cover up what most objective people and institutions outside this House would agree have been deeply unfair and regressive budgets.  The number of children living in poverty is damning and should not be tolerated.</p><p>Will the Cabinet committee on social policy meet in advance of the announcement of the spring statement in order to ensure that social impact figures are published?  In the context of the spring statement, it seems that for the first time in our history the full might of the public and civil service will be used to draft a political manifesto.  The latter will have no status other than as a document designed to win or buy an election.  In a typically immodest piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Taoiseach indicated that he will, by means of the spring statement, be setting out a programme for the next five years.  Will he provide an assurance that he will supply full information on income distribution as part of the spring statement?  Will he also provide the basic information required in order to assess the social impact of what is going to be proposed?  After all, the purpose of the Cabinet committee on social policy is to assess that impact.  I sat on a Cabinet committee which dealt with social inclusion and which frequently deliberated on issues relating to the proofing of Cabinet decisions.</p></speech>

It was then merged with the Cabinet committee on public service reform in September of last year.  A further six meetings have taken place since then, four in the second half of 2014 and two so far this year.  The latter were held on 26 January and 23 February, respectively.</p><p>I am giving consideration to the question of appointing a Minister to deal with drugs but not the appointment of a new Minister.  We have already set the number of Ministers.  The Minister for Health chairs the oversight forum on drugs which monitors implementation and progress and works to address difficulties that may arise.  The Department of Health is preparing a national drugs strategy for the period after 2016 and this process will involve consultations with all sectors and persons involved.</p> <p> With regard to the figures for the social impact, in the process of preparing the budget to be announced in October we will issue the spring statement by the end of April.  That statement will address the general environment of business and taxation, including the environment into which the country will move for the coming period, and set out our views covering several years.  Towards the summer there will be engagement with the various sectors of Irish society on the generality of the budget and the submissions made.  We will then announce the budget in October.</p> <p> The European Commission has confirmed that the Irish economy is the fastest growing in the European Union.  That is to be welcomed, but the challenge for the Government and the people is to see the effect filter down to every family and person who are asking me why, if we are proceeding at this rate, they are not seeing it.  Our challenge is to make this happen.  The more people who are working, the better the contribution to each locality and individual.</p> <p> In regard to the social impact, the first thing the Government did was to reverse the cut in the minimum wage, which affected 300,000 people.  This had a social impact in its own way.  We have established the low pay commission which has begun its work by holding a range of meetings.  I expect it to report to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, by July and the Government will respond to it in October.  We will take into account the impact on employers if the Government makes a decision in that regard.  I have also pointed out that owing to the last budget there are now 480,000 people who are exempt from the universal social charge.  With the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Government, we hope to bring that figure to 500,000 this year.  I am not going to predict the decision of the Cabinet in respect of the budget, but as the figures are analysed in the coming months, it is the Government's intention to reduced the burden of taxation on people.  This has had an impact for several years, particularly for those on incomes of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;70,000.</p> <p> I do not object to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's question about basic information being provided.</p></speech>

I would have thought it would be meeting at least on a weekly basis and, frankly, in emergency session when it comes to what, by any standard, is a central matter of special policy, namely, the chronic and daily deteriorating situation in social housing provision.  Today representatives from council estates in Dublin, Limerick and Cork complained to the European Commission about the abysmally unhealthy and completely inadequate quality of social housing in council estates in our biggest cities.  The Taoiseach has gone out of his way to be the best boy in the European class when it comes to doing what Angela Merkel says, paying back bondholders and doing what the financial markets want him to do, but he is certainly not the best boy in the European class when it comes to the quality of social housing provision in Ireland if the case being pursued by these communities is anything to go by.  Should the social policy committee not be meeting to discuss this issue and should the Taoiseach not be ashamed of his Government for its abysmal failure to address the social housing crisis?</p>  <p>  There has been a considerable spin put on this issue.  Last October the biggest social housing programme in the history of the State was announced.  I have since been contacted by my local authority on an almost weekly basis to ask whether there is any additional money for social housing. but there is not one cent.  Only 19 council houses will be built in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown next year, even though 1,200 people joined the council's housing list last year, bringing the total to 5,200.  In the period since I entered this D&aacute;il, the average waiting time on a council housing list has increased from eight to 15 years.  In other words, some people will never get a council house.  I am dealing with families who are facing unbelievable situations.  One man who was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer has been couch surfing for several weeks.  He is an emergency case, but he has no idea when he will be housed.  Another woman with two children, one of whom has special needs, has been homeless for the past year.  She is moving from couch surfing to emergency accommodation which is not guaranteed from one week to the next.  She does not even know where she will sleep tomorrow.  She is No. 1 on the priority list, but the council cannot even state when she will be given a council house.  Someone who is No. 100 or 150 on the list is looking at a wait of seven or eight years before being housed.  Despite all of the announcements made last October, not one extra cent has been provided for the budget for social housing provision.  That is just in one county.  God knows what the situation is like in the rest of the country.</p>  <p>  What is the social policy committee discussing, if not the provision of social housing during the greatest social housing crisis in the modern history of the State?  Working class communities are going to the European Court of Justice because of the Government's failure to take this issue seriously.  What is the committee doing?  Is it going to discuss the social housing crisis and are we going to have real policy change when it comes to dealing with the social housing emergency?</p></speech>

I have no intention of looking for credit or thanks.  People who do so in this business follow a fool's philosophy.  My job is not about being best boy in class; it is about dealing with the legacy of an unprecedented mess that was left to be sorted out.</p><p>I am proud that the Government has worked with people here and that because of the sacrifices made we are in a better place than we were four years ago.  I am proud of the fact that 80,000 to 90,000 new jobs have been created and that we have opened up new markets for Irish companies which are thriving and exporting and creating jobs and contributing to economic expansion.  I am also hopeful the recently increased economic confidence which is evident will be harnessed in everybody's interests.  I accept that some people will say they hear about 5% growth and a 1.3% rate of interest on borrowings and that we have been able to buy out &euro;18 billion loans from the IMF at cheaper rates but that this does not mean anything to them because they do not see the benefits at the end of the week.  It was only in the most recent budget that the Government was in a position to start to reduce the burden of taxation, which we hope to be able to continue.</p> <p> I am not bound to tell the Deputy what the committee discussed, but at its most recent meeting it considered the progress report on public service reform, the new ICT strategy for the public service to make it more efficient and more responsive to people, the extensive plan brought forward by the Government to address homelessness to deal with a range of unprecedented issues, in Dublin in particular, and the issue of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p> <p> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has set out clearly the scale of the Government's decision to deal with social housing and people who have become homeless because of an inability to pay rent, rent increases by landlords or the shortage of housing.  The figure of &euro;4 billion, for the period to 2020, is part of his direction to local authorities to allocate a percentage of housing to social housing and the homeless.  Allocations of moneys will be made to individual local authorities which will set out and commence implementation of their building programmes to provide quality social housing.</p> <p> No matter what we do, houses will not be built until we have a process in place that will provide money for building and until planning issues have been dealt with and confirmed in order that competent contractors can move in and start building.  A contractor must have a line of finance available in order to be able to build.  As the Deputy is aware, in previous years when 100% of funding was put up by the bank, profits were made by builders who then moved to the next build.  That is not how the system operates now.  Contractors must now provide 40% of the funding and will not receive the type of funding that used to apply.  The programme is in place to provide for the provision of social and affordable houses, but the issue is how we can make this happen.  I respect the case raised by the Deputy of a person who is facing a number of challenges in this regard and feel sure the Deputy has spoken to the local authority about it.  The authority concerned has already been allocated money.  Therefore, if the person in question is first on the priority list, it is a matter for the director of services in the local authority to tell the Deputy when a house will be provided.  </p> <p> We are now in a situation where the scale of the problem has been identified.  We have allocated a serious amount of public moneys for the next few years and the process must now be put in place to ensure housing will be provided for the homeless and those who are made homeless and to ensure quality social housing is provided all over the country.  That is a big challenge for the Government, but I hope we can meet it successfully.</p></speech>

I urge Members to get through these questions in order that we can move some way down the list.  Otherwise, this debate is out of control.  We spend far too much time on a limited number of questions.  I, therefore, ask Members for their co-operation.  I will allow them to ask a quick supplementary question but ask them not to make speeches in order that we can move on to the next questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400023#V00300"><p>I will be as quick as I can.  The Taoiseach was unable to answer my question.  He is right to say many questions could have been asked about this social policy issue.  Questions could have been asked about social housing and cuts in respite care services or the numbers of home help hours, etc.  However, my question was focused on the fact that in 2013 the Government had closed two schemes because it had been advised they were in breach of the Equal Status Act and the Disability Act.  As a result, 5,000 citizens with disabilities have been denied supports.  This concerns equality proofing, an issue I have been raising since I became a Member of the House.  Why has there not been equality proofing?  It is now two years since the schemes were closed, but the Taoiseach does not know when the issue will be resolved for the citizens involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400023#V00400"><p>In his supplementary reply to me the Taoiseach said the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy had met on 23 February, but he subsequently informed me that the sub-committee had been merged with the Cabinet sub-committee on public service reform.  Therefore, the questions predate the merger and the Taoiseach should have spoken about the new merged entity in his response.  This is important because it involves a relegation of social policy at Cabinet level.  In some respects, it is difficult to reconcile the idea that the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy would be included with the Cabinet sub-committee most responsible for the cuts affecting social policy, namely, the sub-committee dealing with public service reform and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government lacks a strong social dimension.  That the social policy sub-committee has been merged with that on public service reform and that the Government has ended up mixing ICT strategy in the public service with social policy is a mistake.  I suggest housing issues should be dealt with separately.  The Minister has, for example, made a hames of the issue of rent allowance, which has caused untold misery for families across the country.  A properly functioning Cabinet sub-committee on social policy would have alerted the Government and not allowed that to happen.  The impact of the decision on rent allowance has been to shove families into appalling and low standard accommodation.  If there was a proper social input at Cabinet level, the cut in the number of career guidance hours in schools would not have happened, nor would we have had the discretionary medical cards debacle.  I put it to the Taoiseach that social policy deserves to be deal with by a separate Cabinet sub-committee.  Is it correct that the meeting on 23 February was a meeting of the merged committees?</p></speech>

We have an unprecedented crisis in social housing and have now exposed a widespread crisis in the quality of existing social housing which is substandard to the point where it is not save for the huge numbers of families living in it.  Will the sub-committee treat this as an emergency issue?  Will it show some urgency and acknowledge that social policy is failing disastrously?</p><p>The facts speak for themselves.  It is getting worse by the minute and there is no sign whatsoever, notwithstanding grandiose announcements that were made nearly six months ago, and nothing is changing on the ground.  I want the Taoiseach to say what he is doing about it and what is this committee doing to push up the priority of what is probably the major social crisis facing this country.</p></speech>

The hard-hitting concrete items that have been raised by the leaders of the two main Opposition parties and by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, put flesh and blood on the arid statistics.  I remind the Taoiseach that the social impact - those are his words - of 100,000 mortgages under stress, of which 40,000 are under extreme distress, represents in the first instance about 250,000 human beings who are Irish people, of which 100,000 are children.

It assesses and presents the Government's consideration options or any alternative measures to achieve a better outcome or to address barriers to achieving social policy priorities.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400024#W03900"><p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The tenth ASEM summit of Heads of State and Government took place in Milan on 16 and 17 October 2014, on the theme of Responsible Partnership for Sustainable Growth and Security.  The format of the summit involved two plenary sessions and a discussion session.  I attended and contributed to the first plenary, Promoting Financial and Economic Cooperation through Enhanced Europe-Asia Connectivity.  The Minister of State for European Affairs and Data Protection, Deputy Dara Murphy, attended the second plenary and the less formal discussion on my behalf.  In total, the Heads of State and Government, or their high-level representatives, of 51 Asian and European countries attended, together with then President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, the then President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Barroso, and the Secretary-General of ASEAN, Le Luong Minh.  The summit was hosted by the Italian Prime Minister and chaired by Mr Van Rompuy. </p>  <p>  The outcome document of the summit is the Chair&rsquo;s statement which I have circulated with my reply.  The main topics covered in that statement include promoting financial and economic co-operation through enhanced Europe-Asia connectivity; Europe-Asia partnership in addressing global matters in an inter-connected world; promoting co-operation on employment, education, social and cultural issues; regional and international issues; and the future direction of ASEM. </p>  <p>  On the margins of the ASEM conference I met with the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr. Tấn Dũng.  We discussed the growing links between Ireland and Vietnam and the possibility of forging closer links in the future, including the restarting of the inter-country adoption process; bilateral trade ties, particularly with regard to meat exports; and Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme to Vietnam.  I also briefed the Prime Minister on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  I had a brief meeting with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Loong.  We spoke about the important role played by Brother Joe McNally in cultural and education policy in Singapore, as well as economic issues, including investment and growth.  I also had the opportunity for an informal conversation with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Shinzo Abe, during which I recalled our very productive meetings in 2013 and welcomed the imminent re-entry of Irish beef to the Japanese market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400025#X00100"><p>These questions were tabled approximately five months ago.  The Ceann Comhairle noted the long time lag between tabling and discussing them.  However, the Taoiseach has reduced by half the number of times he must deal with questions.  Before his time, questions to the Taoiseach were taken twice a week.  Whenever the Taoiseach misses a session because he happens to be missing on a Tuesday, as is sometimes understandable, the session is never rescheduled.</p><p>Fundamentally, the Taoiseach will agree that while ASEM summits do not achieve much directly, they provide an opportunity to meet leaders of many other countries.  I presume many of the points of significance touched on at the summit will also have been touched on by the recent European Council meeting, on which we will have statements later.  The ASEM process is becoming increasingly in-depth as a result of the sectoral sessions for Ministers.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether human rights were discussed at the summit and, if so, what was the consensus on same?</p><p>The issue of trade was discussed and was among the principal topics at a number of ministerial meetings.  The push for a new trade agreement through the Doha Round appears to be gaining some momentum.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that issue?  What sense did he get from the summit that there may be a realistic possibility of the Doha Round gaining increased momentum?  Where does Ireland stand on such trade negotiations and what are our aspirations in that regard?</p><p>There is a growing concern in society about the lack of debate on trade talks at the international and global level.  There is a sense that they are being conducted in a manner that is detached from citizens.  The proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, between the United States and Europe is one example.  Many of the issues being raised may not be fair or accurate in terms of what will or will not happen, particularly regarding the capacity of corporations to have recourse to international law that would trump the law of national states and food issues such as hormones in beef, genetically modified products and so forth.  This detachment needs to be removed because there is little connection between much of what is taking place in global and European institutions and the daily lives of citizens in this country and other countries.  This is a major issue and I ask the Taoiseach to indicate where he stands on it in the context of the discussions on trade at the ASEM Summit.</p><p>Was climate change discussed at the summit?  One of the great consequences of the dramatic expansion of Asian economies, particularly the Chinese economy, has been a consequent impact on the quality of life in Asian countries arising from climate change and pollution, including air pollution.  I read an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>about an excellent documentary made by a Chinese citizen on the impact of economic expansion on the quality of life in China.  Initially, the department of the environment in China welcomed the video and praised its author.  My linguistic skills do not extend to pronouncing his name.  In any case, the video was a significant event in China, one which is being viewed as part of a China spring in terms of environmental awareness and policy.  More than 200 million people accessed the video online, which is an extraordinary number.  According to the article, the Chinese authorities then decided to suppress the video.  Some people believe there is a struggle under way within the Chinese Communist Party, with environmentalists in the department of the environment and other departments seeking to shift the debate from economic growth to one which considers other issues. </p><p>Economic growth affects the rest of the world in terms of the climate change agenda and quality of life issues.  Did the summit discuss pollution and the relationship between economic growth and climate change?  On a related human rights issue, is it not rather disturbing that, despite the video to which I referred being accessed by more than 200 million people, an instruction was issued to all social media and websites to cease facilitating people wishing to view it?  This video clearly shows the impact the rapidly expanding economy is having in terms of quality of life, pollution and environmental issues.  This impact is applicable across Asia and was also applicable in the West.  We must also take our share of responsibility in terms of the earlier phases of economic growth and development in the West and their consequential impact on the environment.  </p></speech>

I agree that answering questions about a meeting that took place last October is not very good, which is the reason I indicated to the party leaders opposite that I would be happy to oblige them if they were to select a Priority Question during questions.  If they want an issue dealt with more quickly, perhaps they will discuss it with the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400025#X00400"><p>Human rights were a major topic of discussion at the summit.  Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to protect and promote human rights in accordance with the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights treaties and instruments.  They also reaffirmed their willingness to promote further co-operation in ASEM in the field of human rights, including through best practice and sharing experiences.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  A discussion took place on the important role of governments, international and national human rights institutions and regional organisations in promoting and protecting human rights.  Leaders underlined their commitment to strengthen collaboration to advance the promotion and protection of human rights through the Human Rights Council, particularly the universal periodic review and its special procedures and mechanisms.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Leaders condemned all forms of incitement to hatred and intolerance, including xenophobia, religious hatred and violence.  They stressed the importance of respect and understanding for cultural and religious diversity and promoting tolerance, respect, dialogue and co-operation among different cultures, civilizations and peoples.  As Deputy Martin is only too well aware, the events taking place in a number of countries do not reflect any of these aspirations.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In respect of trade, from Ireland's point of view, there has been a great deal of activity t</font>o establish and strengthen bilateral connections between Ireland and Asia, including the strengthening of trade and investment links.  For example, in 2014, there were 12 ministerial visits to Asia and a State visit to China.  These visits show our strong commitment to building our links with Asia and many of them had highly beneficial consequences.  For example, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, has done great work in enhancing agrifood exports to Asia.  This has had many positive results, notably the lifting of the ban on beef exports to Japan and the recent lifting of the ban on sales of Irish beef in China.  Food and drink exports to China grew by an estimated 40% last year alone, which gives a clear indication of the considerable potential of the Irish agrifood sector in the Asian region.  Last week, I had discussions with a number of companies in the United States which are interested in working with Irish companies to increase exports to Asia. </p><p>Our educational links with Asia are becoming stronger every year.  Many of our third level institutions are developing partnerships and signing bilateral agreements with a variety of institutions in Asia.  More than 150 such bilateral arrangements are in place with Chinese institutions alone.  During a visit to China last year, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, secured an agreement that Ireland would be recognised as a country of honour at the Chinese educational expo in October 2016.  This provides an opportunity to increase awareness of Irish higher education institutions among the Chinese public.  As Deputies are aware, an increasing number of students are travelling to China for full semesters at third level to immerse themselves in what is a difficult language for Europeans to learn and understand.</p><p>However, our links are not limited to China alone, as two education missions took place to India last year and memorandums of understanding with the Republic of Korea and Japan were signed in 2013 by the then Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p> The Government has established a growing investment relationship with Asia.  A key objective of IDA Ireland's Horizon 2020 strategy is to win 20% of new name business in growth markets by 2020.  Good progress is being made in meeting this target, with a figure of 18% having being achieved by the end of 2013.  Asia plays an important part in meeting that target.  Japan is a significant source of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  There are now more than 50 Japanese companies with a presence here, of which 22 are IDA Ireland-assisted, making Japan the sixth largest contributor to foreign direct investment, with more than 2,500 people employed in assisted companies.  The China-Ireland technology growth capital fund that was launched in January 2014 will target investment in both growing Irish technology companies with strategic ambitions to access the Chinese market and growing Chinese technology companies with strategic ambitions to access the European market through Ireland.  Moreover, an increasing number of Indian pharmaceutical firms are developing a presence here, while a number of Indian information and communications technology, ICT, firms also are setting up operations in Ireland and now employ more than 3,000 people.  In the other direction, companies such as Kerry Group, CRH and PM Group have a strong presence in India.  For example, Kerry Group is an important player in the food ingredients sector which supplies Subway, McDonald's and other catering related companies.</p> <p> Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin mentioned the international trade agreements, of which the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, is one going the other way.  I had discussions on it in America last week and, clearly, it is in Ireland's interests, more than any other European country, to see a conclusion being reached on that agreement.  While there are difficulties, I hope it will be substantially completed by the end of the year because it is important that it happen during the lifetime of this Administration or there may be a danger that it might not happen at all.  As for what I envisage happening in respect of Asia not waiting for international agreements with the European Union, I note that China is signing up to agreements with a number of individual countries.  We had a visit from the then Vice President Xi Jinping and I believe the Ceann Comhairle visited China at a different time.  However, there appears to be substantial growing interest in doing business with China from here, as well as there being obvious Chinese interest in Ireland.  These are matters that should be pursued.</p> <p> For the information of the Deputy, the statement that will accompany this reply contains 45 points of agreement or, if one likes, the conclusions of the meeting.  Point No. 19 refers to how leaders concurred on the seriousness of the challenge posed by climate change.  They agreed that further and immediate ambitious action was required on the part of all parties with a view to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to meet the collective objective of limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  In that context, leaders supported and called for the success of the 2014 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, of parties in Lima, as well as the 2015 conference to be held later this year in Paris.  Leaders resolved to work towards the adoption at the 21st conference of a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC applicable to all parties.  They also underscored their commitment to work together to address the issues of climate change and environmental protection in accordance with all of the principles and provisions of the United Nations on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  There is a range of points that I will circulate with the reply for the information of Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400026#Y00200"><p>It is good that there was a discussion about human rights protections.  As the Taoiseach is aware, 60% of the world's population live in Asia where there is massive poverty, inequality, child exploitation, as well as sweatshop wages and appalling conditions for millions of workers.  I am interested to ascertain what discussions were held on tackling these issues and what the outcomes were.  The Taoiseach has also stated there was a discussion on the impact of Asian economies on global warming.  Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are among Asian countries that are facing extreme risks from climate change.  While it can be seen on our own small island, it is a huge issue in that region.  The Taoiseach will recall that last month massive devastation was caused on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu by one of the most powerful storms ever in that region.  I understand the Asian and Pacific Ocean states are planning a major climate change conference to be held in Paris in November or December and that one issue on the cl&aacute;r will be a globally funded insurance pool to aid in the recovery from climate-related weather disasters.  Was this issue raised at the Milan conference and what is the Government's attitude to it?  Would it look favourably on such a fund to help the region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400026#Y00300"><p>The answer to the question is there was quite a deal of discussion about the requirement to promote and protect human rights in accordance with the United Nations Charter.  A willingness was expressed by everybody to promote further co-operation through the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, in the field of human rights, including, as I stated, through what is best practice in the sharing of experiences.  There was a welcome for the convening of the 13th informal ASEM seminar on human rights which was held in Copenhagen in 2013 and which focused on environmental and human rights.  The 14th informal ASEM seminar on human rights took place in Vietnam in November and the 15th seminar will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, in October.  The leaders present at the meeting underlined the important roles of governments and international and national human rights institutions in promoting and protecting human rights.  They underlined their commitment to strengthen collaboration to advance the promotion and protection of human rights through the Human Rights Council.  They emphasised that members of vulnerable groups needed particular attention to enjoy their full human rights.  They reaffirmed the important roles of parliaments, civil society and the media in strengthening the foundations of democracy, thereby contributing to the sound basis for sustainable development.  In that sense, there was a welcome for the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership held in Rome in October 2014 and the tenth Asia-Europe People's Forum which was held in Milan.  As I stated, there was total condemnation of all issues from xenophobia to religious hatred and violence.</p>  <p>  The leaders reiterated their determination to strengthen preparedness and the response to disasters and to build resilience, including through awareness programmes, early warning systems, search, rescue and relief operations and applying innovation, science and technology, as well as reducing vulnerability to and losses caused by disasters.  They also stressed the need to build the resilience of the most vulnerable, including women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as improving the capacities of local communities and societies to adapt to and manage the impact of disasters.  There was a welcome for the two ASEM conferences on disaster risk reduction and management held in 2013 and 2014.  There was a call for a deepening of co-operation between Europe and Asia on disaster risk reduction and management, while there was an invitation to all ASEM partners to work towards a strengthening of the renewed international framework for disaster risk reduction to be adopted at the third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to be held this month in Sendai, Japan.  There was a call for greater collaboration in dealing with health care for children, women and the elderly, in particular.</p><p>In this context, there was a welcome for the ASEM workshop on public health emergency management, which was held in Beijing, China, at the end of 2014.  In addition, an initiative is to be held in India next month on non-invasive diagnostic technologies for diabetes and its treatment as a lifestyle disease.  All of these things were mentioned and reflected upon, and are included in the statement I circulated to Members.  In the not too distant future, they might get a chance to follow through on some of these again.</p></speech>

Throughout the country there has been an increasing number of such cases in different courts.  Given that Castlebar is the Taoiseach's own home town, will he accept at long last that the number of repossession cases is out of hand?  It is indicative that the Government's response to the mortgage crisis is not working.  The legislation that Deputy Michael McGrath brought forward last week should have been accepted by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that people should only lose their homes as a very last resort.  That is not happening, however, because banks continue to have a veto on mortgage resolutions.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, promised to change the legislation.  He said that legislation underpinning the personal insolvency schemes would be tweaked and changed.  In addition, the T&aacute;naiste has said she supports Deputy Penrose's legislation on reducing bankruptcy from three years to one year.</p>  <p>  Two proposals for legislative change have been put forward by Ministers, so can the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will amend the personal insolvency legislation?  Can he also indicate when the timeframe concerning the bankruptcy period will change?</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Government subsumed the Consumer Agency into the Competition Authority.  Consumers need protection but I hope it will not be diluted in the agency.  There are vast differences in the cost of premiums quoted by insurance companies.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House when the insurance Bill will be published?  Will it contain sections to protect consumers from companies charging exorbitant rates on prices for basic insurance cover?</p>  <p>  Last night RTE had a special programme on loyalist and IRA so-called punishment beatings of individuals.  It was vicious and brutal according to the testimonies given by family members and individuals.  The scale of it would have taken a lot of people by surprise.  Not only did the programme represent vicious beatings, but it was also about controlling communities and society.  At the end of the programme it was stated that the whole phenomenon has not ended.</p></speech>

I am coming to the Bill.  There were approximately 600 beatings in the North in recent years.  I wish to ask three questions.  First, when can we expect the criminal justice Bill to be published?  Second, has this issue been discussed at any stage at the North-South ministerial meetings?  Third, will the Taoiseach allow time in the House to discuss the content of the RTE programme and debate it?</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy an update on that.  It might be appropriate to have a discussion on Northern Ireland, including the situation that applies now and elements of the past.  We can arrange that through the Whips later.</p>  <p>  As regards mortgage arrears and repossessions, clearly the Government does not want people to have their homes repossessed where that is preventable.  I am not sure how many were actually approved yesterday.  The Government is committed to bringing forward a further package of measures in April to deal with the mortgage position.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the Bill put forward by Deputy Penrose to reduce the period of bankruptcy from three years to one year.  The Government has not considered this as part of the overall package, but will give consideration to it.  However, this is not a magic bullet to resolve matters.  It does not apply in the case of mortgages because that is a secure debt.</p><p>The position must be considered that the banks would actually have a greater opportunity to have credit unions and everybody else shoved aside and would be able to acquire possession much faster and the mortgage would still remain.  People who might assume that a reduction to one year of bankruptcy is some sort of panacea for all of these difficult problems need to be very careful about what it is that we actually implement here.  The Government will consider a range of other measures and bring them here in April.  It is in everybody's interest that there be engagement and that people hold onto their houses where that is at all possible.  </p></speech>

This takes on a particular urgency given the loggerheads between the HSE and HIQA at this time.  Part of the problem is that HIQA recommendations in a report on one hospital do not carry across into other hospitals, although they may face the same problems.  There is actually no mechanism that I can find within the Department of Health or the HSE to implement recommendations which HIQA makes in reports.  When will the legislation to allow the Minister's proposed reform be published and will it put in place a mechanism to ensure that the HIQA recommendations are implemented across the health services?</p>  <p>  As regards the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill, there are more than 7,000 orders for repossession sitting in the courts, and the fact is that current Government policy facilitates the repossession of family homes because it provides the banks with a veto over any efforts to find a resolution.  According to Central Bank figures, there are now 37,778 homes in the most serious of arrears and these families are most likely to be facing legal actions.  This is double the figure from September 2012.  The Government says it plans to introduce new legislation - is this is addition to the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill?  Was this crisis discussed this morning at the Cabinet meeting?  Does the Government intend to change or do away with the veto that the banks exercise?</p>  <p>  The general practitioner medical service Bill 2015 was to provide universal GP services to all persons aged 70 years or over.  Last year, the D&aacute;il passed the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 to provide for free GP care for under-sixes.  We were told this would be in place by the end of last year.  When that deadline was missed in December last year, the T&aacute;naiste said she was confident it would be rolled out in the new year.  It is still not there and now we are told it will be in place by June this year.  Can we get some clarity on this?  Will the long-promised free GP care be available in June this year and when will the health (general practitioner medical service) Bill 2015 be published?  </p></speech>

The question of the medical cards for under-sixes is under negotiation between the HSE, the Department and the GPs.  They are not concluded yet.  I understand there is a further meeting this week and the Minister will report to Cabinet on the outcome of that meeting.  Clearly, these depend upon participation by general practitioners to make them work.  I do not have a date for the Deputy in respect of the HIQA Act to which he referred, that is the Health Act of 2007.  I will update Deputy Adams on the work that is under way there.</p>  <p>  I have already said to Deputy Martin that the Government will bring forward a number of options for further enhancing the situation in so far as mortgages are concerned.  I would say to Deputy Adams that 100,000 cases have been settled and agreed and the vast majority of those are able to sustain the commitments entered into in the rearranged position and that is to be welcomed.  There are others out there that have a different range of difficulties, and they can only be sorted out by having engagement and a process by which they might be concluded.  We will come back to that in April.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400029#BB05000"><p>I regret the loss of a German-registered aircraft today in the French Alps, with a total loss of life of approximately 148 or 150 people.  On behalf of the country, I have sent a message to President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel following the tragedy.</p>  <p>  Last week's European Council meeting focused on three very important issues for the European Union, namely, building an energy union, the economic situation in the European Union, including the European semester 2015; external relations, including the situation in Ukraine; preparations for the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga in May; and the current political and security situation in Libya.  Before the meeting opened, the European Council held a minute's silence out of respect for the victims of the appalling terrorist attack in Tunisia the previous day.  We extended our deepest sympathy to the victims, their families and the Tunisian people and confirmed our commitment to intensifying co-operation with Tunisia to counter this common terrorist threat, to strengthen Tunisia's promising democracy and to assist its economic and social development.</p>  <p>  Energy union was the first item on the agenda.  Ensuring Europe's citizens and businesses have a reliable, secure, affordable and sustainable supply of energy is one of the five priority strands of the strategic agenda agreed by the European Council in June last year.  The Commission has described the free flow of energy across borders as the "fifth freedom" of the European Union.  In order to promote and harness the full benefits of this freedom, we must move quickly and decisively, not least given instability in the European Union's neighbourhood and the realities of climate change.  The European Council discussed a number of concrete and measurable steps to deliver energy union and ensure affordable, sustainable and secure energy for all member states.</p>  <p>  There was a positive response to the clear roadmap set out in the recent Commission communication on a framework strategy for a resilient energy union, with a forward-looking climate change policy.  Ireland has very much welcomed the framework strategy.  In particular, we value its vision of an energy union, with citizens at its core, taking ownership of the energy transition, participating actively in the market, empowered and protected as consumers.</p><p> The discussions of Heads of State and Government were focused on two key aspects of the energy union project: enhancing energy security and reaping the benefits of the internal energy market.  When considering energy security, it may be natural to think first of those countries at direct risk of interruption of gas supplies from Russia.  However, enhancing energy security is also of importance to member states such as Ireland which are on the periphery of the energy union, poorly connected to the wider European grid or heavily reliant on a particular source of energy.  Diversifying the routes and sources of our energy and putting in place appropriate infrastructure to support that diversification is critical for us.</p> <p> At my instigation, a specific reference to peripheral regions was included in the section of the European Council conclusions dealing with infrastructure and inter-connections.  This is important as we work to ensure that citizens in the periphery can enjoy the same benefits from energy union as those living in areas which are already well connected.  While Ireland's geographic location on the edge of Europe may present particular challenges in terms of integration with an energy union, it is also a source of great opportunity for developing indigenous energy resources.  Ireland has potentially among the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world, including wave and tidal energy as well as offshore wind.  For this reason, Ireland strongly supported the inclusion of a reference in the European Council conclusions to the development of an energy and climate-related technology and innovation strategy, including next generation renewables.</p> <p> The European Council discussed in some detail the important issue of transparency in gas markets.  There have been concerns that some member states might be incentivised to conclude private gas deals with external suppliers which are either illegal under EU law or could undermine the building of energy union and principles of energy security.  This is clearly not in our collective interest.  The European Council urged that the transparency of gas agreements with external suppliers would be reinforced and compatibility with EU energy security provisions ensured.  lmportantly, it was recognised that this should be done while also guaranteeing the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.</p> <p> The European Council concluded its energy union deliberations with a discussion on how best to co-ordinate diplomatic action on energy and climate ahead of the critical climate change conference in Paris in December.  We noted the ambitious objective set out in the EU's intended nationally determined contribution, which is fully in line with the conclusions of the October 2014 European Council, and urged other parties to the agreement to submit their own contributions by the end of March.</p> <p> The European Council also held a wide-ranging exchange of views on the economic situation in the EU.  The evidence suggests that Europe is now in the early stages of recovery from a period of deep and protracted recession.  The year 2015 is the first year since the onset of the crisis in which all member state economies are expected to record growth.  Lower oil prices, the ECB's expanded asset purchase programme and the depreciation of the euro are all having a positive impact.  That said, it is clear that much remains to be done by member states to ensure that the current recovery is truly sustainable and not merely a cyclical upswing.</p> <p> In his presentation, ECB President Draghi underlined the importance of continued progress on structural reforms.  The more positive economic data cannot be used as an excuse to take the foot off the pedal when it comes to improving Europe's competitiveness and implementing urgently needed reforms.  The importance of boosting investment was also underlined, with the European Council welcoming agreement by finance Ministers on a general approach on establishment of the European fund for strategic investments, EFSI.  The EFSI is being designed to provide additional risk-bearing capacity to the European Investment Bank, which will allow them to crowd-in private sector finance for new projects.  As Commission Vice President Katainen indicated, there is plenty of liquidity in Europe but it is not currently being translated into investment.  We continue to see possible opportunities to develop synergies between the new EU investment plan and the Ireland strategic investment fund and the strategic banking corporation of Ireland.  These will be considered carefully over the coming months.  </p> <p> I updated European Council counterparts on developments in the Irish economy.  The most recent CSO figures point to growth of 4.8% last year.  This is our best performance since 2007 and the highest growth rate in the EU.  Unemployment continues to fall month-on-month, now down to just over 10%, and we expect it to be back in single digits shortly.  Encouragingly, we are seeing significant reductions in both long-term and youth unemployment.  There was significant interest from European Council members in Ireland's approach and our experience was cited by a number of colleagues.  The recovery we are now witnessing would not have been possible without the willingness of this Government to take and follow through on difficult decisions.  It also demanded very real sacrifices by the Irish people.  Our priority, looking ahead, is to ensure not just that Ireland's recovery is strong and sustainable but that the benefits can be shared by all.  </p> <p> In my intervention, I also made the point that in developing Ireland's budgetary plans for 2016 onwards, it is important we work with realistic estimates of both the economy's growth potential and future investment needs.  I underlined then, and will reiterate here now, that Ireland does not have a problem with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Our issue lies with some of the methodologies and calculations used in the application of these rules.  Simply put, our position is that the Stability and Growth Pact rules should support a budgetary stance for Ireland that correctly reflects the outturn and the prospects for the Irish economy.  This depends on the sensible application of the rules, ensuring that results are based on reality rather than the application of older trend information.  The issue is currently being discussed at a technical level and I hope it will be possible to agree a solution soon.  To repeat, we are not trying to bend or weaken the rules in order to get special treatment.  The catastrophic experience of our crash must make Ireland among the strongest supporters of the concept of rigorous rules, applied fairly.</p> <p> The European Council concluded the first phase of European Semester 2015, the Union's annual cycle of economic policy co-ordination.  The conclusions provide strong political reinforcement, as expected, for the three key pillars of European Semester 2015.  These are boosting investment, a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms and continued fiscal responsibility.  Procedural improvements have been introduced for this year's European Semester process to facilitate stronger national-level engagement, including engagement by national parliaments and other key stakeholders.  I would encourage Members of this House to support engagement with the process and to welcome the session organised by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs with the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, earlier this month.</p> <p> The European Council exchange on economic issues included consideration of the current position in relation to the negotiations with the US on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  The European Council called on both sides to make every effort to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement by the end of this year.  Leaders also highlighted the need to communicate the benefits of the agreement and to enhance dialogue with civil society.  On the latter point, I would mention that an important seminar will take place in Dublin Castle on Friday.  Hosted by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m will address the seminar.  Representatives of trade unions, farming organisations and business groups will also participate.  The event will launch a report by Copenhagen Economics on TTIP's potential impact on Ireland's economy.  This is the type of open dialogue which is essential to ensuring that there is a broad understanding among all stakeholders of TTIP's aims and benefits.  This report was endorsed by Cabinet today.  </p> <p> During my visit to the US for St. Patrick's Day engagements, I had discussions with President Obama and US Trade Representative Michael Froman on TTIP.  I also discussed this with Europe's ambassador, David O'Sullivan, and the other representatives.  On the basis of these engagements, I was able to convey their positive sentiments to European Council colleagues.  It is important that Europe and America do not cancel each other out.  We should work together on both the simple and the difficult issues in order to conclude an agreement which has the potential to create a couple of million jobs either side of the Atlantic. </p> <p> The current situation in Greece was not on the agenda for the European Council.  However, the European Council did get a short read-out on Friday from President Tusk on a meeting the previous evening which was held with Prime Minister Tsipras, the Presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup and the leaders of Germany and France.  Prime Minister Tsipras had sought that meeting and it is to be hoped that it will contribute to a clearer understanding by Greece of what is required now, following the Eurogroup meeting of 20 February.  Greece is to present a list of reforms within the next few days that will pave the way for constructive engagement with a view to successfully concluding the programme.  The meeting may have been useful in toning down the rhetoric between Athens and other capitals.</p><p>I expect that yesterday's meeting between Prime Minister Tsipras and Chancellor Merkel will have also have helped in strengthening some trust and confidence between each other.</p> <p> I spoke directly with Prime Minister Tsipras in the margins of the European Council meeting and I reiterated Ireland's commitment, and that of the other member states, to working with him and with Greece to resolve the crisis.  I told him how, in Ireland, we worked with the institutions to ensure that our programme was aligned with the policies of our Government.  We not only successfully exited the programme, but have since become the fastest growing economy in Europe.  So, I would urge the authorities in Greece to engage now with the institutions in a constructive and swift manner to meet the deadline and return Greece to a sustainable economic footing.</p> <p> Let me say a few words about Ukraine and EU relations with Russia.  It is just over a year since the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation.  The European Council does not recognise, and will continue to condemn, this illegal act.  The EU has consistently stressed its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its support, including significant financial support, for the reform programme of its Government and in addressing the humanitarian needs of its people.</p> <p> At the meeting last week, there was an indepth discussion on the latest developments in eastern Ukraine.  There has been a welcome improvement in the overall security situation following the signing on 12 February of a package of measures to implement the September Minsk agreements.  The issue of sanctions against Russia was a key element of the discussion.  As expected, there was agreement that no basis existed for imposing additional measures at this time, given the recent progress in the ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line.  There was also agreement that there should be no relaxation of existing sanctions, given the fragility of the current situation and the many challenges that lie ahead.</p> <p> The question of the early roll-over of existing sanctions, originally adopted in July 2014 and enhanced the following September, was considered.  The consensus among Heads of State and Government was that a decision on this should be made and clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, foreseen for the end of 2015.  Necessary decisions in this regard will be taken in the coming months.  In addition to that, the European Council sent a clear message that the EU stands ready to take further restrictive reassures if necessary.  Many leaders underlined that continued unity in our approach to the crisis remained of paramount importance.</p> <p> European Council discussion also focused on progress in the implementation of the 12 February agreement.  There was broad support for strengthening EU engagement with the OSCE mission to enhance its capacity to monitor effectively and verify the ceasefire.  Leaders also reiterated the EU's continued support for Ukraine's reform process.</p> <p> Concern was expressed at Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns.  The European Council asked High Representative Mogherini to prepare, in co-operation with the member states and EU institutions, an action plan by June on strategic communication aimed at countering this Russian disinformation.  I was surprised by the apparent sympathy of some Deputies for a Russian approach that had led to actions contrary to international law and the rights of small nations, cornerstones of Ireland's foreign policy since the foundation of the State.  I note that similar sneaking regarders are to be found on the extreme anti-European left and right across the Union.</p> <p> Let me conclude my statement here.  In his wrap-up statement, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address the other external relations issues considered at last week's meeting, namely, preparations for the Eastern Partnership Summit and the current political and security situation in Libya, which is quite serious.</p></speech>

While there are very important policies being rolled out or discussed at the moment, they were not on the agenda, rendering the summit itself more of a sideshow than a main event.  A defining feature of the last four years has been the Government's non-stop effort to spin everything and to ignore cynically many wider issues that have a big impact here.  Developments in Europe have been central to our economic pick-up, yet no member of the Government has ever acknowledged this.  There have been banal generalities about wanting Europe to do well, but the direct impact of European decisions on what has happened here has been ignored.  This is important because our Government keeps missing opportunities and is denying the people the opportunity to see what could and should be done to relieve debt pressures.</p>  <p>  For this summit, a lot of work went into briefing the media about the Taoiseach's agenda, but we know less today than before the summit.  In different so-called exclusives, the Taoiseach's staff briefed that he was determined that there would be no pre-election budget giveaways, that there would be major tax cuts and that he wanted the ability to spend up to &euro;1.5 billion more without breaking EU rules.  We were told that he was both against extra budget flexibility and in favour of it.  That begs the question, which is it.  It is just a continuation of the same old trick of trying to be on both sides of the fence at the same time.  This is a Taoiseach who voted against the majority of budget changes for which he now claims credit, namely, the budgetary adjustments that underpinned the fiscal recovery, a Taoiseach who spent a decade condemning the failure to spend more and now condemns the fact that so much was spent.</p>  <p>  I welcome the additional budget flexibility that has been extended to France and other countries.  That reflects the reality of a weak European economy that cannot recover without investment.  It is a great pity that the German Government did not also agree to play a part in the necessary flexibility by encouraging more domestic demand.</p>  <p>  In a few months, we will witness the next shot in our election campaign through the introduction of a spring Budget Statement.  This is an unprecedented use of the Civil Service to prepare a Government's election manifesto, as it will set out four years' worth of spending and tax proposals that have no administrative or legal status other than to serve as an election tool.  In fact, the Taoiseach essentially admitted this when he said that it would show what Fine Gael and Labour would do if re-elected.</p></speech>

Due to the Taoiseach's approach, though, we are getting nothing of the sort.  A major question is whether the Government intends to ignore recently introduced legislation on budgetary and financial procedures.  The Oireachtas has established the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to review economic projections and fiscal policy before and after major announcements.  Why has it been excluded from the discussion?  Why is the Government proposing to announce four years of budgets but not willing to have any outside consultation or review?</p>  <p>  Yet again we have a case of the Government having a public relations policy but no clear economic policy, a Government that did not deliver recovery but did everything possible to make it as unfair as it could be.  The primary objective for the Government is to claim credit for things and stop the more important debate of helping people to understand what has been happening.  The Taoiseach continues to sell a fairy tale of his decisive actions and steely negotiating skills when the truth shows nothing of the sort.  In terms of the reduction in interest rates for all bailout loans to all countries, the reduction in borrowing costs and the vital policy changes of the ECB, particularly of its president, Mr. Mario Draghi, nothing in any of these decisions was influenced by our Government.  Reductions negotiated by others were automatically extended to Ireland and were four times larger than for what our Government asked.  As the Taoiseach admitted at the time, he held no discussion with Mr. Mario Draghi before the latter's appointment.</p>  <p>  The implementation of a quantitative easing policy by the ECB in the face of opposition by some countries is a decisive move by an organisation that is now willing to do whatever it legally can to try to spark a wider recovery.  It is not enough and it is at best a short-term measure that carries some dangers, but Ireland should welcome it and call for other institutions to do more.</p>  <p>  The failure of the Greek economy to recover is the most striking example of the need to change policies.  It appears that, as acknowledged by the Taoiseach, all significant discussions last week took place in a smaller meeting, something that in itself is not a good development.  The situation today is more serious than it has been at any point in the past five years.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been arguing for the past two years that Greece needs further substantial action on its debt if it is to be given a credible path to growth.  This is not to say that Greece should be allowed do whatever it wants with other people's money, but there is a need for a long-term solution.  The evidence is that such a solution is not close.  In fact, it is now reasonable to ask whether Syriza wants to find a solution or is just trying to manage the blame game for when the full crisis comes.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F"> The Syriza-led Government&rsquo;s actions in recent weeks have not shown that it is committed to finding a solution which respects other countries.  It is fully entitled to seek to end austerity but equally it promised before the election that it had a detailed reform plan ready to implement and that it knew exactly how to ease the debt burden but not endanger Greece&rsquo;s commitments to the euro and the EU.  The failure to produce even the most basic reform plan is striking.  Slogans which get a crowd going are not the same thing as policies which can be implemented.  Wiring tourists to catch VAT fraud is not an initiative which will deliver the type of revenue Greek public services need.  It is reported that Prime Minister Tsipras even objected at the summit to international inspectors being able to check the current status of Greece&rsquo;s Government accounts, claiming that this was an affront to sovereignty.  He did so in spite of the fact that every member of the IMF has been subject to this scrutiny since the organisation was founded.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The new policy of aggressively attacking and insulting other governments may well simply be part of managing a diverse range of party factions.  Whatever the origins it is undermining the possibility of building a consensus for helping Greece.  The statement by a Minister that Greece would unleash immigrants on Europe if it did not get what it was asking for was not only wrong, it was playing to the worst type of fears currently being exploited by extremists throughout the Continent.  Another Minister said that Greece wants &euro;350 billion in reparations for past wars, including &euro;20 billion supposedly still owed under the Treaty of Versailles.  This is the type of rhetoric designed to create divisions, not to persuade.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> It is clear that the new government has a mandate to change direction, but other governments also have democratic mandates and they also have the right to represent the interests of their people.  It appears that the Eurogroup is willing to change the terms of Greek debts quite significantly and, in doing so, lift the short-term and medium-term impact of these debts.  What is not yet clear is whether Greece actually wants to negotiate.  For the sake of the people of Greece we should all hope that what we have been seeing is temporary.  Prime Minister Tsipras&rsquo;s letter of last week saying that Greece is running out of money is sobering.  It may well be that an agreement cannot be reached, but it would serve everyone&rsquo;s interests if the sloganeering and aggression were put aside for a few weeks and there was a genuine effort to find one.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> I welcome that the summit discussed and refused to lift current sanctions on Russia for its invasion and partition of Ukraine.  The real substance of the Minsk accords revolves around whether Russia will allow Ukraine to regain control of its own international border.  It is ominous that the Russian-installed rebel leaders announced last week that they want Russia to lead a so-called peacekeeping mission to Donetsk and Luhansk.  They have rejected the proposal that a genuinely independent peacekeeping force from the United Nations or the OSCE be sent, and they continue to deny OSCE monitors access to many areas.  In the four other frozen conflicts which have involved the </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">de facto</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">partitioning of states formerly under the imperial control of Russia the installation of Russian peacekeepers has been the moment when the sovereignty of the state was ended in the enclave.  In the occupied parts of Georgia this has gone even further.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The sanctions have had an impact.  Kremlin-linked oligarchs are the ones who have suffered the most and the sanctions have shown that Europe is not willing to simply do nothing in the face of the invasion and partition of Ukraine.  We should also note that the deterioration of human rights in Crimea continues.  Two people have been convicted for the crime of flying the Ukrainian flag.  The Tatar minority is being suppressed.  Freedom of speech is disappearing.  In the face of this, President Putin has confirmed that he and the Russian state invaded Crimea before the illegitimate referendum.  He has also continued his recent bullying policy towards other states, making trial bombing runs against a number of neutral states including Ireland and Sweden.  At the weekend his Government announced that Denmark would be the target of nuclear attacks if it went ahead with a missile shield.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Sinn F&eacute;in has, of course, maintained its policy of refusing to stand with Ukraine against its partition by Russia.  It continues to use the weasel words of blaming the United States and Europe while steadfastly refusing to make the simple statement that Russia should get out of Ukraine.  As predicted a fortnight ago the massed ranks of Sinn F&eacute;in representatives that went to the United States last week did not repeat their attack on the Obama Administration while they were busy collecting cheques.  Deputy Adams even took the time to have a hissy fit over the fact that the US Administration was not making a senior enough official available to receive him in Washington.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> It remains the case that there is an extremist alliance in Europe standing with Russia against the citizens of neighbouring countries.  Last week a Kremlin-funded group held a conference in St. Petersburg where the British National Party, Golden Dawn of Greece and other fascist parties spoke up in favour of Putin&rsquo;s actions.  At the weekend the French Front National used an &euro;8 million soft loan from Russia to fund regional election campaigns.  There is, in fact, almost no hard right or hard left party in Europe which does not support the increasingly authoritarian and aggressive Putin regime.  I welcome the element in the Taoiseach's statement relating to the concerted effort by Europe to deal with Russian disinformation on the Continent.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Deputy Boyd Barrett need not take this as applying to him as he did in our last session.  He is unusual in the Irish Left in having protested outside the Russian Embassy in the past.  However, he too is guilty of applying false equivalences in this case.  Nothing Europe has done in any way justifies what Russia has done to Ukraine.  The Ukrainian people want to live in a free, united, democratic and European country.  They have voted for this time and again and they have voted for the EU association agreement in overwhelming numbers.  They gave up their nuclear weapons in return for a promise that their borders would be respected.  It is our duty to stand with them and we should support a significant expansion in direct aid.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> On the subject of energy, the summit moved the agenda along in a formal way.  I recognise the central and vital necessity of an energy union because unity of purpose across the European Union is essential for our energy security into the future.  I also welcome the additional focus on the conclusion of bilateral agreements outside of the European energy union itself.  However, the focus is not yet active or urgent enough to tackle the twin crises of climate change and energy blackmail, which go to the heart of a lot of the political instability and geopolitical challenges which Europe and the European Union currently face.</font></p></speech>

Although, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, the issue was not officially on the agenda because of the refusal of some countries to formally discuss the matter, an important side meeting dealt with it.  The Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Alexis Tsipras, briefed French and German leaders about the humanitarian crisis in Greece.  He made it clear he wants to establish common ground in tackling this humanitarian crisis.  He is also dissatisfied that officials from the creditor institutions have reportedly drawn red lines which are preventing Athens from making progress.  It is clear that Mr. Tsipras is concerned that the ECB is attempting to strangle the Greek economy and handcuff the Government.</p>  <p>  Greece's debt is completely unsustainable.  So was ours, but instead of focusing on how to tackle Greece's debt and the humanitarian crisis the EU institutions are attempting to force the Greek Government to impose austerity.  The ECB is not acting as a lender of last resort as it should.  Instead, it is imposing restrictions which prevent Athens issuing more short-term debt to tide itself over.  </p>  <p>  This State and Greece have both had unfair debt burdens imposed their citizens, in our case with the compliance of our Government.  Instead of standing with the Greek Government in its attempts to tackle its humanitarian crisis the Taoiseach has consistently taken the side of the European elite and the ECB against the people of Greece.  He has moved from being an architect of austerity in our own island to being an adviser on how it can be imposed on other European states.</p><p>The Taoiseach said he told Prime Minister Tsipras that he worked with the institutions to ensure his programme was aligned with the policies of his Government, but did he tell him that he was elected to implement totally different policies?  Did he tell him that he was elected with a mandate which is significantly different from the policies he is now imposing upon people here?  Prime Minister Tsipras is acting on the basis of the mandate he received.  </p></speech>

His approach does not represent the sentiments of the majority of Irish citizens.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been very clear in extending our support and solidarity to the Greek people who have stood up against the vested and powerful interests in the EU and the ECB.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach's Government did not show the same confidence, the same sense of self-respect and the same sense of duty to Irish citizens as the Greek Government has shown to theirs.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's  reported comments to Prime Minister Tsprias in which he tried to peddle Ireland's two-tier economy, which is facilitating growing inequality and social disadvantage, as some sort of positive model - bearing in mind that earlier the Taoiseach could not answer a question from me as to how citizens with disabilities have been left waiting for two years to have very modest support - shows, in many ways, the conservatism of this Government.</p>  <p>  Just before the European Council meeting took place there was elections in Israel and the right wing Likud Party received the highest share of the vote and Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to form a coalition government this time.  However, in the run up to last week's election he stated that he will continue to do everything he can to deny the Palestinian people their right to independence and self-determination.  On the morning of the vote Mr. Netanyahu also released a video condemning Arabs for turning out in high numbers to vote and blaming this on foreign funded non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  This was both racist and anti-democratic.  The EU and other countries worldwide have an important role to play in ensuring the two state solution is supported and promoted, and I understand this is the view of the Taoiseach's Government.  Were Mr. Netanyahu's comments discussed at the Council meeting?  I welcome the recent visit there of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan.  The Irish Government has been vocal in its support for the two state solution but has sat back for far too long on the recognition of Palestine.  </p>  <p>  Towards the end of last year, as the Taoiseach will recall, motions were unanimously passed in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad calling on the Taoiseach's Government to urgently recognise the State of Palestine.  He has yet to do this.  Why is that the case?  Are Mr. Nehanyahu's comments not are a call to action?  Do we not need to send a clear message to the outgoing or incoming Prime Minister of Israel, whoever he or she might be, that they do not control or own Palestinian sovereignty.  That right belongs solely to the Palestinian people.  Will the Taoiseach now, as a matter of urgency, set the wheels in motion to ensure that this State becomes the 136th state to recognise the State of Palestine?</p>  <p>  Recently, my party colleague and the chairperson of the European Parliament's delegation to Palestine, Martina Anderson MEP, was denied access to Gaza by the Israeli authorities.  This is the second time she and delegations of European parliamentarians have been denied access to that part of the Palestinian territories.  It is unacceptable that an official EU delegation to Palestine is refused entry to inspect the dreadful situation there.  I know the Taoiseach was there some time ago and we all know that the situation has deteriorated since then.  It is unacceptable given that the EU is the largest financial donor to the Palestinians and that a delegation of the European Parliament should not be allowed to visit it.  I was also denied access on my last visit to that region.  Will the Taoiseach formally complain to the Israeli ambassador in Dublin about their continually refusing entry to Gaza to Irish political representatives?  </p>  <p>  I also note the Taoiseach's remarks on the conflict in Ukraine.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Minsk agreements, the ceasefires and the potential bridge to a genuine peace process but there has been firing from both sides on the front line which is undermining the ceasefire.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the onus is on all sides and on international actors to reduce tensions in the region, to focus on resolving the conflict and to urgently tackle the humanitarian crisis that has been created in Ukraine?</p></speech>

The White Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, which is currently being drafted, will hopefully show that while wind energy is an effective source of renewable energy, we need diversity in the supply of renewable energy.  We need to investigate the development of solar, wave and tidal energy.  It is also welcome that a focus is being put on energy storage.   As Ireland is an island nation, we have a lack of grid interconnection with the rest of Europe.  It is important we focus on the development of energy storage systems, which would be of major significance to this country.</p>  <p>  The improvement in energy efficiency in the housing sector is also a massive issue.  The improvement in the level of energy efficiency to date has been very poor.  It is also very important in tackling fuel poverty.  I urge the Government to focus resources on alleviating fuel poverty with regard to energy efficiency.  The most vulnerable in society should not be sacrificed during the transition to renewable energy.  There needs to be a European-wide definition of fuel poverty and a sufficient strategy on how it should be tackled.</p>  <p>  We learned recently that following years of loyal and unstinting commitment to the EU's austerity rules, regardless of their effect on the social and economic fabric of the State, the Government has now got a problem with the EU's budgetary rules.  It is a little late in the day for the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to be worried about the EU's austerity rules.  What is shocking for most of us  on this side of the House who have argued that those rules have been inefficient and unfair in the effect they have had on the poor and vulnerable is that the concern about the rules and the tough talking that is now taking place is due to the fact that the Government has made the promise of a tax cut to a certain income bracket, one that the members of Government inhabit.  Where was the concern when the austerity rules were leading to a third of a million people emigrating?  Where was the tough talk with the troika when the troika-inspired cuts were shrinking the economy?  It is a little late in the day for the Taoiseach to be getting worried about austerity rules.  He campaigned for them and implemented them in this State regardless of their social and economic cost during the past four years.</p>  <p>  Last summer, Italy and France started to campaign for some flexibility and we in Sinn F&eacute;in called on the Government to back them, but all we heard was stony silence.  As always, the Government follows; it is simply incapable of taking a lead in this issue.  I imagine the Taoiseach's EU counterparts raised an eyebrow or two when they heard that suddenly Ireland wants to object to these rules.  The Taoiseach and the Government have loyally implemented austerity rules on cuts and reductions without protest.  I am more inclined to believe that this sudden turn of face, this new road to Damascus conversion by the Government has all got to do with the issue of expenditure benchmarks.  This rule, which will apply to Ireland's budget in October, will, according to a reply from my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, limit Ireland's new expenditure to &euro;400 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.401" nospeaker="true" time="18:10:00" ><p>Given that the Government has promised it in another irresponsible and unfair tax cut targeting higher earners, it is scrambling for some leeway to fulfil commitments to its narrow sector of society.</p><p>The Government is one of the most divisive in the history of the State with regard to the two-tiered society it has created.  Over the past years it is very clear that we have a Government of the haves against the have-nots, with a Government of private health against public health care and the Government of bank debt and bond debt against household debt.  This is a Government of high-paid earners against low-paid earners and these are totally in line with the Government's approach to the next budget.</p><p>We should have leeway.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the party of self-determination.  We should have leeway with regards to improving our public services, abolishing regressive and unjust taxes and tackling homelessness.  Over Christmas, the D&aacute;il was inflamed by the need to tackle homelessness.  In my county, the budget meant to build new houses has not arrived at the end of the first quarter of the year.  The Government had no difficulty in undermining access to public services.  People have bad access if they want to access public health services through the accident and emergency units because they must wait on trolleys.  People also have problems with access to elective surgery-----</p></speech>

The rush to complete this agreement is unprecedented.  A massive tide of popular opinion is turning against TTIP across Europe.  Is that why the European Council called for the EU to hurriedly finish negotiations?  It is happening in the dark, as there is no transparency.  The rush to finish it will create a further lack of transparency.  The Taoiseach is shaking his head but the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, made a recommendation on 7 January 2015 that there should be greater public access to key TTIP negotiating documents.  In response to a question raised by Sinn F&eacute;in in the European Parliament yesterday, the Commission stated that documents setting out the position of the EU on key aspects of the TTIP negotiations, such as public procurement, will not be made public.  Is the Taoiseach not concerned that the European Commission is ignoring the Ombudsman's advice?  The simple fact of the matter is that the European public have a fundamental right to access those documents, to know what deals the European Commission is making on our behalf and what lobby groups have the inside track on these negotiations.</p></speech>

Recently, a legal document from the regulatory co-operation chapter of the agreement was leaked, which makes the Taoiseach's statement seem naive or willfully deceptive.  The leaked document clearly outlines how TTIP is being used to undermine democracy by putting the concerns of corporations before the interests of the people Governments are supposed to be serving.  Business Europe and the US Chamber of Commerce, as far back as 2012, have been lobbying for the regulatory co-operation mechanism.  They want to establish a private forum that will come into being after TTIP has been implemented, where any legislation or regulations proposed by any EU member state that affects their profits can be brought to their attention before the legislation or regulation comes into effect.  To quote Corporate Europe Observatory "This means businesses, for instance, at an early stage, can try to block rules intended to prevent the food industry from marketing foodstuffs with toxic substances, laws trying to keep energy companies from destroying the climate, or regulations to combat pollution and protect consumers."</p>  <p>  On top of this, laws and regulations that affect trade will have to pass an impact assessment.  If it is found that the interests of corporations are infringed in any way, a report by the proposed regulatory co-operation body will cite a detrimental impact on transatlantic trade.  The new rules also outline how a regulatory exchange must take place if a party requests it on the basis that planned or existing regulatory acts of member states are likely to have an impact on trade and investment.  When it was pointed out by the director of trade policy today that the leaked document has yet to be finalised, striking articles are contained in the chapter as it stands and they pose grave questions about the value of democracy in the western hemisphere.  </p>  <p>  In another attack on democracy coming from the EU, which is repeatedly and publicly supported by this Government, Greece is denied the autonomy of a breathing space to construct an alternative to destructive austerity.  Any economist worth his salt and not in the pay of the financial sector knows that austerity only serves the short-term interests of the elite and furthers the gap between rich and poor, which serves no one in the long term.  The newly elected Greek Government was given a clear mandate by the public to find an alternative to austerity.  Syriza is trying to place the will of the people before the interests of the elites and the banks and is paying a high price for it.  The rules of engagement in the eurozone are rigid and the masters in Berlin and Brussels allow little space to negotiate a path between the extremes of austerity or euro exit.  The Greeks are looking at a situation where they must choose between denying the democratic mandate and breaking all their promises by submitting to the demands of the unelected yet most powerful institutions in Europe or staying true to the ideals of democracy as best they can in negotiating the turbulent waters of an exit from the eurozone.  What is frightening is the manner in which the Brussels group, the troika and Germany have behaved.  They show little or no mercy and no compromise.  The brutality of the response to Greek demands illustrates that the EU no longer has an interest in democracy.  Whenever there is an election and whoever gets elected and whatever they promise their people, they must subordinate everything to uphold the logic of the markets as dictated by the only true sovereign these days, which resides in Frankfurt, Brussels and Berlin.  God be with the days when Europe was a place where all nations were treated fairly.</p></speech>

The Government is behaving like the teacher's pet, sitting up in the front row sniggering and delighting in the teacher turning on the poor boy at the back of the class and giving him a beating.  It is pathetic.  I thought was unrivalled until I listened to Deputy Martin.  The attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il is even worse.  Not content with the teacher giving the young fellow a beating, they want the young fellow to be blamed for it.</p>  <p>  The attitude is in sharp contrast to the attitude of ordinary Irish people.  Instinctively, they feel solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Greece, which was graphically displayed on the protest on Saturday, where many Irish people who marched against this Government's austerity draped themselves in the Greek flag.  It was an instinctive solidarity and it captured the real idea of what the EU ideal was supposed to be, a Europe of equals and where opportunities were given to those who need the most, the weakest.  We have come a shocking way from that.</p>  <p>  I want to make a couple of points about Libya.  We heard the Council discussed the idea of supposedly stepping up support for Libya, even with the idea of sending in a security mission, which could even possibly involve troops from Ireland.  This would be almost beyond belief when some of those going into clean up the mess were directly responsible for it in the first place, with the active role of the French and British in the bombing and decimation of that country.  We must look at what the liberation has caused.  Libya is a hellhole and the centre of ISIS activity, including a public beheading of 21 Egyptian fishermen and workers one month ago.  The video showing it was released on the fourth anniversary of the so-called Libyan revolution.</p><p> In that context, all of the things the west accused the Gaddafi regime of being responsible for are being repeated by that which has replaced it.  I refer to massacres, the shelling of residential areas, car bombings, mass arrests, torture, the theft of oil and other natural resources, etc.  There are even two governments in place there and these comprise warring factions.  The first of these is led by a stooge of the CIA who supposedly is fighting against an Islamic threat now and who fought with that agency against Gaddafi in the past.  Libya was previously the wealthiest country in Africa.  Its people had a high standard of living, access to free health care and education and there was a good electricity supply.  All of these have been utterly decimated as a result of the conflict.</p> <p> Some 1 million refugees have fled the country and entered Tunisia and a future 400,000 Libyans have been displaced.  I understand the Council discussed the number of illegal immigrants fleeing into Europe.  Some 200,000 people entered Europe illegally last year, as opposed to 60,000 in 2013.  Why do the members of the Council think all of those immigrants are coming here and seeking sanctuary?  It is because of the horror that has been unleashed in their own countries.  President Obama told us that this is the new humanitarian model but what is now in place is absolutely reprehensible.  The idea that the EU is going to go in and save the day and that Ireland might play its part in this regard is a joke.</p> <p> My final point relates to Ukraine.  I really do not want to start talking about this issue because I could be here for the remainder of the evening.  I do not support President Putin in any way but the remarks made by Deputy Martin were unbelievable.  The idea that NATO is blameless is just not acceptable, particularly when one considers that 26 out of the 28 NATO countries are located in Europe and that 12 of these are in eastern Europe.  Deputy Martin indicated that he is upset about an extremist far-right alliance supporting Russia but he had absolutely nothing to say regarding the far-right fascist elements inside the Ukrainian Government.  What we criticise is the lack of balance relating to and inconsistency of these programmes and the fact that those in Europe support one side when they should stay out of other people's business.</p></speech>

I am trying to square the circle in respect of those issues and the fiscal policy being pursued by the European Union.  Rigid adherence to debt-to-GDP ratios in the context of dealing with the debt issue is actually undermining any prospect of delivering a different type of economy that will be less carbon dependent into the future.  There is an urgent need for a European debt conference that will deal with this issue in a more comprehensive way.  I, too, am embarrassed by the way in which the Government is interacting with Greece.  Ireland should show solidarity with a country which is in such difficulties, particularly as we understand the impact those difficulties can have on citizens.  Like Greece, France and Italy have serious levels of debt.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the kind of fiscal expansion that is going to be needed in order to facilitate the development of a different kind of Europe that will deal with the issue of energy.  I refer here to what is going to be required in areas such as transport and retrofitting of buildings.  In Ireland's case, it is going to be necessary to invest in the development of an offshore energy industry.  The raw materials are there in abundance to allow Ireland to deliver but it cannot do so because it does not have the ability to raise the kind of capital necessary to facilitate the kind of fiscal expansion required.  A development such as that to which I refer would change this country radically - not just for now but in the years to come - deliver the jobs and growth that are needed and give us hope for the future.  The NESC report on moving transitioning into a carbon-neutral society identifies offshore wind and wave energy as a source of major opportunity into the future.  At present, we import &euro;7 billion worth of oil and gas each year.  Our dependency rate in respect of fossil fuels stands at 90%, whereas across the European Union the average stands at 55%.  We need to take urgent action in respect of this matter or we will be obliged to pay in hard cash when we cannot meet the international obligations up to which we and the European Union have signed.</p>  <p>  In practical terms, if we were to invest in developing a DART underground service, this would transform the public transport system and deliver on some of our commitments in respect of the area of transport.  If we opted for the underground option, then the number of passenger journeys would rise from 33 million to 100 million.  This could make the single biggest difference to the transport system in this country.  We only ever talk about retrofitting homes.  However, we could reduce our oil and gas imports if we were to take action in this area.</p>  <p>  That to which I refer will not be achieved in the absence of a rational fiscal policy at European level, where debt is treated in a more long-term way and where some of it is either parked or written off in order that we might develop a different kind of Europe.  We must take the shackles off if we are going to do as I suggest and deliver jobs and growth in areas in which they really do need to be delivered.</p></speech>

Regardless of where this all ends, the Greek Government has at least challenged the narrative of austerity that has done such damage, crushed the ordinary people of Greece and given rise to a desperate humanitarian crisis and asked that the possibility of introducing alternative policies that will not require future suffering on the part of ordinary people be considered.  Instead of stating that the Greeks are absolutely right - particularly in light of our own humanitarian difficulties, namely, the unprecedented housing crisis, the unbelievable increase in child poverty levels and a similar increase in the number of suicides related to the economic crash - showing solidarity with them and appealing for relief, latitude and an end to policies which cause human suffering, the Government chose to stab them in the back.  We have aligned ourselves with austerity bullies such as Angela Merkel and Mario Draghi, and the remainder of the financial, corporate and political elite throughout Europe, who are willing to sacrifice the livelihoods and well-being of ordinary people in Greece and, for that matter, in Ireland.  That is absolutely shameful and treacherous and not just in the context of the Greek people but also regarding our own citizens.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly referred to the demonstration which took place at the weekend.  The Minister of State really should have been in attendance because he would have seen people holding aloft the Irish flag in one hand and the Greek flag in the other.  It was fantastic and demonstrated both instinctive internationalism and the sense of international solidarity between people in this country and their counterparts on the other side of Europe.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach, Chancellor Merkel and all the rest of them are playing with fire in terms of what they are doing.  If the people who are opposed to austerity and who stand on the tradition of solidarity between different nationalities against austerity do not prevail, then that will create the space for the far right to grow.  I was interviewed by a German journalist who is based in Saxony in recent days and I must admit that what he told me was terrifying.  Immigrants are now afraid to walk the streets of the major cities in Saxony, such is the level of growth among Pegida and other organisations on the fascist far fight.</p><p>It is scary for immigrants to walk on the streets.  The fascists are able to mobilise up to 60,000 people on the streets in Germany.  We have not seen figures like that since the 1930s.  The growth of the far-right in Greece and other parts of Europe is a direct result of austerity.  In the absence of an alternative being offered by the political establishment, the anger and despair at austerity is beginning to express itself in the most disgusting and frightening ways.  The Minister of State is playing with fire.  He should stand with the people who are fighting austerity rather than stab them in the back.</p></speech>

They voted for EU association agreements in overwhelming numbers.  It is clear that the democratic wish of the Ukrainian people is to be part of the European Union.  The comments from Fianna F&aacute;il Members should be understood in that context.

We have long espoused the view that the opportunity afforded to us in the 1970s should be shared with others.  It is a noble ambition to share our common values of democracy and freedom.  Deputy Martin's comments were in line with the views of the Government.  I am disappointed that some contributors ignored the aggressive role that President Putin and his Government have played.  The people of Ukraine will need to make significant steps in reforming their country's structures, and they are working with the European Union on the accession agenda.  This will be discussed in the context of the eastern partnership talks which will take place in Riga in May.  The scenes we saw in Ukraine, with the European Union flag being flown, represent a noble ambition on the part of the people of that country.  We have an obligation to support that ambition and to stay united.  The majority of opposition parties across the European Union support a united approach to sanctions against Russia.  It is important that we stay united because that approach is bearing fruit.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach referred to the fact that Russia has broken international law.  I agree with him.  Russia often breaks international law.  However, I do not think it has had quite as many opportunities to break international law as the United States.  If one considers the number of countries that have been invaded, bombed or had their sovereignty challenged by the US in the past 50 years, Russia pales by comparison.  We break international law by allowing US military planes to pass through Shannon Airport.  We allow the place to be used as a US military base.  It is a landing pad on the way to war.

It was horrific.  Not happy with bombing the country, the US bullied the UN into introducing sanctions of such severity that Denis Halliday, who was in charge of the UN's humanitarian campaign, resigned on the grounds that his programme was complicit in genocide.  The US invaded Iraq again in 2003, with Irish support.  We were part of the coalition of the willing.  Bertie Ahern told us we were not really participating but we allowed Shannon to be used by the US while it killed another 700,000 civilians in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.  During his term of office, Barack Obama has bombed seven, predominantly Muslim, countries.  This is a man who won the peace prize because he promised to put an end to the nuclear arms race.  He cannot even get Israel to sign up to non-proliferation agreements.  He has now agreed to expand the nuclear arms race again.</p>  <p>  Blair and Bush are guilty of war crimes.  Obama is guilty of war crimes.  Putin is guilty of war crimes.  Assad and Netanyahu are guilty of war crimes.  We take sides.  They are all bad people who have caused unmitigated disasters around the planet.  We should not take any side.  I have no respect for any of these people but we are getting involved, and we are not neutral.  How can the Taoiseach give out about Russia's breaches of international law without bringing a balance to the issue?  He was over in New York kissing Obama's backside and there was not a word about the fact that the man is guilty of war crimes.  Where is the balance?</p>  <p>  It breaks my heart that we cannot stay out of these matters and take a neutral position of working for peace.  The arms race and the militarisation of the planet is causing untold disaster for millions of people.  Old people, women and child suffer the most because they occupy most of the buildings that are destroyed by bombs.  Able bodied men are not usually in the buildings when the bombs drop on them.  Women, children and the elderly are the ones who most commonly die.  It is crazy.  I urge the Minister of State to bring balance to these matters by restoring our neutrality.</p></speech>

It is frustrating, when we are discussing serious issues for elderly people, children and citizens generally in Ukraine and the difficulties arising for everybody in trying to de-escalate the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, to repeatedly hear about every other alleged improper act by other countries.</p><p> In regard to countries on the European Continent that share the ambition to be part of the European Union, it is in Ireland's interest that their borders, their integrity and their democracies are protected and assisted in being protected.  As Deputy Wallace pointed out, we are a neutral country and have always said we do not believe there can be a military solution to the problem in eastern Ukraine.  That said, the EU has significant economic tools at its disposal as a family of nations to ensure that the rule of law and the democratic rights and ambitions of the people of Ukraine are protected.  We will continue to play our part in that.</p> <p> In respect of Shannon, the Deputy will be aware that for almost 50 years the arrangements relating to the use of Shannon Airport have been in place and do not form any part of a military alliance.  The arrangements are governed by strict conditions which are employed to ensure compatibility with our traditional approach of military neutrality, which involves non-participation in military alliances.  As I have said here previously, as a family of 28 member states, and notwithstanding our neutrality, the position regarding Ukraine is different.  The EU must be more engaged with crises and conflicts that take place on our borders, because these impact our partner member states that border with Russia and other accession countries and eastern partners.  Therefore, the Government fully supports the unified approach we have seen to date.</p> <p> That is not to say we feel there is not potential for reform regarding actions in Ukraine, whether structural or economic.  The EU is working with Ukraine and I have attended meetings where reform and supports are encouraged.  Indeed, Ireland and the EU have given significant financial aid to date.  I believe it is unhelpful to try to muddy the waters by suggesting some excuse or rationale whereby there can be some blurring regarding who is the aggressor and who is the victim in this instance.  It is the shared view of the EU that Ukraine and the Ukrainian people are the victims and that as a smaller state, they need and will get the protection of the EU.</p></speech>

How can these possibly develop in the economic environment that now pertains throughout the EU and with the level of debt in so many countries, even larger countries like France which has a debt to GDP ratio of  approximately 93%?  How can we have the kind of fiscal expansion required into areas that will deliver on a carbon neutral economy without investing in retrofitting housing, developing an offshore energy industry and upgrading public transport to a beneficial level?  How can we square that circle?</p>  <p>  I am looking at this from an Irish perspective, but we could make a similar case for most other European countries.  How can we live up to the obligations we have signed up to in terms of being carbon neutral in the future while being so hamstrung by the level of debt?  Does the Minister not believe that a debt conference is critical so that we can examine the issues more completely, rather than to look at the issues from the point of view of debt?  Should we not look at how we can grow in a different way in the future?</p></speech>

In Ireland and across the European Union we have had a protracted period of under investment in renewable energy sources and the targets we set ourselves a number of years ago will not be achieved.  The energy conference in Paris in December will present an opportunity for the world to look again at the direction we are taking in regard to achieving a more sustainable environment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a valid point regarding the complementary nature of the ambition of achieving our energy targets and achieving growth.  I believe the recently announced investment package by Jean-Claude Juncker should be targeted at energy and renewable projects.  At the European Council last Friday, the Taoiseach succeeded in having a clause inserted in the text that proposes that poorly connected and peripheral countries should be given extra consideration in respect of projects.  Therefore, there is potential within the new fund to consider the complementary ambitions of addressing areas where Europe and Ireland have under invested and of helping achieve the type of growth that will come from that spending.  The interconnection project between Ireland and France could benefit in this regard.  I believe the application on this project is at an advanced stage and it could supply energy for up to 500,000 people.</p>  <p>  A number of weeks ago, we had interesting discussion in Ringaskiddy with the French Minister for European Affairs on the potential for the development of marine energy, whether from wind or wave.  This was not just in regard to the Irish coast.  France has an extensive coastline itself and shares our ambition.</p></speech>

He mentioned several times that the European Union had a unified approach on Ukraine and, in particular, the sanctions.  Is that not a little bit of a glossy version of the truth?  Is it not the case that the Czech President, for example, has come out and said that the Union should recognise the Russian takeover of Crimea and that a number of businesses, in Germany in particular, are strongly lobbying that the sanctions be lifted?  The cracks are emerging in that regard.</p>  <p>  Second, will the Minister of State clarify that the types of reform he says are necessary for Ukraine relate to the privatisation of everything, something the Prime Minister has already purported to be in favour of?</p><p>The issue raised about the history of the crisis there is not about muddying the waters, rather it is simply the reality that one cannot solve a problem if one does not know the origins of the problem to begin with.  The roots of what happened in the Ukraine go back to the overthrow of the government there and interference from external forces for their own benefit and not that of the Ukrainian people.  I ask if the Minister of State could also address the point about Libya in terms of what was discussed and whether any security arrangement might involve Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-24a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400038#LL00200"><p>The conclusions on Ukraine were unanimously adopted.  I will briefly address the issue of Libya within the time constraints.  Last week the Heads of State and Government decided that as soon as the agreement to form the government of national unity is reached, the European Union stands ready to contribute by making full use of all its instruments.  It is important, notwithstanding the recent terrible events in Libya, that the European Union should play a very strong role in supporting the Libyan people.  The EU high representative, Federica Mogherini, is working on proposals including possible options under the common security and defence policy.  I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of her deliberations but if in due course there is an agreement at EU level on the need for CSDP activities in support of security arrangements in Libya, Ireland will give careful consideration to any request it may receive from the EU with regard to participation in those activities.  The triple lock will apply on this or any future intervention by our Defence Forces.  The triple lock consists of the UN, the D&aacute;il and the Government.</p>  <p>  In the time available to me I will make my concluding remarks.  On St. Patrick's Day I attended the General Affairs Council which prepared the European Council meeting which took place two days later and included an extensive discussion on the draft conclusions.  On the subject of energy union I emphasised the importance of interconnections with peripheral regions as we discussed earlier.  The Taoiseach also discussed this topic.  It is very important that this acceptance of our peripheral status is included.  The Taoiseach referred to my recent attendance at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on the European semester.  At the General Affairs Council I emphasised the need to make the process more open and inclusive and to ensure stronger engagement at national level.  There is a much longer process for the European semester.  Members may recall last year it was only a number of days.  I was a member of the finance committee last year and there was quite a high level of dissatisfaction at that fact.  Hopefully this year there will be greater engagement.  It is not just a matter for the finance committee and we would encourage other sectoral committees to engage in the European semester process.  The extension of time has been made available for more national debate and we urge as many committees as feel it is appropriate to engage with the process.  </p>  <p>  The European Council also discussed the Eastern partnership in view of the upcoming summit in Riga.  The Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the European Union's commitment to the Eastern partnership which provides a framework for the EU's relationship with six countries of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine.  The leaders committed to strengthening EU relations with each of the six countries Eastern partners on the basis of differentiation and taking into account each country's individual level of ambition for its relations with Europe and also bearing in mind that these are in line with the European Union's interests and values.  This was the point to which I referred earlier in the debate about the importance of engagement with countries involved in the Eastern partnership.</p>  <p>  The European Council also urged member states to complete their ratification on EU association agreements with the three partners, Georgia, Moldova and the Ukraine.  The House approved the terms of these association agreements following a debate last January and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will ensure that formal ratification procedures are completed in advance of the Riga summit.  The EU will continue its discussions with the three other Eastern partners, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus, to further the EU's bilateral and multilateral co-operation, as appropriate, under the Eastern partnership umbrella.</p>  <p>  Leaders agreed that the summit will be a key opportunity to convey the message that the Eastern partnership is not directed against any third country and that the EU is not seeking to create dividing lines in Europe.  The European Council also looked to the future of the Eastern partnership and called for enhanced co-operation in a number of areas including, state building, mobility and people-to-people contacts, market opportunities and interconnections in the transport and energy sectors.</p>  <p>  The conclusions adopted by the European Council clearly illustrate the commitment of the European Union to Libya in this time of crisis.  The EU is considering how best it can respond to this crisis and I refer to the EU high representative, Federica Mogherini.  The most recent round of the UN-brokered political dialogue commenced in Morocco last Friday.  Bernardino Leon, the UN special representative, expressed his view that we are now in a decisive moment and this is clearly the case.  As he pushes for an inclusive agreement on the establishment of a unity government and related security arrangements, Mr. Leon has Ireland's full support and that of the European partners.  The continued fighting and the actions by groups affiliated with ISIS, which we have witnessed in recent days, are very grim warning signs.  If unresolved, the crisis in Libya will lead to a catastrophic impact which will not be limited to Libya's frontiers but rather will be felt across north Africa, the Mediterranean, as well as the rest of Europe.</p>  <p>  I thank Members for their questions.</p></speech>

This amounts to approximately 12 million people in total.  The people are starving with four out of five people said to be living in dire poverty and suffering hunger.</p>  <p>  It is very difficult to know what Ireland can do but one thing we should encourage is the realisation that there will not be a military solution to the crisis.  All the turmoil started out of the bombing of Iraq beginning in 2003 which in turn led to civil war in Iraq between Sunni and Shia and the creation of ISIS.  The recent bombing campaign by the US in Iraq and Syria is unlikely to help the situation.  The flow of arms from western allies and from the Saudis through Turkey into Syria will not help things.  There will not be a military solution.  We must encourage the US to sit down with the Russians and the Iranians to stop the massacre and the violence because it is too horrific for words.  Those parties are the most powerful and they can make a difference.  The work must be towards securing a truce.</p><p>While work towards achieving a truce in Syria is worthwhile, the flow of arms to Israel must stop and Palestine must be recognised as a state in its own right.  Much of the trouble in the Middle East emanates from the problems in Palestine and these problems will continue until justice is achieved for the Palestinians. </p></speech>

We tabled this topical issue on the fourth anniversary of the start of the conflict because after four years of unrelenting struggle, desolation reigns and there is no end in sight for the country's citizens.  It is not that Syrian people support one political faction or another but that they are simply exhausted and war-weary.  Millions are living in refugee camps where their basic needs are not met, while others starve.  More than 200,000 people have been killed, yet nobody remembers the dead because there are no morgues and no functioning state to register their deaths.  The economy has shrunk, poverty is everywhere and ISIS holds sway in large parts of the north and east of the country.  Syria is in an unmitigated humanitarian disaster.</p><p>While it is necessary to look forward, we must also look back.  When President Obama decided to arm the Syrian opposition Deputy Wallace and I argued in this Chamber that his decision would make matters worse rather than better.  I do not feel good making that statement but it is true.  Two years ago, Oxfam issued a statement in which it pointed out that sending arms to the Syrian opposition would not &quot;create a level playing field.&quot;  It continued: <blockquote>Instead, it risks further fuelling an arms free-for-all where the victims are the civilians of Syria.  Our experience from other conflict zones tells us that this crisis will only drag on for far longer if more and more arms are poured into the country.</blockquote>This militarisation of the conflict is the nub of the issue.  Military support by external forces, including bombing raids, must stop to create a space amid the desolation that would allow Syrians to try to grapple with a solution.  As a neutral country, Ireland should be spearheading this call.  </p></speech>

I fully concur with the Deputies' analysis of the extent of the tragedy in Syria and the terrible loss of life that has occurred.  This issue has been raised to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the start of the conflict.  On 15 March 2011, brave young Syrians began to protest against the corruption of the Assad regime, calling for reform and better government.  The leadership of the Syrian regime chose to refuse these demands and acted to suppress the popular protests by murdering and torturing civilians, thereby initiating a fight against its own people.</p>  <p>  The horrific conflict that ensued has led to the deaths of more than 200,000 Syrians and almost 4 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.  Of the 7.5 million people displaced inside Syria, more than half are children who have been traumatised by the violence they have witnessed.  Life expectancy in Syria has fallen by a scarcely believable 24 years since the beginning of the conflict, proof, if it were needed, of the horrific hardship and suffering borne by the Syrian population.</p>  <p>  Ireland stands with its international partners in supporting a political solution which draws on the principles set out in the 2012 Geneva communiqu&eacute;, namely, an end to violence, the formation of an inclusive transitional governing body with executive powers and the initiation of a constitutional process for a democratic Syria which preserves Syria's multiethnic and multi-religious character.</p>  <p>  Ireland's humanitarian assistance for the people of Syria since 2011 has already reached &euro;31 million.  Working with trusted non-governmental organisation partners, United Nations agencies and the Red Cross, our support has met a range of emergency needs, including food, water and sanitation, shelter and other forms of protection.  Humanitarian access within Syria remains hampered by regime restrictions on aid agencies, the disunity of the armed opposition and the intensity of the conflict.  I repeat the Government's call for safe and unhindered humanitarian access.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to provide humanitarian assistance in response to ongoing needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees.  We have already provided &euro;1.8 million to support the work of UN agencies in 2015, most of which targets the needs of children.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, will attend a pledging conference for Syria in Kuwait next week, at which he will set out how Ireland intends to support the Syrian people in 2015 and will pledge further funding.</p>  <p>  I repeat Ireland's condemnation of the multiple war crimes suffered by the Syrian people at the hands of all parties to the conflict.  I also reiterate our call on the Security Council to refer the position in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also working on the implementation of measures to address terrorism and violent extremism, which are a threat to the peoples and countries of the Middle East and Europe.  We are committed to protecting all victims of violent and extremist ideology and determined to respond to these threats, while strengthening the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  With our international partners, Ireland remains fully committed to doing everything in its power to end the terrible suffering of the Syrian people.</p></speech>

The use of arms and bombing by both sides is not helping matters.  When Pol Pot started his campaign he had an army of 5,000 men, yet within four years the actions of President Nixon and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, through the use of B52 bombers, had increased this figure to 200,000.  ISIS is similar to Pol Pot's crowd in that its members are also a bad shower that has grown out of the violence in the region.  We need to stop this violence and advocate for the bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq to stop.  ISIS will not be beaten by bombing them from 30,000 ft.  The bombing campaign does not solve the problem as it causes even greater misery for the citizens who must live under it.  We must call on everyone to stop supplying arms and munitions to Syria.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is dead right; Assad is an animal.  However, when people took to the streets in Bahrain the Saudis, using US munitions and arms, stopped the protests because the Bahraini Government could not handle them.  </p></speech>

The communiqu&eacute; refers to a constitutional process and calls for a democratic Syria, yet it is no longer certain that Syria exists as a country.  It is certainly not multiethnic or multi-religious in character and is falling apart in the most traumatic way.  One year after the communiqu&eacute; was issued, the United States and other countries decided to arm the Syrian opposition, including jihadists.  This decision contributed to the problems being experienced by the country and I expect that, in retrospect, the countries in question regret their decision given the crisis it helped to spawn.  This vindicates our point that one cannot hope for good to come from external military intervention in such conflicts.  Only bad things come from such an approach, of which the mushrooming of ISIS has been a by-product.  Therefore, I strongly support the call that Ireland, as a supposedly neutral country, should be arguing for an end to both the arms that are going in from external sources and the bombs that are being dropped, as well as a facilitation of peace on the ground.</p></speech>
