For now, however, I will concentrate on the measures that relate to the M50 itself.</p>  <p>  As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and operation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly known as the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 and in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  As I explained to the Deputy in my reply to his question of 24 November, TII examined a range of short and long-term measures to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency on the M50, many of which were published in its M50 demand management study in April 2014.  At my request, TII has undertaken further analysis and work to identify a mix of measures that can be taken to improve operational efficiency.  This analysis highlights that, since the completion of the M50 upgrade, annual traffic growth has continued and is accelerating with increased economic growth, with more than 140,000 vehicles per day now using the busiest sections.</p>  <p>  A number of short-term measures are being progressed.  These include changes to junction layouts at key locations following recent upgrades at the N3-M50 and Dublin Airport-M1.  The aim of the revised layout is to optimise use of lanes to increase throughput.  TII and local authorities are erecting new permanent signage to direct traffic where diversions from the M50 are required.  The motorway traffic control centre, which oversees incident response, has been enhanced and the number of incident response vehicles on the M50 has been increased.</p>  <p>  I will outline the medium-term measures in response to the following question.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600004#B00100"><p>I think the Minister will agree that demand management is an important aspect of ensuring we get the best out of the investment that has already been made.  Has any consideration been given to a reduced toll or perhaps a period in which no toll would apply, particularly on the West Link section of the M50, to encourage people to travel earlier and later.  While I accept the tolling component is an important part of funding works already completed, it is clear that this piece of infrastructure is now unable to meet demand at certain peak times, so the Minister needs to think more radically.  Heretofore, the view would have been that an orbital outer route needed to be built.  That is not the answer.  We have to sweat the asset that is there, with better demand management.  </p>  <p>  The Minister rightly identified that the big issue is for Transport Infrastructure Ireland to deal with it but he has overall responsibility for policy.  It plays into public transport as well.  The decision not to proceed with DART underground as quickly as would have been appropriate to deal with some of the demand for vehicular transport could have been resolved by a greater investment in our public transport network.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600004#B00200"><p>On demand management, I have now requested that Transport Infrastructure Ireland initiate work on variable speed limits on the M50.  This is a traffic management system that is now in place in many other road networks of a comparable size elsewhere, where the speed limit would be reviewed in response to the amount of traffic that is on the road.  This would also help with our efforts in respect of lane utilisation.  At the moment, nearly one third of traffic travels on the outside lane at peak times as opposed to one fifth at non-peak times.  We need to smooth that out to make best use of all lanes that are there.</p>  <p>  In respect of public transport, the Deputy is correct that I made the decision not to go ahead with the current design of DART underground because of the &euro;4 billion cost involved.  In the nearer term, we are going to be increasing the bus fleet for Dublin Bus by more than 100 next year, we are opening up the Phoenix Park tunnel next summer, we are redesigning the Dublin control centre to expand capacity in Connolly Station and we will have the Luas cross city project open for the summer of the following year.</p></speech>

He mentioned the &euro;4 billion investment.  An outer orbital route would obviously cost significantly more and we have to continue to invest in transport infrastructure.  I take his point on the investment in buses.  That has to be done anyway.  There is a relatively small increase in overall bus numbers.  What we are lacking is an appropriate basic infrastructure for public transport in this city.  If the city is to continue to grow in line with expectations, we are heading into a period of exceptional gridlock at peak times, which will retard the growth not just of the city but of the rest of the country.</p></speech>

In the past 18 months, during my time as Minister, Dublin Bus alone has received an additional &euro;93 million to fund new buses.  As I have said, for next year, that will directly equate to an additional 100 buses for its fleet to deliver better frequency on the services we have.  Alongside that, we have put further measures in place.  For example, we are looking forward to the operation of a new Luas line out to Cabra and Phibsborough by 2017.  In the run-up to that, I have now made more funding available to Luas to procure longer carriages.  We are putting in place many different measures to increase public transport capacity.  This is all happening because the faster rate of job creation is increasing Government's ability to invest in these new measures.  I appreciate the difficulty faced by people who are commuting around the M50 each day and that is why we are putting in place a series of short-term and medium-term measures on the road itself to increase its efficiency, alongside investing in additional public transport capacity.</p></speech>

The idea of an outer ring road has been on the table for many years and I want to hear the Minister's views on this.  He was a member of Dublin City Council, where we had many presentations over the years.  Are there any measures on the outskirts and the commuter belt that can help?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600004#B00800"><p>As I indicated in my answer to Deputy Dooley's question, I am very conscious of the pressures on the M50 but I do not see the provision of major new road infrastructure as a solution at this time, nor is it feasible to do this in the context of our new capital plan.  The upgrade of the M50 was completed as recently as 2010 at a cost of &euro;1 billion and the extra capacity is under pressure already.  In the short term to medium term, the objective has to be to optimise the operation of the M50 as currently designed and enhance other options, such as public transport. </p>  <p>  In respect of public transport, alternatives include the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel for some services on the Kildare commuter rail line from next summer.  The new Luas cross city line, which will be in operation in late 2017, providing the capacity for an additional 10 million journeys on the Luas network each year, will also be of significant help in this regard.  The new capital plan also envisages significant ongoing investment in the replacement and enlargement of the PSO bus fleet.  Next year alone, we are providing an additional 100 buses.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority's draft transport strategy envisages the development of a core orbital bus network to ensure that more trips within the area can be undertaken by public transport in a convenient and efficient manner.  These services would be operated at a matching frequency to the core radial services to ensure that they offer an attractive alternative to private transport.  Six orbital routes were proposed under the draft strategy, namely, D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Dundrum, Dundrum to Tallaght, Dundrum to Finglas, Ranelagh to Drumcondra, Tallaght to Blanchardstown and Blanchardstown to Kilbarrack.  Following the conclusion of the public consultation process, the NTA is now in the process of finalising the strategy.  Implementation of proposals in the strategy will be subject to approval of business cases and availability of funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600004#B00900"><p>I acknowledge that it is only five years since the major upgrade, when the road was widened and various junctions were tackled.  This cost more than &euro;1 billion.  However, it is quite clear that some of the measures being proposed will not be sufficient in the long term.  The Minister is talking about lowering speed limits and the possibility of tolling at various off-shoots of the M50.  That would probably add to the problem but I would like to hear whether he has ruled out multi-point tolling altogether.  A great deal of revenue is generated by the M50.  The Minister has said &euro;110 million is taken by the toll and &euro;50 million goes to pay the original owners.  I am assuming all that money is ringfenced or put back into the system to deal with the congestion issues, which seem to be multiplying.  I use the M50 and it seems to be getting worse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600004#B01000"><p>In respect of the implementation of multi-point tolling and what that would mean, I have made very clear that such a proposal should only be implemented if we have very substantially increased public transport capacity to provide an alternative to the M50.  The congestion study done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland in April 2014 indicated there was potential to reduce the volume of traffic on the M50 by up to one fifth.</p><p>However, of the 20% reduction in traffic, half of it would be displaced onto other roads.  That would mean that between 35,000 and 40,000 journeys would be moved onto local and regional roads.  That is not a viable solution to tackling congestion as it would merely move such congestion onto roads less able to handle it.  I would appreciate it if the Deputy were to take the opportunity to clarify Sinn F&eacute;in's policy in this area.  Does it support the construction and building of a new outer ring road?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600005#C00300"><p>No, I was not suggesting I supported it.  I was asking whether there was merit in considering it or giving consideration to improving the outer ring roads in a way that would alleviate the pressure.  Everything appears to converge on the M50, with traffic travelling north, south and east, which is hard to understand.  However, I agree with the Minister on one point, which is that public transport must be considered to alleviate the congestion.  He mentioned the orbital bus routes, which are for the future and will be important.  In addition, the metro north project should take a great deal of pressure off in respect of the number of cars it will take off the roads.  It is estimated that a couple of hundred thousand cars could be taken off the roads.  I seek the Minister's opinion on this, as although metro north is for the future, it is a major project that could have an immense impact.  The congestion problem is building on the M50 and will not stop.  I do not believe it will be sufficient to put up signage or to lower speeds limits, given the problems that appear to be building at peak hours, in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600005#C00400"><p>The additional measures I have confirmed will make a difference.  However, what will make an additional difference is how the layout and availability of public transport routes alongside the M50 are changed.  That is why the work under way to deliver bus routes that will run along the perimeter of the M50 and then to points at which a significant number of people want to work and providing them as soon as possible at an affordable price in a manner that they will carry a large quantity of passengers is key in giving people an alternative to using their cars.  It is important that the Deputy has confirmed his view on the orbital ring road.  The construction of new projects such as this within Dublin raises huge questions about how they would be funded, not to mention how Ireland would be able to meet its obligations from a climate change perspective in the context of the recent meeting in Paris.  However, I conclude by noting many of the measures I have announced to ensure better support for the Garda and to change road layout at three further junctions on the M50 will take place next year, as will the provision of an additional 100 buses for Dublin Bus.</p></speech>

This is against the backdrop of the fact that last year permits were given permits by the Minister to take weapons and explosives through Shannon Airport on a total of 272 flights, the majority of which were used to take US troops between military bases and locations in the Middle East where, as Members are aware, a slaughter of innocent people is under way.  What is the Minister doing to review the procedure?</p></reply>

I am in contact with the Departments in respect of the policy and administration matters related to the 1973 order.  The primary purpose of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended, is ensuring the safety of aircraft and those on board.  The Deputy's concerns relate primarily to foreign policy considerations; these are not my responsibility.</p>  <p>  The rights for civil aircraft to overfly and land for refuelling purposes are known as the first two freedoms of the air.  Such rights are vital for the operations of airlines around the world, including Irish airlines, and it is only on rare occasions that a state would deny such rights.  Civil aircraft being used to transport military personnel and goods have been landing in and overflying Ireland for many decades.  The vast majority of the airlines operating these flights are from the United States and other NATO countries.  However, exemptions also have been granted to airlines from Russia and Switzerland during the years.  These flights are operated in compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's safety rules.  This period covers many international crises and military confrontations.  Ireland has not sought to withdraw or suspend such permissions at any stage during this time.</p>  <p>  I should also point out that successive Governments have considered the granting of such permissions to be compatible with Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.</p></speech>

I take it from his reply that he is stating he intends to do nothing to change the position.  More than 550 permits were granted to airlines carrying troops, weapons and explosives to their forward operating bases, all from NATO countries, by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Moreover, they are<i>en route</i>to areas engaged in war.  Under the legislation the Minister cited, he is authorised to search such aircraft.  It is part of his powers he has chosen not to invoke.  When the Administration came to power, its programme for Government stated, &quot;We will enforce the prohibition on the use of Irish airspace, airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&quot;.  I am aware, on foot of freedom of information requests, that munitions and explosives that could have been the components of cluster bombs went from the United States to Saudi Arabia.  I am aware that the United States is facilitating illegal breaches of international law in Yemen in the massacre of civilians which is occurring there.  Therefore, the Minister will be in breach of the programme for Government and international law unless he carries out the searches he is lawfully permitted to do before granting permits.  I really do not know why he is not doing it.  He might enlighten Members.</p></speech>

As I informed the Deputy in my opening response to her question, my responsibilities in this regard are clear.  They relate to safety.  I consult the relevant Departments at all times on any decision I make.  I have done so and the Government continues to do so.  All of the decisions the Government makes are clearly framed and undertaken within the powers available to me under the 1973 order.  I have made available to the Deputy all of the information on of applications with which I have dealt, the origin of such flights and the reasons for decisions I have made.</p></speech>

How is neutrality advanced by him authorising the transit of 190 tonnes of explosives and ammunition to Afghanistan, where, as Members are aware, the Taliban is in control?  I would think it not advanced in terms of the safety of people in that region or in Yemen.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with an issue regarding the permits he grants.  This time last year, the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport appeared before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and stated permissions were only granted based on strict criteria, that the munitions were not visible or on board, that everything was placed in the hold.  In my court case earlier this year direct evidence was given that was not contradicted but was accepted by the judge without qualification to the effect that such armoury was carried on board aircraft in clear breach of the direction of the Secretary General of the Department.  How does this advance safety, with which the Minister is concerned, never mind neutrality?  I do not see how Ireland can claim neutrality, given that it is facilitating this movement by NATO countries and the United States, in particular.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with the breach of the permits granted.</p></speech>

I have explained clearly that I have responsibilities in this area in respect of aircraft, that is, to their safety, as well as safety within Ireland's airspace.  All decisions I make in that regard are focused on these objectives and taken in consultation with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the safety of the aircraft and the materials being transported on board.  As I have indicated previously, flights transporting dangerous goods that are granted exemptions are generally carrying munitions such as cartridges, ammunition and some categories of explosive devices and fuses.  These must also be packaged securely and on passenger aircraft, they must be stored in the hold to ensure they are inaccessible during the flight.</p></speech>

The core grant programme for national governing bodies, the high performance programme and the carding scheme for elite athletes are all gender neutral, applying to both men and women.  The women in sport programme, which is an additional investment targeted at female participation in sport, was launched in 2005 to address the clear gender gap in sports participation.  Since then, more than &euro;16 million has been invested in the programme.  This year, Sport Ireland is investing &euro;970,000 in women in sport.</p>  <p>  Figures from the Irish sports monitor reports show that this investment is delivering results and the programme has proved to be a success.  The 2013 report shows that participation among females has increased from 39% in 2011 to almost 43% in 2013.  This is equal to more than 750,000 women and girls participating in sport every week, the highest recorded participation rate for women since the Irish sports monitor was introduced in 2007.  The result has been a significant narrowing of the gender gap in participation. </p>  <p>  While these figures are very encouraging, I recognise that there are particular challenges around young girls staying involved in sport.  Sport Ireland, the national governing bodies and the local sports partnerships continue to develop and operate targeted programmes aimed at increasing participation by young girls.</p>  <p>  One of my key goals for sport is to encourage more women and girls to become involved in sport and physical activity.  I am hopeful that, through these targeted programmes, we will see a further narrowing of the gender gap in sport and more participation by young girls.  In this regard, the Minister and I met representatives of the Women's Gaelic Players Association yesterday to discuss issues relating to their sport.</p></speech>

Women show much lower activity levels and participation rates in sport than young men, with only 39% of the 16 to 25 female age cohort playing a sport compared to 63% of males in the same age group.  We learned recently that significantly fewer women than men receive sports scholarships in third level institutions.  This should serve as a reminder of the gap that exists between the sexes.  Barely one in five sports scholars is a women.  As such, significant work remains to be done.  While I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment, the issue is not always one of Government funding.  A strategic approach is required to ensure funding is spent correctly and in a way that encourages initial and continued participation in sport by women and girls.  The only way to achieve this is through leadership programmes and scholarships that help to increase participation.</p></speech>

The Department is working on a physical activity plan and I hope the targets its sets will be reached.  Successful sportswomen, of whom there are many in this country, do not receive the same recognition as men.  The time has come to promote women in sport more.  In particular, the national governing bodies and sports organisations must recognise the achievements of women and offer them the same opportunities as men.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Irish Sports Council provided additional funding for women in sport, including &euro;142,500 to the Football Association of Ireland specifically to develop the women's game; &euro;112,500 to the Irish Rugby Football Union to support the women's game; &euro;384,655 to the Ladies Gaelic Football Association; &euro;378,510 to the Camogie Association; and &euro;166,930 to the Ladies Golf Union of Ireland.  The purpose of this funding was to increase women's involvement in sport.  The Deputy is correct, however, that more needs to be done and I have focused on local sports partnerships for this reason.  In many counties, these partnerships encourage women to participate in marathons.  Through the sports capital fund, we are trying to fund football, soccer and rugby pitches and provide tracks to give women who are dropping their children to school an opportunity to participate in sport.</p></speech>

The Department must introduce a strategy that has been thought out.  While I do not underestimate the Minister of State's commitment in this regard, particularly with regard to funding various groups, these efforts will only keep things ticking along.  This approach must be overlaid with a new and appropriately funded strategy that encourages greater participation in sport across the disciplines.  I hope the Minister of State will give some consideration to that proposal in the new year.</p></speech>

This issue is not solely the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Departments of Education and Skills and Health also have a major part to play in this area.  As part of the physical activity plan being developed by the Department, we have raised many of these issues with the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  The trouble with government sometimes is that every Department wants to have responsibility for sport but not all of them want to do anything about it.  The Department is working with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills for the first time in many years to produce a plan.</p>  <p>  I am pleased the Deputy has raised this issue because I agree with him that gender balance is necessary and women must be treated fairly in sport.  We must encourage women to participate in sport in whatever we can because too many girls stop engaging in sport, especially between the ages of 13 and 15 years.  My Department and the Departments of Health and Education and Skills must target this issue.  We are hoping to identify ways and means of dealing with the problem through the new plan.  Women must be treated equally in sport.</p></speech>

With regard to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, a range of energy efficiency measures, including eco-driving, bus and network priority programmes and fleet replacement, have delivered significant fuel savings.  Irish Rail has also introduced a range of measures, including train configuration changes and traction control software on the DART network. </p>  <p>  On the specific issue of fleet replacement, Dublin Bus will receive 110 new buses in 2016, of which 80 will be replacement buses and 30 for market growth.</p><p>In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann will get 72 new buses comprising 11 from its 2015 order and 60 additional buses for replacement and market growth.<br/><br/>Investment in fleet replacement is underpinned by significant investment in the public transport element of the Government's new capital plan, which will reach &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2016 to 2021.  In 2015, I secured an additional allocation of &euro;60 million for capital investment in public transport infrastructure to bring the total capital investment in 2015 to &euro;340 million.  A similar amount has been secured for next year and annual allocations will more than double to &euro;845 million in the final years of the plan.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>This funding will be used for asset renewal of the public transport system including the upgrading of bus corridors and the completion of the Luas cross-city project in Dublin.  Funds are also being committed in respect of a range of measures which will help to alleviate traffic congestion and promote a shift to public transport away from private cars in the short term, including the building of additional cycle lanes, the continuation of smart technology upgrades, improvements to the DART service and the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel in 2016.  Investment will also be focused on addressing growing congestion resulting from economic recovery and population growth.  Such funding will also enable other major transport projects to proceed, such as the new metro north and the DART expansion programme.<br/><br/>In addition to this investment in public transport infrastructure, my Department is currently developing a new national policy framework to support the uptake of alternative fuels through the development of infrastructure and incentives aimed at increasing the number of alternative-fuelled vehicles, including buses, being used in Ireland.  Within this context and as reflected in the White Paper on energy policy which is being launched around now, it is proposed to establish a green bus fund to support the purchase of cleaner and greener public transport vehicles in the period to 2020.<br/><br/>In the context of our mitigation objectives, the responsibility for emissions reduction is a collective one and, when all sectoral inputs have been co-ordinated, the draft mitigation plan will be available for extensive public consultation before being submitted for approval to Government.</p></speech>

There may have been more investment in Dublin Bus but fares are increasing and that is making the public transport network less attractive for users.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has changed its schedule, cutting out key routes at key times in areas such as north County Dublin which, again, forces people out of the trains and back into their cars.  Congestion is back to the boom time levels of 2008.  According to the EPA, we will not only fail to meet our targets but will massively overshoot them.  What we have had is a huge number of plans but very little substance.  Transport emissions are projected to increase by 20% over the period 2020 to 2035.  The only two things in the Government's plan to deal with this are electric cars and the move to biomass and biofuel.  Let us look at electric cars briefly.  The Minister has told us that he will get 50,000 of these on the road by 2020.  It is his key plank.  There are 1,000 on the road now on the eve of 2016.  As such, he tells us that there will be a fiftyfold increase magically overnight.  This is not a minor part of his plan, it is actually promoted as the key part along with biofuel.  He is nowhere near delivering on either of them.</p></speech>

She is flatly refusing to accept the reality that investment in public transport is increasing.  She talks about plans and their delivery.  Let us look at delivery for next year and the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, which will have the capacity to facilitate the carrying of an additional 1 million passengers.  Let us look at that to which I have just referred.  An additional &euro;90 million has already been made available to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide new buses.  That is happening.  The reason the Deputy is so unwilling to acknowledge any of this additional investment is because it comes from a recovery she said would never happen.</p></speech>

We are investing more in longer Luas carriages, new Luas services, including the opening up of Luas cross-city route, new improved train and DART frequencies and greater numbers of buses.  In respect of private transport and the need to make private cars more efficient, we are putting in place, and have out to public consultation currently, a new policy on alternative fuels, biomass and compressed natural gas to make more of such fuel sources available for use in private vehicles.</p></speech>

Those in the middle and the bottom have seen their incomes falling.  On the issue of public transport, in which radical investment is needed, metro north was on track when the Government came to power and then it shelved it.  While it has now put the project back into development, we have not seen anything on the ground.  I see that the Minister chose to ignore the points I made about electric cars, which comprise a key plank of his policy to lower our emissions.  It is not me giving out and saying that it is not good enough.  The Government's own agency, the EPA, is pointing out that there will be an overall growth in emissions because of our lack of investment in public transport.  The Government announced to great fanfare the discovery of billions of extra euro in the Exchequer coffers.  When will we see evidence of that to which I refer being front-loaded in terms of delivery.  Given that he places such emphasis on them, the Minister might talk about electric cars.  How is he going to get the numbers from 1,000 to 50,000?  When the Government came to office, the target was 230,000.  As such, we are going forwards and going backwards.</p></speech>

We want to keep the recovery going and we want more people to participate in it.  Perhaps the Deputy will be able to stand up later and acknowledge that an additional 130,000 jobs have been created.  Everything is aimed at ensuring that more people can participate in the recovery.</p>  <p>  In the context of actual delivery, I am not sure the Deputy wanted to listen to what I said a moment ago.  I have already outlined what we are doing in respect of buses alone.  Let me deal with electric cars.  It is a pity that in her analysis of the issue, the Deputy failed to acknowledge that there are more than 1,000 electric recharging points available across our country and that 97% to 98% of all towns and cities that need the points now have them in place.  The infrastructure is in place to enable their growth, which the Deputy completely missed in the points she put to me.  In fairness, one of the few points she made that I agreed with relates to the need to look at the use of electric cars and to increase their numbers.  That is why the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, and I have put in place a new interdepartmental group to consider measures to incentivise the use of these vehicles and to take advantage of the very infrastructure the Deputy did not want to acknowledge in her contribution.</p></speech>

The Minister has correctly identified some of the investment that he has made.  However, there is a rising concern about the affordability of public transport as a result of the significant increases in fares.  I ask him to address that and to provide any views he has on it.</p></reply>

On 30 October 2015, the NTA published its fares determination for 2016.  In setting fares, the NTA takes a number of factors into consideration including, of course, the financial contribution that fare revenue makes toward the overall funding of good-quality public transport services.  However, there are other important factors which it also considers, including the role the fare structure can play in ensuring greater use of public transport.  This year's fare determination builds on the work of recent years in simplifying what has historically been a quite complicated fare structure system.  In addition, the recent determination continues the initiative to encourage people to switch to using the Leap card.  The recent announcement means that the public now knows that the Leap card will always be 20% cheaper than cash for a single journey.</p>  <p>  Along with its work on simplifying fare structures and encouraging the switch to Leap card, the NTA has also delivered a number of significant cross-operator initiatives such as real-time information at bus stops, via apps and online, the national journey planner, investment in the bus fleet and on-board wi-fi, improved public transport maps and the reconfiguration of regional city bus services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600007#E01500"><p>There is no doubt about the need to make public transport more attractive by creating better, more accountable and, importantly, more affordable transport systems.  Extensive fare hikes have taken place across bus, rail and Luas services.  If one looks at it cumulatively over the last four years, one cannot but conclude that providers have been predatory and made a significant dent in people's pockets while at the same time reducing the attractiveness of public transport.  Adult cash fares on Dublin Bus services have increased by 36% since 2012.  The increase at Bus &Eacute;ireann averaged approximately 18% while Luas fare increases totalled approximately 11%.  Increases on most monthly and annual rail tickets were on average approximately 22% on short hop commuter trips.  All of that has amounted in my view to a targeted attack on commuters using the public transport system.</p><p> Despite the huge fare hikes over recent years, the NTA has approved fare increases of up to 5% across Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Luas and Irish Rail from the beginning of next year.  Like others, I welcome the increased economic activity.  However, the growth that is taking place is in no way keeping pace with the increases with the cost of public transport.  While I accept the difference between the statutory roles of the Minister and the NTA in this regard, there is a need to call a halt here.  If fares continue to increase, that will have an impact on people's use of public transport services, which in turn will only add to further gridlock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600008#F00200"><p>I have outlined to the Deputy what my role is in how these decisions are made and how the fare structure is set.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I expect that as our economy recovers, more public investment in public transport is made and the balance sheets of public transport companies begin to improve in line with increases in their passenger numbers, the frequency and magnitude of the price increases we have experienced in the past will begin to change.  The Deputy has referred to the most recent fare determination figures.  I would like to contrast those figures with where we came from in the depth of our difficulties in 2013.  In 2013, Dublin Bus had a price increase of 5.7%, whereas its most recent price increase was 1.2%.  In 2013, Bus &Eacute;ireann had a price increase of 6.1%, whereas its most recent price increase was 1.1%.  In 2013, Irish Rail had a price increase of 7%, whereas its most recent price increase was 1%.  This shows that the magnitude of price increases is beginning to decline significantly.  In all cases, the Leap card will be cheaper than cash.  In many cases, a single Leap card fare will be exactly the same in 2016 as the cash fare was in 2013.  This is all about driving more integration and better utilisation of public transport.</p></speech>

What I am saying in a roundabout way is that there is a need for the Minister to fight at the Cabinet table for a greater level of subvention.  We all have faith in his capacity to ensure the burden of the cost of a publicly funded public transport system does not weigh too heavily on the shoulders of those who use it.  If people move away from public transport because it has become an intolerable burden, a negative spiral will be created.  Although investment in the upgrading of infrastructure is important and good, if fares continue to increase as they have been increasing, it will have a very negative effect.  I hope that over time, the Minister will be able to secure a greater level of funding through the State subvention.</p></speech>

I remind the Deputy that the most recent fare determinations differ considerably from the fare determinations that were made earlier in the crisis with which this country had to deal and from which we are now looking to emerge.  In response to the Deputy's question about investment in public transport with particular reference to the level of subvention, I will set out where we are now.  When the budget that will come into effect next month was announced, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I were able to provide for an increase of &euro;28.5 million in the current funding available to the CIE group.  That single increase restores almost 30% of all the funding lost by the group over the last seven years.</p></speech>

It has taken the Government a full year to legislate for this issue, which is of great importance to the Border region, in particular.  I understand most of that time was spent renegotiating our mutual recognition agreement with the UK.  A number of further months have passed since that was concluded.  I accept that the other key part of this legislation, which relates to drug-driving, is very important.  The Government has stuck mutual recognition in with that.  Organisations like the PARC road safety group are asking why the mutual recognition aspect of the proposed Bill has not been advanced more quickly on its own.  They believe that should have been done because this is such an important issue.  Has the Road Safety Authority been informed of Northern disqualifications?  If so, how many such disqualifications has it been informed of in the current year?  Have we informed the Northern Ireland authorities in reverse?</p></reply>

In the past, it was possible for a driver who committed a serious road traffic offence in one jurisdiction and was detected and prosecuted, resulting in a driving disqualification, to return home and continue to drive without any recourse being available to apply that disqualification in his or her home country.  Arrangements for the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK, based on the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications and primary legislation in both jurisdictions, were in place from January 2010 to November 2014, with an average of 140 disqualifications being transferred between the two jurisdictions each year.  Those arrangements changed for the reasons outlined by the Deputy.  When they were in place, a driving disqualification received in the other jurisdiction was recognised in the driver&rsquo;s home country or country of normal residence.  A new agreement between Ireland and the UK on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications was signed on 30 October 2015.  I am taking the first opportunity available to me - the road traffic Bill that was agreed by the Cabinet yesterday - to make provision for that in legislation.  The drafting of the Bill has been completed and the Government approved it yesterday.  My aim is to publish the Bill soon.  I hope to have it published before the end of the year.  While it will not be passed by the Oireachtas early in the new year, I assure Deputy Broughan that I aim to have it introduced in the Oireachtas in January so that its passage through these Houses may begin.  I believe a number of measures in the Bill will make a prompt contribution to better road safety for 2016.</p></speech>

I accept that the other issue is very important as well.  Ten years ago, I proposed in this House that we should adopt the drug-driving regime that was being used in the state of Victoria in Australia.  It has taken a decade for legislation to be introduced to address this issue.  Surely the Minister could have fast-tracked the mutual recognition aspect of this legislation to get it passed before this House is dissolved in the new year.  A number of us will not be in this House after the general election.  The Minister and I might not be Members of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  The legislation to which I refer is of great importance in Border areas.  How will this process actually work?  When the Road Safety Authority gets the information from Northern Ireland, will it go to the District Court to seek to have someone who has been the subject of a disqualification in Northern Ireland disqualified here?  I think that was the older mechanism that was used.  Will it be used again under this process?  I have raised some of these matters on Topical Issues on two occasions.  The Minister was not able to attend those debates because he was on European business.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, deputised for him.  I asked two critical questions about disqualifications, but I did not receive any satisfactory answers.  I would like to put those questions again briefly.  First, we often hear from solicitors etc., that there is no actual requirement in law for the Courts Service to record the licence of a disqualified driver.  Is that the case?  If so, do we need legislation?  Second, the Minister has told me we do not need legislation on the question of breathalyser results in English and Irish.  Prosecutions are not proceeding as a result of the chaotic situation that exists in this regard.  Can the Minister tell us what will be done about that, particularly in light of Judge Marie Keane's recent judgment?  She threw out 21 cases over summonses that were wrongly worded, in her view.</p></speech>

It is a matter that is treated differently from other matters we debate.  As of earlier this week, 34 fewer people were killed on our roads compared to this time last year.  That is a very significant change to which all the Deputies have contributed.</p> <p> The Deputy asked me a number of significant questions.  He asked why could I not do this sooner.  The reason is that the agreement between both jurisdictions was signed on 30 October and the first opportunity I have had to bring it in is in the road traffic Bill, which I have just brought to Cabinet.  On the issue of where we are in terms of the serving of statements regarding the electronic breathalyser test devices in Irish, when I dealt with the matter in the past, it was subject to a court hearing.  I was advised that we would win that matter but, as the Deputy knows, we did not.  We were ruled against.  The next day I signed the statutory instrument to deal with that matter.  A number of cases are before the courts and I will not comment on them because it is up to the judges to evaluate and make decisions on them.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor is considering what action could be taken on them and I await its response.  I will not comment on any cases the courts are currently evaluating.  I always do my best to take Topical Issue matters when I am here.  I was not here, as the Deputy acknowledged, for the debate on that issue.  I will find out what questions the Deputy raised and I will write to him within the next seven days with an answer on them.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle ruled out two questions I tried to ask about Judge Marie Keane's judgment on 12 November 2015, when she dismissed 21 cases on the basis of failure to present licences because, as she said, the summonses were worded incorrectly.  They did not include a reference to the penalties people would incur if they did not bring their licences or have them ready for presentation.  I asked whether that has been appealed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It seems there are many matters in regard to the broader issue under mutual recognition that need to be addressed and in respect of which we need to bring forward legislation.</p></speech>

In regard to our northern counterparts in Stormont and transport companies in the North, what work has the Minister done to introduce a ticketing system to cover the North and the South and to improve access to cross-Border public transport services.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600009#G02100"><p>I understand from the National Transport Authority, NTA, that it has held discussions with the Department of Regional Development and Translink in Northern Ireland in order to explore the possibilities for integrated cross-Border ticketing.  The current ticketing systems are incompatible and the NTA understands that Translink is in the process of putting together a tender for new ticketing equipment for the North.</p>  <p>  Concurrently, the NTA is looking into the possibilities of the next evolution of smart ticketing across Ireland and is having discussions with Translink with a view to exploring the opportunities for collaboration.  These discussions are at an early stage and at this point in time, there are no defined plans for integration.  However, both NTA and Translink recognise the potential of linking up the systems and are keen to explore further. </p>  <p>  An example of the tangible benefit cross-Border co-operation can deliver to everybody on our island is the fact that approximately &euro;21 million has been awarded to two separate cross-Border railway projects, the Drogheda viaduct and Enterprise refurbishment project, which will significantly enhance the transport infrastructure of the region on a cross-Border basis.  This has been financed through the European Union's INTERREG IVA programme and managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  I launched the Drogheda viaduct on 7 December and the Enterprise refurbishment project will be complete by the end of this year.  Both projects will enhance one of our main cross-Border infrastructure links, thereby supporting trade and tourism between the two biggest cities on the island.</p></speech>

It is a pity we have not pushed this much further because many areas could benefit from rail and bus link ups and they could be made very efficient.  On many occasions, we have said there should be free travel for senior citizens North and South.  That issue needs to be addressed.  Other areas with respect to cross-Border links include the ferry services and the canals.  If a better approach was taken by officials and the transport authorities on both sides of the Border, it would greatly assist in improving our tourist figures and provide a better way for ordinary citizens to travel between the North and the South.  This is an important issue and one on which we need to place more emphasis.</p></speech>

We need only consider what we are doing in the tourism area where both jurisdictions are working together successfully to deliver more than either could deliver on its own.  In regard to fares and ticketing integration, discussions are under way but because the Northern Ireland Executive and its transport bodies are perhaps considering introducing a new ticketing system, we will have to let that work take place and allow them to make their decisions on how they want to do that.  When that happens, I would hope there would be further opportunities for integration but that is a matter for them to work on.  </p>  <p>  With regard to cross-Border co-operation, I would respectfully say that one would not find many better examples of that than the &euro;21 million European Union funding that both Administrations worked together to secure, the benefits of which can be seen in the co-funding of the new viaduct and the new rolling carriage that is available on the Belfast to Dublin rail line.</p></speech>

This issue could be progressed.  I acknowledge that his Northern counterparts are looking at a new ticketing service.  Have detailed discussions been held with them regarding the systems used here such as Smarter Travel, Leap card, apps and real time information provision and what they are doing in this regard to try to move us towards an integrated system across the island?  That is important and it would have huge benefits.</p></speech>

A great deal of work needs to be done.</p></speech>

I did not say the Department had done nothing but it has not done enough in the context of climate change and the fact that transport is the second largest non-emissions trading sector.  This has a key impact on our emissions targets, particularly now, given we were not on target to meet the 2o target.  The Paris agreement has changed that to 1.5o by 2050.  What change in public transport plans will the Minister put in place to take account of the new agreement reached in Paris last week?</p></reply>

I am also acknowledging what needs to be done.  As opposed to going through the material I shared with the Deputy earlier, I will outline new information in this regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to our bus fleet, I propose to establish a green bus fund for the period 2017-20 to support the purchase of cleaner and greener public transport vehicles.  The main purpose of the fund will be to cover the differential between the cost of a conventional diesel bus and an alternatively fuelled equivalent.  It is hoped and planned for that the fund will help to accelerate the introduction of alternatively fuelled vehicles across the public transport sector.  These measures will focus on supporting the change in the current fleet stock of hybrid vehicles as double deck or single deck vehicles to make them potentially fully electric for both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This has the aim of delivering reduced vehicle emissions, improved air quality and health benefits, lower fuel costs, reduced operating costs and increased security of supply.  These vehicles would also have the potential to utilise a renewable fuel source, namely biomethane, all of which has the objective of trying to improve the efficiency and quality of our public bus fleet in the context of the agenda the Deputy has outlined, which I accept will pose challenges for Ireland that we will need to respond to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600010#H00600"><p>It is clear the Government has not taken on board the scale of the crisis.  To achieve the target set in Paris, there would have to be a near complete decarbonisation of the world economy with a wholesale shift away from fossil fuels to renewable sources.  I welcome the fact that there will be more green buses.  That will be great and I compliment the Minister on that but the problem is that public transport fares have increased by 60% and, therefore, it has become less attractive to people.  We might have cleaner buses but instead of people using them, they are being forced into their cars.  Dublin Bus is reliant on circuitous routes that transport people all around north County Dublin before, for example, bringing them into town, which does not make the service attractive.  When Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann publishes a timetable that does not service key urban areas such as Donabate at peak times, people from those areas do not have an opportunity to get home by rail from the city centre, which means fewer people on trains.  While I accept there has been more investment, everything needs to be stood on its head.  A total of 60% of the capital investment plan for transport published in September will go on the road network.  If we are to tackle climate change, that has to be move in the opposite direction.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that we are making progress in the public transport sector.  I accept we need to make more progress and I have outlined how we are working on that.  However, it is also important to acknowledge the big change under way in respect to the numbers of people using public transport.  Based on the analysis the Deputy offered, one would think fewer people were using public transport than a year ago.  More people are using Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Luas and Irish Rail services, particularly the DART and suburban rail services.  Contrary to what she suggested, more people are using public transport and we need to continue to invest in this in line with the plan I outlined, which seeks to substantially increase service provision.  Over the past 18 months, an additional &euro;90 million has been made available to support the improvement, maintenance and upgrading of the Dublin Bus fleet.</p></speech>

They have reached 2008 levels in recent times.  We need to get more out of public transport.  Private car journeys need to be reduced, yet the plan unveiled by the Minister in September said that 60% of his capital budget would go on the road network, which supports private transport in the main, not public transport.  The Government needs to radically overhaul and prioritise rail transport, particularly in financial terms.  Only &euro;3.6 billion is promised for public transport over seven years, of which &euro;2.6 billion will maintain current service provision.  It is indisputable that Ireland would not have met the target in place prior to the Paris agreement but to reach the new target of 1.5o, we have to do something different from what the Minister planned in September.  I am wondering what that will be because justifying the amount being spent on roads will not do it for us.  We will fall far short.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann buses will have to use the roads we are upgrading.  The Deputy can talk to the company's managers about the needs they have in the context of improving our road infrastructure in order that public transport can work better.  Public transport runs on our roads and if she thinks there is no need for this investment, she should travel along the parts of the N4 and N5 we are looking to upgrade to see what is happening and the challenges faced in the context of road safety.</p></speech>

She should also visit Deputy Pringle's constituency and examine the road projects that have been welcomed there.  They all address road safety.  One of the points the Deputy is missing in the question she has put is the investment in our roads is justified on a road safety basis and to allow different forms of transport, including public transport, to travel more quickly and safely.  I agree with her that we have a shared objective of trying to get more people to use public transport but the capital plan, which provides that almost one third of additional funding will go to transport, was put together in anticipation of the agenda that our country will have to implement.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 5 provides a definition for the term &quot;international protection officer&quot;.  Amendment No. 177 inserts a new section into the Bill on international protection officers.

We have been handed bits of paper with substitute and additional amendments.  A whole series of new amendments is being proposed by the Minister at this stage and the Bill is being guillotined.  It is outrageous that we have to deal with all this while trying to keep track of what is going on with such a significant Bill dealing with people who are the definition of vulnerable people - refugees and asylum seekers fleeing desperate situations.  It is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  In the case of this particular amendment, the Irish Refugee Council says it is utterly opposed to this particular change because it is, effectively, the privatisation of a Civil Service role.  There is no reference in the Bill to the training and qualifications of an international protection officer.  Will the Minister of State explain exactly what the point of the amendment is?  Will it result in, as the Irish Refugee Council suggests, the privatisation of Civil Service roles and a sort of Irish version of Frontex - in other words a privatised, untrained police force without adequate or suitable qualifications policing a new fortress Ireland policy?</p></speech>

Why would the Minister for Justice and Equality appoint somebody who is completely unfit for the job?  This individual will come from the Civil Service and will meet UNHCR standards.  The overall point of the Bill, which the Deputy alluded to, is to ensure that people do not languish in the protection system for years on end, which is the overarching problem identified by every NGO I have come in contact with concerning the protection system in Ireland.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that applicants for protection in this country will get a decision on their application within six months and finality on that decision within 12 months.  There will not be a situation in which they languish in the system, many in direct provision, for a long number of years.  That is the point of the Bill.  The international protection officer will be a person of the highest standard who will exercise his or her duties fairly and independently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600011#J02700"><p>That is a very unsatisfactory response.  Speed is one thing but justice is another and justice trumps speed.  We should ensure that we have a fair and just process for people seeking asylum, who in many cases have come from the most awful situations possible.  While everybody is in favour of shortening the inordinate length of time that people are left languishing in direct provision, a fear has grown as I have tried to get to grips with the Bill.</p><p>Like other Deputies, I indicated in my Second Stage speech that in the rush to ram this legislation through what was being smuggled in was not a mechanism that would speed up the process in the interests of asylum seekers but rather a process that would make it more difficult for people to get into the State in the first instance and to fast-track their deportation.  The legislation also provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the immigration authorities with additional powers in the deportation of people and for an ill-defined new category of immigration officer to be called an international protection officer to, possibly, replace civil servants.  The Irish Refugee Council which has a better handle on this issue than most of us here is concerned about these proposals, as are all other NGOs, as the Minister of State is well aware.  They are concerned that there is a move towards privatisation of the immigration process by way of the replacement of civil servants with a type of private frontier security service.  That is what they suggest is the risk in what is proposed.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of their views on this proposal.  Will he reassure us that their concerns, to which I attach some weight, are misplaced?</p></speech>

Every NGO of which I am aware has been calling for a long time for the introduction of a single procedure mechanism.  The Deputy will be aware that the expiry of the term of office of the Government is approaching.  It is important in the context of the current protection process in Ireland that we put this issue to bed and put in place a single procedure to ensure the system will be more transparent and efficient.  The current system is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's reference to the lack of a definition of international protection officers, the purpose of thee amendments is to define their role.  They will be civil servants trained to UNHCR standard.  The point of the exercise is to ensure improvement of the system.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that, owing to a lack of reform of the current asylum system for many years, it is broken.  What we are attempting to do by way of this process is review and assess it in a humane and proper fashion, understanding all the while that even since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for this area and the appointment of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to her portfolio, the situation has changed radically in terms of the number of people coming to Ireland to seek protection, including those who are coming here because of the situation internationally.  Be that as it may, the objective is to put in place a protection process to deal with individuals with dignity and respect and to ensure their applications will be processed in a fair and independent manner.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has not responded directly to its concern that trained and qualified civil servants are to be replaced by externally recruited personnel who may not receive adequate training.  The council also raises concern about the powers of the Minister to revoke authorisations for international protection officers, IPOs, if a particular IPO is viewed as being too generous in his or her decision-making.  As I understand it, this proposal opens up the possibility of the position being outsourced to be filled by people who are not qualified, the fear being that there will not be justice or proper consideration of applications for asylum.  The Minister of State has not responded on the specific issue of the possible outsourcing and privatisation of these roles.</p></speech>

However, the amendment does not define who is qualified to be an international protection officer.  All that is stated in the amendment is that they may be appointed or removed by the Minister.  It does not state who the people will be, what their qualifications should be and what their role will be when in place.  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify why, if it is intended that IPOs will be civil servants, this is not specified in the amendment.</p></speech>

All international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard.  The suggestion that what is being proposed will lead to the outsourcing of these roles is tiresome.  That is not the case.  IPOs will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and will exercise their role independently.</p></speech>

The staff of the international protection office will be civil servants transferred from the Refugee Application Service to take up this role.  They will be civil servants who, as I said, will be trained to UNHCR standard.  I assume what the Deputies opposite are suggesting is the highest possible standards in the processing of applications might not be adhered to.  We must have a system in which people can have faith.  In this regard, there are international standards we have to uphold.  As a country, we must ensure our international process is in line with that in place in every other European country.  Our protection process in recent years has not been one of which we can be proud.  Part of the reason for this is legislation of this type has not been given priority for more than 15 years.  We are now in a position where we can address this issue appropriately.  I can assure Deputies that international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and that we will deal with applications on that basis.</p><p>The asylum status is a fundamental international status and the UNHCR is strong in its opinion that it should retain that international status for many different reasons.  The Bill will proceed on that basis.  The suggestion about outsourcing and privatisation does not stand up to scrutiny.  These will be civil servants trained to the highest UNHCR standards. </p></speech>

I accept he believes that these will be civil servants trained to the highest international UNHCR standards.  The problem, however, is that when the Bill is passed this will not be provided for in black and white.  The Bill will provide solely for the power of the Minister to appoint and revoke the appointment of the international protection officers.  Where is the assurance on what is intended?  On implementation of the Bill in a couple of months' time, it may well be that staff will be transferred from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  That may happen in the first instance but 12 months or two years down the line, if the Department decides to do it, there will be no legislative provision to prevent the outsourcing of the processing of applications.  The legislation will not have defined the qualifications of the officers or what is required of them.  On that basis, we cannot have any faith in the legislation in terms of the role, qualifications and functions of the international protection officers when appointed.</p></speech>

We are on amendment No. 3 and the Minister of State looks a bit lost as to the point being made and is having to consult civil servants for explanations.  Prompted by the Irish Refugee Council, we are pointing out a significant gap in the legislation but there is no possibility of the Minister of State taking on board what we are saying.</p>  <p>  Today's Committee Stage is a sham.  The point of Committee Stage is to allow us, having digested the arguments, to return in a week's time to amend the Bill if legitimate issues, gaps or problems have been identified, but that cannot happen today.  The process will be short-circuited and the Bill will be guillotined.  We are only at the beginning of the Bill yet it will become apparent as we move on through it that there are many problems with it.  In calling this Committee Stage, we are engaging in a charade because anything we say will be immaterial.</p>  <p>  There is a real problem with the Bill given its failure to define the role and qualifications of the people who will be overseeing the application process.  All the aspirations about a fair system of asylum and applying the highest standards mean nothing because they are not properly defined in the Bill.</p></speech>

I believe the Minister of State believes that is what an international protection officer will be but the legislation does not say it.  It is important to note that this is not an ideological conspiracy or an attempt to undermine the Minister of State.  The points we are articulating are not our own.  They have been formulated and researched by the people at the coalface who are working with refugees.  These people participated as equals in the working group at the invitation of the Minister of State..  They came up with very good suggestions for how we might improve the broken system the Minister of State referred to earlier as a system not fit for purpose.  The process included Department officials and representatives from NGOs and the suggestions were costed and signed off on.  These people are telling us that their observations are not contained in the Bill.  The Bill is still not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  It is very wrong to rush through something so important.  We are dealing with the welfare and lives of some of the most vulnerable people in the world.  These people come here looking for refuge and asylum.  We owe it to them not to rush the Bill.  Even now, at the eleventh hour, I would ask that we take some advice and pull back.  We will be left with an unmitigated mess otherwise and I think the Minister of State is beginning to realise it.  </p></speech>

The Minister is not empowered to authorise anyone who is not a civil servant.  Section 73 provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions".  The Minister cannot authorise anyone who is not a civil servant.  Only a civil servant can perform this function.  While it may not be explicit, it is certainly implicit in the section.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the comments made about my bona fides.  We are attempting to improve the Bill and we are accepting many of the amendments tabled by the Opposition in order to make it better.  There is no intention here but to do the best for those vulnerable people who seek our protection and have a system that works better. </p></speech>

The central point is that section 73(1) provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer".  The Minister cannot authorise just anyone to fulfil this role.  This is implicit.  No Minister in any circumstance can authorise anyone within his or her Department who is not a civil servant.  That is the reality of the situation.  It is implicit in the Bill.</p></speech>

Is that what he is referring to?  If it is, it provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer by or under this Act".  It provides for any such persons he or she may consider appropriate.  It could be anyone.  It could be me.</p></speech>

This is particularly concerning in the light of the potential situation where a child has been trafficked.  The proposed amendment would bring the Bill more into line with the Separated Children in Europe programme and the UNHCR's definition of separated children.  This definition was also recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission in its observations on the 2008 version of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UNHCR also define both separated children and unaccompanied minors in their guidance.</p></speech>

Before we entered into this process, the term "best interests of the child" was mentioned three times in the Bill.  If we conclude today's proceedings successfully, the term will be mentioned in the Bill seven times as a result of the interaction we have had with Opposition Deputies who have been trying to improve it by tabling positive amendments.</p>  <p>  A lot of it comes down to terminology which is consistent with EU directives.  The term &ldquo;separated child&rdquo; is not defined in the EU directives to which the Bill seeks to give effect.  Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the proposed amendment as the term does not need to be defined and is not one used in the text of the Bill.  All children who arrive in the State will be protected by the provisions of the Bill, with the best interests of the child taken being the primary consideration.</p></speech>

This is proposed to try to strengthen the Bill in terms of its definitions and also aims to assist in meeting our international obligation in terms of asylum seekers.</p><p>Those of us on the Opposition side who have submitted amendments have engaged with the range of NGOs which work with asylum seekers.  I do not question the Minister of State's integrity in this regard and I appreciate he must take legal advice and guidance from his officials on these matters.  However, a range of NGOs that both he and I respect are experts on these areas and they have profound concerns.  I did not call a vote on the previous amendment because I would like to have more debate on the issues raised in the different amendments and every vote stalls us for 15 or 20 minutes.  Today we are going to see example after example of areas where this Bill is deficient.  I believe that even at this late stage, the Minister of State should consider deferring it until the new year and should take the intervening period to engage with the NGOs in order to strengthen the Bill and address their concerns.  Otherwise, we will end up with a Bill that the Opposition cannot support.  That would be disappointing because we support the single application procedure.  However, the problem is that this procedure dealt with in isolation from other matters that need to be dealt with and without providing the necessary protections means this Bill is not the one it needs to be.</p></speech>

A number of voices must be taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  In terms of the specific amendment and the term "stateless person", we must keep in line with international law and EU directives.  I cannot accept the proposed amendment as the term is not defined in EU directives.  If the term is not defined, it is not a term we can entertain.

The Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions considered the issue of direct provision over a considerable period of time.  We visited and met asylum seekers in different centres across the State and we came to the conclusion that the system is not fit for purpose.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is also a member of the committee and he worked hard on our report.</p><p>On Second Stage, I said that over the past 15 years, our approach to asylum seekers is in contradiction to our international responsibilities.  It is almost as is we are schizophrenic in our approach.  In terms of overseas development aid, we have been world leaders and have the highest <i>per capita</i>contribution to it.  We are respected across many countries and regions, in north Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, for our contribution to peacekeeping as part of our overseas development aid.  However, when it comes to our approach to asylum seekers, we just have not managed to align it properly with our responsibilities.  This is a collective failing of the Irish people.</p><p>On the other hand, we campaign for the rights of the undocumented Irish.  We are economic migrants, not asylum seekers.  I am a west of Ireland man, a Donegal man.  Significant numbers of my people, including members of my family and myself, had to emigrate as economic migrants.  Asylum seekers are people who come here alleging - in most cases they are genuine - they are leaving war-torn, desperate situations to try to form a new life.  We have international obligations towards them and yet we have failed them for long periods.  The single application procedure will speed up the application process, which means people will not be stuck in direct provision centres.  However, we need to address the issue of the centres.</p><p>The working group made many recommendations for improvement.  I believe that imperfect as this amendment is, it is necessary.  While the principle of the Bill is fine, we believe it needs significant amendment.  It needs to be aligned with a proper reception and integration strategy for asylum seekers who come here.  They need dignity.  Ours is the only State in Europe that has opted out of the European directive that says that after nine months as an asylum seeker, a person is entitled to work.  That is shameful and there is no other way to describe it considering our history.  We are the only country in the world today that has a population lower than we had in the 1800s.  We have a history of mass emigration, with 500,000 leaving in the past number of years - economic migrants to Australia, Canada and around the world.  </p><p>I am not talking about an open door policy, but about a policy that meets our international responsibilities and that gives people dignity while we decide swiftly and fairly on their applications.  That is what we want to achieve.  We have not reached that point and that is the reason I want this amendment accepted.  I want it to link these policies together.  I appreciate the amendment may not be accepted and normally in that situation I would call a vote but I do not want to waste debating time.  I call on the Minister of State to respond to my points and to give some assurance about how he will implement the issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600016#O01100"><p>I echo Deputy Mac Lochlainn in saying it is disappointing that this Bill is not only being rushed but it is not accompanied by other measures long wished for by asylum seekers and those who support them, chief of which are the granting of the right to work and the ending of the shame and scandal that is the direct provision system.</p>  <p>  As when dealing with other legislation, despite the guillotining and short-circuiting of the proper legislative process surrounding this Bill, I got as many amendments in as I could.</p><p>If I had the time, I would have put in another one about an amnesty for all those who have been failed.</p> <p> The Minister has pretty much acknowledged that the direct provision system and what has happened to asylum seekers to date in this State has been utterly unacceptable.  If we acknowledge that, we should also look to compensate those who have suffered this through an amnesty for the people we failed in the direct provision system.  There was a failure to give people the right to work, for example.  It is something that should accompany this Bill, as it should also see the end of direct provision so as to allow people the right to work.</p> <p> The spirit that should inform this Bill and all the measures the Minister needs to take in order to move from a failed, dysfunctional and, in some cases, scandalous, process is the presumption that anybody seeking asylum here could be one of the people fleeing the bombed out cities of Syria, who suffered torture or who has been in the most horrendous positions.  The presumption should be of their bona fides as asylum seekers fleeing the worst possible scenarios rather than that they may not be legitimate asylum seekers, and that therefore it is right to essentially imprison them in the direct provision system or empower authorities to find excuses to refuse their asylum applications or have inordinate delays.</p> <p> I welcome the single procedure, as most people do, but there is an absence of a proper legislative process in dealing with this Bill and accompanying measures, such as those proposed by the petitions committee.  I commend Deputy MacLochlainn and the secretariat of the petitions committee on the huge amount of fantastic work on this.  It is very disappointing that we are not simply dissolving or abolishing the direct provision system, putting in place the right for asylum seekers and refugees to work at a minimum of nine months.  That is instead of being penned up in the scandalous system that is direct provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600017#P00200"><p>We are dealing with two separate issues if we are talking about the Bill and the direct provision system.  Approximately half of the people here seeking asylum are in direct provision and half are not.  There are approximately 4,500 people in direct provision and a similar number are not.  Members know the working group was established 18 months ago and it reported earlier this year.  A number of those recommendations are being worked on.  It is the only document in town when it comes to direct provision and nothing else is being entertained.  It is the document that the Government is working from and many of the recommendations are in this Bill.  Other recommendations, such as those relating to the right to work provision mentioned by the Deputy, are currently being assessed by the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy.</p>  <p>  I have visited approximately 14 centres around the country.  The overarching and main issue that is constantly being raised is the length of time in the system.  It does not matter what kind of wonderful conditions that anybody could possibly put in place for people seeking protection as they just want out.  It is not a place to live for a long period or, certainly, to raise a family.  We do not accept the amendment because this is a different issue to what is being dealt with in the Bill.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the report between 60 and 80 people per month who have lived in the direct provision system over five years have been getting leave to remain.  The report's recommendations are being implemented, even in this Bill.  We have seen over 80 deportation orders quashed since July.  Other recommendations are yet to be effected.  If we get to a stage where every asylum application is assessed within six months, it would logically follow that asylum seekers could access the labour market and other entitlements.</p>  <p>  When direct provision was first established, it was a response to a homelessness issue.  There were 10,000 applications per year in the early 2000s and people were living in parks and playgrounds, sleeping on benches because there was nowhere for them to live.  It was a homelessness crisis in the asylum system.  The direct provision system was established with the intention that applicants would be there for a number of months.  I could stand over a system where people would live in a facility for a number of months but I cannot stand over a system that belittles people because they are there for years on end.  That is why we put together a working group to consider the entire process, including direct provision.  It did not advocate an amnesty but rather that anybody in the system for over five years should see a fast-track approach in their application.  That is exactly what is happening and I have mentioned the figures already.</p>  <p>  This is for new applicants and to deal with them in a fairer and more transparent fashion so that they do not have to languish in a protection system for years on end.  This is so we do not have the scandalous position of families living in and children being born in centres, living there for nine, ten or 11 years and knowing nothing else but the walls of a direct provision centre.  We are trying to effect reform to deal with the backlog of applications in the system.  For the information of the Deputies opposite, approximately 450 people in direct provision have leave to remain but have nowhere to go because of housing issues.  I have had to take on the responsibility of chairing a task force, examining the information and empowering people to be able to access accommodation, dealing with local authorities and housing agencies to ensure that families can get out of direct provision into accommodation to rebuild their lives.  They have an absolute right to do that.  We are working with them.  The worst thing we could do to a family is say that they have leave to remain and show them the door.  We have not done that.  There are approximately 18 cases of people who have been in direct provision for more than a year after they get leave to remain status.</p>  <p>  I understand and admire the Deputies' intent and campaigning zeal on the issue.  We have worked together on this issue, as we have with many Deputies opposite.  The intent of this Bill is to have a process that is much more humane and transparent, so as to deal with the issue much more quickly than the current system.  Direct provision is a separate issue that is being dealt with through the report, which has been signed off by many non-governmental organisations in the field.  Its recommendations are being implemented as I speak.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600018#Q00200"><p>Ireland has one of the most severe strains of cystic fibrosis in the world and the highest incidences per head of population at three times the rate in the United States and the rest of the European Union.  In that context, Ireland should be at the forefront of new technologies, research and strategies to deal with the condition.  A ground-breaking new drug has arrived on the market.  It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States as far back as July and has also been approved by the European Union.  It is called Orkambi and has been described as a game changer in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  It can lengthen life, will improve quality of life and effectively reduce the number of hospital admissions for cystic fibrosis patients by 40%.  It would benefit about 60% of cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland as it is very effective in treating the most common cystic fibrosis gene alteration in Ireland - delta-F508.  It is a dramatic and game changing drug.  However, the response of the authorities in the health service plan and that of the Government is that no funding will be made available in 2016 to provide the drug for cystic fibrosis patients.  The HSE is clear that if the Government wants to fund it, it will have to provide it with additional money.  We note that in the health service plan there is to be no increase in the high-tech fund in 2016.  The plan talks about it being dependent on the HSE in containing new drug approvals.  The entire emphasis is on containing rather than looking for an opportunity to dramatically change the quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis.  Will the Government provide the necessary funding to ensure the 60% of cystic fibrosis patients who would benefit from the use of Orkambi will be able to benefit from it during the course of the next few months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600018#Q00300"><p>It is not about containment.  The HSE service plan, as submitted to the Minister for Health and presented by him to the Cabinet, is based on over &euro;800 million extra - almost &euro;13 billion in total - being put into the health service.  This means that services will be maintained and that &euro;100 million has been left aside for new, additional and targeted services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes the point that Orkambi lumacaftor-ivacaftor is a new drug that has come on the market for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing of drugs and the reimbursement of medical products under the community drugs schemes in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are not political and not ministerial.  They are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  This is a combination drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States on 2 July and the European Medicines Agency three weeks ago on 19 November.  On 26 November the manufacturer of Orkambi submitted a rapid review application to the NCPE.  The rapid review represents the first step in making a pricing and reimbursement application.  As of Friday, 4 December, the manufacturer had not submitted a full application for reimbursement to the HSE.  However, based on pricing details in the rapid review file, the HSE estimates that the reimbursement could cost approximately &euro;90 million per year.  Given the significant budgetary impact, the NCPE is likely to require a full technology assessment of the drug to be carried out before making any recommendation to the HSE on reimbursement, in keeping wtih the normal procedure.  </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE have made significant improvements to the facilities for CF sufferers around the country, particularly isolation units, which add greatly to their comfort and meet their needs.  This matter is part of the application process which has a journey to travel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600018#Q00400"><p>The Taoiseach is not being straight with the people on this issue.  He is hiding behind the NCPE and the HSE.  The bottom line is that there is no provision of extra money for the high-tech drugs scheme next year, despite the rapidly escalating cost of treatment, which we acknowledge.  However, there is no plan or vision on this issue.  Last Sunday the director general of the HSE said categorically that there was no money included in the plan, that the Government had not provided any money and that the health service plan approved by the Government had not provided for any money to be made available in 2016 for this drug.  That is the reality.  The policy under the health service plan is to contain approvals, in other words, to try to hold them back.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration in the United States went through a very rapid process because this drug was a game changer.  It is an orphan drug in the United States and making a huge difference.  Ms Jillian McNulty is a campaigner in Ireland who took part in the clinical trial.  She said:</p><blockquote>Within a few months, my body started changing, during my runs I could breathe deeper, it's not something I can explain correctly because I don&rsquo;t think I've ever known what it's like to breathe properly. </blockquote><p>She said this in a letter that she sent to about 30 Senators and Deputies.  Having come off the clinical trial, she immediately saw the impact the drug had on her body and health.  Cystic Fibrosis Ireland has written to the Minister outlining the benefits of the drug.  It is the first drug to impact on the underlying causes of the condition for 60% of the cystic fibrosis population in Ireland.  It has resulted in a 40% reduction in the number of hospital admissions and a sustained increase in lung function and weight, which is a major issue.  The Government should stop hiding behind the HSE and the NCPE on this issue and start to have some vision and plan for the game changing new technologies now and in the future.  The answer is not a nil increase in the provision in the high-tech budget for 2016.  That is not the vision required to deal adequately with this issue and reduce the anxiety CF patients feel because of the statement made by the director general.  He said he was being honest, that he did not have the money and would not have it under the health service plan.  The Government must make a decision.  Will it provide the money in 2016 - yes or no?</p></speech>

It is the same old mantra.  Perhaps he did not hear me the last time.  What I said was that decisions on medicines to be reimbursed by the taxpayer were not political or ministerial.  They are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the NCPE.  The Deputy is a great man to talk about his vision.</p></speech>

From what we know about his proposals our health services will continue to be under-funded.  One of the big ideas the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, proposed was based on the assumption that 125,000 medical cards will not be required next year.  I do not know how the Government worked that out but I tried to picture the scene where the Ministers all sat around the Cabinet table, cogitated on this and obviously did not consider that there is a deserving citizen and a family behind every medical card.  It was all a numbers game.  Maybe one Minister said, "Well, 125,000 fewer medical cards, that sounds a wee bit high".  Maybe somebody else said, "Let us go for &euro;100,000 fewer medical cards".  What was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s preference?  Was it 80,000 or 75,000 fewer medical cards?  Did he pull numbers out of a hat?</p></speech>

It is little wonder that the head of the HSE recently acknowledged that there is no plan, no money and no vision for the health service.  The Government&rsquo;s stated intention is to maintain existing health service levels.  Existing levels means that this morning, 331 citizens are lying on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal, which is now the Government&rsquo;s policy, envisages continued waiting lists, the capping of fair deal schemes, continued trolley waits and more waiting lists for home help hours and less money.  Every day as we sit here, facing Christmas, staff and patients face appalling and chaotic conditions in our hospitals and the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health refuse to address these.  The Government has no plan or vision for the health services and it is making life a misery for tens of thousands of patients and their families.  Why does the Government persist in making a mockery of our health services, health workers, patients and their families by refusing to deal with the root cause of the crises in the health service?</p></speech>

These involve having to travel to the UK for an abortion, after being told that their much loved and longed for baby had no chance of survival outside the womb.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's response to this has been to promise a citizens' convention on the eighth amendment, should Fine Gael be re-elected.  He has indicated that when a legislative framework comes before the D&aacute;il, he will permit TDs a free vote on the issue.</p>  <p>  Ahead of the upcoming election, public emotion is running high on this issue.  Yet it was running equally high when the Whip was exercised on both Deputy Clare Daly's and Deputy Ruth Coppinger's proposals to legislate for abortion.  On that occasion, one of the most emotive speeches in the D&aacute;il was given by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett who has known the effects of fatal foetal abnormality.  It is an awful shame that we did not take note of that opinion.  If so, we would not have eight to ten women leaving for the UK this week to have an abortion.  I will tell a story about that in a few minutes.</p>  <p>  There is an umbrella group representing 40 organisations in Ireland and I have spoken to many of its representatives in recent weeks.  They include the National Women's Council of Ireland, pro-choice groups, trade unions, and human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  They are now asking every candidate to state their position on this issue.</p>  <p>  I am aware that this issue is a divisive one in the Taoiseach's party, not to mention across the country.  However, it is now widely acknowledged that we need to put aside our emotions and adopt an evidence-based approach to this debate.  The evidence is that Article 40.3.3o does not stop Irish abortions, it merely exports our problem.</p>  <p>  In the interests of accountability, will the Taoiseach instruct each candidate in his party - whom he has said he is confident will be elected to form the next Government - to publicly state their position on repealing the eighth amendment?  Would the Taoiseach agree that voters are entitled to know exactly where candidates stand on the issue before casting their vote?  Because of the party whip system they have been prevented from doing so in the 31st D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

There she was picked up by a mini-bus with eight other women in the vehicle.  She told me that the eight others were all aged 17 to 19, some of whom were vomiting and weeping.  She said that what frightened her most was the silence on that mini-bus as they were taken to the clinic, where nobody spoke, as well as the isolation and the loneliness.  By the way, they had to make the same journey all the way back home and she had to drive down to Waterford.  The woman is in a terrible state.  She was to be here today, but I am not too sure if she is.</p>  <p>  I believe the Taoiseach to be a man of compassion and I have never said otherwise.  Would he allow this to happen to his own daughter?  I do not know if he has a daughter.  Would anybody here in the D&aacute;il allow it to happen?  Would the Taoiseach like to see his own daughter, in the emptiness and loneliness of a terribly frightening situation, having to leave her own country?  I have three daughters and I would not like to see any of them having to go.</p>  <p>  Very many young women do not tell their parents or friends - they go on their own.  It is not the procedure that does the psychological damage to them.  Believe it or not, all the indications are that it is the fact of having to make that journey on their own that does so.  None of us should be sitting comfortably knowing that today a mini-bus is leaving Glasgow or London to take nine or ten such women to clinics, some of them as young as 17 or 18.</p></speech>

Knowing that we have exported this problem over to England, I think it is inhuman.  I would ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this position, particularly concerning people with fatal foetal abnormalities, or women who have been violently sexually assaulted and raped.  This is an issue of compassion.  We cannot continue to be inhuman in dealing with our citizens and exporting the problem.</p></speech>

It is one of many where these circumstances cause great stress and difficulty for so many people.  That is why I believe we should have a respectful, rational and sensitive discussion involving the people, about their views and the options that they would consider as to what might be done.</p>  <p>  I also recall watching a television programme recently about a woman who was given two opinions that the child she was to give birth to would not survive with a fatal foetal abnormality, which was not the case.  These matters are all part of life.</p><p>I have committed to what I think we can do in a respectful and rational way about this.  At the end of that process, a decision comes to this Chamber which will be a matter for the make-up of the next Government.  Members of the party I lead will have the right to have a free vote in respect of their view on it.  I thank the Deputy for raising it in the way he did.  I feel we need to look at this in 2016 in a rational, respectful, sincere and sensitive way, and that is what I commit to.</p></speech>

On this and the next measure, we object to the unacceptable use of the guillotine in principle.  It reflects the Government's approach to this D&aacute;il from the outset where it has sought to undermine its efficacy, reduce time for debate and ram through important legislation.  The most glaring illustration of that was the legislation setting up Irish Water, which proved to be a debacle.  It has been debacle after debacle and there have been many illustrations of it.  There has been no indication from Government that it has taken the whole idea of reforming how the D&aacute;il operates seriously or allowing the D&aacute;il to develop its own personality, independent of the Executive.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has served the Parliament very badly during his term and this is further evidence of it.  Particularly when we consider that the D&aacute;il only sat for five days in September and ten days in October.  Essentially since May the game plan has changed and the D&aacute;il has been shut down by the Government to reduce accountability.  I am not talking about sittings that do not matter and all that kind of thing.</p></speech>

It may well be that the time set aside by the Government for these two very important Bills will suffice.  It may be that Deputies will not turn up to make their case for or against and that is how it should be allowed to proceed.  The International Protection Bill is a very important Bill.  A range of NGOs have expressed their concerns about it and the Government's failure to meet its own targets.  Many NGOs have called for the Bill to be withdrawn, which we know will not happen.

What emerged yesterday was the degree to which the Government had dragged its feet on the issue from the very beginning dating back to parliamentary questions not being replied to properly and responses to freedom of information requests which revealed an awful lot more than had been revealed in replies to parliamentary questions and so forth.  The legislation in which we are specifically interested - we offered to facilitate, with the Govenrment, the passage of the legislation prior to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il before the general election - is, first, to amend the Commissions of Investigation Act, in accordance with the request made by Mr. Justice Cregan, particlarly to give him additional powers equivalent to those of a High Court Judge.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when that legislaiton will be brought before the D&aacute;il?  </p>  <p>  I also ask about legislaiton to enable the Minister for Finance to instruct the special liquidator to waive his rights over documentation.  That is legislation we would support.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if we will see it in January?  </p>  <p>  I also ask about legislation that was indicated at the meeting last night when the Taoiseach promised we could amend the Companies Act to enable activities at the Irish Stock Exchange to be inquired into without restriction by Mr. Justice Cregan in his inquiry.  In essence, other inquiries managed to access bank accounts all over the world.  It is not acceptable that we cannot initiate an inquiry within this jurisdiction to get behind activities within a State-owned bank run by the taxpayer on the Irish Stock Exchange and into the activities of the Department of Finance.  We need to increase the powers and capacity of the Minister for Finance to instruct the special liquidator to waive any alleged right in regard to documentation pertaining to a State bank to facilitate such an inquiry.  Can we see that legislation and will the Taoiseach commit to producing it on the resumption of the D&aacute;il on 13 January?</p></speech>

The Government has no difficulty in amending the terms of reference to have a modular system with a more targeted focus or in providing resources or personnel for the Cregan commisison.  The amount of &euro;300,000 was spent up to the end of November and &euro;3 million will be provided in 2016.  I have committed to bringing and circulating the heads of a Bill that we discussed last night to the leaders of Opposition parties leaders and groups early in January, taking into account the issues raised and discussed last night.  On amending legislation in regard to the Irish Stock Exchange, it may not be able to deal with the particular issue because it might be nominated accounts held in the names of companies.  These are matters that will be reflected in the heads of the Bill which I will circulate early in January.</p></speech>

He gave it last night, but I want to welcome it in the Chamber that he will bring forward the heads of the Bill.  However, as I told him last night,  I do not have any confidence that the Government is serious about having a proper commission of investigation into transactions at IBRC.  The proof of this is that the Government voted against the amendments we tabled at the time that would have strengthened the terms of reference.  It also ignored other propositions that we had put to it.</p><p>We look forward to the new terms of reference.</p> <p> I refer to the diplomatic relations and immunities (amendment) Bill which would give effect to the Vienna Convention which specifies the privileges of a diplomatic mission and allows diplomats to perform their functions.  The reason I raise this issue is the D&aacute;il unanimously passed a motion calling for formal recognition of the Palestinian state and the Government to upgrade the Palestinian mission to that of a full embassy.  The Government has not done this and I have raised the issue continuously and consistently.  The Government has decided not to do it.  It would be a positive contribution, acting on the wishes of the Oireachtas.  When will the Government take the steps necessary to award the Palestinian mission full embassy status and to recognise the Palestinian state?</p></speech>

It seeks to protect workers and union organisers who are denied employment simply because of their lawful trade union activities.  Some politicians and businesses deny that there is such a practice of blacklisting but throughout the world companies collect information on individuals because they are involved in union activity and prevent them from progressing in their employment or gaining employment elsewhere.  We know following the Consulting Association scandal in Britain that this practice is prevalent and well organised and has a devastating effect on workers and their families.</p><p>For decades, trade union members and organisers have raised the issue of blacklisting and the response of decision-makers has been, &quot;Show me the evidence,&quot; but the problem is that blacklisting, by its very nature, is insidious, covert and extremely difficult to expose.  An action was taken by the British Information Commissioner in 2009 which exposed blacklisting on a massive scale in the construction and services sectors.  It identified 43 senior staff in transnational companies based in Britain involved in this practice.  The commissioner's staff discovered extensive files listing 3,000 trade union members and their activities when they raided the Consulting Association's modest premises.  When they gave evidence to the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, they confirmed that they had only managed to secure approximately 10% of the files held by the company, which showed that the scale of operations was far in excess of what had been believed to be the case.  Furthermore, ICTU's executive council biennial delegate conference report last July noted that a large number of affiliate members were fearful of blacklisting in this country.  ICTU and trade unionists generally have repeatedly raised the issue of blacklisting in the context of both the public and private sectors.</p><p>The outworking of blacklisting is devastating for workers and their families.  The practice entails skilled workers being unable to secure regular work for prolonged periods because of their trade union activity.  Some workers have been blacklisted because they demanded the provision of toilets on the sites on which they were working.  Private companies collect details of workers and spread the information to other companies in order that they can make decisions not to employ them.  I raised this issue with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with responsibility for small business and employment and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and tabled many amendments to Bills to address it in legislation, but they have so far refused.  There are anti-blacklisting regulations in England, Scotland, Wales and the North.  Scotland and Wales have introduced procedural rules to enable public sector bodies to exclude blacklisters from bidding for public contracts.  Refusing to legislate for this practice means that regular trade union workers will not be able to go about their lawful business.  It is important that the Minister and the Government take a proactive and positive attitude towards the Bill.  I, therefore, ask the Government to constructively consider it and allow it to proceed to Second Stage as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The meeting comes at a testing time for the European Union, with migration continuing to pose serious challenges, the terrorist attacks in Paris and elsewhere still fresh in our minds and with the debate on Britain's membership of the European Union entering a new and crucial phase.  Now, more than ever, it is crucial that we work together in solidarity to find and implement solutions to these challenges.</p>  <p>  The agenda for the European Council addresses the issues I have mentioned and a number of others.  The first item is the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.  We will continue the much needed work on shaping and implementing a comprehensive EU approach.</p>  <p>  On the EU-UK question, following the letters from Prime Minister Cameron and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, Heads of State and Government will have a substantive discussion on the British proposals.  The Council will consider Europe's actions in the fight against terrorism, building on the decisions taken at its February meeting and in the light of the barbaric attacks in Paris in November and other locations such as Mali and Lebanon.  In the light of international developments, the situation in Syria and, possibly, Ukraine may also feature.</p>  <p>  The European Council will examine a number of economic and financial issues.  We will take stock of discussions to date on the five Presidents' report on Economic and Monetary Union.  We will also consider developments in the Internal Market and, finally, conclusions are expected on energy union and a forward-looking climate policy.</p><p>I have asked Deputy Deenihan to address this last, very important item in his wrap-up statement.  However, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding French chairmanship of COP 21 and the willingness of all delegations to compromise to reach a remarkable agreement.  How the EU fulfils its commitments in detail will be the subject of much work over the coming years and I have set out our determination to secure a deal for Ireland which will be ambitious, sustainable and achievable.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the migration and refugee crisis is and will probably remain the priority issue for the European Union in the period ahead.  The tragic human cost of the crisis has saddened and shocked us.  Although the latest figures show a dip in recent weeks in the numbers attempting to reach our shores, we know that this does not mean the problem is receding.  Ireland has consistently called for an approach which addresses the root causes as well as the humanitarian challenges at the European level.  From an EU perspective, there have been important agreements over the past few months on various elements of a multifaceted, comprehensive response to the crisis.  While this is encouraging, implementation has been disappointingly slow and much more needs to be done.  Many of our colleagues have rightly said that the Schengen system is in danger if control of the Union's external borders is not restored.  While Ireland is not a member of Schengen, we acknowledge it as a profoundly important achievement.<br/><br/>This week's European Council will allow us to assess the state of play.  I expect discussions to cover the so-called hot spots for processing asylum seekers, which have been established but have not become operational as quickly as planned, and the implementation of the decisions on relocation of asylum seekers within the EU, which, similarly, has been very slow.  Delivering on decisions taken is essential to the Union's credibility and we must try to maintain that focus.  The need to register people as they arrive, to return those who do not have a legitimate right to enter the EU and to resettle refugees who are often stuck in perilous conditions beyond our borders will also feature and the grave shortcomings of the current situation will be highlighted.  <br/><br/>I expect a substantial part of the discussions to focus on the EU relationship with Turkey and the joint action plan and statement agreed at the meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister on 29 November.  Turkey plays a geographically and politically central role in the region and is a hugely important partner for the EU.  It is a candidate country and is also currently host to more than 2.2 million Syrian refugees.  It is vital therefore that we work together with Turkey to address the migration crisis.  One step towards this is the EU's commitment to contribute &euro;3 billion to help support Syrian refugees and their host communities in Turkey.  Rapid implementation by both sides of all aspects of the action plan will be key, including a sustained and significant reduction in the number of migrants reaching the EU through Turkey.  No one is under any illusion that this will be easy but it must be done.  A new measure proposed by the Commission yesterday to resettle refugees from Turkey on a voluntary basis would be dependent on Turkey delivering on its commitments.  With partners, we will examine this proposal carefully.  However, the priority for the Government remains our September commitment to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers under the Commission's earlier resettlement and relocation programmes.  We are working to fulfil this as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The European Council is likely to ask that the other Commission proposals made yesterday be examined urgently.  These are on a European border and coastguard, the Schengen borders code and travel documents for failed asylum seekers returning to their places of origin.  Ireland does not participate in the Schengen Agreement and so will not take a lead role in those discussions.  However, we remain committed to engaging constructively as we have done over the past year, for example, in co-operation with Frontex.  The forthcoming Commission review of the Dublin system is also likely to feature, as will the controversial proposal for a permanent relocation mechanism, which we would not be required to opt into.<br/><br/>With regard to Ireland's commitments, our humanitarian search and rescue Naval Service mission in the Mediterranean has now concluded and the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>will return to Cork later this week.  In total, 8,592 people were saved by the crews of the three vessels concerned and I pay tribute again to their work.I know the House joins me in expressing the pride of the Irish people in what they have achieved and we thank them deeply and sincerely for their service.<br/><br/>In addition to this and our offer to accept up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers under the Commission's resettlement and relocation programmes, I recall our significant humanitarian aid which includes &euro;42 million funding by the end of 2015 to support people affected by the Syrian crisis, &euro;3 million to the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and a doubling of our annual contribution to the World Food Programme, bringing it to &euro;20 million each year for the next three years.  We will also make a significant contribution to the new fund which it is envisaged will support Syrian refugees in Turkey.<br/><br/>As I said at the outset, it is vital that the fundamental cause of the crisis - the civil war in Syria - and the savage actions of Daesh are also addressed and I expect that the situation in Syria will feature prominently in discussions.<br/><br/>The United Kingdom's planned referendum on membership of the European Union will also be discussed in what is expected to be the first really substantive collective debate around the table.  Our position is well known.  We are committed Europeans, we believe in the EU and we believe that the UK belongs in our Union.  Of all other EU member states, Ireland stands to be affected most significantly by a possible UK departure.  Our strong support for continued UK membership of the Union is equally rooted in the belief that UK membership of the EU benefits the entire Union and all its member states.  Quite simply, together as 28, we can achieve much more for our citizens.<br/><br/>The European Council discussions will be framed by Prime Minister Cameron's letter of 10 November to President Tusk and President Tusk's letter to all EU leaders of 7 December.  Prime Minister Cameron's letter was helpful in confirming the four broad categories in which the UK wants to seek change.  It kick-started an intensified round of discussions among EU partners and with the EU institutions.  Although President Tusk's letter was generally optimistic about the prospect of an agreement, he did not hesitate to highlight the more difficult areas where effort will be needed from all sides to agree a package that is acceptable to all.  In addition, he mapped out a helpful time frame for the discussions themselves which sees us aiming towards agreement in February.  We welcome this approach.  <br/><br/>As far as the discussions at this European Council and beyond are concerned, Ireland will continue to be constructive and helpful.  We completely share the UK's enthusiasm for sustained effort under the competitiveness heading.  The issues here are the drivers of long-term prosperity for the citizens of the EU.  Under the economic governance and sovereignty headings, although the details of the proposals remain to be clarified, we can see where solutions might lie.  In the immigration and free movement area, there is considerable support, including from Ireland, for British proposals in relation to addressing fraud and abuse and changing the way in which child benefit is paid abroad.  However, it seems that there is very significant opposition to the Prime Minister's proposal to withdraw in-work benefits from EU workers for a four year period.  Prime Minister Cameron believes there is a need for a real political debate among leaders only, during which I am sure he will underscore the political importance of this issue in the UK.  He has indicated his openness to considering other proposals that would achieve essentially the same result.  I expect there to be a substantive political discussion of this and the detail of the other issues on Thursday with a view to moving towards the elaboration of concrete proposals for consideration at the following European Council.  It is well worth taking the time to get the package right and by that I mean to the satisfaction of the UK and all other partners around the table.  I very much hope for agreement in February and we will continue to urge all sides to engage fully and not lose sight of the very high stakes involved.<br/><br/>In considering the fight against terrorism, the European Council will review progress since February when an ambitious and necessary programme of criminal justice, law enforcement and border control actions was set out.  These discussions come in the wake of the brutal events in Paris last month, acts that were an attack on the very values that we cherish in Europe and in the democratic world.  Ireland stands in total solidarity with France and we remain steadfast and united in our determination to counter the threat posed by global terrorism and all forms of radicalism.  Critically, the Union has to work to deliver on the measures and priorities already agreed.  At the EU Council, therefore, we will build on the work of the Justice Ministers in examining the enhancement of information sharing and looking for early implementation of the recently agreed passenger name record directive.  The use of systematic and co-ordinated checks at external borders is important and a commitment will be looked for to take further Commission proposals on new directives for combatting terrorism and on the illegal firearms trade.  There are also fresh proposals to increase the effectiveness of the fight against terrorist financing.  The European response has to come in an international context and we support the proposed stepping up of engagement with partner countries and regional organisations in the Middle East and elsewhere.  The EU needs to do more outreach in the region and we also need to improve our strategic messaging, in particular to promote our values.<br/><br/>As agreed at the October European Council, the December European Council will return to the five presidents' report, Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, which was produced on 22 June.</p><p>The five presidents' report is an important contribution to the debate about the future of the single currency area.  It sets out the authors' vision for a deep, fair and genuine EMU to be achieved by 2025 in two stages, with the first stage focused on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing banking union and the second stage, beginning in 2017, involving more significant changes to the EU's economic and institutional architecture.  Ireland's position in this regard remains clear.  We need to keep a firm focus on full and effective implementation of the wide range of reforms already agreed in recent years.  This means continuing to improve our collective engagement with the European Semester process of economic policy co-ordination and, of course, pressing ahead on banking union.  In this context, the proposals presented by the Commission on 24 November for a European deposit insurance scheme are welcome.  These were the subject of initial exchanges among Finance Ministers last week.  A further positive development on banking union is confirmation that the Single Resolution Mechanism will enter into force on 1 January 2016.  This comes after a sufficient number of member states, including Ireland, ratified an intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions, to be built up to approximately &euro;55 billion over eight years.<br/><br/>The Commission also presented its annual growth survey package on 26 November, setting out the key priorities for supporting growth and jobs under the 2016 European Semester.  This retains the threefold emphasis established last year on investment, structural reforms and responsible public finances.  We agree that these are the right priorities and that practical measures to further strengthen the economic outlook must remain at the top of the agenda.  Although the Irish economy is recovering strongly, we need to see further improvement in the economic performance of the wider euro area and EU economies, particularly in terms of creating the right conditions for investment and job creation.  There will, in due course, be a renewed debate on the longer-term future of the euro area but the first step must be to do what we have promised and what is possible under the extensive reforms of recent years.<br/><br/>The Commission presented its new Single Market strategy on 28 October, entitled, Upgrading the Single Market: More Opportunities for People and Business<i>.  </i>This is a crucial initiative, including in the context of the current UK debate, and I expect a strong endorsement of it by the December European Council.  While the single market works well for goods, there are still too many barriers to cross-border trade in services.  At the same time, traditional boundaries between goods and services have also become less relevant.  For this reason we must ensure that we are adapting our single market rules to fast-changing 21st century realities.<br/><br/>Next year will be the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Single European Act and renewed momentum in this regard will be a crucial driver of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  This includes unlocking the full potential of the digital single market along the lines advocated in my letter to President Tusk, in respect of which I was joined by seven other Heads of State and Government, before the June European Council.  We will need to study carefully the individual single market and digital single market proposals as they are produced but in broad terms, we see the key issue here as pressing ahead with a high level of ambition, agreeing concrete timelines and delivering results, with the European Council continuing to take an overview of progress.  The December Council meeting will also take stock of progress under capital markets union, following presentation of the Commission's action plan on 30 September.  Ireland remains a strong supporter of this initiative, particularly in terms of making financial markets work better for the SME sector.<br/><br/>The issue of Russia and the Ukraine, though not on the agenda, might be raised in the context of the scheduled review of EU sanctions.  We have always linked the sanctions to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements and we would, therefore, support the sanctions being rolled over - as is likely - for a further six months.  The European Council will, therefore, address a number of issues of central importance.  I expect that in keeping with the urgency and complexity of the situation migration will once again be a very significant part of the discussions.  However, the debate around the UK reform proposals, as well as the fight against terrorism, Economic and Monetary Union, the Single Market, energy and climate policy, will also be of considerable interest.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing Deputies' statements.</p></speech>

No doubt, this will once again be played out in a string of anonymous media briefings where leaders will retain the right to publicly deny what they have been saying privately.  I hope we will be in a position to discuss the outcome of this summit, which is an extremely important one concerning the future direction of Europe.  It will mark an important time in the context of whether Europe decides to stand by its fundamental values or it allows the agenda to be set by extremists.</p>  <p>  The summit to be held in February, which might coincide with the holding of our general election, is due to formally decide on a fundamental issue for Ireland, namely, the terms on which Britain will hold its referendum on continued membership of the EU.  The Taoiseach and his team will, of course, employ their usual spin and hyperbole and may even pretend that the Taoiseach is leading the negotiations or invent another story, such as the infamous and comprehensively debunked claim that he fought off an ambush in 2011.  No doubt Chancellor Merkel will once again be asked to help Fine Gael's campaign.  If there is one thing this country does not need, it is more of this nonsense.</p>  <p>  For five years the Government has put spin first in everything.  When it comes to vital European issues, it has adopted a consistent policy of sitting on the sidelines and waiting for things to turn up for which it might be able to claim credit.  This is a time when issues that will shape the economic, social and democratic future of Ireland and the whole of Europe are being decided yet this Government ends its time in office having never produced a statement of its policies.  In the context of every significant negotiation in the past five years, the Taoiseach has refused to state his policy in advance, claiming afterwards to have shaped what he always praises as wonderful conclusions.  On banking union, ECB powers, debt relief, fiscal controls, migrant policy, Russian aggression, British renegotiation and many other issues, there is no example of this Government having set out clear policy objectives or undertaken any campaign to influence other member states.  Instead, we have had the growing influence of domestic party political manoeuvring in policy.  This is why, for example, the Taoiseach refuses to state internationally that Ireland's growth is based on the fundamental strengths of the economy developed by the people of this country over many decades.  He has also refused, with one exception, when he went off script in Paris three years ago, to state that Ireland was treated unfairly and deserves justice in respect of debts accumulated due to failed and abandoned EU policies.  The Taoiseach prefers to talk about his heroic ascent to office, missing the fact that he voted against the majority of measures he now claims credit for and that he waited almost a year before introducing a budget.</p></speech>

In fact, the Government is so determined to avoid any debate that we constantly have to turn to Brussels to get basic information on Ireland's position.</p>  <p>  Many of the vital foundations of the European Union are under threat.  Equally, core policies have failed and need to be reformed.  Progress is impossible so long as countries such as Ireland stand on the sidelines and refuse to even state their proposals.  Europe's enemies on the right and left, as well as those in countries which want to undermine it, are willing to use any tactic and any argument to damage it.  A gradualist, business-as-usual approach is not working and will not work in the future.  Perhaps most fundamentally we have been clear about the values for which Europe must stand.  Without setting this as a foundation which we will always defend, anything could happen.</p>  <p>  At the core of co-operation between European states must always be an absolute commitment to democracy and the respect of human rights.  Europe and its states are not, and never have been, perfect but this region has a right to point to over seven decades during which it has shown a commitment to democracy and human rights which far outstrips that shown in any other region in the world.  Those who like to constantly attack Europe, particularly the extreme right and left, like nothing more than coming up with false comparisons and nonsense such as "How can you criticise when your record isn't perfect?".  Europe must not allow the pressure of undoubted crises to move it away from its values.  The strength of these values is most eloquently seen in the fact that so many people see it as a haven from conflict and repression.  Chancellor Merkel has played a progressive and humane role in this crisis thus far.  I hope that her speech this weekend does not mark a significant change in her policies.</p><p>She is entirely wrong when she accepts the idea that multiculturalism is somehow a myth or threat.</p> <p> One of the most important developments we have seen as a society is understanding the need to embrace cultural diversity.  The positive parts of Europe's history have all been based on the mixing of cultures to develop new ones.  The idea of fixed historical cultures has no basis in reality and has caused immense destruction in the past.  Our response to the current pressures exerted by migration will play a major part in defining whether we are true to our values or if we will allow the extremes to distort them.</p> <p> It is clear that there is not unlimited capacity to provide for any person who wants to come to Europe.  However, we have an undoubted duty to provide humanitarian refuge.  Whether one bases it on Christian or other religious beliefs or on a humanistic approach, this is the litmus test.  The grotesque campaigns seen in France, Hungary and other countries to scapegoat people from minority or new groups must be resisted in every way possible.  They cannot be resisted by adopting their logic.  We should note the courageous and successful effort of Prime Minister Valls to stop the Front National from winning in any region last weekend.  Both he and President Hollande put principles ahead of party in a way that, unfortunately, others did not.</p> <p> At the summit tomorrow political decisions will be taken on establishing a border force.  This issue has little direct impact on Ireland owing to our non-membership of the Schengen area.  The Schengen project is one which its members value, but they equally have collective responsibilities relating to borders.  It is difficult to see how a force of 1,500 guards which may move from place to place will address any significant problem.  The true focus should remain on addressing the reasons people are fleeing their homes in the first place.  If we stand by while families are forced to live in refugee camps with few facilities and no future, of course, they will continue to flee.  Our first and absolute priority must be to help people to return quickly to their homes and provide them with support before they feel the need to undertake a perilous journey in search of basic prospects for the future.  If the new proposal goes ahead, it will shift the funding balance from humanitarian aid to enforcement.  This is something we should not support.  Ireland should argue for an increase in humanitarian aid without any diversion from other important programmes and with the border proposal being financed by new and additional means.  Equally, we should not drop basic requirements for Turkey in order to win its assistance on this issue.  </p> <p> Since he assumed the Presidency of the Council, Donald Tusk has adopted a very important departure in organising summits.  His private and public communications with leaders are defined by a new openness and honesty about difficulties.  I welcome his decision to be open about the difficulties being faced in the negotiations with the British Government.  His pre-Council letter shows that progress has been marginal and, on the tricky issues, Britain continues to make demands which should be unacceptable.  The proposal to ban welfare supports for EU migrants for four years is tabloid-pandering of the worst type.  It answers a problem which they have yet to demonstrate is encountered.  It also has direct threats for Ireland.  It is impossible to see how we could continue to support current policies with each country being</p> <p>open in terms of welfare payments to our citizens, while being denied to citizens of all other countries.  Leaving aside the wider point of the regular movement of workers back and forth across the Irish Sea, across the Border it would have potentially enormous implications.  I hope this is something the Taoiseach has reviewed because it is not a point he has yet publicly acknowledged.</p> <p> Prime Minister Cameron's demand for a veto on eurozone-specific policies is also a huge concern, one about which we need to hear more in terms of specifics.  On the face of it, a demand to veto co-operation between other member states is extraordinary.  The bigger issue is that many of the reforms required to make the eurozone more effective could be stopped and we would end up with the worst of all worlds.  </p> <p> There is to be a brief discussion on Economic and Monetary Union on the agenda.  Reconciling the contradictions between this discussion and the demands of the British Government is something which must be done but which is not acknowledged in the Taoiseach's public statements.</p> <p> No doubt when we reach February, the Taoiseach's staff will roll out a PR campaign to claim that he is driving negotiations and having important discussions with the leaders of the largest countries.  There is no reason to believe a five-year policy of spin leading everything will disappear between now and February.  As a country, we cannot afford an approach whereby we which simply stand by and accept whatever emerges.  We have a national interest in seeing Britain remain in the European Union.  We also have a national interest in reforming the European Union to make it work better.  We need a Union which shows ambition and urgency in tackling rising problems, not one which has been emasculated and retreats towards simply being a single market.  It will be a gross disservice to the Irish people if we do not have more openness and engagement on this issue.</p> <p> The summit is due to discuss the extension of sanctions against Russia.  The lifting of the sanctions has been predicated on full implementation of the Minsk Accords, which has not happened.  Russia continues to have troops on sovereign Ukrainian territory.  It continues to deny Ukraine the right to control its own borders.  It has also begun to escalate the economic intimidation of Ukraine.  The unilateral cancellation of gas agreements is a serious indication of more to come.  It seems obvious that Russia's intervention to save the Assad regime and its aggressive stance on Syria are designed in part to force others to ignore Ukraine.  Nicholas Sarkozy's visit to Moscow two weeks ago and his statement that we should forget about sanctions against Russia were shameful, as are the efforts of others to sacrifice Ukraine in the interests of commercial and political expediency.  The invasion, partition and undermining of a neighbouring state is a practice which can never be rewarded.  I hope the Government will stand with Ukraine and insist on these sanctions being maintained.  Anything else would be shameful.  </p> <p> The summit is due to discuss the related issue of energy union.  With the breakthrough in the climate negotiations, we need an energy union which is ambitious enough to ensure Europe will meet and exceeds its emissions goals.  This cannot happen if we allow countries to act unilaterally and create infrastructure which undermines solidarity and leaves Europe open to blackmail by increasingly authoritarian countries.</p></speech>

The role of the European Council and EU leaders will be pivotal in making the Paris agreement work.  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure it is properly discussed.  It is particularly important in the light of the impact of climate change in recent weeks on our own place.  We have had significant flooding, serious disruption of communities and hardship for families.  It is not just about flooding.  It also concerns coastal erosion, salt water getting into the water cycle, hurricanes, cyclones and storms of greater ferocity and increased frequency than ever witnessed before.  It is welcome that an agreement was achieved in Paris.  This is a good step forward, but it falls far short of what is needed to protect the globe and humanity from the growing environmental crisis created by climate change.</p>  <p>  The new agreement is to limit global warming to a rise of less than 2 degrees Celsius with the hope it could be kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  However, it needs to be more than hope.  For the State, it means coming up with a credible plan to cut emissions.  Under the Europea Commission's energy and climate package from 2008, the State is required to deliver a 20% reduction in non-emissions trading sector greenhouse gases emissions by 2020.  This is not an ambitious target, but it is crucially important.  The European Environment Agency has reported that while the European Union is expected to exceed its 2020 reduction targets, the State will not.  We will be lucky to achieve half of the target which must be a matter of grave concern for the Taoiseach and the Government.  The Environmental Protection Agency is reported this morning as stating it has real concerns about the ability of the State to meet its EU commitments for 2020.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.  The conclusion of the Paris conference and the agreement reached mean that a much wider public and political debate on climate change and the necessary measures to tackle it is needed.</p><p>This should be discussed at the European Council and the Commission but it would also be a very good start if we had such a debate here.  <br/><br/>I note that Britain's in-out referendum is on the agenda.  Sinn F&eacute;in firmly believes that a British withdrawal from the EU would represent a political and economic setback for Ireland and would hinder the process of democratic transformation in the North.  A Brexit has raised the real prospect of a reinforced partition with a potential for customs checkpoints, trading tariffs and adverse knock-on effects for the all-island economy.  Apart from these negative economic, social and political implications, the proposed referendum is profoundly undemocratic.  The referendum as planned will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationship of the North - and therefore the island as a whole - with the EU.  David Cameron is seeking an end to what he has described as the &quot;ever closer union&quot; and wants a guarantee that Britain will not lose out economically because it refuses to join the single currency.  He also wants action to curb migration, including making it significantly harder for workers from the rest of the EU to claim benefits if they are living and working in Britain for less than four years.  Two new opinion polls published yesterday suggest that support is growing within Britain to exit the EU.  <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>ICM survey shows that half of British voters support a Brexit.  In<i>The Express</i>, another poll reports that 42% want to leave the EU compared to 40% who will vote to stay in.  If one adds in undecided voters, 51% currently back a Brexit.  The British public and political momentum at this time appears to be behind leaving the EU, although this can change.  There has also been speculation that the referendum could take place earlier than expected.  What plans does the Government have to minimise economic disruption in the event that a referendum in Britain results in an exit from the EU?  <br/><br/>A significant portion of tomorrow's Council meeting will be devoted to a discussion of anti-terrorism measures as well as steps to deal with the refugee crisis.  I join with the Taoiseach in commending the crew of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>who return home for Christmas shortly.  I presume that if our humanitarian search and rescue mission is required in the future, the crews and three vessels involved will not be found wanting.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach, t&aacute;imid an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il astu.  T&aacute;imid f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och do na fir agus na mn&aacute; sin.<br/><br/>Yesterday it was announced that new border checks will be introduced for people arriving at the EU's external borders.  It is also planned to establish an EU coastguard to patrol EU waters as part of an effort to reduce the number of migrants and refugees.  We have yet to hear the detail of the Government's approach to these plans.  The Commission has unveiled plans for a new European border guard to replace the existing border agency, Frontex.  While this State is not obliged to participate in this new agency, we have participated in Frontex operations previously.  A Commission official said that this State is expected to take part and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, said on Monday that he expected the Government to play its part.  We need to be told what this means.  The issues involved are critical and deserve urgent attention but they represent the symptoms of the problem.  We must urgently encourage a peace settlement.  That is the only way to tackle the causes of the problems and to build a lasting peace in the region.<br/><br/>Yesterday the trial of Irish citizen Ibrahim Halawa in Egypt was postponed yet again.  His trial has been postponed nine times to date.  Last Sunday Ibrahim marked his 20th birthday in prison, his third birthday in jail without trial.  My party colleague, Lynn Boylan MEP, has tabled a motion in the European Parliament calling on the Egyptian authorities to release him immediately.  That motion will be debated tomorrow, which I very much welcome.  A new trial date has been set for 19 December.  I urge the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to raise Ibrahim's case with their EU counterparts and to ensure that maximum pressure is placed on the Egyptian Government to ensure that this Irish and EU citizen is released and allowed to return home to Dublin.  <br/><br/>The Government has failed to make a positive contribution to the efforts for peace in the Middle East by its stubborn refusal to recognise the Palestinian state and to join other EU governments which have accorded the people of Palestine this basic entitlement.  I again urge the Taoiseach to act on the Oireachtas motion on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600028#AA00200"><p>I echo the words of Teachta Adams and call on the Taoiseach to raise the case of Ibrahim Halawa, a constituent of mine, at the meeting.  Yesterday the European Commission announced plans to launch its own European border and coast guard system.  The plans envisage a reserve pool of 1,500 border guards who can be deployed on the EU's external borders without the consent of the host state, if needs be, which is unprecedented.  Disturbingly, the plans suggest that dissenting EU states may end up in court or face as yet undefined sanctions if they refuse to let the European Commission dispatch guards to their national borders.  This is an extremely worrying development which strips member states of their sovereignty.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline his views on this matter.  I understand that this secondary legislation requires a positive opinion based on a qualified majority from a committee composed of experts from the 28 EU states.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that Ireland will vote against this unprecedented legislation which is incompatible with national sovereignty.</p>  <p>  The aforementioned plan is yet another knee-jerk reaction from the EU to the biggest refugee crisis that Europe has faced since the Second World War.  A two year relocation scheme to dispatch 160,000 arrivals in Greece and Italy to other member states has also stalled.  Only 64 asylum seekers have been officially relocated from Greece and 144 from Italy so far this year.  That is an appalling statistic in the context of the thousands of people landing in Greece and Italy every week.  The EU is trying to create a fortress Europe and is attempting to pull down the shutters and pretend that it can wish away this crisis.  It is this naive policy which encourages dangerous sea journey across the Mediterranean.  Official estimates put the number of migrants and asylum seekers who died in the Mediterranean this year at 3,671.</p>  <p>  The EU is attempting to use Turkey as Europe's gatekeeper and is ignoring serious human rights violations.  Today Amnesty International condemned the Turkish authorities for detaining scores of refugees, including from Iraq and Syria, since September and abusing and pressuring them to return home, in clear breach of international law.  The EU is setting aside any concerns about the growing authoritarianism of Turkey's Government and has promised &euro;3 billion in aid for refugees, along with a package of political goodies.  It is also ignoring the fact that Turkey, in its haste to see President Bashar al-Assad toppled, is letting Jihadist fighters cross its border, some of whom have gone on to join Daesh, or ISIS.  The Turkish authorities unlawfully arrested two journalists from an opposition newspaper that reported on this story and charged them with espionage.  The Turkish authorities are also attacking Kurdish militants who have been fighting Daesh and have been involved in serious human rights violations in Kurdish majority areas in Turkey.  This includes the reported summary execution of two Kurdish protesters by the Turkish authorities on Monday last.  Does the Taoiseach have any concerns about the EU's deal with Turkey?  Will he raise the serious human rights violations by the Turkish Government with his European counterparts at the Council meeting?</p><p>Turkey has also invaded Iraq.  While its personnel are supposedly there to train the Iraqi army, the Baghdad Government is denying this and has asked them to leave Iraq.</p> <p> It is welcome that the European Court of Justice has ordered that a 2012 trade pact between the European Union and Morocco be annulled because Western Sahara which has been illegally occupied by Morocco, is included in the deal.  The court reported that the European Union had not carried out its duty to ensure it considered all aspects of the deal, including its impact on the fundamental rights of the people of Western Sahara and who controlled the region's natural resources.  This is an issue that Sinn F&eacute;in raised when we called on the Government to reject the deal during its discussion in the House.  I congratulate the Polisario Front which took this successful case.  However, I am extremely concerned that Federica Mogherini has said the European Union has agreed to challenge the decision of the European Court of Justice.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the decision to appeal and what is the Irish position on it?  Neither Morocco nor the European Union has the right to exploit the natural resources of Western Sahara.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if the European Union wants to discuss the natural resources of Western Sahara, it needs, first, to consult the people of the territory, not Morocco, the occupying power?</p> <p> The conflict in Ukraine will also be discussed.  It is nearly two years since the crisis began and the conflict in the east goes on, even though the firing of artillery is sporadic and restricted to specific parts of the front line.  Nine thousand is the conservative estimate of how many have been killed.  I, again, call on all sides to stop escalating the conflict and implement all parts of the Minsk peace agreement.  I am sure there is full support in the House on the issue.</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see what comes of the discussion.  All of these headings conjure up situations and truths in my mind, but I am sure the interpretations and proposals that will be exchanged in Brussels will have very tenuous ties to reality.  I say this because the Government has repeatedly failed to look at the situation in the Middle East with much clarity or objectivity.  It refused to recognise that Ireland, by allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a forward air base for the American military, was complicit in the devastation and destruction caused in the region and has played a serious part in the rise of ISIS, the deaths of close to 2 million civilians and the displacement of millions more.  If the Government refuses to recognise the obvious truth, how can it possibly contribute anything meaningful to the discussion?</p>  <p>  When the European Council talks about the conditions that lead to terrorism, is it going to acknowledge that every act of war by the West and its allies and every new supporter of the US-led bombing campaign against ISIS only confirms Islamic State's message that Muslims are under attack by the West and plays into its hands?  When the Council talks about counter-terrorism co-operation with third countries, is it going to address the problem with Turkey?  President Erdoğan vowed to punish the editor of a newspaper that had published video footage which it was said showed the Turkish state intelligence agency helping to send weapons to Syria.  This would lead one to think Turkey was turning a blind eye to the smuggling of arms into Syria for Islamic State.  We already know that Turkey has facilitated ISIS in selling oil on world markets.</p>  <p>  It is well known that any chance of ISIS being beaten in the region will be through local forces and the ones who are most effective are the Kurds, yet these are the people Turkey is bombing the living daylights out of every chance it gets.  It is going to be difficult to have a coherent policy if the European Union is going to continue to entertain Turkey's role and tolerate what it is up to because it is a serious problem for the entire region.  People are very reluctant to call it as it is.  It was not insignificant that Turkey took down a Russian warplane that happened to be attacking ISIS positions.</p>  <p>  We have been harping on for a long time about the fruitlessness of violence and bombing.  I find it difficult to listen to people here talk about refugees while continuing to support US foreign policy, continuing to allow Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base and continuing to refuse to search aeroplanes.  International law is being breached on a regular basis, but we ignore it.  When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in opposition, they had concerns about this, but they dropped them when they got into power.  Surely, this leads to serious disillusionment about how politics works.</p>  <p>  The idea that this is still a neutral country is nonsense.  I do not agree with what Russia did in Ukraine and, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin stated, no one should get away with it.  However, are we going to turn a blind eye to the fact that the Americans have killed close to 2 million civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan?  They invaded these countries and had the support of the Government in doing so.  In 2014 in how many countries did the United States engage in military operations?  The answer is 130.  There are fewer than 200 countries in the world, yet it carried out military exercises in 130 of them.  The world has gone mad.  Ireland has abandoned its neutral position.  We should be working for peace and saying "No" to war. </p></speech>

The very first thing the Taoiseach should say within the European Council is that all of the problems in Syria and the refugee crisis, much of which stems from what is happening in Syria, will be made worse by the actions of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other powers that are bombing in Syria.  Is it not obvious that that is the case?  More innocent people will be killed in the bombings.  How can this be a legitimate response to the horrors in Paris?  It will increase the flow of refugees from Syria and be the best possible recruiter for Daesh that one could imagine and increase support for it.  In addition, it will not work, as we know because the United States has carried out over 2,000 bombing runs in the past year and in that time Daesh has substantially expanded its territory.  In direct proportion to the intensification of bombing supposedly against Daesh, it has expanded its territory and recruited more people.  The bombing will prolong the war, strengthen Daesh by increasing the number of recruits and strengthen President Assad and encourage more support from Russia for him, the net result of which will be a continuation and an extension of the war.</p>  <p>  Is the alternative not to stand up and say, "Do not bomb; do not make the situation worse," and instead demand that we stop arming and treating as normal states such as Saudi Arabia which is funnelling support and weapons to the most extreme jihadist groups?</p><p>We should take action against Israel, which again last night killed 14 innocent Palestinians in raids on refugee camps.  The plight and persecution of these people is one of the main recruiting sergeants for jihadist groups across the region.  </p> <p> Should we not start to speak out about what the el-Sisi regime is not just doing to Ibrahim Halawa but to thousands of its citizens?  I read today that the el-Sisi regime has destroyed 3,000 homes around Rafah, on the Egyptian side of the Gaza border, in the so-called war on terrorism.  However, we continue to do business with regimes like this, beef deals and so on.  The west sells them arms and provides military aid.  Why do we not speak out on behalf of the PKK, which is one of the forces that is conducting effective resistance to Daesh and Assad and pointing to the repressive and hypocritical nature of the Turkish regime and which is still, wrongly, on a terrorist list?  Why are we not speaking out publicly saying the PKK should be taken off the terrorist list, because if there is any hope in the disaster that is Syria, it will come from the ordinary people on the ground who oppose Assad and Daesh.  The PKK and the Kurdish forces resisting both of those forces have shown the capacity to resist them in a progressive manner.</p> <p> In all of this, we maintain a deathly silence, while we continue to collaborate with the US war machine and with all the war mongering at Shannon involving US troops, armaments and so on.  When we look at the disaster of Syria and the refugee crisis it has caused and when we look at the destruction of Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan, should we not say that we are going to restore our shredded neutrality, that we are not going to participate in this and that we are going to take a stand on the international stage against this madness?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600030#CC00200"><p>The proposal yesterday from the European Commission regarding European border guards, which will be discussed at the European Council, is most serious.  It represents an attempt to build even higher the walls of fortress Europe and to further militarise those walls.  It places metaphorical and real barbed wire on them, provides for tower guards and for drones flying across the Mediterranean.  In doing that, it eliminates the democratic rights of countries to determine and observe their own borders in favour of a centralised European force.</p><p>The parallel with the ongoing drive for fiscal union is striking.  It is all about the fact a crisis has appeared that offers opportunities for the 1% in Europe and its clinical project of the capitalist integration of the European Union.  The fiscal union uses the euro crisis to say we must drive ahead with this project, eliminating the rights of national governments to write their own budgets, etc.  The refugee crisis is now being used to build higher the walls of fortress Europe and to centralise European border controls in a central European border force.  That is the proposal from the Commission, but I am sure it will meet opposition at this stage, including at the European Council.</p><p>What we face is described in the Commission document as the establishment of a border guard of 1,500 people empowered to intervene rapidly within three days.  It states: </p><blockquote>[T]he Agency will in the first instance be empowered to recommend Member States launch joint operations or rapid border interventions.<br /><br />Where deficiencies persist and national action is not forthcoming, the Commission will be able to adopt an implementing decision determining the situation at a particular section ... requires urgent action and entrusting the Agency with the task of carrying out appropriate operational measures.  This will allow the Agency to intervene immediately in crises situations by deploying European Border ... Teams.</blockquote><p>This means the right of member states to have their own border guards and coast guards is being overridden by the establishment, or the proposed establishment, of this force.</p><p>A third element of this proposal, and anybody who has followed the history of European migration policy will know what it means, is that it provides for an enhanced role for the agency as regards co-operation with third countries.  This is about the externalisation of European borders.  It is about another deal, like the deal done with Gaddafi providing huge amounts of money in order to keep migrants from Africa away from Europe.  It means the Commission is going to try to buy off new dictators across the north of Africa and the Middle East so they become European border guards.  Effectively, they are gong to outsource European border guards and externalise the European borders.</p><p>The consequence of this will be further abuses of the human rights of migrants.  It means an extension of the kind of horrific scenes we are seeing in a number of countries in eastern Europe, with migrants treated horrifically as sub-human.  It means an extension of that and effectively making it European policy.  It means an increase of deaths in the Mediterranean.  What is now called the cemetery of the Mediterranean will, unfortunately, see more drownings and we will see an increase of the figure of 30,000 of those who have died over the past 30 years trying to make their way to Europe if these measures to make European borders more effective are implemented.  It also means an undermining of the democratic rights of states in favour of a centralisation of power in the European Union under the control of the European Commission.  Europe must not go down the road of Donald Trump.  The right of asylum must be defended.  We must oppose racist immigration controls and must fight for a society in which people do not feel the need to travel all across to world to escape from war and poverty.</p><p>I will finish with a quote from <i>The Guardian</i>from playwright, Anders Lustgarten.  He states:</p><blockquote>In all the rage about migration, one thing is never discussed: what we do to cause it.  ... <br /><br />The single biggest thing we could do to stop migration is to abolish the development mafia: the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.<br /><br />A very close second is to stop bombing the Middle East.  The West destroyed the infrastructure of Libya without any clue as to what would replace it.  What has [been left] is a vacuum state run by warlords that is now the center of Mediterranean people-smuggling.  We're right behind the Sisi regime in Egypt that is eradicating the Arab Spring, cracking down on Muslims and privatizing infrastructure at a rate of knots.</blockquote><p>I would add to that the disastrous rate of climate change, which is also fuelling the mass movement of people offered no choice.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach has mentioned, I will focus my remarks on energy union and climate change.</p><p>The European Council is expected to encourage swift delivery of the legislative package needed to advance the energy union project, as endorsed last month by the Union's energy Ministers, and to welcome the historic agreement on climate change reached in Paris last Saturday.  I am delighted to welcome the new Paris agreement, which sets the framework for a truly global response to the enormous challenge of climate change and its impact.  The European Council is expected to warmly welcome this achievement, particularly France's guiding role in presiding over COP21, to which I add my congratulations.</p><p>The Paris agreement, with 196 countries on board, is both ambitious and legally binding.  It means that all countries are now in a position to take ambitious action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience.  It sends a signal to all actors, the private sector, citizens and civil society that governments are serious about the challenge of global warming and about taking the steps necessary to combat it together.  Collectively, we are now committed to keeping the rise in global temperature to well below 2<sup>0</sup>celsius above pre-industrial levels and to keeping the more stringent target of below 1.5<sup>0</sup>in sight.  The agreement strengthens the financial and technical supports necessary for the most vulnerable countries and, critically and crucially, through its transparency mechanism, ensures that each country can have confidence in the progress of others. </p><p>Ireland's team played a key part within the Union's effective negotiating efforts in Paris.</p><p>Next year, within the European Union, we will turn to how each of the 28 member states will contribute to achieving the EU's collective obligation as set out in the EU climate and energy targets for the year 2030.  Ireland has been clear and consistent in wanting a fair and achievable target that does not place a disproportionate burden on any one country but allows everyone to play a part.</p> <p> How energy is sourced, produced, supplied and used is an important part of reaching our global and EU ambitions.  This week's European Council is expected to encourage swift implementation of the Commission's energy strategy, as set out in the energy union package.  The goal of this package is achieving an energy-resilient Union with a forward-looking climate policy.  The strategy seeks to ensure secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy for citizens and businesses, allowing a free flow of energy across borders, with a secure supply in every EU state.  To achieve this, the energy union encompasses a wide range of policy areas, including climate, transport, industry, research, the digital economy and agriculture.</p> <p> Ireland strongly supports the energy union.  As a relatively peripheral member state, it is critical for us to diversify the routes and sources of our energy, putting in place appropriate supporting infrastructure.  Regional co-operation will assist us in achieving EU-wide market integration and will further contribute to unlocking the full potential of renewables.  Under the energy union legislative framework, member states will be required to produce national climate and energy plans by 2019.  By definition, these plans will be closely linked with work on achieving the EU's targets for 2030 under the climate and energy framework.  In Ireland's case, the recently passed Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill has set work under way on the development of a national mitigation plan and a national adaptation plan.  The launch of our new White Paper on energy sets the framework for Ireland's transition to a low-carbon economy and society by 2050, aligning fully with the principles set out in the energy union strategy.</p> <p> This concludes my statement on the meeting of Heads of State and Government meeting that will begin tomorrow in Brussels.</p></speech>

People are living in fear and uncertainty.  People, some of them elderly, are worried sick about feeling trapped in their homes.  This is a very stressful time, particularly for older people.  I have seen it myself helping people to leave their homes.  Nobody should have to leave their home in fear.  This is clearly a humanitarian situation where properties are at the mercy of flood damage and householders and businesses are sick with worry about how they can rebuild their lives.</p>  <p>  What makes the situation more distressing is the fact that many of the properties do not have flood insurance.  Some families spent their life savings after the floods of 2009 putting their homes back in order.  Where do they go now for help?  The Government should invest in or design a package aimed at people who cannot get flood insurance.  This is not about a handout for people.  These people can pay and have always paid their insurance.  I am cognisant of the fact that this Government recognises the need to support people and businesses at a time of crisis, particularly during the run up to Christmas.  I strongly welcome the introduction of the &euro;5 million fund set up so quickly to aid small businesses which have suffered damage.  It is critical that the initial sum of &euro;5,000 is paid out before Christmas, as has been promised, with the further &euro;15,000 delivered as soon as possible after Christmas.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Government to explore what supports are available for farmers, who I understand are ineligible for the emergency funding despite the fact that they are businesses.  Farms have been flooded, property has been damaged and fodder has been destroyed as a result.  Farms are enterprises and should be included in any funding scheme.  </p>  <p>  There is a separate humanitarian assistance scheme for householders.  The scheme aims to provide for people who have suffered damage to their homes.  I appeal to the administrators to make an extra effort to process these applications as quickly as possible and I appeal for an increase in staff, if necessary.  </p>  <p>  Apart from the financial measures, there are a number of practical measures, including relatively small remedial works, that could be looked at to alleviate flooding in the long term.  In 1979, levels in Lough Rea were raised temporarily for navigation purposes but as far as I am aware, they have never been restored to their original level.  I ask for this to be looked at in the context of current flooding.  It is also clear that sections of River Shannon need dredging.  Essentially, this involves clearing bog and undergrowth out of the river.  The premise is simple.  It is like a drain that has been blocked.  If it is cleared, the water can flow.  The Minister of State is probably aware of the cut at Mellick and Banagher which allows Lough Rea waters to flow into Lough Derg.  This cut badly needs clearing as it is completely overgrown.  Some work was done after 2009 and it made a huge difference but it still needs more remedial work.  It is an issue that should be addressed as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management, CFRAM, report is due in 2016.  A total of 300 flood risk areas were identified nationally as part of this work and over 60 of them are along the River Shannon.  I want to see long-term solutions as possible arising from this report with one of them being one lead authority for the River Shannon.</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly noted, the Government approved the allocation of &euro;5 million to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses that through no fault of their own have been unable to secure flood insurance and have been flooded recently.  The scheme, which is being administered by the Irish Red Cross Society, will provide a once-off ex gratia contribution to the costs of damage incurred by those small businesses which were unable to secure flood insurance and were flooded arising from the impact of Storm Desmond during the period from 4 to 17 December 2015.</p>  <p>  The scheme is aimed at providing a contribution to the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock.  It only applies to rateable premises that have been flooded and it is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution rather than compensation for loss or a replacement for the cover provided by insurance.</p>  <p>  The emergency nature of the response to the impact on businesses affected by the flooding required a speedy process in order to meet the needs of affected businesses.  In this regard, a two-step approach is being taken involving an initial application which, if successful, will lead to a quick payment which will be capped at &euro;5,000 per property.  Application under the &euro;5,000 threshold will be paid following a rapid verification process.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that some businesses will have incurred significant damages and will require a more detailed assessment of losses incurred.  The second stage of the scheme will be a more lengthy process requiring a detailed assessment and will provide the scope for a further payment with the total payment available capped at &euro;20,000.</p><p>Application forms for the scheme are available on the Irish Red Cross website.  I encourage all businesses affected by flooding to go to the Irish Red Cross website.</p> <p> The humanitarian assistance scheme of the Department of Social Protection is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and other adverse weather conditions and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repair.  The Department of Social Protection has activated its humanitarian assistance scheme, administered by the local community welfare service, to assist householders affected by the current bad weather conditions.  The situation in all affected areas is being monitored and community welfare service staff are engaging with the local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are being provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Staff are assessing and meeting the demand for assistance by the public as needs arise and, when necessary, are visiting the homes of persons affected.  This is happening in the Athlone area where the Department of Social Protection officials are in constant contact with Westmeath County Council and are providing whatever supports are required, including the provision of additional clinics and visits to persons' homes, as necessary.  Emergency community welfare service clinics have been established in Grace Park Road, Athlone, operating mornings and afternoons.</p> <p> The Defence Forces and Civil Defence have been actively involved in assisting householders and businesses in Athlone under the terms of the framework for major emergency management.  All of the available resources of the Defence Forces have been made available to support the principal response agencies and the Defence Forces have responded positively to all requests for support.  In the Athlone area, the Defence Forces have provided personnel and vehicles to support the provision of lighting and the filling of sandbags.  In addition, floating water pumps have been provided to Westmeath County Council.  The Air Corps has provided and continues to provide air reconnaissance of rivers and coastal areas in the Headford and Athlone areas.</p> <p> The local Civil Defence units from Westmeath and Roscommon have been assisting with flood relief efforts including evacuating families from their homes, moving furniture, distributing sandbags and delivering fuel.  I commend the Defence Forces, Civil Defence and all other agencies and volunteers who have tirelessly worked to assist householders and businesses in Athlone and other flood stricken areas around the country over the past ten days.</p></speech>

This situation is not sustainable for communities and businesses.  They cannot continue to endure it.  I know the Government is committed to doing all it can.  It is not just a matter of planning but of investing the resources needed to implement these flood defence plans that are so talked about.  I am very pleased to see the considerable investment allocated.  I know the Government has set aside more money for the next five years than has been spent in the previous 20 years and that can only be good for Athlone.</p>  <p>  I have been assisting in the emergency support efforts in Athlone since the flooding hit the town and have seen at first hand the huge effort invested on behalf of many people, not least by the volunteers who have been working 24 hours a day for the past two weeks.  I pay tribute to the volunteers, the local authority, the Defence Forces, the Civil Defence, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Red Cross and the Health Service Executive, not just in Athlone but around the country.  Athlone has united to assist people in their time of need.  The battle continues to keep the flood at bay but the resilience shown by the local communities is incredible.  Many businesses have donated food to the volunteers.  The Irish Red Cross had to pay for pumps on a personal credit card.  That is not good enough.  The national flood emergency response plan has to be reviewed when we recover from the situation we are in now.</p>  <p>  While the outdoor staff and executive of Westmeath County Council have worked tirelessly and exceptionally hard in the past two weeks, we need to know why the Army was not called out earlier in Athlone as it was in other towns and why any member of the Irish Red Cross would have to pay for a pump on a personal credit card.  Surely the council should have enough money to provide pumps where they are needed.</p>  <p>  I want to send out a clear message that Athlone is very much open for business.  This is a very important time of year for local businesses and I cannot emphasise enough to shoppers that they are more than welcome to come into Athlone and to move about freely.  The town is not flooded.</p></speech>

They have worked tirelessly almost 24 hours a day.  They have to be applauded for that.  The Deputy said the Irish Red Cross had to pay for pumping machines and diesel with a personal credit card.  That is not acceptable.  I asked officials in the Department to call the county manager in Westmeath County Council but he was not aware of that.  I am not sure of the background to this story but the Deputy should contact the people in the Irish Red Cross and tell them to contact the assistant chief fire officer, Mr. Pat Hunt, about this.  The Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence have been working closely with the Irish Red Cross, even though it is independent.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Defence Forces not being called out earlier.  I understand that is a matter for Westmeath County Council in that the Defence Forces were at the disposal of councils when called.  It is entirely up to the people in charge to put the call in to the Defence Forces.  It is not the fault of the Defence Forces that they were late.  It was for Westmeath County Council to make the call.  I spoke to some of the senior officers in the Athlone area and they were willing and able to help when they got the call.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned homes being flooded.  She should encourage people to go to the Department of Social Protection.  There are welfare officers on the ground willing and able to help because this is a difficult time of year, coming up to Christmas.  They will assist householders with in financial need.</p>  <p>  The flood level in Loughrea and the sections of the River Shannon and Lough Derg needing dredging are matters for the Office of Public Works.  I will bring them to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris, who has been very involved with the flooding in the Athlone area and I have no doubt he plans to visit there.  I will get the officials to do that this afternoon.</p>  <p>  Yesterday I answered a Topical Issue matter raised by a Deputy opposite about flooded farm land and advised him to raise the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Coveney, and the Department.  I promised that I would also raise it with the Minister and I will but I also encourage farmers to get in contact with farming organisations, such as the Irish Farmers Association or the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  I have no doubt those organisations will be in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Food regarding the problems, whether a fodder crisis or whatever, in the area. </p>  <p>  I know the Deputy has been very involved in helping people and their families in Athlone over the past few days.  I commend her for that because people depend on their public representatives at such times.  I will bring the issues she has raised to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, and encourage her to contact Mr. Pat Hunt, the assistant chief fire officer in Westmeath County Council regarding the Irish Red Cross payment with a personal credit card. </p></speech>

My problem was that the Westmeath County Council did not ask them out in time.  Something should be done afterwards to make the plan a national one.  I know that members of the Army in Athlone were willing and able to come out.</p></speech>

Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu has since been re-elected as Prime Minister of Israel.  He has overseen the illegal blockade and mediaeval siege of Gaza, the building of an apartheid wall in Palestine, the construction of more illegal colonial settlements in east Jerusalem and on the West Bank and the wholesale destruction of Gaza during a brutal 50-day bombardment in 2014 and an eight-day bombardment in 2012 in which collectively nearly 2,500 Palestinians were killed and over 10,000 injured.  During the course of the election campaign Mr. Netanyahu clearly stated he would never recognise the state of Palestine and peace negotiations have gone nowhere.  Ireland needs to swiftly put itself on the right side of history and join the vast majority of countries, 136, that have recognised the state of Palestine.</p>  <p>  We know that consensus will not be reached at European level and that Palestinians cannot wait for it.  Sweden has recognised this and its new government took that step.  It took years at EU level to introduce the labelling of settlement goods.  The Irish people have shown huge solidarity with and support for the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.  Tens of thousands of people across the island have taken part in demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people.  Will the Government recognise the state of Palestine before its term ends?  It is a simple question.</p></speech>

It was passed unopposed by the House.  Not one Member of the Oireachtas - a similar motion was passed by the Seanad - voted against either motion, yet the Government has refused to act on a motion passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I said at the time, while some people were spinning in saying the motion was non-binding, I do not see how a Government could not support it and its effects in the future.  It is not only a challenge to us, as Opposition Members, but also a challenge to the Government to live up to what is contained in it.  Sadly, the Government has not done so and we are back again on the eve of the end of the Government, having seen no movement, despite the fact that it is over one year since the motion was passed.  In my speech at the time I also mentioned that only down the road in the Mansion House, nearly 100 years ago, An Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il met.  The Irish State was founded that morning and it called on all free nations of the world to recognise it.  The Palestinian people in their call to this Parliament and others around the world are echoing the call made by the Irish people in An Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919.  It is a very simple step which could be taken today.  I hope the Minister of State will do this in his respone, to officially recognise the state of Palestine and send a message to these beleaguered people.</p></speech>

It is something we seek to achieve in reality, not just in words, and all of the Government's actions in relation to the Middle East conflict are directed to that end.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has repeatedly stressed at the Foreign Affairs Council the need to retain an EU focus on the issue of Palestine, notwithstanding the many other crises in the Middle East region and elsewhere.  Only a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state existing alongside and in peace with Israel, can satisfy the needs of both peoples for security and prosperity.</p>  <p>  Last year the Seanad and the D&aacute;il passed motions which called on the Government to recognise Palestine and help to achieve a two-state solution.  The Government did not oppose, or seek to amend, the motions that were calling for something towards which we were already working.  There were similar motions in other European parliaments, prompted by the decision of Sweden in October to recognise Palestine.  In Ireland, as in most countries, the recognition of sovereign states is a matter for decision by the Government.  The views of the Oireachtas are, of course, a very important factor in that consideration.  However, it remains for the Government and, in the first instance, the Minister to consider if this would be an appropriate step and, if so, when it might be best to take it.</p>  <p>  With other Ministers, the Minister spoke in the D&aacute;il debate last December, setting out in detail the Government's view on the issue.  He stated clearly that, while successive Governments had always seen recognition as part of an overall peace agreement, he would have no difficulty with early recognition by Ireland if he felt it could be helpful to the situation, that is, to the effort to reach such a peace agreement.  The statements made in that debate also set out, in more detail than I can do so today, the many and various factors which might be weighed in making that consideration.  All of us know that recognition by Ireland would not of itself bring a Palestinian state into being.  However, we need to consider not just the positive symbolic significance recognition might have for Palestinians but also the effect it might have on the Israeli side, where we seek to influence and persuade.  We must also consider how it might affect Ireland's influence and voice on the issue both in the region and in international discussions, particularly at EU level, and any impact it might have on Ireland's ability to continue our work on the ground.  There are potential downsides to be considered, as well as gains.</p>  <p>  In terms of timing, clearly some events in the last year would have weighed on consideration as regards when might be the right moment for a decision to be made on recognition.  They include the lengthy election and coalition-building process in Israel in the first half of the year and the continuing debate in the European Union on Middle East policy.  More recently, the upsurge of violence in Jerusalem and elsewhere has to be considered.  I do not for one moment suggest we can only act in the Middle East when the situation is calm, but a move now, just when violence has dramatically increased, could well be misread as a signal by either side or both sides.  When the action under consideration is a symbolic gesture, timing is everything.  The audience on which we are seeking to impact is in the region, not here.  During that period also the Minister has visited Israel and the Palestinian territory.  He has discussed the recognition question with some EU colleagues and the Palestinian Foreign Minister.  It is also worth noting that no further EU partner has followed Sweden and recognised Palestine.  The Minister is continuing to consider the question of early recognition by Ireland of the state of Palestine.</p></speech>

I do not see how the Minister of State can ignore the democratic will of this House.  He says the final decision rests with the Minister, but the Minister's colleagues in both Houses have called for the recognition of Palestine.  The Minister of State says the timing is not right, but when will it be right for the Palestinian people?  It is a fair question, but does the Minister of State have an answer to it?</p>  <p>  We were also told that the timing was wrong for the labelling of settlement goods.  Eventually, however, after waiting for years, the matter has been recognised.</p><p>The Minister of State is concerned about the impact this might have on Israel.  What about the impact it might have on Palestinians, who at the moment are under the heel of the Israeli defence forces, including those Palestinians who are under siege in Gaza and those Palestinians who are being tortured in terrible conditions in prisons across the Occupied Territories?</p> <p> I want to see the Minister of State deliver a positive message.  We have repeatedly asked the Government.  The Minister of State has said there is no recognition, but what is the Government waiting for?  Sweden has recognised, which has led to a reflection in all the EU states on the issue.  The situation has got considerably worse in Palestine - any fool would accept that.  The Israeli Government continues to flout international human rights law with impunity.  Recognition of Palestine along the 1967 lines is the logical step now for all states committed to an equitable two-state solution.</p> <p> If we truly want a lasting and sustainable peace in this region, we need to work swiftly to recognise the state of Palestine.  That is what we are asking for.  Pushing it off for another six months, two years or five years would mean Ireland playing no real role in trying to bring about a lasting peace in the region.</p></speech>

The original script the Minister of State was forced to read here was one of the most crawling speeches I have heard in this House.  It seems to lay the blame for on inaction on us.  He said that we seek to achieve in reality, not just in words.  When we tabled the motion in this House and in the Seanad we understood it was not empty words; we were looking for action from the Government on foot of a motion passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State asked if this was an appropriate step.  It is always appropriate for an independent state to recognise another independent state, especially given that more than 70% of the UN countries have already done so.  Not one person voted against those motions in these Houses.  It is deplorable that no action has been taken.  Even the recent action to deal with the issue of settlement goods was taken on foot of the EU and not by the Government despite a motion and calls from this side of the House and by me, not under this Government but under the previous one, for this State to take actions.  It has not done so because it always seems to want to wait until some other country takes action.  In this case Deputy Crowe has mentioned the other countries that have taken action.  They had the will to stand up against the Israelis and what they have done in that region for many years.  I reiterate not only the content of the motion to which I have referred but also the call to immediately suspend the EU trade agreements, to expel the ambassador, to boycott settlement goods, and also to encourage Irish companies to disinvest from Israel and to impose the sanctions required.  Those are the actions, not words, required.</p></speech>

The Minister made this very clear in last year's D&aacute;il debate, when he outlined the factors that would guide that consideration.  The Minister is continuing to consider the question carefully and I would be happy to advise him of the arguments advanced by the Deputies here today.</p>  <p>  There is no disrespect for the views of the Oireachtas.  The motions moved last year are clearly important factors to be considered, but this remains a decision for the Government, based on its assessment of the pros and cons of the issue and its timing.</p></speech>

I have often spoken about the advantages Ireland has as the western frontier of Europe.  I do not know if F&aacute;ilte Ireland stole my idea or if great minds think alike, but I am glad it is in operation.  I am also glad it used my initiative of the road less travelled, based on a small booklet I brought out years ago.  It is a very good concept.  When, therefore, I heard the announcement of the Ireland's Ancient East project I was very happy because I regarded it as a counterbalance project for the east of Ireland.  It was well timed politically and I felt there would be something behind it.  However, I have deep reservations based on what happened with a previous F&aacute;ilte Ireland initiative about driving routes between Kildare and Wicklow, and based on the absence of any real plan for the proposal.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring.  I am glad to see him here and he has done an excellent job.  He is a very creative and positive individual.  I am willing to concede everything in his prepared speech.  I do not doubt the increased tourism figures, notwithstanding many external factors, such as exchange rates and Ireland's success in golf, etc.  I commend F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister of State.  I know the Minister of State is a pragmatic man and he will deal with issues as they appear before him.  I want to deal with the issue of the Ireland's Ancient East.</p>  <p>  I have reservations because when there is something for everybody in the audience I get a little worried.  When the project was launched a number of counties complained that they were not included.  However, based on the details of the latest funding I see that Monaghan and Louth, which thought they had been excluded, are actually included.  It does not seem to be driven by any concept or great plan.  It is driven by allocating money to whoever puts in a project thereby taking pressure away from a political perception that only the west is getting funding for the Wild Atlantic Way and the rest of the country is being forgotten.  The west has many good attractions and good luck to it.  However, many tourists come to the east and that they are attracted to the concept of the Wild Atlantic Way.  We need something in the east to counterbalance that.  We can agree on that.</p>  <p>  However, I am not sure as to what is being proposed here.  One of the earlier press releases referred to ancient Ireland, early Christian Ireland, medieval Ireland and Anglo Ireland.  A hodgepodge of locations was included to cover every geographical area that could be covered, without any thread running through it.  I represent Wicklow and east Carlow.  From the north west of Wicklow down to Borris in Carlow we have some of the most outstanding Neolithic tombs and hill forts on the planet.  However, I do not believe there was any reference to it initially.  I have raised it a few times and there now has been some reference to it.  This region has historic centres, including the Brusselstown ring and the dolmen at Haroldstown.  That is what Ireland's Ancient East should be about.</p>  <p>  I would like to see a plan for how we will market it and deal with it when the tourists arrive at the airport.  We have seen a programme with regard to the signage on the M50.  In Wicklow we have the monastic village of Glendalough but when one listens to the radio on a busy bank holiday Sunday one will hear the Garda issuing a warning to stay away from Glendalough owing to the dangers of too much traffic.  There is one road in to the amenity.  There are too many organisations involved, as with the Shannon, with everyone and no one responsible.</p>  <p>  I would like to see a trust established in Glendalough.  More important than the local politics, I would like to see a plan for the concept of what Ireland's Ancient East is about.  I do not have confidence in that regard.  I am not sure what is on the table in the first instance, indeed I do not think there is anything.  I would like to hear the Minister of State elaborate on that.  He might share his thoughts with me.  I am willing to concede all the statistical information he will throw at me to project the very positive work he is doing.  I acknowledge all that.</p></speech>

We have a lot of people claiming the Wild Atlantic Way but I wish to put on record that this Government put in the funding and instructed our agency, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, to make sure that happened.  I have led the campaign myself.  I am delighted that I am in that region.</p><p>When the Wild Atlantic Way was announced a lot of people said it would not work, that it was another idea nobody would do anything about.  I went to public meetings where people said it would not work and that it would not deliver anything to the west.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been the greatest initiative that has ever happened to the west.  It starts in west Cork, goes into Clare, Galway, Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo.  It has gone into areas where tourists had not gone for many years.  People have discovered areas they never knew anything about.</p><p>The one bit of advice I will give to Deputy Timmins and the tourism sector in his area is that if people want to support Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East they must buy into it.  If they do not sell it and the people in the tourism sector do not sell it, it will not work.  They must get involved.</p><p>I will turn to the scripted reply now but I wished to give Deputy Timmins my response first.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue with me.  Tourism has been a priority for this Government from the outset.  We have long recognised the contribution of overseas tourism to the Irish economy.  That is why we continue to invest in tourism marketing and in supporting our tourism businesses to enhance their competitiveness.  Our policies on air travel tax and VAT have helped to improve the value on offer for our visitors.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to advise the House with regard to the new tourism experience brand, Ireland's Ancient East, which is being developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and which will capitalise on the wealth of history and culture that abounds in the east and south of Ireland.  It is a series of attractive clusters of places to visit, linking some of our most iconic sites like Newgrange and the Boyne Valley in the north east, through the midlands, along Kilkenny's Medieval Mile to Waterford's Viking Quarter and Cork's many cultural gems.  For visitors, it is a journey through 5,000 years of history in 500 miles.  Its development is part of a larger strategic approach in which our tourism offering is tailored to appeal to consumer segments that research has indicated are most likely to select Ireland as a visitor destination.  Ireland's Ancient East will appeal in particular to the culturally curious audience in overseas markets.  These are independent, active sightseers, who are typically looking to visit new places and expand their experience by exploring landscapes, history and culture.</p><p>In terms of the overseas marketing of Ireland's Ancient East, this is the operational responsibility of Tourism Ireland.  In recent months, Tourism Ireland, working in close collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has been developing marketing material on Ireland's Ancient East for its 2016 overseas marketing campaigns and for the <i>lreland.com</i>suite of websites for international markets.  Ireland's Ancient East launches have already taken place overseas, including at Tourism Ireland events in the United States, France, Italy and at the World Travel Market in London.  Tourism Ireland will highlight Ireland's Ancient East experience in key markets through publicity, media and trade visits, social media, digital marketing activity and briefings for the travel trade.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I were delighted to announce further funding of &euro;1 million to Ireland's Ancient East, which will ensure that we maintain the momentum of this initiative and build on the impressive tourism assets we have in the east and south of the country.  As this project evolves and grows, I am confident that it will be a perfect complement to the Wild Atlantic Way in the west and that it will generate significant additional visitors, revenue and tourism jobs in the east.</p></speech>

I am pleased to see the Blackstairs project in Carlow got funding.  That is fantastic.  County Carlow is beautiful.  It is unheralded and unknown by many as a tourism destination but it is very attractive, for example, the Barrow Valley in the St. Mullins area.</p><p>The statement on tourism issued by the Ministers in recent days outlined that the next round of funding in Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East project would go to the roll-out of signage.  I heard that before in the context of the driving routes which gives me cause for concern.  In my county there is signage for the Excalibur Way and the Michael Collins Way.  There is signage everywhere but it leads nowhere.</p><p>I am concerned that we do not have a concept of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East.  The Minister of State indicated that it is important that the stakeholders buy into the project.  I agree.  However, one cannot buy a pig in a poke.  I work with excellent staff and since I came into the Chamber I got a copy of a local free newspaper, the <i>Wicklow Voice</i>, for tomorrow, 17 December.  It has not even been published yet.  In it the chairman of Wicklow Tourism, Mr. Noel Keyes, states he has attended numerous meetings on the initiative and he is unclear what F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing and what the initiative is about.  He has a vested interest in trying to get the project going.  A group under his chairmanship has led several local projects and it is putting in a great effort on a very limited budget in order to try to buy into every project.  I have much affection for the west and I also have a lot of affection for Cork, a nice and fine county.  I noticed three locations in Cork had received funding earlier in the week.  The Minister of State will never convince me that we will see a Cork man wearing a Leinster jersey.  I would not say anyone from Cork would claim to be from the east.  Let us stop trying to encompass everybody.  There should be projects for every area but if we want to make Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East concept work let us concentrate on that and not just have a pot of funding that goes to everybody from Monaghan to where the Wild Atlantic Way stops in Kinsale.</p></speech>

He mentioned signage and the variety of projects that exist.  The one thing that is needed is signage.  Surveys show that when people come to this country they want to see a new product and new things happening.  Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East initiative will work but it will take time to develop it.  It was the same with the Wild Atlantic Way; people felt initially that it would not work but now everybody is buying into it and they see the benefits.</p>  <p>  Deputy Timmins inquired about overseas marketing.  This year we invested an extra &euro;1 million in order to attract people to Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way and to try to get them into the regions.  We work with the airports and the ferry companies to try to encourage people to come to this country and to go to rural Ireland.  That is the whole point; to try to get them to see what we have.</p>  <p>  Last year more than &euro;35 million was spent by the Government on the promotion of this country abroad.  Another &euro;1 million was spent in regional and co-operative marketing and that was matched by funding from some local authorities to support the initiatives and to try to get people to come to this country.  They also worked with the airlines.  The travel tax has been a benefit.  The Government reduced the travel tax from 3% to zero and the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9%.</p>  <p>  Deputy Timmins adverted to the situation and it is important to spell it out.  We are a small country and this year we had approximately 7.5 million visitors, a 13% increase, for the first ten months of this year.  We hope we can reach 8 million.  The plan for the next couple of years is to increase the number to 10 million.  The 7.5 million visitors have generated revenue of &euro;3.75 billion into the country and we want to increase that to &euro;5 billion.  A total of 205,000 are employed in tourism and we want to increase the number to 250,000 by 2010.  Jobs can be created in the area but we must attract people into the country.  I urge all the tourism bodies in Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East to buy into the initiative, sell it and work with it.  To be fair to the Government and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, we allocated the funding last week and it has spread into the region in order to get the facilities in place so that people will visit and will stay longer.  They are a different segment of the market.  The Wild Atlantic Way is one proposition.  Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East is another proposition and Dublin is another market.</p>  <p>  We are trying to bring people to every corner of the country and we have had great success.  I compliment F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and everybody involved in the trade, in particular the trade itself.  Sometimes we forget that many people make major investments in tourism with their own money and take major risks.  They should be rewarded, helped and supported because they create badly wanted jobs.  Because they are Irish jobs created by Irish people sometimes we do not have the same respect as if they were multinational companies.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister for Health will make a final decision on the matter in the coming weeks.  The proposal has been recommended to him by the State regulator, the Physiotherapists Registration Board, and is also strongly supported by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, the professional body for physiotherapists-physical therapists in Ireland, which has more than 3,300 members.  Support for the protection of both titles has come from many reputable bodies, including the Irish Medical Organisation; the Irish Hospital Consultants Association; the Irish College of General Practitioners; the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland; and the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland; Trinity College Dublin and the Univeristy of Limerick; the deans of medical facilities; the Irish Patients Association; IMPACT; the Federation of Voluntary Bodies; regulatory bodies around the world, including Canada, America, New Zealand, Australia and, importantly, the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland; and the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, the world professional body, where the two titles are interchangeable and considered the sole preserve of the physiotherapy profession.</p>  <p>  The strong view is that the implementation of this proposal would maximise protection and eliminate the current widespread public confusion.  The Health and Social Care Professional Act sets out to protect the titles of 14 health professionals and the title of "physiotherapist" is protected.  The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists believes it is imperative, for a number of valid and compelling reasons that I will outline, a second title of "physical therapist" also gains protection under the legislation.  </p>  <p>  In the United Kingdom and internationally the title "physical therapist" is synonymous with "physiotherapist" and the titles are, therefore, interchangeable.  The difficulty is that a group of people in Ireland have adopted the title "physical therapist".  While this group enters into practice after the completion of short part-time courses, varying in length from six to 15 months to three years, physiotherapists, on the other hand, undertake a full-time four-year professional university degree course, with provision for a postgraduate follow-up degree.  This leads to considerable confusion since neither the public sports organisations nor many other individuals and groups related to health professions in the country are aware of the fact that physiotherapists and physical therapists and the level of services provided by each are completely different.  </p>  <p>  This is not a livelihood issue or about having to stop practising, rather it is about changing the title in order that physical therapists and physiotherapists would mean the same and to take away the confusion caused for the public.  The titles mean the same all over the world except in Ireland.  It is time that they also mean the same here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600037#KK00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</p><p>Protection of title is a core function of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  It is vital that when people access health services that there be no ambiguity about the profession and the competence of the health service provider they are attending.  The system of statutory regulation of the professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system. These bodies are collectively known as CORU and responsible for protecting the public by regulating the 14 professions designated under the Act.</p><p>Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration. The Act provides for a two-year transitional or &quot;grand-parenting&quot; period from the date of the establishment of the register during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of specified qualifications.  After this period, only registrants of a registration board who will be subject to the Act's regulatory regime will be entitled to use the relevant protected title.  </p><p>The Physiotherapists Registration Board is finalising its drafting of the by-laws necessary for the establishment of its register early next year.  This means that by early 2018 only registrants of the Physiotherapists Registration Board will be entitled to use the title of &quot;physiotherapist&quot;.<i></i>In other English speaking nations physiotherapists regularly use the title of &quot;physical therapist&quot;<i></i>interchangeably with that of &quot;physiotherapist&quot;.  In Ireland, however, for the past 25 years or so and in the absence of State regulation and title protection, the title of &quot;physical therapist&quot;<i></i>has been used by providers of musculoskeletal therapies in the private sector who are not physiotherapists.  </p><p>Concerns have been raised that the use of the title of &quot;physical therapist&quot; by practitioners who are not physiotherapists is causing confusion and could lead to patient safety risks.  The concern is that doctors and their patients and people who are self-referring might view both titles as interchangeable and think they are being treated by qualified physiotherapists when they are not.  The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists has been seeking for some time to have use of the title of &quot;physical therapist&quot; also protected for the exclusive use for registrants when the two-year transitional period ends.  </p><p>Towards the end of last year, in accordance with the legislation, the Minister consulted the Physiotherapists Registration Board about options to address this issue.  Having considered the board's detailed response, he wrote to other interested organisations seeking their views on the proposal to make a regulation, to come into effect after an appropriate lead-in time, to protect the title of &quot;physical therapist&quot;.<i></i>Several submissions have been received and they are being reviewed in the Department.  The key issue is to ensure public protection.  This will not be compromised when the Minister appropriately addresses the concerns and legitimate interests of the other parties involved.  It is hoped to progress the matter very shortly.</p></speech>

The people who have contacted me and many other Deputies are anxious that the Minister make the decision before the Government falls, which may happen in the very near future.  The Minister is the darling of the media and will probably be re-elected, but he might not be Minister for Health.  It is important before he leaves office that he sign off on the regulations as sought by physiotherapists and that he do this as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 74 is related and both will be discussed together.</p></speech>

Given that so many children currently live in the direct provision system and the Bill only recognises the best interests of the child after the protection process is completed, whether or not they have been given protection, the intention of my amendment is to ensure the best interests of the child are referenced throughout the legislation, which is vitally important, rather than in the various sections in which the reference is made.  It is notable that the reference only applies to those sections as opposed to the entire Bill.  For something as important as this and for vulnerable people seeking protection here, the best interests of the child should be paramount throughout the Bill, particularly given the Government's record in this regard with the children's referendum and the fact that the best interests of the child was to filter through all Government policy and legislation.  That is why I have tabled the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600038#LL00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  There were three references to the best interests of the child in the first draft of the Bill but because of amendments such as this, on the passage of the Bill, there will be at least seven references.  I do not accept the Deputy's amendment and I will outline the reasons shortly.  The Bill will be better as a result of the contributions from across the House.  We do not oppose the motivations behind the amendment but, unfortunately, we are dealing with technical wording that appears in legislation.</p>  <p>  The working group on the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, held a similar view and one whose intent I share.  However, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact it refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions.  Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in the legislation and our amendments ensure not only the intent of the recommendations but also fulfil the Government's policy to enable such protection to be included in our Constitution, as the Deputy has mentioned.  The amendment does not legally satisfy the advice we have been given and would have an unintended consequence beyond the scope intended that we cannot resolve at this stage.  We have explored all avenues to reassure all those who rightly advocate for children's rights that the Bill will ensure the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the protection process, ensuring the best practice, which exists in our process, will be embedded in the practices that will result from the enactment of the Bill.</p>  <p>  A number of amendments have been tabled by the Government which will further strengthen the safeguards for children in the legislation.  A provision has been inserted in section 15(4) to provide for the Child and Family Agency to include legal advice when deciding if an application should be made in respect of an unaccompanied minor.  We also propose an amendment to section 27 along with an amendment to section 25.  These were prompted following serious engagement with Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 74 also addresses this matter.  The amendment is linked to amendment No. 52, which relates to section 27.  We acknowledge the engagement of the Senator on this matter.  The amendment, once again, demonstrates that in all appropriate provisions of the legislation, the Government has been wiling to reassure everyone that we are fully committed to ensuring best practice in respect of children in the protection process is not only at its heart but is embedded in the work of all those who will engage with children seeking protection.  The new section 25(6) states: "The best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section".  While there may have been comments that there were not sufficient references to the best interests of the child, that has been addressed and such references are much more explicit than was previously the case.</p></speech>

I fail to see what unintended consequences there could be in executing Government policy to look after the best interests of the child.  Children, by definition, are vulnerable and children of refugees and asylum seekers, in particular, are even more vulnerable.  As a State, we should protect the best interests of the child and that should permeate the Bill.  The continuous reference to the best interests of the child being taken into account within this section is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

The advice of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General's office is that this subsection is not required.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 12 states provides that a copy of any notice or other document that is required or authorised by or under this Act to be served on or given to a person shall also be sent directly to his or her legal representative at the time of issuance of the notice.  The rationale underlying this amendment is that the current provision does not clarify whether legal representatives also receive copies of decisions or notices issued to their clients.  The amendment would ensure legal certainty and clarity in that it would ensure speedy access to such documentation by legal representatives to enable them act in the best interests of their clients.  This is a simple amendment that would not have unintended consequences and would improve the legislation.</p></speech>

Given that many people seeking protection move around a lot and would not be in a fixed abode, it is vital that documentation such as that provided for in this amendment would be passed on to their legal representatives.  Is the intent of the Minister of State's amendment, in terms of its proposed removal of subsection (2), to shorten the length of time a person would have to respond to documentation sent to him or her?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600040#NN00800"><p>No, that is not the intent of amendment No. 11.  That amendment was tabled on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  I understand that the purpose of all of the amendments tabled to this Bill by Deputies is to improve the Bill from a humanitarian point of view.  Were this legislation being debated anywhere else in Europe, the intent of a number of the amendments sought would be to not have as generous or humanitarian a focus as is provided for in this legislation.  However, in Ireland we have political parties and representatives who are doing their best to ensure that our protection process is as humanitarian as possible.  The Minister and I appreciate the motivation behind each amendment tabled.  In not accepting any of the amendments, we are not in any way trying to refute or criticise the intentions of those who have tabled them.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 12, the Bill, as set out in section 5, already provides for the serving of documents to legal representatives, where appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600040#NN00900"><p>What we are seeking by way of amendment No. 12 is that documents would be served directly to the person's legal representative at the time of issuance of the notice.  The people about whom we are speaking in this regard are often under severe pressure and may not be used to dealing with officialdom.  I cannot understand how the inclusion in legislation of a provision that would require the issue of the documents to people's legal advisers at the same time as they are served on those people would weaken the legislation.  It would ensure that full knowledge of a case at a point in time would be with the legal adviser and the person concerned.  I do not understand the Government's reluctance to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

This would ensure that persons suffering from domestic violence have clarity with regard to their rights in terms of protection.Amendment No. 128 states: &quot;In page 54, line 28, after &quot;be&quot; to insert &quot;unless the person ceases to be a family member because of domestic violence&quot;.&quot;.  The rationale behind this amendment is that partners of applicants given permission to reside in the State are often fearful of reporting domestic abuse for fear of losing their right to remain in the State as a family member.  This amendment would allow such person to report domestic violence and not lose his or her permission to reside in the State.  The Minister of State mentioned that many of the amendments tabled are humanitarian.  This amendment is not only humanitarian but necessary so that people will not be afraid to report domestic violence.</p><p>Amendment No. 131 states: &quot;In page 56, line 12, after &quot;subsist&quot; to insert &quot;, unless the marriage or civil partnership ceases to subsist because of domestic violence&quot;.  This amendment provides for an exemption in cases where victims of domestic violence would otherwise be reluctant to report abuse for fear of losing their refugee status and adds clarity to the current situation with regard to domestic violence being a factor in defining a vulnerable person.</p><p>Amendment No. 143 states: &quot;In page 57, line 25, after &quot;subsist&quot; to insert &quot;unless the marriage or civil partnership ceases to subsist because of domestic violence&quot;.&quot;.</p> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that due regard is had to persons subjected to domestic violence specifically.</p> <p> The next amendment in the name of Deputy Mac Lochlainn is amendment No. 147 states: "In page 58, line 4, after &ldquo;violence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including domestic violence&rdquo;.  The same rationale applies, which is to ensure that due regard is had to persons subjected to domestic violence specifically.  All these amendments are intended to ensure people will not be afraid the reporting of domestic violence will have adverse consequences for them.</p></speech>

It is hard to figure out why amendments such as these have to be tabled.  The tenet of the Bill appears to be that if a marriage breaks down or ceases to exist after family reunification, those who have come here to be reunited with family will lose their rights to residency.  This is bizarre.  It is supposed to be a humanitarian system which is concerned with protection and allows family reunification.  This is a recognised international standard but we are telling refugees they are welcome to come here and stay provided they remain married, even where the relationship is abusive.  With the best will in the world, a relationship might break down.  Irish citizens are entitled to move on and create new lives for themselves but the families of refugees and those who have obtained international protection will be obliged to stay in dead relationships.  It is absolutely crazy.</p></speech>

I will deal with the amendments one by one.  I cannot agree to amendments Nos. 13 and 14.  The section in the Bill is in line with the EU qualifications directive and the list contained in section 7 of the Bill is not an exhaustive or limited one.  I cannot agree to amendment No. 128 which relates to permission given to family members of qualified persons.  The category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999.  Amendment No. 131 relates to permissions given to family members of qualified persons.  Again, the category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999.   I, therefore, cannot agree to the amendment.  The same issue and reasons apply in terms of amendment No. 132 as apply to amendment No. 131.  Similar answers apply to amendments Nos. 143 and 144.  I cannot agree to amendment No. 147.  The list contained in the section is not exhaustive.  Other forms of violence or abuse will be taken into account when dealing with international protection applications from vulnerable persons.  Section 7(2)(a) defines acts which may amount to acts of persecution as including "acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence".  These can be used to establish an entitlement to protection need.</p></speech>

Should they apply before the marriage breaks down or afterwards?  Should they apply before they leave the abusive relationship or afterwards?  Will those factors be part of the decision-making process under the Immigration Act?</p></speech>

The first is that it was not worth Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn's time submitting amendments.  It is clear they will not be accepted.  That is probably a result of an effort to get this Bill passed before we break for Christmas.  </p>  <p>  I have a second, more important point.  If an Irish citizen was afraid to report acts of domestic violence but had to go through the hoops described, we would be banging our fists on counters in protest.  It would not be acceptable in the case of an Irish citizen nor should it be acceptable for vulnerable people coming to this country as refugees.</p>  <p>  I understand the fear that exists.  The fear is that there might be sham marriages.  People might come in pretending to be married and then, lo and behold, they separate.  There is a different way to deal with that issue and that is what should happen rather than putting impediments and bureaucracy in the way of a partner who is the victim of domestic violence.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider these simple amendments.  I do not think there will be any unforeseen consequences arising from the amendments but they would add much humanity to the Bill and much understanding to the pressurised situations refugees can find themselves in.</p></speech>

The Deputy's suggestion that it is a waste of time to table amendments does not stand up to scrutiny.

When a person presents as a child it is imperative that he or she is treated as such.  This also reflects the principal of the right to be heard under Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC.  In case of doubt, the person should be treated as being under 18 until such time as there is sufficient evidence to the contrary.  </p><p>Amendment No. 18 reads:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 18, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;an adult who is taking responsibility for the care and protection of the person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the parent or legal or customary caregiver&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>As it stands, there is a lack of clarity in the Bill about whether a minor is deemed accompanied or unaccompanied.  In law and in international best practice, a child is either accompanied by a parent or guardian or is an unaccompanied or separated child.  Sections 14 and 15 make reference to &quot;a responsible adult&quot; which is not defined and does not accord with Irish law, unlike the term &quot;guardian&quot;.  This responsible adult has extensive powers enabling him or her to make an application for international protection on behalf of a potentially unaccompanied or separated child under section 15, including the power to consent to a medical examination of a child without his or her relationship to the child ever having to be established.  The adult could be a friend, brother, sister or could be the child's trafficker.  </p><p>Amendment No. 19 reads:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 18, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;taking responsibility for the care and protection of the person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the parent or legal or customary caregiver&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>The rationale behind this amendment is the same as for amendment No. 18.  </p><p>Amendment No. 20 reads: </p> <blockquote> 	In page 18, line 29, to delete &ldquo;shall be deemed to also have made&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may make&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>This clearly articulates the right of the child to make a separate application on his or her own behalf.</p></speech>

The Bill as it currently stands states that "where it appears" to an officer that a person seeking to make an application for international protection is under the age of 18 but the amendment allows for a person to self identify as being a person under 18 years of age.  This is vitally important because unaccompanied minors have ended up and do end up in this State.  Unfortunately we have a sad history of large numbers of unaccompanied minors in the asylum system going missing within this State, never to be heard from again.  I also know of two cases in the direct provision centre in Donegal where 15 and 16 year old boys were forced to live in an adult centre by the Reception and Integration Agency because the agency deemed them to be over 18 even though they were not.  This was pointed out to the agency.  Bizarrely, the system actually allowed them to attend secondary school but would not accept that they were children.  Are we going to have a continuation of this system?  I would very much like to say that it is not the case but "where it appears" to an officer that a person is under 18 is not sufficient to ensure that such a person will be treated as a child.  The principle of self identification is vitally important and should be the first principle when we are dealing with children who come into this State.  A final determination on age can be made at a future date but the principle of self identification is vitally important.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 73 provides that the age assessment procedures would only be carried out as a last resort rather than as a matter of course.  These procedures, some of which may be invasive, should not be carried out unless all other avenues, including interviews and attempts to gather documentary evidence have failed to establish an individual's age.  This comes back to the best interests of the child principle.  Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and assert that the immigration system will ensure that unaccompanied children who end up in this State will actually be treated as children.</p></speech>

It seeks to preserve the assumption that an individual is a minor if he or she self declares thus.  That is hugely important and is in keeping with international best practice which suggests that the law should automatically assume that a person is a minor if he or she is self declared as such rather than a self declared minor being forced to prove that he or she is a minor.  It is up to the State or the law to prove otherwise and we should preserve that principle.  It is hugely important, particularly because children can often look older than they actually are.  If we declare that we believe in the best interests of the child, then we must listen to and respect what children are saying to us.  If we have information to the contrary, we can use it but if not, we should accept their word.  As Deputy Pringle said, the potential exists for unaccompanied minors to be assessed as adults, which would be detrimental to them.  While this amendment is relatively minor, it is important.</p></speech>

The idea that children would be wrongly assessed as adults is completely unacceptable and, therefore, any self-declaration by children that they are children should be accepted unless there is evidence to the contrary.  The word of the children should be accepted unless there is a reason to believe otherwise, and documentary evidence or other evidence should be looked at if there is any reason to believe it is not the case that someone is a child.  However, in the first instance, we should accept the word of the child.</p></speech>

Some of what we have done in the amendments is reflective of the debate in the Seanad, when Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance had concerns around the Bill.  I will explain that it will be necessary to have two opinions of the age of a suspected minor, not one, as previously envisaged, and also that the Child and Family Agency will be automatically involved.</p>  <p>  I cannot agree with amendments Nos. 16 and 17 as all applicants are asked for their date of birth as part of their initial interview on arrival.  If the person gives a date of birth that makes them a minor, then they have self-identified as a minor, and that is the way it works.  I also cannot agree with Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments Nos. 18 and 19 because there is a concern they may be too narrow.  A child may be accompanied by a responsible person who is not covered in the suggested text of the amendments.</p>  <p>  Government amendment No. 72 is a technical drafting amendment.  I cannot accept amendment No. 73, which seeks to insert a provision into section 24 which deals with the examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor in order to provide that such examinations should only be carried out as a measure of last resort.  This amendment is not necessary.  Section 24(1) clearly states that an age assessment examination will only be conducted when necessary for the purposes of determining the age of an applicant for international protection.  Section 24(6) also provides that the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 74 is a Government amendment linked to amendment No. 52, which concerns section 27.  We acknowledge the input of Senator van Turnhout in regard to this matter, which relates to having two opinions rather than one and also the involvement of the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  Government amendment No. 76 arose from an engagement with the Children's Rights Alliance and Department officials.  The alliance has many NGO members from the protection sector.  This amendment gives a further reassurance that the best interests of the child are at the heart of the Bill and provides specific safeguards as to the assessment of the child's capacity to understand the process.  Those provisions were not in the Bill previously but they will be as a result of accepting these amendments.</p></speech>

I am sure that in the cases I mentioned earlier, the children gave their dates of birth to the immigration officer at the port of entry when they entered the State, but they certainly were not treated as minors.  Unfortunately, we cannot accept the Minister of State's reassurance that having someone simply give their date of birth as part of the interview process will ensure they will be treated as a minor.  For that reason, it is important the Bill should allow for self-declaration as a minor.</p></speech>

The issue with these amendments is that they risk adults claiming they are under 18.  We have accepted Senator van Turnhout's advice on ensuring a second opinion is required and, if there is any doubt at all, the Child and Family Agency - Tusla intervenes.  The officer has to err on the side of caution if there is any doubt in regard to the age of the applicant.</p></speech>

However, that leaves an over-reliance on the individual officers concerned.  What we are enshrining here is something that is contrary to the advice of any child protection agency I know of or any advocate for children's rights.  We have always heard it said that we should listen to the voice of children and believe them.  This is putting too much of an onus on the individual officers.  There is no requirement for an officer to listen to the voice of the child.  Of course, parents may try to reduce a person's age in order to have them introduced as minors.  However, are we designing legislation on the assumption that people are going to tell lies or in order to make it easy for people who are coming in traumatic circumstances and trying to enter as refugees?  Do we not expect that the majority of the people coming will have evidence of dates of birth and will be truthful about them?  It seems the Bill flies in the face of what child protection advocates and organisations have been saying for years in this country.</p></speech>

First, he said that if a minor gives a date of birth that shows they are a minor, subsection (2) automatically kicks in and Tusla will be informed.  He then said the reason he is not accepting this amendment is in order to stop people declaring themselves as minors falsely to try to subvert the system.  What is to stop somebody who is not a minor giving a date of birth that shows them to be a minor if the first system kicks in anyway?  It does not make sense.</p>  <p>  This brings us to the heart of the unfortunate assumption in the system that everybody who is coming here is trying to scam the system or get something they are not entitled to.  That is the not the presumption that should be within the Bill, which should be about how we meet our international standards in order to protect people who need protection.  We should not throw out a whole system because some people might try to abuse it.  If we did that, we would not have a social welfare system in this State.  Unfortunately, I believe the underlying assumption throughout the Bill is that these people are really coming here to scam the system and to get something they are not entitled to.  The presumption should be that these are people in need of international protection and that we have an obligation, as a State, to offer them protection.  That is different from the way this has been pitched in the debate.</p></speech>

Senators and Deputies have put forward amendments on the issue of children and unaccompanied minors, which is a particularly sensitive area.  In regard to the first amendment in this group, if somebody arrives here and gives a date of birth that clearly identifies him or her as a minor, he or she has self-identified as a minor.  The previous system, as envisaged, was that one officer would make a determination on that application.  Now, as a result of amendments that have been submitted, the determination is that two officers must make a determination.  If one officer makes a determination, the second officer must corroborate it.  If there is any doubt and if somebody is clearly not a minor, that may be evident.  If there is any doubt - for cultural or other reasons - the person is not a minor, the Child and Family Agency becomes involved.  Therefore, we now have a double lock system and an external independent agency that will be involved in the process.  Previously, one individual had all the power.  Now this has changed and two officers must collaborate on the opinion and the Child and Family Agency may then be involved in copper-fastening the decision.</p> <p> Notwithstanding what I said previously about the perception of an unsympathetic system, we must remember that asylum is a sacred status and the UNHCR has constantly reaffirmed this.  We undermine that sacred status if we do not ensure those who acquire this status meet the international criteria, which is why we like to ensure these checks and balances are in the system.</p></speech>

That is how that situation is dealt with.  There is no suggestion that individual would not be entertained or that an application would not be processed.</p>  <p>  The amendments in this grouping deal with applications for international protection.  I am not accepting amendment No. 20, as a provision is included to stop applicants making claims on behalf of their children in their own right, after their own cases have been completed, in an effort to frustrate the process and delay their removal from the State.  Amendment No. 22 is a Government amendment.  It is a technical amendment which adds a comma.  I cannot accept amendment No. 23 as it would weaken the provision and would not be in the best interest of the child.  Amendment No. 24 is a Government amendment which further amends and clarifies the information required to be provided by an applicant when making his or her application, which may have a bearing on other matters to be considered by the Minister for Justice and Equality as appropriate at any later stage.</p>  <p>  I am not agreeing to amendment No. 25, as a person arriving at the frontier of the State who is an unaccompanied minor will be referred to the Child and Family Agency, which will decide what is in the best interest of the child.  The Child and Family Agency will make a decision on behalf of the child, based on the information and legal advice available to it.  I am not agreeing to amendment No. 29, as the existing provision adequately balances the needs of the State and the circumstances of the individual and current practice takes account of personal circumstances.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 75 is a technical Government amendment.  I have already spoken on amendment No. 76 in the context of the interaction with the Children's Rights Alliance.  Amendment No. 90 is a Government amendment which clarifies that an application for international protection may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the preparation of the report under section 38.</p></speech>

Section 16 outlines the conditions that attach to a permission granted to a protection applicant while the applicant remains in the State.  Section 16(3)(b) places an outright prohibition on the protection applicants seeking, entering or being in employment.  Ireland is now the only country in the European Union, bar Lithuania, that has a blanket ban on protection applicants entering the workplace.  The impact of this on protection applicants is well documented by the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, NASC, protection applicants and other non-governmental organisations in the field.  It has formed part of the public discourse on our protection system in recent months, with the lifting of the ban receiving wide public support</p><p>Importantly, the working group on the protection process in direct provision recommended that protection applicants be granted the right to work if a decision on their application was not received within nine months.  NASC is deeply concerned that despite this, the prohibition on the right to work is restated in the current draft Bill.  It also recommends in the strongest possible terms that protection applicants should be given access to the labour market, with section 16(3)(b) being removed and replaced with a provision from Article 5 of the reception conditions directive, granting qualified or limited access to the labour market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600045#SS00900"><p>I will speak to amendment No. 102, which basically has the same effect as Deputy Collins's amendment, except it does not allow blame to be put on the applicant.  The Minister of State will probably indicate in response that the intention of the Bill is that all decisions will be made within six months so this does not arise.  Seeing is believing and I certainly do not believe it.  I would very much like to be in a position where all decisions would be made within six months but no extra resources will be made available within the system to process applications.  The system cannot deal with the people it has now but that argument can be turned around by blaming the applicants and saying they use the courts system and everything else to slow down the process.</p>  <p>  I put down a Private Member's motion a while back and at that stage the Minister of State probably echoed the working group's recommendation that people should have access to the labour market after a certain period if their application has not been decided.  It is a basic principle that makes sense.  It would be great if the amendment is accepted and all applications would be decided within six months as it would mean that this element would never have to be used.  There cannot be any unintended consequences of this amendment because its provisions will never be used if the Government's logic is correct.  Everything will be done and dusted three months before it would be needed.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has nothing to fear from agreeing with the amendment if he is confident everything will be processed so quickly from now on.  If there is meant to be quick processing but not enough resources are put in, there is a fear that it might be more difficult to get a fair hearing.  There should not be a serious argument against this amendment if the Government is intent on processing everything in six months.  Most people, including the Minister of State, would agree that it is fair to say that the people in direct provision have not been treated like normal human beings.  Not allowing them to work shortly after their application, and being crucified as a result, is grossly unfair and impossible for any State to defend.</p>  <p>  The inhuman way some of these people have been treated is directly related to the fact that we have not allowed them into society for one reason or another at an early stage while the application was being processed.  If the failure is on the State's side because it has not been able to process the application quickly enough, allowing the people to work is a no-brainer.  It makes sense all around in terms of human rights and treating people with dignity.  Anybody on the island of Ireland who is fit to work should have the opportunity to look for a job.  As Deputy Pringle has stated, given the Minister of State's confidence in how everything will be processed so quickly from now on, this amendment would not interfere in the Government's thought process.</p></speech>

It has been for a long time.  The indignity of not being allowed to work and simultaneously being accused of somehow sponging off the system, becoming a target for all sorts of racist abuse by a certain element of society, is utterly unacceptable.  Asylum seekers want to contribute and they do not want to be dependent if they do not have to be.  They want to contribute and work and they want the dignity that comes with it.  For so many years, so many asylum seekers have been denied that, which is one of the great scandals.  It is a failure to date in the asylum process.</p>  <p>  In the best of all possible worlds, and even if the resources existed and worked absolutely smoothly, there would always be a delay.  The idea that we will have a six-month process immediately after the passing of the Bill stretches credibility.  Even if we reach it at some point relatively soon - Deputy Pringle has indicated there is reason to doubt that the resources exist for this - there will always be the potential for delay.  Most people would say that delays are likely, as events have a way of going past the hoped for periods for processing these applications as envisaged by the Bill.  The Minister of State should accept this amendment as he knows how fundamental it is.  It is a big omission in the Bill.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;6 million was allocated in the budget to fast-track many applications.  That is why between 60 and 80 leave to remain cases are being processed each month since publication of the working group's report.  The report is being implemented.</p>  <p>  I agree with the right to work.  I accept what the Deputies are saying about the nine-month stipulation not being necessary if everybody has his or her application processed after six months, but the fundamental point about having a right to work should be acceded to by the Government.  This is being done through the Cabinet social policy sub-committee.  That is the mechanism through which I want to see it happen.  It is not happening in the Bill, but I am not letting the issue go because, as Deputy Niall Collins said, I do not think we should be outside the European norm in this regard.  The right to work is fundamental and we must vindicate it.  As I said, it is not happening in the Bill, but I believe it will happen through the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy.</p></speech>

The guidelines should include but would not be limited to the standards for apartments laid out in Tables 1, 2 and 3 and paragraphs (a) to (e), inclusive.  The minimum sizes for apartments in the guidelines should be as laid out in Table 1.  The size of 45 sq. m for a one-bedroom apartment refers back to the old legislation.  I am not opposing the Government's move.  It is, obviously, a climbdown from Dublin City Council's recommendation of March 2007 of 55 sq. m. for a single bedroom apartment.  We can live with small sizes for single bedroom apartments.</p><p>Likewise, I have not opposed the idea of a studio apartment, given that more and more people are living separately and alone in Irish society than ever before.  Nine out of ten people who got married last year will probably separate within 15 to 20 years - a lot of them perhaps within ten years.  There is nothing wrong with this; I am separated myself and can recommend it.  It is all part of life and I have no regrets either way.  There is a demand for small studio apartments.  The average size of a one-bedroom apartment in Paris is about 35 sq. m.  The idea that we only build one bedroom apartments here of 55 sq. m is a little off the wall.</p><p>I have included 80 sq. m as the minimum size of a two-bedroom apartment and 100 sq. m as the minimum size of a three-bedroom apartment.  The Government might think that is draconian, but I do not.  We have a serious problem with apartments in Ireland and how we approach their construction.  We have never built apartments fit for family use.  I have to hold up my hands and say that, as a company, we did not build apartments that were good enough for families either.  If we are to avoid covering the country in concrete, Ireland will have to embrace the idea of apartment living.  If we are to do so, however, it is unfair to expect people to raise families in the apartments we have been building.  Therefore, my proposal for a minimum size of 80 sq. m for a two-bedroom apartment and 100 sq. m for a three-bedroom apartment is geared towards the idea that we must stop thinking about apartments being a transitory place for single people or childless couples until they have children and then have to move to a house.  That is not the way forward.  We have to start building apartments in which families can live.  There are many aspects to it, but we have to examine the European model.  I have looked at many apartments elsewhere in Europe in which families live very well.  They work, but they are a very different animal from what we are producing here.  </p><p>In dealing with the spatial aspects if one is to built two-bedroom apartments of less than 80 sq. m, they will not be fit for family use.  There are, obviously, other dimensions in terms of what an apartment should have if it is to be fit for used by a family.  For example, a big problem in Dublin city is that there are no play areas for kids in apartment complexes.  We provide basement car parks and sometimes small landscaped areas in a courtyard, but there are no proper play areas.  In general, apartments do not have nearly enough storage space or large balconies.  Some may think it is all right for Europeans on the Continent to have balconies because they enjoy suitable weather conditions.  In fact, however, the winters in northern Italy are much colder than in Ireland, yet one sees big balconies there.  Of course, they have better summers than we do, with much more heat.  They are able to seal balconies for the winter with perspex or glass and remove it during the summer.  We could do the same here.  It makes a massive difference if an apartment is airy and has balcony space.</p><p>In the Bill the Minister of State is agreeing to move to a depth of 2 m for balconies.  The amendment also addresses the issue of minimum balcony sizes.  It proposes a minimum size of 6 sq. m for a one-bedroom apartment, 8 sq. m for a two-bedroom apartment and 10 sq. m for a three-bedroom apartment.</p><p>It is doable.  In the last apartment complex we built, the two-bedroom apartments had an average of just under 12 sq. m.  It makes a considerable difference to an apartment.  To build good apartments the element of a balcony is crucial.</p> <p> The same applies to storage space.  There was no storage space in the original apartments we built in Dublin in the 1990s.  Some apartments have almost zero storage space and one would wonder how it could work.  It does not work very well.  Storage space is not something one thinks of in a house because there is not really a shortage of it in a house, but it is a big challenge in an apartment.  Especially in an apartment block of 30 to 40 units, there is nowhere else to put stuff.  With a house there can be a garage, outhouses etc., but there is always space.  There is an attic in a house.  There is no attic in the average apartment.  There is a 300 mm concrete floor sitting above one's head.  There is a huge lack of storage space.  One just cannot pretend that the need is not there because it is.  One might say that people should not clutter so much, but everybody has things and needs storage space for them.</p> <p> The sizes I have specified in the amendment are not unreasonable.  I am perfectly comfortable to live with the idea of one-bedroom and studio apartments being small.  However, will an apartment be inhabitable if we adhere to these guidelines?  It will be if we build it properly.  Will it be built properly?  I have always insisted that the building regulations in Ireland are A1; there is absolutely nothing wrong with our building regulations.  We have powerful building regulations in Ireland and we do not need to adjust them.  However we need to apply them.  If we want to be sure they are being applied, we need supervision.  That is why, as the Minister of State will know, I argued very strongly here for the return of independent inspections by the local authorities.  It would play a huge part in ensuring things were done right.</p> <p> In every profession on the planet there are people who are really keen to do things right and those who are not so keen to do things right and want to cut corners.  It is not just builders; it is everybody across the board.  In every profession some people take a more positive approach to how they do their work than others.  Building is no different.  Architects and engineers are no different.  We need inspection.  It is not unrelated to us allowing military planes go through Shannon without inspecting to see what is inside them.  We will never know what is inside them unless we look.  I can understand the Government's reason for not looking because I do not think it would like to see what is in them.</p> <p> If we look at construction, the return of the tariff of works would be very positive.  I think the Minister of State agrees with me.  Anyone who has worked in the profession knows it makes sense to check what is done; that is not rocket science.  There is another aspect.  Obviously, we are moving into a different era with regard to housing in Ireland.  Not long ago 85% of Irish people owned the place in which they were living.  I do not believe that day will return.  I do not see a problem with that.  Home ownership is just over 70% at the moment.  In our lifetime it could reach 50:50 between home ownership and otherwise, including social and rented housing.</p> <p> Obviously, not much will happen between now and the general election, but the next Government, whatever its make-up, will need to take a serious look at how we do housing.  For example, in talking about social housing in Ireland at the moment, we think of these large ghettos that have not really worked well.  They were built badly.  The raw material used and the workmanship were of the cheapest kind.  We built loads of them together and there was no mixture.  As they were not mixed very much with private housing, they became problematic and there are major social problems attached to many of the social housing developments in Ireland.  However, it does not have to be that way and it could be done differently.  I believe we will have to do it differently.</p> <p> For example, when Part V was in operation, even as poor as it was and it did not serve us well, when people were building 20% social or affordable units, builders and developers were getting away with using cheaper material in the social units.  It was not legal but they were not being pulled up on it.  I would challenge the State to tell me where the builder or developer was pulled up on that.  I knew of it happening on a wholesale basis.  It was mad.</p> <p> Even in the same development, the social and affordable units were not being built properly.  White deal was being used for skirting, doorframes and doors in the social and affordable units, whereas solid wood was being used in the ones to be sold privately.  It should not have been allowed, but why did it happen?  Nobody was watching; nobody was inspecting.  Nobody knew what was happening in the apartments.  We had an inspection rate of less than 15%.  Even then, the inspectors were so under-resourced and they had so much to inspect, they were not even going that far; that was way past what they were looking at.  They had bigger issues to look at as far as they were concerned.  There was no inspection of the material being used.</p> <p> The level of workmanship being applied was a different area again.  That also was not being inspected.  If one is concerned about the level of workmanship that goes into the building of an apartment or a house, it requires constant monitoring because otherwise one does not know what is happening.  Homebond used to inspect the foundations, wall plate and roof.  Did Homebond know about what happened in between?  It did not.  Its inspectors very rarely made it out for the three inspections.  So they knew bugger all about what was in the building.</p> <p> There are so many things that can be done cheaply in between.  The construction industry is a problematic industry.  The capacity for cheating is massive.  There is huge potential for saving money in many areas along the way.  Some people do it in order to save loads of money and there is nobody there to inspect them.  I would be a huge advocate of consistent on-site inspection.  Someone must be on-site all the time to ensure things are done right.  Even if we are going to adhere to minimum sizes here and there, we will still have the problem of doing things right.  We will still have the challenge of whether we are going to start doing local authority social housing well.</p> <p> I could bring people here to look at social housing in Turin and they would not believe what they would see.  It is better than how we do private housing here and it works very well.  I could bring them to some fantastic developments that work so well and are so good to rear families in.  It is magic.  We can learn from other people.  The Italians had toilets 2,000 years ago and we were swinging out of the trees 200 years ago.</p><p>We should not be afraid to learn from them.</p> <p> I am convinced that housing will remain a huge challenge for the next Government.  I do not see a serious appetite to deal with it.  We keep introducing measures do deal with various aspects of the problem but it is all sticking plaster stuff.  We must rethink the entire approach to housing.  I fully agree with the Central Bank's requirements on mortgages in terms of the 20% and 80% ratio.  That makes sense.  It will stop people buying property on which they might not be able to afford the repayments at a later stage.  However, it will mean that only 50% of people in this country will be able to afford to own their home.  The State must take up the slack and take responsibility for the sector.  We must provide housing.  The rental market is not the answer.  I am sorry but the rental market will not provide the solution to the vacuum.  I understand the Government&rsquo;s argument on rent supplement and the reason it is way below the rents being charged.  Of course it is.  If the rent supplement was dramatically increased there is a good chance rents would also increase.  The chances of the State being able to control the rental market is slim.  If the chances were slim a couple of years ago they will be slimmer in the future.</p> <p> We have seen a major shift in property ownership in this country.  When the developers ran into trouble a lot of property was put into NAMA.  A total of &euro;74.8 billion worth of par value assets went into NAMA, which became the biggest real estate body on the planet.  There was also a lot of property in other banks.  Most of it was sold in fire sales.  Ulster Bank sold property with a par value of more than &euro;5 billion to Cerberus for less than &euro;1 billion.  NAMA has sold more than 90% of the rental properties in this country to US investment funds.  That is a major change in the rental market.  All of a sudden Irish people do not own those rental properties.  I have heard people giving out and saying the problem is that Fine Gael backbenchers own properties and that is the cause of the problem with the market.  They are not the problem.  Someone owning a couple of properties and renting them out is not the problem.  There was nothing wrong with that.  Anyone that makes such an argument is living in cloud cuckoo land.  I am worried about the fact that the Minister for Finance is comfortable with having professional landlords in this country, be it Hines, Kennedy Wilson or whoever else.  They now have a cartel in our capital city and that is having a dramatic effect.</p> <p> I built apartments in Dominic Street.  The rent cost &euro;900 a month three years ago and now they are &euro;1,500.  This is a street in the city centre where people are afraid to walk when it is dark.  The reason for the high rent is that US vulture funds now control the bulk of the rental market in Dublin city and they are getting a hold on it in other cities.  Things will not change dramatically in the future because these buggers have bought up most of the good development sites that were among the stressed properties that were in trouble with the banks or ended up in NAMA.  The vulture funds have bought them up and are getting planning permission to build on the sites.  However, they will not sell the properties, they will rent them because this is a great city for rental income.  It costs a maximum of &euro;400 a month to rent an apartment in Turin and most Italian cities yet one can get &euro;1,500 a month in Dominic Street, a working class area where the lighting is not good enough at midnight.</p> <p> We have a serious problem.  The Minister for Finance might like professional landlords but I am not so keen on them.  Neither am I keen on the fact that we have outsourced our rental market to US vulture funds who have only one ambition, namely, to make the maximum money every year for their shareholders.</p></speech>

Section 28 of the Principal Act deals with ministerial guidelines for building standards.  Deputy Wallace has dealt with a number of those.  One of the problems we have and the reason we oppose section 3 is that we do not think concentrating more power in the hands of the Minister is the right move to make.  We discussed that on Second Stage.  The belief is that part of the Bill has its origin in the moves by Dublin City Council to have a higher standard than the minimum.  It has been under pressure for many years to change that situation.  My view is that the council was quite good in the stance it took.  Not only are we providing for increased ministerial input but there is no provision for democratic oversight.</p>  <p>  In amendment No. 1b we insert a provision that would subject any guidelines drawn up by the Minister to a vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is reasonable if the views of Members are to be taken into account on a critical area of concern.  In amendment No. 1a we set out minimum standards for apartments.  Deputy Wallace dealt with some of them.  They are not exhaustive but we see them as being basic, minimum standards for many different elements which should comprise a modern living space.  It will be necessary to draw up more detailed guidelines and while we wish to leave it open to local authorities to set higher standards we think it is only right that the national guidelines should be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny.  That is something that is very important and it is contained in amendment No. 1b in this group of amendments.</p>  <p>  The Minister is on record as saying that even if the Bill is passed we will still, supposedly, have the most generous minimum apartment standards in Europe, but we cannot say that for certain because we have not seen the guidelines yet and we do not know what they are.  The current national minimum guidelines might be generous compared to London, for example, but London is not a good benchmark given the problems families and others have trying to live in London.  I would not set up London as an example.  The reality is that our standards are miles behind other European cities.  For example, the minimum guideline size for a two-bedroom family apartment in Germany is 88 sq. m.  In the 2007 national guidelines, which it is unlikely the Minister will change all that much when he updates and publishes the new guidelines, the minimum size for a two-bedroom apartment is 73 sq. m, which is 15 sq. m less than the minimum in Germany.  That amount of space is the size of a living room in a family home.  That is the issue we are trying to address.</p>  <p>  I agree with the points made by Deputy Wallace.  We need a cultural shift in attitude to apartment living, but we are not going to get it if people are subjected to dog boxes in tiny spaces that are not suitable for family life.  Current planning is based on low density housing in the suburbs which contributes to climate change because people are forced to transport their children to access amenities and that is not a good way forward.  Apartment living can be good if it is done properly with the minimum standards we want to include such as decent, well insulated and sound-proofed large apartments with high ceilings that one does not bang one&rsquo;s head off when one goes in, where one has enough storage space in medium density blocks with some outside space.  That is the best way to raise a family but it is not the norm in this country.</p><p>It is the norm in Germany, Italy, Austria and elsewhere.  It allows for a concentration of amenities such as playgrounds, shops, post offices and restaurants.  Cycling and walking can be encouraged in that environment.  That is the way forward rather than what we have now where people are condemned to low density, suburban living, with a long commute, adding to our climate change and emission standards.<br/><br/>The problem we have is that 40% of all of Ireland's residential housing stock was built between 1991 and 2010.  That is the biggest proportion of new housing stock anywhere in Europe, with Spain coming second.  Given that very little construction has happened since 2007 when the new national guidelines were brought in, the majority of existing units were built in that period of explosive growth when the standard size was 55 sq. m for two-bedroom apartments.  I return to the point I made on Second Stage that we do not have full data on this area.  We believe there is a sufficient stock of small units, of small two-bedroom apartments and small two-bedroom houses, and that we need to consider building larger apartments.  That is what our amendments are geared towards because we believe that we have enough of the rest.<br/><br/>Ireland has the single greatest proportion of single family houses, relative to apartments, than anywhere in Europe.  Some 90% of our residential stock is made up of houses but only 10% of it comprises apartments.  By contrast, it is 40% in Germany and just under 35%.  We have an under-provision of apartments with a knock-on effect in terms of poor transport policy, energy efficiency and a spatial strategy.  What we are trying to do in these standards is to direct a new approach to a better type of living, which will provide a better quality of life and will be better in terms of meeting climate change obligations into which we must be linked.<br/><br/>Insulation in Ireland is laughably bad.  It is frightening and, combined with the dearth of apartment living, it means that Ireland has the greatest CO<sub>2</sub>emissions per useful floor area in its buildings by miles compared to the rest of Europe, including eastern Europe.  Irish buildings emit more than 120 kg of CO per sq. m.  By comparison, emissions in Italy are just over 40 kg of CO per sq. m while in Germany, emissions are around 65 kg per sq. m.  The average in Europe are 54 kg per sq. m, which in light of the discussions that took place in Paris last week are incredibly important.  To talk about more generous minimums, more storage space, bigger balconies and higher ceilings is not socialist utopia or anything like that, far from it.  We would say that Germany, which has had quite a right-wing government since 2005, would be horrified by the quality and style of accommodation that Irish people are expected to live in and by the dreadful state of our public transport network.  What we have is the legacy of a failure of successive Governments to stand up to the Construction Industry Federation and so on.  Some 2,700 ha of land across all the Dublin local authorities are zoned resident.  In the heart of the inner city, 60 ha are already zoned.  That is about 96 football pitches worth of land that is already zoned but nothing has happened on it.  We are trying to put better standards in place for such zoned land in order that we can have some quality, family-type living in the heart of the city centre.<br/><br/>I refer to the points Deputy Wallace made about real estate investment trusts, REITs and the role of NAMA in distorting the market.  What is happening is frightening.  It is not just the numbers of units that have been handed over to US vulture funds but the Irish Residential Properties REIT has become Ireland's largest landlord, acquiring 800 units from NAMA last year, and that group has decided to up the rents by 20%.  The same group is on the verge of acquiring 442 units from NAMA in Tallaght for &euro;83 million and 40 units in Terenure for &euro;12 million.  The annualised rents in these dwellings, which have 85% occupancy, are approximately &euro;5 million, so this group is already making money.  These units are being given over for a song and because of the scale and the size of these organisations, they are distorting the rental market, which is having an enormously negative impact on our citizens and leading to many of the problems all of us on all sides of House have to grapple with on a daily basis.  That is why we are putting forward this group of amendments.  We think it will put shape on development as we move forward, it will give some accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas, rather than just Minister <i>per se</i>and it will still allow the local authorities a certain leeway to build beyond the minimum standards.</p></speech>

The concern is that this Bill could become the planning and developers (amendment) Bill 2015.  Most people would agree that the quality of the units built during the boom was pretty poor.  I was in an apartment in my neck of the woods, the main living room of which was shaped like a banana, and when I sat on the couch in that room, the back of which was to one of the walls, my feet were able to touch the skirting board on the far side of the room, and I am of average height.  Work that one out.  That development unit was passed for planning because it had the required number of sq. ft. but the developer thought it was a good idea to shove in another apartment within the frame of the building, which is what was done, and it was rented out.  There is a funny side to it but it was anything but funny for the people who had to live in that apartment.  Such cramped living conditions affects people mental and physical health and it not good for children.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that my three amendments were ruled out of order and I  question why they were.  My amendments Nos. 2, 8 and 16 oppose the Government's amending of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and propose to amend that legislation by inserting other provisions that would have strengthened the provisions, as provided for in Part 5 of the 2000 Act, for social housing and provided safeguards against the use of substances that were not up to standard in the building of houses.  We know the importance of that in terms of pyrite and the other material that was found in Donegal.</p></speech>

I am disappointed at the arbitrary way in which those three amendments were ruled out of order.</p>  <p>  There is a concern is that will be a return to the development of shoe box size apartments.  Dublin City Council has set out guidelines-regulations for Dublin city and it uses the democratic power available to it.  However, this Bill will remove the democratic leeway that the council has had.  I am not sure that we should have a one size fits all model.  I support the building of good quality apartments.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, the amendment put forward by Deputy Wallace is good.  I would question the 45 sq. m size he proposes for a one-bedroom apartment.  I do not know if any Minister has lived in a 45 sq. m house or apartment but I did and it is not too nice.  The positive aspect of this amendment is that it recognises that if one has a family, one will need a two-bedroom apartment and the size set for it increases to 80 sq. m and for a three-bedroom apartment, the size is 100 sq. m, which would be the size of a standard three-bedroom semi-detached.  That is what we want.  It is important that other factors are taken into consideration in the amendment, including the storage area.  The Deputy is correct in that one does not have an attic in an apartment.  People need places to store bicycles and the basics that people use.</p><p>The balcony sizes are good because that is important.  I visited Rome a number of years ago and I was struck that people almost had small gardens growing on their balconies.  They had all sorts of plants and grapes growing on their balconies, which was amazing, whereas here people would be lucky to fit a flower pot on the window sill.</p> <p> I am concerned there will be a return to shoe box apartments.  Even if he says he will safeguard us against all this, the Minister of State might not be in office following the election.  The next fellow or lassie who takes over from him could want something completely different and if the Minister of the day is given all this power, we will have no way of stopping him or her.  We have witnessed that many times in this Chamber over the past five years.  When Opposition Members tried to put forward alternatives, we were listened to on few occasions.  The former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, listened to us on a few occasions and I have to give him credit for that-----</p></speech>

Ceiling height has an effect on people's psychology.  If one goes into one of the old cells in Long Kesh, for example - I recommend a visit because it is educational-----</p></speech>

The ceiling in a prison cell is much lower than in a house.  That was done to psychologically damage the prisoners but they failed in that.</p>  <p>  I have raised another important issue with the Minister of State and the previous Minister, Mr. Hogan, and I would like the senior officials who are present to come back to me on this.  There is an issue regarding the use of plaster slabs to separate apartments.  They have concrete floors of a specific thickness to separate each deck but I have visited apartments blocks, which I can take the officials to see, where studded partitions were used to divide the plaster slabs.  There are a number of problems with that.  The first is the lack of privacy as everything going on in the apartments either side can be heard.  What is happening in an apartment two doors down can even be heard.  If one is in No. 20, one can hear what is going on in No. 22.  It is not nice that families have no privacy whatsoever.  There is also a fire safety concern.  I raised this with the Department a number of years ago when I was a county councillor and it sent me a diagram outlining how safe the complex was and where the fire would go between the plaster slabs and so on.  I do not buy that.  I have not travelled the world that much but in the dozen or so countries I have visited, I have never entered an apartment where the party wall was hollow; they were all concrete.  We have to get away from hollow walls.  We cannot put people in apartments like this.  The least we can do is ensure they are separated by a minimum nine inch solid wall.  The Government has the power to push this legislation through this evening.  I am taking off my party hat and I ask the Minister of State to do the same.  More and more people will live in apartments in the future for the reasons outlined by the previous two speakers.  The population is increasing and we need to give people security, privacy and safety.  Plaster slabs are not safe because they are a fire risk.  Apartments currently do not afford privacy because every noise in the surrounding apartments can be heard and they are not secure.  I canvassed in an apartment complex in which the units were sold for big money.  One guy had a row with a fellow living in another apartment and he put his foot through the wall.  I was shocked when I saw this.  That is not conducive to proper living and the least we can do if people are forced to live in apartments is ensure they are separated by solid walls.  The Minister of State does not have to give me a complete response tonight but I would like him to come back on that.  I make that appeal sincerely.</p>  <p>  In former eastern bloc countries, apartments are large and they have large balconies but where groups of three or four blocks are sited together, they have play areas in between the towers.  Parents or whoever is minding the children can congregate there with the children but they also have parklands nearby.  Reference is often made to conditions in the Soviet Union and I was not a fan of the command economy but they thought through their planning and development policies.  In some areas, there were large parks where people could get fresh air.  Apartments in this State should be located in strategic zones with recreational areas, which provide two levels of recreation - small areas for children where parents can meet and play with the children and larger parks like the Phoenix Park.  Perhaps they should not be as big as that but I have seen huge parks near developments in eastern European countries.</p>  <p>  Significantly more apartments will be built in future.  Some of those constructed in the noughties were shocking and they need to be pulled down.  What developers got away with was nothing short of criminal.  They led officials and politicians by the nose and wrote the script.  They landed in helicopters accompanied by architects and engineers and anybody who opposed or questioned what they were doing was told he or she was anti-jobs.  That was a load of nonsense.  We are all pro-good jobs but we have to think about where people live because that affects them psychologically and this has been proven time and again.  While the Minister of State thought my reference to Long Kesh was funny, I mentioned it to illustrate that if people are living in confined spaces with low ceilings, they can be affected negatively by that.  Apartments do not need to have ceilings that are 10 ft. or 15 ft. high but they should be similar to that in a standard three-bedroom house.  The low ceiling height was deliberately planned by the boyos who designed the Kesh for a reason.  Let us not allow developers to build apartments with ceilings lower than the standard height of 8 ft. 6 in. and let us try to maintain that because people need breathing space.</p>  <p>  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

I had experience in this area in the 1980s.  I worked with ICC Bank and I was responsible for providing development finance to large house building groups such as Sisks, O'Malleys, Sorahans and so on and to those building apartment blocks in our cities.  Generally, the bank took a hands-on approach to what was happening.  One does not live in square metres or square feet; one lives in cubic feet.  Anywhere people live or spend a minimum of eights hours a day sleeping or looking after children is a cubic space.</p><p>Psychology studies have shown that children who grow up confined to low-ceilinged rooms with poor window aspect have lesser emotional and intellectual development than children who, for example, grow up in badly heated apartments.  It is very important for the human mind that one is not depressed or stunted, which is literally what happens when there is not sufficient ceiling height.  Developer-builders who added an extra four or six inches to the average height sold their apartments at better prices because when they were showcased, people thought there was a nice feel about them because they had good aspects and balconies.  When we were considering the financing possibilities for apartment developments, we looked at the plans - kicked the tyres as the Americans say - and looked at ceiling heights, materials, partitions and anything that physically made sense.  If one does things that make physical sense, financial well-being follows.  Deputy Wallace mentioned Dominick Street where rents are now at &euro;1,500 a month or &euro;18,000 a year.  That represents a huge portion of gross income, which the average wage could not handle, in particular before tax and USC are deducted.  For an investor, a 7% or 8% yield on &euro;18,000 a year would be &euro;270,000.  One arrives at the investment price by multiplying the annual rent by 15.  That is what people look for in cities around the world, such as Berlin.   </p> <p> I will try to connect a few other wheels and cogs on the position of the country.  Does the Minister of State remember what is in the drawer of Professor Phillip Lane, which was previously that of Professor Honohan?  There is &euro;25 billion outstanding of promissory bonds.  The big trick was to liquidate IBRC in February 2013, which Deputy Wallace is very familiar with.  The promissory note which was then about &euro;28 billion was converted into &euro;28 billion of promissory bonds long dated for 40 years.</p></speech>

That &euro;25 billion has a totally toxic and odious provenance - the losses of two banks forced on the Irish people.  Professor Honohan lost his temper with me and Stephen Donnelly at a meeting in July 2014.  Did Deputy Boyd Barrett attend that meeting or was it Luke "Ming" Flanagan?  It was former Deputy Flanagan.  At that meeting, I put it to Professor Honohan that in September 2008 the guarantee was entered into on false grounds, namely, the inaccurate and misleading balance sheets of the banks and overstated loan portfolios, which could have been determined at the time.  The guarantee was entered into under duress and the strong arm tactics of Olli Rehn, Klaus Masuch, and all those guys.  Does the Minister of State remember their names?  They are embossed on my mind.  The &euro;25 billion that stands today should be cancelled unilaterally and Mr. Draghi should be told it is done.</p></speech>

I have experience of this in the 1980s, which was a bad time to be building and developing.  We did it because we made physical sense of it with people who had experience - builders, developers, architects and quantity surveyors.  One should examine and line up one's ingredients and do it for the right reasons which means thinking long term and including storage, playground areas, access and bicycle spaces.  All of these things are needed.  One needs window outlets because people will live there through their lifecycle, from their single days through marriage or partnership and family.

If a building or a proposed development is not within a minimum proximity to public parks, the seaside, promenades and so on, then planning permission should not be granted.  Consideration must be given to the quality of life of residents.  When people are balanced in terms of their psychological and physical well-being, we have better communities and along with that comes generational support from grandparents through to grandchildren.  The planning stage of a development is crucial.  If we do not get that right, any mistakes made will be with us for up to 40 years.</p></speech>

These amendments relate to the standards applicable to apartment complexes, in particular.  An amendment was made to the Bill in the Seanad which allows the Minister to overrule the standards set by local authorities.  While I agree in part with some of the amendments proposed by Deputy Wallace, I do not agree 100% with them.</p>  <p>  Great care must be taken when setting standards or giving powers to a Minister to overrule a democratic institution.  I refer by way of example to the decisions taken in the past by Dublin City Council, none of which I was party to, to set a standard for apartments in Dublin, which was above that set by the Department.  I accept that some of the guidelines set by Dublin City Council were somewhat impractical.  The process of discussion within Dublin City Council on its current development plan, in terms of the number of submissions received from councillors and members of the public, would indicate that people, having looked again at that plan, are of the view that because of the restrictive regime within Dublin City Council, it is difficult to build apartment complexes of the type envisaged by those trying to ensure that apartment build in this city is fit for residential living rather than to meet the needs of the transient population to which Deputy Wallace referred.  </p>  <p>  If this city is to develop without sprawling into several other counties, we will have to address the need for apartments and ensure that whatever apartments are built in the future, lend themselves to successful apartment living.  A detailed document to which the city council was party, entitled Successful Apartment Living, set out a vision in this regard for Dublin.  In the development plan thereafter, particular areas were designated as suitable for high rise development while build in other areas was to be of only seven or eight storeys.  While not everybody in the city agreed with that vision, it set the standards for the apartments that would be built to facilitate modern expansion.  The planners and developers thought there was no end in sight.  It was possible to build in certain quarters apartment blocks, similar to those in other cities around the world, of up to 20 to 30 storeys.  The only thing wrong with that was that in Dublin until then anything that was being built did not have the additional services required, such as playgrounds, communal spaces, sufficient space between apartment blocks, proper access for traffic and a mix of communities.  They also did not include shops, restaurants and so on.</p>  <p>  Some of the apartment complexes built in Dublin in the past 20 to 30 years have been successful.  Somebody needs to examine why they were so successful and why they excelled when others did not.  In this regard, I refer to some of the apartment complexes with wooden frontage.  In most cases, these were disastrous because the wrong wood was used or because a management contract that would require the wood to be revarnished every year was not put in place.  What looked very fancy in the brochures produced to sell these products does not look so great now, including the ones in my own area, the wood on which has turned black and the walls have not been painted since they were built.  The council document, Successful Apartment Living, called for the setting of a standard that would meet the needs of single people, couples and retired people.</p>  <p>  As I came into the Chamber, the issue of ceiling height was being discussed.  As far as I am aware Irish people are, on average, taller now than people here were 30 years ago.  The ceilings in many of what were previously known as corporation houses are only 8 ft. high and the doorways are only 6 ft. high.  There are many young people in Ireland nowadays who are taller than 6 ft., such that they bang their heads of in these doorways as they are coming and going.  This needs to be examined.  The same can be said in regard to the population in Japan.  The height of the Japanese has increased substantially over the past 50 years, as a result of which Japan had to review its height standards.  If people are, on average, now 6 in. or 1 ft. taller, then accommodation proportions need to be different.</p>  <p>  The house in which I lived up to six years ago was a corporation house.  Like many other corporation houses and apartments in this city, it had major problems in terms of air circulation, which led to condensation.  It was not built to the standards now in place.  A ceiling that is 10 ft. high, which is the height of the ceiling in the house in which I now live, allows for greater circulation of air.  That is why people set standards.  They are not set to impose an additional burden on developers, although I would have no problem with that because developers will just add any additional cost to the selling price if needs be.  Standards are set to ensure that people can live in a manner appropriate to modern society.  In another era, we did not have many possessions.  In the 1930s and 1940s, people were happier to move from the tenements in Dublin city to council houses in Crumlin, Drimnagh and elsewhere.  They were a godsend to them in many ways.  The standards in place then fitted with the needs of people at that time.  We are now in a different era, so we have different needs.  There are many houses in areas such as Crumlin and Drimnagh that have not been upgraded since they were built, many of which have only one socket per room.  In terms of even minimum standards, a single socket per room or a wooden window frame with single glazing would not suffice in this day and age.  </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council sought to set standards that would stand the test of time for the next few years.  We know that the Department is not happy with those standards, that it considers them too restrictive and that it is fearful that other local authorities will be encouraged to set similar standards.</p><p>In many ways, they were not restrictive because most developers, if they wanted to build a house or an apartment block, could make money on it, even at today's prices or those of a number of years ago.  What happened, however, was that most developers wanted not only to make a profit on what they were currently building but also enough profit to make up the losses they had accumulated over the previous five to ten years.</p> <p> When considering giving a power to a Minister to dictate to, or overrule, a local authority, one needs to be mindful of why we have local authorities at all.  The local authority, through its development plan, already has to consider its standards every five years.  Every standard that is set is reviewable by the authority's elected members.  It is, therefore, reviewable by the public as they elect the councillors.  The public includes those who work in the construction industry and those who run it and they can make submissions and ask for changes to be made.  It is at that stage that Ministers should be involved rather than having the power to come in willy-nilly and impose their diktat on what they think is appropriate.  What might be appropriate in Tipperary or Galway may not be appropriate in Dublin city where there is a different outlook.  Dublin is a capital city with more than 1 million people concentrated in it, with the possibility that many more would be concentrated in it in the future.  One needs to be cognisant of that fact.  Standards have been set. </p> <p>  I find it strange that Dublin City Council encourages the possibility of high-rise development in certain areas but when developers submit plans for high-rise developments, they are shot down.  Developers are not getting planning permission for proposed houses.  It is for the planning authority in the city council to decide these applications but some of the decisions seem odd.  Dublin City Council put a plan to the Minister in respect of a senior citizen complex in my area.  The plan was for 75 apartments.  The Minister said it would have to be reduced to 65 apartments.  This is ridiculous in the middle of a housing crisis but councillors and the Minister who made the decision will have to live with the decision.  </p> <p> I have a major problem with a power being given to a Minister to set a standard, which may be irrational, in place of that which councillors have democratically debated and agreed.  Rather than taking this undemocratic stance and ramming this provision through, the Minister should have regard to the process each council completes in preparing its development plan.</p></speech>

It is particularly the case now but it is arguably the case at any time.  The issue is the provision of housing and putting roofs over the heads of our citizens.  It concerns the delivery of the volume of housing needed but also ensuring the housing is of a quality that will ensure a decent existence for our citizens living in those homes.  It should be self-evident but we have failed dramatically in this regard for at least 20 years at all sorts of different levels.  This failure played an enormous part in the economic crash we faced and the ensuing housing crisis, which is the worst one the State has ever seen.</p>  <p>  I wish to make one general comment, which relates to the fundamental flaw in the thinking behind this Bill.  What went wrong in the past 20 years - I put it roughly at 20 years but it may be slightly longer - in housing is that we fully privatised its provision.  The consequences have been utterly disastrous for the economy as a whole and particularly in terms of the provision of housing for those on low incomes.</p></speech>

The privatisation of housing has resulted in an enormous crisis.  The thinking behind this Bill is to say, in response, that we must dilute standards in order to incentivise private developers.  Standards are to be diluted and the Government is to be given the power to override local authorities attempting to uphold standards.  Talk about compounding a disastrous mistake.</p>  <p>  These amendments are an effort on behalf of Deputies Wallace and Daly to put in place some sort of minimum safeguards against this extraordinary folly on the part of the Government.  It was the market that got us to this point but the Minister seems to think we need to give more incentives to the market to get us out of this crisis.  The most likely scenario, however, is that the market will bring us right back round in the circle which brought us to this mess in the first place.</p>  <p>  I do not know if the Minister heard the comments by the delegates from NAMA at the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.749" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600055#CCC00600"><p>This is relevant to the amendment because we were talking about housing.  The delegates said that the pleas of the developers, claiming it is currently not viable to build housing anywhere in Ireland, are false.  The delegates said building houses is viable but the reason the developers are not building is the profit to be made is not enough for them.  In other words, the reason is greed.  The implication - in fact, it was pretty explicitly stated by Frank Daly - was that the developers are essentially holding the Government hostage in order to batter down standards so they can make an even bigger profit.  The Government has handed them the ammunition to do this by selling, via NAMA, vast amounts of property to vulture funds.  These vulture funds are now effectively holding the Government hostage in terms of housing.  This is happening to such an extent that they are now putting pressure on the Government to dilute housing standards.</p>  <p>  Frank Daly informed me that the vast majority of the existing 15,000 units NAMA took over and the development potential for 70,000 units - which is a huge number - has already been, or will be, transferred to these vulture funds.  Even then, they are still not happy.  They are so flipping greedy, they want to be able to build box apartments that are rubbish and are pressurising the Government to override standards. </p>  <p>  I have had some indication of what this is likely to mean in my area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One of the things mentioned in Deputies Daly's and Wallace's minimum standards concerns Ireland's emissions and climate obligations.  They are trying to ensure that we shall pay attention to these things when drawing up guidelines.</p><p>How eminently sensible is that?  In the last week or two, however, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has contacted D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and told it that the requirement for passive housing building standards, that is, good insulation which will be good for the occupants and also help us to meet our carbon emissions targets, must be deleted from the development plan because the developers do not like it.  It would cost them too much and they cannot make enough profit that way.  In the same week that the Government is trumpeting its commitment to dealing with climate change and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White is producing his white paper and declaring our commitment to the targets, it is also telling a local authority not to include passive home requirements in the building standards for houses that will be built in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That is what we are getting in reality.  All of the aspirations, whether on climate change or building standards, are sacrificed as the Government dances to the tune of the developers who got us into this mess.</p> <p> These amendments are a second line defence against what this Bill proposes and I support them for that reason.  However, the best protection we have in terms of building standards is democracy, to underline the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  What do I mean by that?  Who is better placed to decide what sort of standards should apply to the houses we build than the people who will live in them?  That is how one has good planning, development and building standards.  I know of some examples of this, one being the redevelopment of York Street in Dublin city centre.  In that case, progressive architects working for Dublin City Council worked with the residents in developing the plans for York Street.  They worked together on every single detail of the apartments, the play areas and the green areas and agreed balcony sizes, ceiling heights on so forth.  All of these aspects were discussed with the residents over a period of time so that they had a proper input into how the places they would live in and raise their families would look.  That is how one does good planning.  One certainly does not let the developers decide because they are only worried about how much profit they can make.  Furthermore, one does not let central Government, no matter how enlightened it might think it is, make these decisions either.  One puts democracy at the heart of the process.  Giving the Government power to override the little bit of democracy that we have is the opposite of what we should be doing.  We should be enhancing and expanding democracy at the local level to ensure that we have the highest possible standards.</p> <p> I wish to give another example of the cynicism and greed of developers in the context of building standards.  There is a development in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown which is half finished.  The Part V requirement was originally 20% but in the second phase of this development that will probably be reduced to 10%, although that is still unclear.  Those units will be leased back to the council, of course.  To discharge their obligation to provide 20% social housing, the developers, with the agreement of NAMA, put all of the social housing units in a north facing corner of the site.  The units were of a completely different quality and standard to those built on the rest of the site which were for sale on the private market.  They produced yellow pack housing for people on the social housing waiting list.  Will the Minister of State, in the context of the reduced the Part V requirement, guarantee that the 10% will not be hived off into the worst corner of development sites with lesser building standards than those applied to the other 90%?  Will the social housing units be genuinely mixed in to ensure the social mix which the Government claims to support?  Will the 10% be of the same quality as the other 90%?  To date, that has not been the experience.  Developers seek the cheapest way to discharge their commitment to provide social housing, which they really do not want to do because all they are interested in is money.  </p> <p> The fundamental problem here is that this Bill is driven by the belief that in order to deliver the housing we need, we must to dance to-----</p></speech>

It is saying that the State is not going to deliver social housing but will rely on the private sector to do so.  It is intent on incentivising private developers and removing any obstacles they claim are getting in the way of the delivery of that housing but all the developers are trying to do is figure out how they can profit from this exercise.  NAMA confirmed that today at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not just me who is saying this - NAMA confirmed it today.</p></speech>

We must acknowledge that the Government, in its efforts to address obvious deficiencies in our building standards has somewhat curtailed the flow of units onto the market.  I ask that the Minister of State would respond positively to the suggestions and proposals being put to him.  I am not suggesting that they be taken on board exactly as proposed but there is much merit in what has been said with regard to the size of units, particularly in the context of suiting various family forms and household types.</p>  <p>  In the context of its efforts to fast-track housing developments and make them available to the market as soon as possible, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the Minister retains absolute control and power over the building standards.  Those standards are extensively debated, scrutinised and analysed by local authorities and members of the public through the consultation process that follows the initial publication of any development plan.  There is much merit in that system and its virtues should not be lost through any proposals that emanate from this legislation.  In that context, I ask the Minister of State to take on board the suggestions that have been put to him and to acknowledge the good intent of the proposer and those members of the Opposition who are supportive of them.  I would ask that he consider making alterations which would address the deficiencies, whether minor or major.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State to investigate these matters, to make further proposals and to accept those amendments which were proposed in good faith and are based on the experience of people who have observed the process as it evolved over time.</p><p>In the course of development plans, councillors and Deputies alike have seen this process in train and they have seen the deficiencies as well as the merit involved.  There are standards that need to be addressed but these proposals definitely take cognisance of the form of family units these days.  Developments of apartments, in particular, should have standards in regard to the square footage applied and the number of units in the make-up of the various units within any complex in order to take cognisance of today's forms of living.  As Deputy Wallace said, there are many single people, and people who find themselves divorced or separated, who may have their children with them on a regular basis and need ample space within these complexes in order to live there in a proper manner.</p></speech>

It has touched on many aspects of the issue of housing and apartments, not only in terms of the standards and regulations that apply but also in regard to how they are financed, all of which are pertinent issues in the wider debate.</p>  <p>  Deputies regularly raise in this House their concerns regarding housing supply and the need to meet demand that, which is legitimate, and I have no issue surrounding that.  However, one of the obvious barriers to supply that we have identified is the whole issue of viability of construction and ability to buy and to rent.  Until the supply issue is addressed, many of the other issues will not be resolved.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right in one respect, namely, the State needs to build more social housing, which is why the Government is committed to doing that.  However, the Deputy does not even acknowledge that in his contribution.  I would respect him more if he acknowledged we are doing some building but he does not even mention it.  He is clouded in his cynicism and, while he is entitled to be cynical, his view is being clouded by the extreme view he takes.</p></speech>

We are doing that through the local authorities and through the affordable housing bodies.  The Deputy does not recognise that and, while he is entitled to take that view, I believe he is clouded in that respect.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of passive housing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I want to put on record that I do not hold any candle for the construction sector - none whatsoever.  I am in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to respond to the housing challenge that we all know is there at the moment.  I, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and our officials are using every avenue that is available to us to try to address the shortage of supply in housing and apartments throughout the country.  With specific regard to the direction issued to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in regard to passive housing, the existing building standards equal or exceed the energy efficiency performance of passive housing.  Passive housing is a brand, a commercial entity, that the Deputy is buying into and for which he is holding a candle, whether he realises it or not.  It is anti-competitive to impose a commercial brand or a standard across the board within a local authority jurisdiction.  What the Government is proposing is consistency of approach and a minimum standard for apartments across the country.</p>  <p>  I listened carefully to all of the contributions, especially that of Deputy Wallace because I know he has experience in this area.  I agree with a lot of what he said, although I do not often agree with him.  We need to be careful in this regard in that we need to distinguish between building standards and building control regulations.  The Government introduced building control regulations in a way that has never been seen before to ensure we have compliance in terms of good quality building in this country again.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that there is a role for the clerk of works.  I believe we have not gone far enough and, if I am back in this Department at any time in the future, I will work to ensure an enhanced role, first, for local authority inspections and, second, for onsite oversight, which is a job for the clerk of works.  The clerk of works should be on top of every stage of the development, from breaking the ground, to foundation, to construction, to completion.  If we are to learn anything, I believe it is that there is a role for the clerk of works.  This is something we should work on because it is the clerk of works who will identify those subcontractors and others who are trying to take shortcuts.  There is no place for that.</p>  <p>  The regulations introduced by the Government have moved a long way towards bringing accountability in terms of sign-off and certification, although I have no problem saying more needs to be done.  It is something I want to work on and I have already instructed Department officials to begin building capacity in terms of the local authority building control departments because they, like the planning and housing sections, were also denuded.  If we are to learn from the mistakes of the past, we need to bring up the capacity of those units through the addition of qualified people to inspect and ensure that buildings are being constructed in line with the regulations the people want and deserve.</p>  <p>  I would agree with Deputy Stanley's points on plaster slabs, sound-proofing, proper fire regulations and party walls.  The regulations have already been enhanced by the Government to ensure that sound-proofing and fire regulation and control is enhanced.</p></speech>

This has already been enhanced under the Government's regulations.</p>  <p>  To go back to the distinction between building standards and regulations, building control regulation is a debate for another day, although Members are right to raise the concern here and I have no issue with that.  This Bill, however, is about building standards and apartment sizes.  People are criticising the Government by saying we are bringing back shoe box housing but that is not correct.  Essentially, what the Government is doing is restating the 2007 guidelines for apartment sizes, which compare favourably with other jurisdictions.  Speakers mentioned the UK and Germany.  For a one-bedroom apartment, we are suggesting a minimum size of 45 sq. m, whereas the UK has a size of 39 sq. m and Germany has a size of 48 sq. m.  Therefore, we are well above the UK standard and, while it is slightly bigger in Germany, it is not a whole lot bigger.  For a two-bedroom apartment, the minimum standard proposed in Ireland is 73 sq. m, which is substantially higher than the UK, where the minimum standard is 61 sq. m, and slightly higher than Germany, where it is 70 sq. m.  Therefore, our guidelines compare quite favourably with other jurisdictions.  They are not shoe boxes; they are just a minimum standard that ensures a good standard of living and viability and affordability so we can deliver on those apartments.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to ceiling heights and, again, we compare favourably.  I am not sure about Long Kesh as I was never there and I never want to be there, to be honest.  However, I take Deputy Stanley's point about low ceilings and cubic space.</p>  <p>  The reason we are bringing forward these guidelines is to ensure we have a minimum standard that applies nationally and a consistent approach in terms of guidance to local authorities across the country.  That said, there is nothing preventing any developer or proposer from building larger apartments or having belts and braces or whatever they want.  What we are introducing here is a guideline of minimum standards, so we are not imposing unaffordable costs that will ultimately impact on the cost of buying or renting an apartment.  Viability and delivery of units has to be realistic and affordable and that is the fundamental basis for this Bill.</p>  <p>  For example, one of the guidelines we are issuing is that one lift would suffice for six to eight apartments rather than having one lift for every four apartments.  We believe that is reasonable and it would have a big impact on cost, so apartments are more viable for purchasers.</p><p>It is important we consider viability in the context of the guidelines we issue.</p> <p> On the proposed amendments, I have already referred to the minimum standards and sizes and to how we compare to the UK and Germany.  The Government opposes amendments Nos. 1a and 1b.  Amendment No. 1a proposes that the content of what would normally be included in guidelines issued by the Minister in regard to apartment standards should be put in primary legislation.  We do not agree with that.  Section 28 of the Act already empowers the Minister to issue guidelines to planning authorities regarding their functions under the Act, principally to have regard to these in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of local area development plans.  Under this provision, a comprehensive range of guidelines have issued to planning authorities.</p> <p> The Deputies are now suggesting that issues normally dealt with in guidelines, such as apartments sizes, floor to ceiling height, storage areas and private amenity spaces should now be specified in primary legislation.  This would not be appropriate or practical when these matters, which are generally quite technical in nature, are more properly addressed by way of ministerial guidance and the expertise of ministerial advisers to planning authorities.  The  amendment now proposed by the Deputies would also be quite Inflexible and onerous, as guidelines are often updated and any revision or updating of them would require changes to primary legislation.  We believe it is unworkable and that it is not appropriate to have technical guidelines issued in primary legislation.</p> <p> Amendment No. 1b proposes that all section 28 guidelines should be debated and voted on by both Houses in order to be approved.  Such a provision would run contrary to the existing section 28 provisions which empower the Minister of the day to issue guidance to planning authorities.  Certain planning regulations are already required under section 262 of the Planning Act to be presented to the Oireachtas to be the subject of a positive resolution by both Houses before they can be made by the Minister.  However, such an arrangement would not be appropriate in respect of guidelines, which as I have already outlined are generally quite technical in nature.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke about eroding the powers of elected members or the democratic mandate of councillors.  This Bill is not about doing that.  It is not about eroding the powers of elected councillors.  It is primarily aimed at ensuring all local authorities adopt a consistent and fair approach so that we do not have a situation where various approaches are applied throughout the country that would be unsustainable and could drive up the cost of the provision of houses or apartments as we all want to see increased provision, particularly where demand is most acute.</p> <p> The provisions of the Bill support the aim of revised apartment standard guidelines shortly to be introduced, which is to make apartments more economically viable for builders to build and more affordable for people to buy or rent.  Fundamentally, we cannot accept the amendments tabled.  We feel they are too prescriptive and binding for primary legislation.  Guidelines, based on the advice of senior departmental advisors are issued constantly to planning authorities by the Minister.  This Bill is about addressing the concerns Deputies have consistently raised here about the lack of and need for more housing and apartments to meet demand.  We feel the measures in this Bill will address some of the barriers and will not erode the minimum standards which compare well to those in other European jurisdictions.  We have good energy efficiency and building standards already that will not be eroded by measures proposed in the Bill.  Therefore, we oppose the amendments.</p></speech>

A flat concrete block with plaster on both sides will not necessarily pass the sound-proofing test, because a concrete block is only five Newton in strength, whereas a person building a wall uses 35 Newton concrete.  One can build a wall with double slabbing and insulation that will give better sound-proofing than a concrete block on the flat, but a concrete block on the flat is of course better.  This has nothing to do with the Bill, but the point I am making is that the regulations were not being applied.  If apartments have walls where the person next door can be heard, the building was not done right and was not tested.</p>  <p>  A wall of nine inch concrete blocks on the flat I built was tested in 2006, but it did not pass the sound-proofing test, although it had 20 mm of plaster on both sides of it.  I had to add an inch batten and another slab on both sides for it to pass the test.  That is how good the test is.  Following that, we only built nine inch solid concrete walls, with reinforced 35 Newton concrete.  That is the perfect job for fire and sound-proofing.  It is a brilliant job and the Government should apply that standard.  While it is expensive, it would be great if it was done everywhere.  It is the right way to build a party wall.</p>  <p>  Many issues have been raised here.  One of these relates to ceiling height.  The average ceiling height for a three-bedroomed house is 8 ft. and the same average applies to apartments.  My argument is that 8 ft. is not adequate for apartments, because apartments have a more feeling cramped than a house.  For example, apartments are either single or dual aspect, while a house is three or four.  There is a much greater sense of air and space in a house than in an apartment.  In Europe, 10 ft. or 11 ft. high ceilings are not abnormal.  Ceiling height I would use is 2.7 m which is just under 9 ft.  This would make an incredible difference and would not change the price significantly.</p>  <p>  I understand this presents a huge challenge to developers.  If a developer is allowed build four floors of apartments at a ceiling height of 2.4 m, and the slab is 300 mm, this means the height of the floor is 2.7 m.  Four such floors would give a total of 10.8 m, plus a roof.  If the Government decided all ceiling heights should be 9 ft., 2.7 m, it should give developers the extra air height and allow the development go a bit higher.  In the case of five floors, we are talking about going up an extra 1.5 m.  This makes sense because if a developer goes to a bank to seek backing for building an apartment complex with five floors at 8 ft. ceilings, but then goes to the local authority to seek permission for a 9 ft. ceiling and permission to go 1.2 m higher, but permission is refused, he is forced back to an 8 ft. ceiling because he will not have the finance otherwise.  The local authorities should give on that.  We do not build high enough in Dublin.</p>  <p>  In the early 1990s, we were building four floor blocks, a commercial ground floor with three residential floors above it.  Zoe built most of such blocks in the city centre at the time.  Then we increased to five floors and then six.  In European cities, ten floor blocks are quite regular.  As other Deputies have said, if we do not want to cover the country in concrete, we will have to move towards far more apartment living.  However, we must do it better.  These amendments seek to introduce minimum standards in order to ensure that and to guarantee future apartment building will be better.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has said our amendments are inflexible.  They are not minor amendments.  They are good standards and, therefore, can be inflexible for a long time.  If we want to build even bigger and higher apartment blocks in ten years' time, it will not be the end of the world if we have to go back to change the legislation.  These standards will be good for a long time and we will not have to go back and change them next year or the year after.  We could live with them for a long time.</p>  <p>  I believe if we want to build good living spaces in apartments, an extra foot in ceiling height is enormous and makes a bigger difference than anything else.  Apartments are cramped spaces to live in when ceilings are low.  This is something that is not felt in a house.  I do not see a demand for a greater ceiling height than 8 ft. for houses as important as it is for an apartment.  This is an issue the Government should think about.  It need not cost builders a fortune to achieve this, provided local authorities can live with the fact that the building will be higher overall.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about lifts and the provision of one lift for six or eight apartments with which I fully agree.  The notion there should be only four apartments for each lift is crazy.</p><p>It requires a good standard of lift and the lift company to stand over the fact that the lift can serve eight apartments.  I have zero problem with that.</p> <p> The Minister of State touched on on-site oversight, and we agree on that.  To move slightly away from the Bill, I have talked about how I expect only 50% of people in Ireland to live in their own properties in the years to come and about the fact that we will need much more local authority and social housing.  I disagree very strongly with the principle of selling social housing.</p></speech>

It is the wrong way to go and we should think about it.</p></speech>

The new regulations only identify somebody that can be sued and do not stop any of the bad practices.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made a point on how we compare with the rest of Europe but his information was slightly misleading.  I made the point that we should definitely not compare ourselves with Britain and London, where the standards are appalling.  Nobody wants to be benchmarked with them.  The Minister of State's information from Germany was slightly inaccurate; he quoted a 70 sq. m figure for a two-bed property but that is a for a two-person two-bed property.  The German standard for a family two-bedroom unit involving four persons is 88 sq. m.  In that sense, what we are proposing is not excessive relative to European standards and is very much in keeping with them.</p>  <p>  The bottom line is we are opposing section 3 because it concentrates too much power in the Minister's hands.  It is not a good way to go.  Removing the power of local authorities to set higher standards is dangerous.  Housing is a long-term game and leaving it to a Minister who may be here for one office term is not a good way to go about things.  We need more accountability, oversight and long-term thinking.  The idea is strategically good as the larger minimum sizes we propose are not excessive by any means.  They will stand to us.  Reports done in Britain around 1961 set the idea in principle that additional space is a longer term investment that will yield, apart from increased well-being, return on investment in terms of quality of living.</p>  <p>  With regard to power being centred in the Minister's hands, I will use the example of what is happening in Dublin's docklands when it is in the gift of a Minister to drive planning policy and achieve his own objectives without scrutiny or oversight from anybody else.  We can consider what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has called Dublin's Canary Wharf.  He has told NAMA to basically go ahead and build it, and it has complied.  Dublin's docklands has 22 ha. of undeveloped land, 75% of which is in the control of NAMA.  The Minister has spoken about this being a rare opportunity but what are we getting from it?  We are getting more office space than was previously envisaged, which itself is an amount already deemed to be too much.</p></speech>

Across the 22 ha., which is the size of 35 football pitches, there will be just 2,600 residential units, with only 260 for ordinary people as social housing units.  This is in an inner city development at the height of a housing crisis.  It is absolute lunacy.  We need democratic check and oversight, and that is why the provision to have the Oireachtas scrutinise the standards is really good.  We would all benefit from it, as we have from the discussion we have heard today.</p></speech>

The Minister of State might know this as he passes through it regularly, and he may be familiar with some of the sites.  Despite the collapse, construction has continued and a number of proposals have gone into Dublin City Council in recent years.  The vulture funds mentioned earlier do not have a problem complying with the existing rules, regulations and guidelines contained within the Dublin city development plans.  They are building at Clancy Barracks now as the plan was developed a number of years ago; it collapsed in the downturn when developers overextended but a company came in, bought it and is going ahead with it, regardless of price increases and the Minister of State's proposals to undermine the democratically elected councillors in this city who set out guidelines above the Department's guidelines.  There are a number of other examples, and I mentioned earlier a number of proposals from both private and public developers who wanted to go ahead but were prevented from doing so, sometimes because of Dublin City Council.  That was the case with the Davitt Road site, which is now in the ownership of the HSE.  The plan was to build duplexes on the site but Dublin City Council indicated that was not dense enough.  The developer felt it could make money from a site at low density but it was prevented from doing so by the city council planners.  That is their issue.</p>  <p>  There are other proposals that were prevented by the Minister only a number of months ago.  That had nothing to do with money as it was social housing.  The site I mentioned is Cornamona on Kylemore Road.  The city council sought to build 75 units for senior citizen accommodation on the Cornamona site but the Minister ordered the plan to be resubmitted as he wanted only 60 units.  That was absolute madness, and it happened within the guidelines currently set.  The site is empty but it is serviced.  It has been sitting there since before the downturn because buildings were knocked down.  The city council has waited for funding from the Minister.  The council has resubmitted the plan and the Minister agreed with it but it now involves lower number of units.  It is welcome to an extent, as it defeats the purpose when land is available.</p>  <p>  I am living in an area zoned for high-rise buildings on the Naas Road, as there are no houses within the industrial estates surrounding the likes of the Red Cow.  The Minister of State might recognise the area.  There are local area plans but there are no major objections to high-rise buildings.  When some of the developers submitted plans under the current guidelines, they were still not allowed to go above five storeys, which is crazy, as there are no problems involving local residents.  The zone is away from houses and builders want to make the best use of a site within current guidelines.  As Deputy Wallace stated, if a builder wants to go up a floor or a couple of floors, so be it, especially in areas designated as higher density by the democratically elected councillors.  It should be allowed.  We do not need somebody like the Minister of State or the Minister coming in and telling a city council that it cannot approve certain plans and that it must lower its standards.</p><p>We as a society should always seek to raise our standards, not lower them.</p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about England and Germany.  Just because it happens in England and Germany does not make it right.  In fact, we should go higher than them.  The other thing to bear in mind when referring to Germany is the fact that German family size is smaller than that of Ireland and has been so.  The Minister of State should bear that in mind when setting standards for two and three-bedroom apartments.  The standards for successful family living and successful apartment family living for Irish families mean that we need apartments that can contain not just two people and one child but two people and three or four children.  This relates to the guidelines set out by Deputy Wallace, which set out storage space.  Anybody who remembers the apartments, or flats as they were known, will remember that they all had pram sheds because Dublin City Council recognised years ago that there was a need for them.  The problem was that they had to be knocked down because they were used for the wrong purposes, or that is what the council felt.  In some cases, they could have changed them and made them more secure so that they would not be used for purposes they were not set up for.  That was a recognition even in those days when people did not have as many belongings that you need storage space.  People have far more belongings now.  Perhaps they will not have so many in 50 years' time.  We might have changed again.  As a result of changes in telecommunications, televisions are getting smaller and people do not have DVD players, VHS or Betamax.  People have fewer books because they have tablets so they might not have as many possessions in the future.  </p> <p> The Minister of State also argued that it would be madness to bring the guidelines back to this House but he did not even consider whether it might be appropriate to bring them back to the select committee and let it have a discussion once a year or once every ten years when these guidelines need to changed.  The Minister of State just ruled it out altogether and said it would not be appropriate.  He spoke about how councils and planning departments were denuded of staff.  Whose fault is that?  First, we have the lack of funding for local authorities and, second, both this and the previous Government had a jobs embargo, although this Government eventually changed it.  When people retired, they were not replaced.</p></speech>

If the Acting Chairman wishes to impose order, he should be in order.</p>  <p>  The clerk of works was also mentioned by the Minister of State.  He believed that it was a good point.  Why did he not introduce a relevant amendment in the Seanad?  He had an opportunity to do so.  He brought in the other amendments.  That would have been a more suitable amendment, would have been more respectful of the local authorities around the country and would have had a greater effect on housing standards in the future than what he is trying to do here.  It would have ensured that apartments in the future were liveable.  </p>  <p>  Whether he likes it or not, the Minister of State is eroding the democratic mandate councillors and the council are given by his suggestion that they are introducing or introduced guidelines that are impractical.  The fact that as we speak, Dublin City Council is taking on board some of the suggestions made by Deputy Wallace and the Minister of State about lifts shows that you can change and they are willing to listen.  This is being discussed at the moment yet the Minister has already taken the decision for them.  Why bother having a discussion around the development plan in any shape or form when the Minister is going to make the decision for them?  They should leave it and say the Minister is the representative on the planning SPC or whatever part of the city council takes the decision.</p>  <p>  What the Minister of State is trying to do is a disgrace.  I know he said he is not doing this for any developer and I would not suggest that he is.  I do not know him well enough and I do not know his background but I know exactly what the consequences of what he is doing will be.  It will facilitate developers in screwing people even more and taking more money out of a pot of land than they are currently able to take.  Every developer in this country can make a profit on the price of houses on the land on which they are sitting in this city.  There are plots of land around the city that could be built on and houses or apartments sold when they are built and those developers would still make money.  They just want more money and that has always been the case.  It was the case prior to the collapse.  If one looks at the price of houses and apartments in this city, particularly those for rent, one can see that all we are doing is adding to the future crisis.  It is cyclical in nature.  </p>  <p>  The amendments introduced by the Government from the Seanad represent a retrograde step.  I support the amendments we have been discussing here, particularly those from Deputy Wallace.  We need a reasonable set of standards that can be complied with rather than a diktat from a Minister and a Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600060#HHH01000"><p>I again thank the Deputies for this debate which is interesting, relevant and important.  I acknowledge that the amendments are made with good intentions.  I have no issue with that but Government considers it is important that we get the balance right.  We consider that minimum standards must be generous and they do compare quite well with other areas, as I have already stated.  We must also ensure that they are energy-efficient.  I remind Members that the Bill refers to minimum standards in guidelines.  There is nothing stopping any developer or local authority building an apartment that is far bigger and more complex in any way they wish.  What we are essentially setting here is a minimum standard that is affordable and efficient and can meet demand.</p>  <p>  The fundamental reason for the Bill is to ensure we have a mechanism whereby we can deliver more houses and apartments that are economically viable to meet the needs the same Deputies rightly identified.  I reiterate that I hold no candle for the construction industry.  It will now have to step up to the mark and prove that it can deliver the apartments and houses it says it can deliver.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly mentioned the issue of Dublin docklands earlier.  The planning provisions relating to Dublin docklands are being transferred back to Dublin City Council, which will have the same oversight in terms of planning.  That is the way it should be.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill 2015 is taking care of that.  It is only fair to note that 15,000 jobs are located in the docklands where previously there was nothing.  This is making a huge contribution not only to the national economy but to Dublin city as our capital.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace raised the issue of ceiling heights.  I know where he is coming from.  The guidelines we are proposing call for a minimum ceiling height of 2.7 m on the ground floor and a minimum ceiling height of 2.7 m in north-facing apartments because we want flexibility rather than the imposition of dual aspect.  Where an apartment is north facing, we will have the higher ceiling height so that there is more light and all other floors would have a ceiling height of 2.4 m.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace and other Deputies raise pertinent points about the height of buildings.  My understanding is that greater flexibility is being introduced in the Dublin city development plan that is currently being drafted and considered.  I feel there is scope for increased height in appropriate places.  My understanding is that apartments and offices will now have similar heights.  Where a footprint is available and where it is serviced in an urban area by public transport and all of the other utilities and services available, we should utilise that and utilise height as far as possible.  I have a proviso relating to that.</p>  <p>  I believe everybody would agree there are sensitive areas in our capital, in particular the Georgian areas.  People spoke about how we need to protect them and we do need to do so.  Imposing large-scale building developments on top of those areas needs to be sensitively treated.  Ultimately, that is a matter for the planning authority but I understand that greater flexibility is being introduced in terms of allowing the building of taller buildings so that we can have more buildings on the footprint in urban areas.</p><p> I welcome this debate.  It is important to continually review and evaluate our buildings and the standards we want to adopt.  There is nothing new in Ministers issuing guidelines.  It happens all the time but to prescribe them in primary legislation is not acceptable because it is too restrictive.  If guidelines have to be introduced to change those in any way in the future, we have to introduce new legislation.  We want minimum, good, efficient standards that meet the needs of our citizens and that deliver economically viable units which is what everybody wants to see.</p></speech>

That means the developer who buys the land and manages the construction will set the regulation.  He has the very minimum to work with and will then decide whether to make the apartments bigger, incorporate more ceiling height, storage space or a decent play area or just not bother.  He has only the minimum to confine him and I disagree with that.</p>  <p>  Developers and builders get kicked to death in here.  I know many builders and developers who did things right and were not prepared to do things wrong and cheat all the time.  It is the same as any trade where there are people who do things better than others.  Not everyone was a crook.  They were not all gangsters trying to do things badly.  If the Government creates a base level and no one will be obliged to go above it, saying people can build better if they feel like it is not the way forward because developers will build as they see fit just above the Government&rsquo;s minimum standards or just within them.  There will be no great incentive to do anything else.</p>  <p>  In respect of ceiling height, the regulation will be 2.7 m on the ground floor and only with a north-facing aspect.  That does not address the problem.  A minimum height of 2.7 m is needed in every apartment in Ireland.  It would be great if that was used in housing too but it is essential for apartment living if we want to build better spaces for families to live in.  We have to stop the notion that an apartment is only a place for people to live until they start a family and then they move to a house.  There will not be enough houses.  We will run out of grass to cover with housing.</p>  <p>  In recent legislation, the Government reduced the social affordable dimension in developments from 20% to 10%.  That makes it more financially viable for the developer and easier to finance.  It was not the worst move in the world but 10% social and 90% private in a development is not a sufficient mix.  We have had a huge problem with ghettoisation in Ireland.</p></speech>

It would be a very sensible way forward.  The standards need to be set for the entire country.  The point was made on Second Stage that there is too much diversity throughout the country.  If, however, we set these minimum standards in primary legislation they will work for the whole country and there will be a standard across the board.  These are workable.  The Minister of State might say that in the country it is not necessary to have such a high ceiling but it should be.  Why should it be any different?  It is cheaper to build in the countryside than in Dublin.  It is more expensive to build in Dublin than in any other part of Ireland.  That is a fact.  The idea of introducing legislation right across the board with really good standards would be a brilliant way forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.818" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1202" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600065#NNN00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  While I acknowledge that progress has been made on the national monument in Moore Street, in that , the buildings have been bought and there is a plan and funding in place, what has not been achieved is our ensuring that the buildings will be preserved in their context.  It is only when one visits the site and is taken through what was the battlefield that one appreciates the importance of the context.</p>  <p>  I remember how the events of 1966 were marked and there is no doubt there was a degree of triumphalism at the time, which was very understandable given that some of those who took part in the rising were still alive and would have been involved in shaping the event and making sure the legacy of the leaders was properly preserved.  I imagine the tone and content of the 2016 commemorations will be different.  I was in primary school at the time of the earlier commemoration and I remember such events as the renaming of the railway stations and streets, the pageantry and the parades.  I was perhaps more interested than most because my grandparents had taken part in the Rising and both of them were in the Four Courts garrison, therefore, it was a subject that was a constant among my family.  There is no doubt that 2016 will be different in both tone and content.  However, the children who are in primary school now and who will remember the 100th anniversary of the Rising in decades to come will all have markers in the same way as I did.  Some will be physical markers such as physical buildings, the museum in the GPO and the work in Kilmainham Jail are great examples, and the battlefield site such as Moore Street should be one of those markers.  I believe the context will be different in 2016.</p>  <p>  History is brought to life when it is in context and that is what is important here and that is why the wider battlefield site should be preserved. </p><p>I would like to read a quote which states:</p><blockquote>The O'Rahilly volunteered to lead the charge and he, together with twelve others, left the side door of the GPO and led his advance party under fire towards the junction of Henry Street and Moore Street as dusk fell.  On Moore Street, the column separated into two sections as they headed for the British barricade.  The O'Rahilly ordered the charge and dashed towards the barricade. British troops immediately replied with intense machinegun fire.  Most of the group took cover in the shop doorways.The O'Rahilly could hear British troops calling out his position and so he decided to make a final dash to safety across Moore Street into Sackville Lane (now O'Rahilly parade) on the far side of the street. As he made a run for it, more firing ensued and he was again struck down along with another volunteer Frank Shouldice.  He dragged himself into the lane and managed to prop himself up against a rear doorway of Kelly's shop at 25 Moore Street.He managed to write a last letter to his wife before slipping into unconsciousness.  A reproduction of the letter now adorns the wall of the building opposite the side of 25 Moore Street (on Sackville Lane - now O'Rahilly Parade) where he died.  Just as the Leaders signed their own death warrants when they signed the Proclamation, in leading the charge from the(GPO) the O'Rahilly showed the same courage when he faced almost certain death.</blockquote><p>This is not just a place, it is a place where real people and real events shaped our history.  That is part of the reason the preservation in Moore Street needs to go beyond the four buildings that make up the national monument.<br/><br/>The tone of 2016 commemorations need to be different.  We need to both look back, commemorate the events in the present and, just as importantly, look forward.  We need to capture the values that were outlined in the first democratic programme and build towards a real republic, look forward to the kind of republic we want to build, what the values should be that underpin it and what steps, we need to take to achieve that aim because it is not just sovereignty that the men and women of 1916 aspired to; it was an independent republic where our citizens are equal and where our aim is to ensure all our people can live a dignified life.<br/><br/>I refer back to my own experience in 1966 when I was in primary school in Goldenbridge, which was just across the road from Keogh Square in Inchicore.  The buildings were simply known locally as the barracks.  It was the old Richmond Gaol where those who were picked up in the surrender and, indeed, those who were subsequently rounded up were brought, and for most it is where they departed from for English prisons, including my own grandfather who was sent to Stafford Gaol and then on to Frongoch Interment Camp in Wales.  In 1966, the barracks was one of the last refuges for those, mostly families, who were homeless.Many of the windows had no glass, it was dirty and rat infested and poverty was endemic.  The girl who sat beside me in school lived with her family in the barracks.  While she was someone who carried herself with real dignity, there was no dignity about where she lived or how she lived.  It was such a terrible irony that such poverty and deprivation could have existed in this of all places.<br/><br/>The commemorations were happening with that backdrop.  Indeed, many of the city slums still stood in 1966 a stone's throw from O'Connell Street and the GPO.  Just as 1966 was a marker in time about our social development, so will 2016.  Surely 100 years after the Rising, the right to shelter should be a given. Surely that is one thing that should not mark the memories of primary school students in decades to come but it seems, unfortunately, it is destined to be for those who are currently experiencing homelessness, including many children.  My own observation of Keogh Square as a youngster was life shaping and it certainly shaped my political opinions and outlook.  It is part of why I find it totally unacceptable that the number of children who go to bed hungry is increasing and 140,000 children are living in deprivation in 2015, a number that has unfortunately doubled over the past five years.  A poor child has a greater chance of being a poor adult.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen.  The litmus test of cherishing all the children of the nation equally must be given real meaning.<br/><br/>The legacy of 2016 must capture many things.  First, the commemorations must be fitting.  Second, the opportunity to conserve important buildings and places must be taken.  The works on the Four Courts, the GPO and Kilmainham Gaol are good examples but the Moore Street battlefield site should be included.  Third, it will be essential that we take stock and use the opportunity to build towards the kind of republic that we have never managed to build but which I believe can ultimately be achieved.  Moore Street was a living street in 1916 and it can be again.  It can live comfortably with being a battlefield site that is both an historical site and a living street.  It will take a little imagination but we should not allow this opportunity to pass.  If people review the papers in 50 years' time and see that some of us aspired to have the site preserved in context, they will look back and wonder, if we do not take the opportunity now, what value we placed on the events of 1916.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600066#OOO00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to debate the commemorations of the 1916 Rising and I am glad to support the Government position on the legislation.  I am delighted that on 31 March 2015, to protect and conserve this national monument, the Government made a decision to purchase Nos. 14 to 17, Moore Street to preserve these buildings and in recognition of their historical importance in our nation's history and to safeguard them for the future as an historical landmark.  We have had many debates in the past, particularly among Members from Dublin, and there will be many in the future about how we commemorate the Rising.  It is an important time of reflection first and foremost.  It will give us an opportunity to look back on the journey our nation has taken from that incisive point in our history to date.  Many of the hallmarks of what has made us a great nation were personal sacrifice and, in the case of 1916, many paid the ultimate sacrifice with their own lives.  Nowadays, we are probably more individualistic in our outlook and, at times, the downside of that is we can be more self-serving but the general outlook of people at that time was very much motivated by the common good and a greater good not just for themselves but for future generations.  We owe a great deal to our founding fathers and those who came after them to carry on that tradition.</p>  <p>  When we reflect on contemporary issues facing us, global warming and climate change are topical at the moment.  We have to be bold and fierce in tackling this issue.  It will have an effect on us individually, on business, and on agriculture.  The way in which we face up to that at the times we are called on will be important.  The climate change debate is complex and not so straightforward because burdens, some financial, will be placed on people.  In the case of the carbon tax, we have to safeguard people from fuel poverty where they have no choice other than to burn fossil fuels because they cannot afford, for example, a different heating system or to buy an electric car.  We also have to safeguard business from the point of view of competitiveness.</p><p>Sometimes we forget about the common good and use the term too loosely because people are concerned about themselves.  I realise I am generalising but we have to get the focus back on many issues.  While it is right to strive towards excellence and debate citizens' rights in this House, bearing in mind we will never be perfect, we need more debate on individual responsibility now that we can do a lot more of what we like.  Oppression is a thing of the past; we are much freer than in the past.  There does not seem to be the same emphasis on debate about responsibility.    </p> <p> When I speak of the 2016 commemorations, I like to do so with reference to my county.  Most of the action during the Easter Rising did not occur in County Mayo.  The events took place in Dublin and yet it had a major impact on all of our lives and our country.  Mayo is the birthplace of two key figures who took part in the Rising - Major John MacBride of Westport, who was second in command of the Jacob's garrison and was executed for his part in the 1916 Rising, and Dr. Kathleen Lynn of Mullafarry near Killala, who was the chief medical officer in the Irish Citizen Army stationed at the City Hall garrison during the fighting.  We also had links to Padraig Pearse, Roger Casement and Eamon de Valera, all of whom studied at the Irish college in Tourmakeady to improve their Irish.  Tourmakeady is one of three Gaeltacht areas in Mayo.  </p> <p> Recently, someone who has more local knowledge than I informed me of another person to commemorate in Mayo.  The local commemoration group was not aware of the connection of Dr. Brigid Lyons Thornton to Mayo.  She was born in Roscommon but married a Mayo man, Captain Edward Thornton.  She tended to the wounded in the Four Courts during the Rising.  After that, her legacy is of fighting for underprivileged people and for what we would today call human rights.  She was incarcerated in Kilmainham jail and continued her medical studies and republican activities.  She was buried beside her husband in Toomore cemetery near Foxford in County Mayo in April 1987.  Her funeral had full military colours, her coffin was draped with the tricolour and a guard of honour formed by the western command fired a graveside salute.  We are only beginning to talk about our claim to Dr. Brigid Lyons Thornton and her great work and fight against injustice throughout her life, the seeds of which were sown around the time of the 1916 Rising.  </p> <p> I compliment the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and all parties involved in bringing the commemorations to places outside Dublin.  Mayo County Council, like every local authority, has put a programme together.  Mayo County Council holds the largest collection of artefacts related to the Rising outside of Dublin at the Clarke collection in Ballina, which was opened in 2013.  The collection was formed by Jackie Clarke, a visionary local man and former town councillor, and his son Peter.  When he died in 2000, he donated the materials to the county council to make them available to the public.  Those archives and artefacts are of considerable value.  It is a great tribute to him that his widow, the late Anne Clarke, who died recently, donated the collection to the State in accordance with his wishes.  The collection has great financial value and we look forward to having many commemorations there among unique artefacts that are not available elsewhere and to the idea of interfacing with schools and locals to bring the commemoration alive.  We will look back and there will be an examination of social and political history.  Sometimes when we see black and white images of people in poverty, we do not easily relate to them because they look different to how people look now.  We talk about poverty now but these people knew real poverty.  It was poverty of a different nature because they were impoverished financially, not culturally.  They are stories we can relate to because they go back to the theme of personal sacrifice.  </p> <p> It is particularly important to move forward.  I assume that is why it is called the 2016 commemoration and not the 1916 commemoration.  It allows us to look at where we are now as a society.  I often think of my grandparents and great-grandparents who worked hard to raise their families without the welfare system we have today.  They had ambitions for family and the family unit and community were strong.  In many ways, I feel the idea was to create a society where families and future generations would flourish and take responsibility for the country.  Their motivation was the common good.  </p> <p> In terms of involvement in arts and culture, there is a collaborative 2016 project under way involving the foremost arts venues in Mayo.  Ballina Arts Centre, the Linenhall Theatre, Customs House Studio, &Aacute;ras Inis Gluaire and Ballinglen Arts Foundation are coming together on a collaborative project which will focus particularly on Dr. Kathleen Lynn and her role in the 1916 Rising.  One thing of particular importance is that we are acknowledging and highlighting the role of women.  As is true in most of history, women are there but they never got the limelight or platform.  Dr. Kathleen Lynn is somebody we are particularly proud of.  She is from near where I come from and was the daughter of a Church of Ireland rector.  She was an important woman during the 1916 Rising.  The arts allows us to look at things in a modern setting.  The involvement of the arts means that we are not looking at it in a strictly historical way but are thinking outside the box in terms of the contributions made by people.  When the arts are used to break down prejudice or racism, it disarms people because the message or interpretation circumvents normal language and speaks in a way that is disarming and allows us to look at events with fresh eyes.  </p> <p> All of this in addition to the &euro;3 million funding package to support this extensive programme of local events planned for 2016 around the country is very welcome.  It is a once in a century moment in our country's history.  It is important that everybody gets to participate and that we reach out to our diaspora because 70 million people around the world claim some Irish connection or descent.  They are part of our nation, which extends way beyond these shores.  By marking these sometimes intangible concepts, we make them more tangible and speak to the civic spirit.  People are looking for an avenue of expression.</p><p>The body of work that has been done locally and nationally is very important.  I look forward to 2016 and a lot of conversation about our country in terms of the journey it has been on, the reality of that journey and the difficulties experienced in that regard, which are so often forgotten.  As we move forward, we must do so in a positive vein with great hope for the future of our country in terms of the legacy that has been given to us by our forefathers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600068#QQQ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject tonight.  I do not in any way doubt the motives of Fianna F&aacute;il in bringing this Bill forward.  It is right and proper that we commemorate those who died a century ago.  The Minister mentioned that the Bill as currently drafted is ill-conceived, that it is not well constructed and that it could potentially be unconstitutional in some respects.  For that reason, my colleagues and I on this side of the House will be opposing this Bill.</p><p>The Government is committed to commemorating the legacy of 100 years ago.  In this regard, it recently purchased 14-17 Moore Street.  We can expect to see the new commemorative centre opened there next year.  A new visitors centre will also be opened in the GPO.  These are two excellent new additions to the Dublin landscape that will be appreciated by residents of Dublin and visitors from outside the capital, including foreign visitors.  They are fitting tributes.</p><p>As a Deputy from outside the capital city, I wish to focus on two issues.  First, the Rising did not only happen in Dublin; it also happened outside the capital.  Second, as a nation we will be commemorating a series of historical events over the next few years, all of which reflect the maelstrom that existed in Ireland and the world in the 1910s.  In regard to the Rising having also taken place outside the capital, in my own county of Meath a battalion led by Thomas Ashe was ordered by P&aacute;draig Pearse to defend the area around Fairyhouse outside what is now known as Ratoath.  Following that, there was a major battle in Ashbourne during which the rebels in a six-hour battle captured arms and vehicles.  They only surrendered 24 hours after the Rising collapsed on the orders of P&aacute;draig Pearse.  Thomas Ashe is currently the subject of a plebiscite in Ashbourne in terms a proposal to rename Broadmeadow Street as Thomas Ashe Street after the leader of that rebel battalion.  A handful of residents in Broadmeadow Street will be voting on that this week.  We are looking at other ways of commemorating that the Rising also took place outside Dublin.  I have no doubt that next year there will be events in places like Ashbourne to commemorate those battles.</p><p>Other events took place 100 years ago that are not related to the Rising, for example, the involvement of people from Meath in the First World War.  I refer in particular to the poet, Francis Ledwidge, who, like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, was a war-time poet.  Sponsored by Lord Dunsany, he was a prolific poet by the time he signed up to fight in the First World War.  He did so because he thought it was unreasonable to expect others to defend the rights that he was taking for granted.  He fought in Gallipoli, which he survived but was wounded.  While recuperating in hospital in Manchester, he heard about the death of one of the leaders of the Rising, Thomas MacDonagh.  Many people who fought in the First World War did so because they saw it as their duty as nationalists to defend the rights of the free world that were under threat.  </p><p>Francis Ledwidge, although a fighter in the First World War, wrote a lament for Thomas MacDonagh, who was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, the first verse of which I would like to read into the record.  It states:</p><blockquote>He shall not hear the bittern cry<br /><br />In the wild sky, where he is lain,<br /><br />Nor voices of the sweeter birds,<br /><br />Above the wailing of the rain.</blockquote><p>Many people will remember that from their days at school.  I was delighted that Deputy Quinn, during his tenure as Minister for Education and Skills, put Francis Ledwidge back on the leaving certificate course.  It is a fitting tribute, bearing in mind the upcoming commemorations.  Francis Ledwidge lost his life at the Third Battle of Ypres and is buried at Passchendaele.  Although he never returned home to Meath, he is remembered.  Last week, I attended the launch of a CD of his works in the village of Slane.  Yesterday, it was announced that a commemorative stamp will be issued on the centenary of his death in 1917 to reflect the role he played not only as one of Ireland's leading war time poets, but as one of Ireland's leading poets of the last century.  It is worth while remembering individuals who played such a major role in shaping the Ireland we now live in and enjoy.  The purpose of these commemorative events, such as the Easter Rising commemorative centre and the new visitors centre in the GPO, is to ensure that the next generation do not forget where they came from.  It is important the next generation learns about the sacrifices made by others to ensure they could enjoy the rights available to them in this country.  It is vital and imperative that we remember that.  For that reason, I am delighted that the Government is spending so much time and effort ensuring that a range of centenaries are commemorated and are given the respect they deserve.</p><p>While I accept the motives behind this Bill, I am unable to support it for the reasons I outlined earlier. </p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; ag pl&eacute; le gn&oacute;tha&iacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; reachta&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Rialtas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag pl&eacute; le h-athch&oacute;iri&uacute; ar Moore Street agus ar an GPO agus ar fhoirgnimh cos&uacute;il le Boland's Mill, South Dublin Union n&oacute; Ospid&eacute;al Naomh Sh&eacute;amais, an sean monarcha Jacob's, an Royal College of Surgeons, Mount Street agus foirgnimh eile.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh athch&oacute;iri&uacute; i l&aacute;r Chathair Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath freisin.</p>  <p>  In welcoming this Bill, I re-emphasise the need for identification of all of the sites associated with the Easter Rising and, as outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the need for a freedom trail and a lasting investment in our history and heritage.  We all know there are opportunities to view the history and heritage of Dublin, whether by way of bus or a Viking tour.  However, as suggested in the Bill, there is a need for investment by the development company in these areas.  It is important these places are safeguarded and given the recognition they deserve.</p><p>The discussion on this Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss the preservation of all the locations where Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizens Army fought.</p> <p> I commend RTE on its programme, "Ireland's Rising", in particular, the commemoration of 1916 outlined by the presenter, Mr. Ryan Tubridy.  He said, on visiting Galway, that it was like going home for him.  He met people who had connections with the Rising.  I am glad that Galway County Council has a programme that involves consultation and partnership with the communities of the county, including community consultation and workshops in Tuam, Oughterard, Loughrea agus sa Cheathr&uacute; Rua.  Galway is the county of birth of &Eacute;amonn Ceannt, who was from Ballymoe, and Connemara was the summer destination of P&aacute;draig Pearse.  One of the largest forces of Irish Volunteers mobilised and fought for Irish independence in County Galway and there was a lot of emphasis in "Ireland's Rising" on west Galway.  There were traces of a freedom trail in west Galway, in particular around Ros Muc, where P&aacute;draig Pearse had his school.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's freedom trail idea is something that could be replicated in every part of Ireland, in particular in Galway given its rich 1916 history.  </p> <p> I am disappointed that there has been very little reference to the buildings around Moore Street, both those the Government has already dealt with and others, on RTE radio and television and in the print media.  The Moore Street traders have fought their cause for a long time.  We saw reports on the role of the leaders in the print media and there was much reference to the GAA and its role in 1916 and afterwards and the Gaelic League and its role.  The buildings, however, have gotten very little attention and I am glad Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has brought the issue forward through this Bill and we are talking about not only the Moore Street buildings but buildings in other areas of Dublin and across Ireland.  </p> <p> A number of buildings in east Galway and other places were visited by Ryan Tubridy and mentioned in the programme.  These included Killeeneen, Clarinbridge, Athenry, Moyode, Lime Park and Craughwell.  Commemorations are planned in Moyode next April and at the Mellows monument in March.  Easter Monday there will be a commemoration in Athenry and next May there will be one in Kilbeacanty.  These are areas many tourists would like to visit and local authorities, relatives and other stakeholders should be involved.  </p></speech>

I thank my colleague, sitting here beside me, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is the chairman of the Fianna F&aacute;il commemoration committee of the events of 1916, for producing this legislation for debate last night and tonight.  I also acknowledge the work of my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, for introducing it in the Seanad.  More especially, I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il group in Dublin local authorities who have worked together to bring the legislation forward.  They did most of the work because they are most intimately involved.  They represent Dublin city and the surrounding areas and they understand better than most the need for regeneration in the area.</p>  <p>  Our Bill aims to redevelop the national monument at Moore Street and designate the surrounding areas an historic quarter.  The 1916 Quarter Development Bill will establish an urban development company tasked with delivering urban regeneration in the area.  Most people will be familiar with the tremendous work carried out in the Temple Bar area.  If it can happen on one side of the Liffey, there is no reason the same cannot happen on the north side of the Liffey in the Moore Street and surrounding areas, including the GPO.</p>  <p>  I want to thank, in particular, the Save 16 Moore Street committee and acknowledge their work and continual involvement.  It is not today, yesterday, last year or the year before that those in the committee got involved.  I can testify that they have been involved for at least a decade and should be supported in their work.  They had a vision in this regard before people even realised we were coming up to the centenary celebrations.  </p>  <p>  The Bill is very detailed and I wish to deal with the specifics but I want to first put on the record the area it concerns.  Some people are not quite sure when we talk about a quarter what exactly it means.  Is it a quarter of the city, a little section or a quarter of a street?  Schedule 1 to the Bill describes the 1916 quarter area as: "That part of Dublin 1 including the building known as the General Post Office, O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin 1 and its auxiliary lanes adjacent to that building; the street known as Moore Street and auxiliary lanes adjacent to Moore Street; other buildings and locations and their auxiliary roads and lanes in the city of Dublin which were occupied by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army during Easter week, 1916 as prescribed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through statutory instrument."</p>  <p>  We are not dealing with Moore Street alone.  We are including the GPO, surrounding lanes, back streets and buildings in the area.  Lest some people think we are just talking about four specific houses in Moore Street, it is much broader than that.  This probably reflects the central difference between our approach and the Government's narrow, haphazard approach.  When we were in government, we declared the area a national monument.  I know the Government purchased the four houses having been pressurised to do so and we welcome that fact.  However, the Government seems to be very narrowly focused and does not seem to see the bigger picture.  I encourage it to do so. </p>  <p>  Some people on the Government side mentioned here tonight that they agreed with the sentiments behind the Bill but not the principles enshrined in it.  I have a direct question for the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan.  Does she agree with the principle of powers of compulsory purchase being vested in these companies?  This is a very important proposal.  If the Government does not agree with powers of compulsory purchase in this legislation, nothing will ever happen.  Developers are there to make money.  Shopping centres and developments are and have been proposed for the area.  Shops do what shops do, which is sell whatever knick knack they feel will turn a buck.</p>  <p>  If the Government is happy for that approach to continue, will it please say so?  However, if it accepts the principle of having powers of compulsory purchase as provided for in this Bill, the Government should let it go to Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage, all the difficulties and issues with the Bill people have mentioned can be teased out in detailed discussion.  It can then come back to Report and Final Stages here in the D&aacute;il.  If the Government does not agree with the principles in the Bill, I hope it will be honest enough to say what it is proposing in its place because there is a clear and concrete proposal in this Bill.  </p>  <p>  It is fitting that the last private Members' debate of the D&aacute;il this year, before we enter 2016, should be devoted to the commemoration of 1916 in a meaningful way.  It should not be the small effort proposed by the Government.  The commemoration is bigger than that.  There is probably a parallel between the approach being taken by some people in this regard and what happened in 1916.  A small group of people were involved then and people said they did not have widespread support.  Some 100 years on, there is a bit of that resonating through this debate and the comments of various people because the Government wants to narrow the focus.  </p>  <p>  I was very pleased, during the term of the last Oireachtas, from 2007 to 2011, to be Chairman of the environment committee.</p><p>We were invited by the Save 16 Moore Street committee to see the site.  I met a number of my colleagues at the Spire.  We then crossed to the General Post Office and were brought on a guided tour.  We walked the streets and back lanes of the area, were shown bullet marks in walls and given the full history and background of what happened at various points along the way.  We were shown where the various leaders came and went, where lookout posts were stationed and so forth.  It was a tremendously educational day.  We were finally brought to Moore Street and  those of us who would not have been on that street on a regular basis were genuinely disappointed to see the state of the buildings. We were shocked.  I was mortified when I looked at the facades of some of the shops on the street and thought to myself that no self respecting capital city in the world would allow buildings of such historic significance to fall into such disrepair.  I am delighted the site was declared a national monument subsequently.  I would also like to thank the aforementioned committee which provided us with a video showing how the redeveloped site would look.  </p> <p> It has been suggested that there were up to 3,000 participants in the Easter Rising but I do not know the exact number.  There has been much favourable coverage and treatment of the events of 1916.  I was particularly impressed by the work of Joe Duffy which made the events very human and brought them home to ordinary people.  Importantly, it showed the levels of poverty that existed at the time.  Joe Duffy, in his book and his work on RTE concentrated specifically on the children who died, some of whom were shot accidentally or caught in the crossfire.  It was a very human story and revealed the real horror of what happened in Easter week in 1916.</p> <p> We must acknowledge that these are the buildings that the leaders of the Rising ended up in and No. 16 was the building from which they surrendered.  Subsequently, many of them were executed but that was not the end of it.  In fact, that was the beginning.  By any standards the Easter Rising, notwithstanding the execution of the leaders, was an outstanding success and the proof of that is that 100 years on, we are here in our national Parliament discussing how to commemorate it.  The 1918 general election gave a democratic mandate to the Rising, which it did not have in advance.  The people of Ireland voted accordingly when they got an opportunity, which must be recognised.  </p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention the Laois connection with the 1916 Rising.  Most Members who have spoken already have been keen to emphasise that it did not all happen in Dublin and that there was involvement from other counties.  I have been in this House for quite some time but have said only once before that a significant event of the Rising took place in Laois in an area known as Clonad, just outside Portlaoise on Easter Sunday.  It happened on what would be known as the old Portlaoise to Abbeyleix road or the main Dublin to Cork road until it was bypassed recently.  In the run up to Easter week, a group of Volunteers were given orders by P&aacute;draig Pearse to go to the railway line outside Portlaoise and take up the tracks.  The purpose of this exercise was to prevent British military reinforcements being sent from Waterford to Dublin to put down the Rising.  The aim was to derail any train that used the route.  The Volunteers headed out very early on Sunday morning and hid out in the woods for the day.  They did not know about the countermanding order because they did not see the daily newspapers that day.  They proceeded to do their business on Sunday night and took up the railway tracks.  The railway company became aware that an incident had occurred and sent out a train with several employees to check the line.  That train was derailed when it reached the spot.  A ruckus ensued and several shots were fired by the Volunteers.  Many people in Laois would maintain, with justification, that these were the first shots of the 1916 Rising, fired as part of the effort to prevent reinforcements travelling from Waterford to Dublin to put down the Rising.  That event was an outstanding success and I mention it because the officer in command was my uncle, Eamon Fleming who was accompanied by another uncle of mine, Patrick Fleming.  The group of Volunteers included about 16 men and three women.  Thus there is a direct link between myself and the events of 1916.  </p> <p> Approximately ten years ago a 1916 commemoration committee was established in County Laois and it has erected a substantial monument at the site in question to commemorate that event.  The names of all of those involved are engraved on the monument, as are the words of the Proclamation.  I was fortunate to be asked to chair that committee in recent times and have been happy to do so.  However, it is the other committee members who have done all of the work.  The biggest project undertaken by the committee this year was the production of a film to commemorate and re-enact the events that happened at Clonad on Easter weekend, 1916.  The film is called Mother because most of the Volunteers were single young men and women in their early 20s whose mothers were fearful for them as they went out on that fateful day.  During the course of this summer filming took place at a number of locations where the event was re-enacted and the local community was heavily involved.  The film crew and actors involved were put up in people's private houses throughout the county.  There was tremendous good spirit shown by all of those involved.  The film will be ready in early 2016.  I must also thank all of those who were involved in the voluntary fund raising efforts and Laois County Council for the grant it provided to the project.  The council, like many other local authorities, has a substantial programme of events planned for 2016.  </p> <p> I wanted to put the involvement of Laois on the record of the House.  Members from other counties will do the same and it is right that the people of Ireland be made aware that the events were well spread out.  I wanted to emphasise, in particular, my own family history.  It is not something about which I blow my trumpet too often but it would be wrong to let this occasion pass without acknowledging the role played by members of my family.</p> <p> I must stress that No. 16 Moore Street was the last headquarters of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic during the 1916 Rising.  The Volunteers moved through various back lanes and side streets to get to that building from which they ultimately surrendered.  The loss of their lives through execution was not in vain, however.  It brought forward our independence and now, 100 years on, we are celebrating their great work.  As a true Irishman I must say that I hope to see the complete reunification of the 32 counties of Ireland by peaceful means in my lifetime.</p></speech>

As my colleague Deputy Fleming has said, it is appropriate that we are discussing this Bill on the eve of 2016.  This is the last Private Member's Bill to be put before the D&aacute;il in this session.  I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the work he has done in preparing the Bill in consultation with the many interested parties and groups who have worked for many years to build an awareness and to generate a momentum behind properly commemorating those people who did so much to give us the freedom we enjoy.</p>  <p>  Last night, in a very wide ranging and illuminating contribution, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about the fact that the events of 1916 happened in an era when the British Empire dominated the world.  A small group of people took a stand at that time, emboldening public opinion in favour of the establishment of an independent nation.  </p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the theme of the First D&aacute;il, the exactitude that was pursued in establishing it and, subsequently, the different political systems and structures that were put in place, which have stood the test of time despite various challenges and difficulties over the years.</p> <p> It was on the discussion of a similar motion in the Seanad that I heard Senator Paschal Mooney refer to Springfield, Illinois, where President Lincoln was born.  A particular area of the city was developed in commemoration of its famous son, with structures and buildings proper to the commemoration of a famous world statesman.  Senator Mooney also made the valid point that, as well as commemorating an iconic figure in politics, it was a huge tourist attraction and brought many visitors to that city.  The Bill before us is not just about bringing visitors to Dublin city.  It is about a proper commemoration, but the positives downstream from that are a rejuvenation of part of the city and the economic activity that flows from that.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il party, has put forward the Bill and I am disappointed the Government seems to be opposing it.  The Bill goes much further than the current legislation designed to refurbish and restore the Moore Street area.  What the Fianna F&aacute;il Party wants is to create a 1916 historical quarter in Dublin city which will encompass not only the GPO and Moore Street but also other key locations which were linked to the 1916 Easter Rising, such as Boland's Mills, the South Dublin Union, which we now know as St. James's Hospital, the old Jacobs factory and the Royal College of Surgeons, to name but a few of the different locations that should be restored and included in a commemorative trail.  Eventually, we would like to see the preservation of all of the locations where Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army fought during Easter week.</p> <p> The Bill provides for the establishment of an urban development company which would oversee the creation of the 1916 historical quarter to ensure that areas of historical significance are given the prominence they deserve.  Beginning with the GPO and the Moore Street area, the development company would undertake major regeneration and restoration works in and around Dublin city centre, which would not only serve to market an important event in Ireland history, but would also breathe life back into areas which have fallen into disrepair.  That would be one of the many positive features that could emanate from the State going about this development in the proper way.</p> <p> As a Parliament and as a country, we should want to create a city that respects and preserves its history, while at the same time rejuvenating those areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for the establishment of a freedom trail, to which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred last night, to clearly identify all of the sites associated with the Easter Rising.</p> <p> Deputy Fleming referred to the different commemorative programmes that are being put in place, mainly through the work of the local authorities.  I attended a number of events in Cavan where we sought to bring together people who were interested in this project.  In Cavan and Monaghan great work has been done in putting together good, ambitious, practical and inclusive programmes.  Deputy Seamus Kirk and our former D&aacute;il colleague, Rory O'Hanlon, have been very active in Louth and south Monaghan in running a series of commemorative events and lectures to highlight and commemorate that period.</p></speech>

The establishment of a Temple Bar-style company to create an develop a fitting historic quarter is a very sensible one.  After all, the birth of our Republic has deep roots in the Moore Street area of Dublin.  It is estimated that as many as 300 volunteers and members of Cumman na mBan escaped to the buildings from the GPO when it caught fire and was attacked by the garrison forces in the city at the time.  We can safely state that future generations will not thank us if Moore Street is not properly preserved.</p>  <p>  We need the structure and the legal empowerment of an agency with the responsibility to acquire properties and initiate the developments that would be appropriate for what will become, in those circumstances, a very important and historic part of the city of Dublin.  It will become a focal point for tourists, tour groups and historians who wish to take historic tours in the country.  Given the obvious publicity attending the various commemorations that have been organised around the country in the lead-in to Easter 2016, there will be an intensification of focus and interest in it.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned, as part of the 1916 commemorations and the lead-in to 2016, we have been organising various lectures across the north east in places like Carrickmacross, Newry, Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Dunleer.  What has struck me is the huge public interest and the attendances at these lectures.  Bearing in mind the five or six that have been held to date, we might expect that maintaining momentum and interest would be challenging, but it is growing with the passage of time.</p>  <p>  The first lecture was held in Ardee and we had the honour and pleasure of the presence of the great-grand-niece of Eamonn Ceannt, who attended school in the town of Ardee.  He was born in Ballymoe in County Galway and his father was an RIC officer who was posted on promotion first to Drogheda and then to Ardee.  He attended school in Ardee and the people of the town and locality are particularly proud of the fact a signatory of the Proclamation served mass and attended school in the town.  There was an overflow attendance at that lecture.  Indeed, the lady in question, Ms Mary Gallagher, will be returning to Ardee.  It is believed Eamonn Ceannt spent a period of time at school in Drogheda as well, so it is an opportunity for the people of the north east, particularly the people of the two towns of Ardee and Drogheda, to commemorate the fact a signatory of the Proclamation had his formative years in the county.</p>  <p>  If anybody has the opportunity to read a profile of the man, they could not but be struck by his academic and intellectual capacity.  It was measure of the type of individuals who were involved with the Rising.  They could think strategically, they had a vision for the future of the country and, more importantly, they had the absolute commitment to implement the plan and see it through.  It is people like Eamonn Ceannt and the many others involved in the Rising who have done so much to lay the foundations of the Republic we have today.</p>  <p>  It is with pleasure that I support the Bill moved by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I appeal to the Government to give very serious consideration to the proposals contained therein and to accede to the request of a great number of people in the country at this time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.834" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600071#TTT00300"><p>I thank the House for the opportunity to reply to some of the contributions made on this Private Members' Bill.  I have listened carefully to the proponents of the Bill and have noted that the main concerns appear to be the importance of the Rising to the history of our State, together with the importance of commemorating it appropriately, as well as extending the preservation and conservation works beyond the national monument in Dublin's Moore Street.</p><p>The justified significance and importance of the Easter Rising are not lost on the Government.  As Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, indicated last night, the Government is taking a number of positive initiatives to commemorate the event and to build fitting tributes to the 1916 leaders and the sacrifice they made on our behalf.  As many Deputies, particularly Deputy Mulherin, pointed out, every community in the country will get an opportunity to take part in the commemoration and celebration of our history in a mature way.</p> <p> In respect of the buildings at numbers 14 to 17 Moore Street, the Government has acquired the national monument and work has commenced to pave the way for a commemorative centre.  This will be a fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders and is an important element of the 2016 centenary programme.  This project will enable people to step back in time and experience the building as it was when the 1916 leaders held their last council of war there.  They will be able to see the rooms the leaders were in and view the passages they broke through.  The centre will be a significant addition to the many other major projects being developed as part of the commemorations.  Unlike other adjacent properties, these buildings also retain significant and extensive internal 18th century elements, including staircases, partitions, plasterwork, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  The form and profile of the 18th century buildings.  Most importantly, we will also have the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents, in the form of the openings broken through party walls.</p> <p> With regard to the "laneways of history", I wish to make the following points.  Under the planning permission given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2010, Moore Street will continue as an open street, as part of the wider development plans for the area.  Henry Place, Moore Lane and O'Rahilly Parade are also to be retained.  Before any development takes place, a detailed project proposal must be submitted to Dublin City Council, in which the historic significance of the central locations along the evacuation route from the GPO are featured and interpreted.  It will be up to Dublin City Council to consider these matters in due course.</p> <p> On the question of whether the whole terrace should be saved, I would point out that most of the other buildings on Moore Street have been altered extensively since 1916 and they retain little of the historic fabric and character of the time.  A number of other buildings on Moore Street date from after 1916.  The Government would like to see the wider street appropriately developed and I understand Dublin City Council is progressing plans in this regard.  However, the responsibility of the Government is for the national monument and we are pleased with the work under way to preserve it and to develop a commemorative centre that will be a major visitor attraction for Dublin's historic trail in the future and will significantly enhance the overall appeal of this historic part of our capital city and breathe new life into the community and economy of the north inner city.</p> <p> With regard to this Bill, the Government appreciates the constructive motivation that brought it about.  It presents a very interesting idea.  However, we cannot support it for the reasons stated last night, which I will not repeat.  I wish to assure the House that the Government is determined to follow up on the many initiatives already commenced and to deliver a commemoration appropriate to the importance of the 1916 Rising.  As stated, the new commemorative centre will act as a lasting and appropriate tribute to the 1916 leaders, to whom we are all indebted.  It will allow people to step back in time to the dramatic final moments of the Easter Rising.  Coupled with the new visitor centre being developed in the GPO, just a few minutes walk away, the Moore Street commemorative centre will be a permanent commemoration of the Easter Rising and a fitting tribute to its leaders.</p> <p> The Bill presents a very interesting idea and perhaps the Deputy should make a presentation to Dublin City Council, which plays a central role in respect of this issue.  We regret that planning laws have had a chilling effect on this proposal and that we cannot accept the Bill.</p></speech>

This Bill owes its genesis to Dublin City Council and the acknowledgment within that group that they are unable to do this the way it should be done.  The model we propose, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has spent significant time developing, is a specific company and operation to drive this development.</p>  <p>  The notion that we should exclude areas of Moore Street because they retain "little of the physical fabric" of the past is nonsensical.  It is not the physical fabric we seek to retain and commemorate.  We seek to remember what the men and women of 1916 did.  They gave their lives and put them on the line.  Regardless of whether they did that in one building rather than another, the whole area needs to be maintained and restored as a monument, not just to them but to this country and its people.  The model we propose will do that.</p>  <p>  Passing responsibility back to Dublin City Council puts it on the long finger and this time next year, when we come to the end of the commemoration year, all we will have had will be a series of commemorations, celebrations and parades, with no lasting legacy.  Will we have provided something or added to what is there to mark the centenary in a permanent way?  I do not believe so.  The fact the Government continues to talk about passing responsibility back to Dublin City Council shows a complete lack of ambition and understanding of the importance on the area.  The Government's focus on buildings as opposed to the area and what happened there constrains that vision.  This proposal seeks to provide a lasting legacy.</p>  <p>  It is wonderful that every community throughout the country will share in the celebration, because it is the country's Proclamation.  However, the fulcrum and where it started must be protected and there must be a proper ambition in that regard.  What we have currently, with the retention only of the commemorative centre, leaves the rest of the area to the whims of developers and profit takers, the very kind of people the 1916 leaders and participants revolted against.  We are now handing Moore Street and the area where people laid down their lives to them and nobody is showing any concern about what these developers may do.</p>  <p>  Yes, we will have a commemorative centre but will we have a Starbucks beside it and is that appropriate?  Yes, we will have a commemorative centre but will we have car parks on the other side of it and is that appropriate?  Yes, we will have a commemorative centre but the Government keeps saying we should pass responsibility for the area back to Dublin City Council.  However, what has it done with Moore Street and O'Connell Street since 1916?  Not a lot because it does not have the resources, the ambition or the appreciation that what is at stake here involves more than just buildings.  It does not appreciate the importance of what the area means to people.</p>  <p>  One benefit that will come from the celebrations next year is that the people of this country will be able to show what 1916 means to them.  They will be able to show in the 21st century that the values of republicanism and putting one's country first are still important.  The ambition of the men and women of that time needs to be matched now by the men and women of the current and incoming Government.  This is the way to do it.  This Bill provides a properly thought out and resourced model.  It involves the many actors and players in this sphere.</p>  <p>  It is ridiculous that in one of our final votes before we begin the centenary year, the Government will seek to divide this House around how we appropriately commemorate the battle site to which this country owes its freedom.  It will bring in its Members, many of whom have no interest in this issue, to vote against a proposal that seeks to do the right thing and reflect the ambition and courage of the men and women of 1916.  That courage is not reflected in the Government's approach to this Bill and that is deeply regrettable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-12-16a.842" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121600073#VVV00400"><p>I presume I will be allowed the extra time.  I would have thought that if the Government was going to knock the Bill on technicalities, it would have brought forward an alternative way of achieving the same result.  If it had indicated it was holding back the Bill on technicalities, claiming there might be constitutional issues and that it would find another way, I would have withdrawn the Bill and not push the issue to a vote.  It has used technicalities to defeat the principle behind it.</p><p>I admire the Save Moore Street Committee, the work it has done and particularly the efforts of Mr. James Connolly Heron who has a direct family connection.  Some of the arguments I have heard are quite extraordinary.  When speaking about the changes to the buildings, I thought of Warsaw, which was flattened during the Second World War, but its centre was rebuilt from the plans because the people wanted the pre-war city to be rebuilt rather than building a modern city that would have been completely different.  It is important to say the National Museum of Ireland, in correspondence with the then Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, stated:</p><blockquote>The proposed retail development will significantly impoverish the historical and cultural significance of the 1916 national monument.  The national monument exists within an historic battlefield.  </blockquote><p>Therefore, all this talk about the national monument has been put at naught by our institutions.  The National Museum of Ireland continued:</p><blockquote>Outside the national monument there are original buildings and the street fabric that is monumental in form, historic in character and national in importance.  Any consideration of the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street must, in particular, take account of the route between the GPO and Moore Street in order to maintain the link in a meaningful way, given the extent of the surviving street plan and buildings, especially along Henry Place.</blockquote><p>The National Museum of Ireland is not a partisan party but the professional in this area.  Its correspondence continues, &quot;A formal process should be undertaken by the National Monuments Service to assess the status of the survivals and to consider whether they are part of the same monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street or constitute separate national monuments&quot;.  It is important to note that the White House on Henry Place was occupied and held by Michael Collins and that 10 Moore Street was the point of entry and the place where the rebels held the Council of War and the leaders slept overnight.  At 20-21 Moore Street the volunteers gathered and reluctantly agreed to accept a surrender order after addresses by Thomas Clarke, Michael Collins, Joseph Plunkett and Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada.  One of the best quotes on the importance of Moore Street was made in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</p><blockquote>This is a confined area but it contains the lanes of history ... The area from the GPO to the Rotunda is very compact.  There is an opportunity, if handled properly, to make available a multilingual explanation to people from all over the world in order that they can see the circumstances and locations where one of the first independent states was recognised in the early part of the 20th century ... This needs to be looked at afresh ... The lanes are still there as is some of the original brickwork, etc., to enable a more comprehensive explanation and analysis of what went on ... we have an opportunity to get it right before anything happens which might impact severely on it.</blockquote><p>I say &quot;Bravo&quot;, as these are the words of the Taoiseach in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 12 April 2011.  It is fair to recognise that the former Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, accepted the proposition that relatives of the signatories to the 1916 Proclamation would be appointed trustees of the national monument.  It is fair to say it would be much better if they were appointed trustees to the whole battlefield site that was Moore Street.</p><p>There are many other assessments that indicate the importance of the entire streetscape.  The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has stated the determining factor in preserving 16 Moore Street was its historical significance, but we have questions to ask.  Is 10 Moore Street a house of historical significance?  Is the White House which was occupied by Michael Collins of historical significance?  Are 20 and 21 of historical significance?  There can only be one answer to these questions.  Although the list is too long to read in full, I have details of locations where the 1916 Rising took place that have been destroyed by the vicissitudes of history.  They include South Dublin Union, Jacob's, the Ballast Office, the Metropole, Liberty Hall, Fr. Mathew Park, Boland's Mills, Clanwilliam House, Carisbrook House, the Abbey Theatre, the Fianna hall, the Foresters hall, Marrowbone Lane, the Mendicity Institute, North King's Street, O'Rahilly Parade, Roe's distillery, Watkins' brewery, Tom Clarke's shop and York Street.  These important locations are no more and cannot be saved.</p><p>Does the Government think it is too big a step, financially, to save the rest of the street?  At the end of the day, where there is a will, there is a way.  Yesterday the Minister made a big play about the local authority, but we need to put a few facts on the line.  A local authority is very confined in what it can do in a compulsory purchase order.  It can have one for housing and roads, but it does not have the power to make such an order for cultural and historic purposes.  Therefore, throwing the issue back to the local authority is wrong.  The sole power to make a compulsory purchase order for cultural and historical purposes lies with the State.</p><p>I have a question for the Government and I hope it will answer it publicly during the Christmas period.  Has the State put a cost on the compulsory purchase of the rest of Moore Street and adjacent lanes?  Is it willing to state publicly the valuation in order that the Irish people can make a decision on whether the street and lanes should be saved for posterity?  It is one of the best preserved urban battlefield sites in Europe, if not the best.</p><p>I am reminded of the poem by Pearse when there is talk of money.  He wrote: </p><blockquote>Since the wise men have not spoken, I speak that am only a fool;<br /><br />A fool that hath loved his folly,<br /><br />Yea, more than the wise men their books or their counting houses or their quiet homes.  </blockquote><p>We all know how that poem continues in a very prophetic way.  He asked a rhetorical question in writing, &quot;O wise men, riddle me this: what if the dream come true?&quot;  I stood back in the initial stages when we discussed the 1916 Rising as I was afraid people would make an allegation that I was doing it only because of family connections with the Rising.</p><p>When I saw in the early stages that this important event in Irish history was going be played down, and I must accept that the Government has vastly improved its programme, I decided to get more involved.  We are determined to make the dream of saving Moore Street come true and to save all of Moore Street and the adjacent lanes so that generations unborn shall visit the houses and should visit the place shaped in our heart - the noble heart of our thoughts.</p> <p> We will be pushing this to a vote because we believe that the Government should make a principled decision here tonight to save Moore Street.  We can discuss on another day how that might be done in practice.  I thank Deputy Martin and all of my colleagues for the fantastic support they have given to this fight.  We vow to work with the Moore Street committee until we achieve victory in this battle.</p></speech>
