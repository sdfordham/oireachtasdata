I hope we will have a productive year.  I also wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle a happy new year.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the CSO survey of income and living conditions results for 2016 because they show improvements in living conditions and tackling poverty.  In 2016 incomes rose by 3.1%, mainly due to rising employment, while the deprivation rate fell for the second year running.  We have now lifted 7,000 more children out of what we call consistent poverty.  </p>  <p>  By 2016, each of the rates quoted in the question was down substantially from its peak in 2012-13.  I am very grateful for this.  The number of children living in consistent poverty was down from 12.8% to 11%; the number of children at risk of poverty was down from 20.3% to 19%, while the number of children experiencing deprivation was down from 37% to 25%.  While I welcome these figures, they are still not good enough and will not be good enough until they are down significantly.</p>  <p>  Excluding pensions, the social welfare system continued to perform strongly in 2016, with the at-risk-of-poverty rate being reduced from 33.6% before social transfers to 16.5% after social transfers.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 51%, ensuring Ireland remains one of the best performing countries in the European Union in reducing the incidence of poverty through the social transfers system.</p>  <p>  The entire impact of the recovery is not fully reflected in the most recent data which relate to incomes in the period from 2015 to 2016.  Macroeconomic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since.  The unemployment rate fell from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% towards the end of 2017.  The number in receipt of working age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  In addition, budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports, including an increase of &euro;5 per week in the maximum weekly rate for people of working age and young jobseekers and pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependants and an increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child dependant allowance which had not been increased in the previous eight years.  We all have to agree that these increases are aimed at assisting those individuals and families most in need.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion is set out in the national action plan for social inclusion.  The plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing the level of consistent poverty.  My Department is reviewing the plan in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p></speech>

I also wish everybody a happy new year.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge what was done in the budget and the previous one.  I also acknowledge that there has been a reduction in the rate for those experiencing deprivation.  Nevertheless, the figure for the number of children living in consistent poverty in 2014 was 12.7%, which figure was reduced to 11.5% in 2015 and 11.1% in 2016.  If one does the figures, they show that 97% of the children who were living in consistent poverty in 2015 were also living in consistent poverty in 2016.  In the same three-year period the at-risk-of-poverty rate fell from 20.3% to 19.5% and then to 19.3%.  They show that 99% of the children who were at risk of poverty in 2015 were still at risk of poverty in 2016.  Does the Minister agree that the substantial economic growth which we acknowledge has happened in recent years and the substantial reductions in the rate of unemployment are not yet being properly reflected in the statistics for children?  Is she aware that approximately 70,000 more children are living in poverty than in 2008?  Does the Government have specific proposals to ensure improvements in the economy will be translated into a substantial reduction in the incidence of child poverty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700003#A00600"><p>I agree with the Deputy that the numbers I have just given do not reflect the economic progress we are seeing because they are the figures to the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016.  Thankfully, in 2018 there are 320,000 more people working than when the Deputy's party left government in 2011.  Ensuring someone has a job is the single greatest thing any economy or government can do to try to take adults and children out of poverty.  There are some specific measures in the action plan.  The latest CSO survey of income and living conditions shows that the number of children living in consistent poverty fell to 11.1% in 2016.  Given the continued economic recovery this and the last Government have seen, it is reasonable to expect that future figures to show further improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the economic recovery is experienced by every person and in every county.  A key driver in preventing children from experiencing poverty has been social transfers, as indicated in the reduced averages, as well as child dependant payments and child benefit.  EUROSTAT data show that we reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate before social transfers from just over 40% to just under 19% after social transfers.  We know that social transfers work.  We also know that the Government can only aid economic recovery, but when we have resources and the fruits of economic recovery, we can make sure they are targeted at the most vulnerable through the Social Welfare Bill.  That is my job and what I intend to do.</p></speech>

We have heard that before.  Before the latest figures were produced, we were assured that, because of the accompanying economic growth, they would show a substantial reduction, but that has not transpired to be the case.</p><p>The 2020 child poverty target that was agreed by the Government would require it to lift 102,000 children out of consistent poverty between 2015 and 2020.  Will the Minister say if this target is still realistic?</p></speech>

It is an ambitious target.  I have said a number of times on the record that the target under the action plan Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is to take 90,000 children out of poverty in that period.  I do not know which 30,000 children we will pick to leave behind.  It is my ambition to make sure that everybody in the section of society that is currently either long-term or short-term unemployed, and who wants to work, will have a job.  For those people who have difficulties in accessing the jobs market we need to make sure there are activation measures in place to assist when people find barriers or difficulties in their way.  We will assist them to get in to employment and make sure that the fruits of the economy that are given back to people through social transfers are given to those who are most vulnerable, in my opinion those children and their parents who are living in consistent poverty.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700004#B00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The current rate bands applying to the State contributory pension were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic environment, which we all acknowledge, at that time.  Although the economic crash in 2008 led to a reduction in other welfare payments, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  In order to respond to the pressures on the State finances, however, it was necessary to achieve some savings in pension arena.  In order to do this in a manner that both minimised the impact on the most vulnerable pensioners and was consistent with long-term pension policy it was decided to align pension payments for new pensioners after 2012 more closely with the number of social insurance contributions made by a person.  This was achieved by introducing new rate bands for the purpose of calculating average contributions, which is the current system.</p>  <p>  The rate bands introduced in 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between the years 2000 and 2012.  Although for some people these bands have reduced their pension compared to what they would have received under the old rules, the pension that is paid is still disproportionate to the level of contributions that have been made.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years of his or her working life still receives an 85% pension payment.  Although the basis of averaging pensions is still relatively generous I recognise - I have said this before - that some people, mainly but not exclusively women, who have broken contribution histories are receiving a pension that is significantly lower than they would otherwise have received; a pension that is less, in some cases, than is paid to people with a similar level of contributions paid over an unbroken period.  I therefore have committed to examine options that will address this issue.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in a cost increase of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million each following year.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a Cabinet committee tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700004#B00900"><p>I have listened to the Minister's response and heard her trying to explain the rationale around why these changes were put in place but there is simply no rationale.  The changes were wrong in 2012 and they are wrong now.  They need to be changed.  The Minister and her Government have an opportunity this week to rectify the changes that directly impacted more than 42,000 pensioners, predominantly women, who took time out from their working lives to look after family members or loved ones.  The Minister has an opportunity to bring a proposal to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow or to the full Cabinet in order to right the wrong that was done to these pensioners.  Perhaps, in this era of the so-called new politics, the Minister might give the D&aacute;il a brief insight into what proposal will be brought to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow.  It would be useful.  The Minister has said previously that she would have no problem publishing the proposals.  Perhaps she will now give us some insight into what she and the Department are thinking in the context of reversing the changes and restoring the payments to the 42,000 people who are directly impacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700004#B01000"><p>To be clear, I do not believe that at any stage I have ever said the changes were wrong, and if I have than I would like to correct it if the Deputy's understanding of what I said is not true.  There is nothing wrong with the band changes and the averaging system that was introduced by this House in 2012, in the Government's opinion.  The change gave rise to an anomaly that currently affects some 42,000 people.  This is what I shall address.  At no stage, however, have I ever said that the introduction of the bands, or the averaging system that arose from those band changes to the calculations of pensions, was wrong.  There is a difficulty with the fact that men and women who had longer working lives than other people are receiving less payments, even though they might have had similar contribution histories.  That is wrong, it is an anomaly and is what we are going to fix.  I am not at liberty to share the details of the proposals, as they must go to Cabinet.  I will bring the proposals to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow, and if I can get approval tomorrow it will go to the full Cabinet committee on Tuesday.  As I have agreed with Deputies Brady and O'Dea before Christmas, I will publish that report on Tuesday regardless of the outcome and whether I get what I am looking for or not.  I reiterate that there is a Cabinet sub-committee meeting of the economics portfolio tomorrow afternoon and I will propose a solution on the pensions changes to the committee tomorrow.  If they give me the nod - for want of a better word - then I will bring the proposal to the full Cabinet meeting on Tuesday and we will have a conversation thereafter on that.</p></speech>

The report is going to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow, which will discuss the proposed solution and it will then go to the Cabinet on Tuesday.  The Minister has said she will publish the report regardless of the outcome.  Is the Minister saying that even if the Cabinet turns down the proposals, she will still publish the proposals after that meeting?  What happens if the Cabinet sub-committee says no and thinks the proposals are unrealistic?  What is the situation in that case?</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, made reference to a figure of &euro;70 million to rectify the anomaly this year.  Am I correct in saying that it would cost &euro;70 million or thereabouts if we were to rectify the anomaly straightaway and if it was backdated to 1 January?  It depends on where the change comes in through the year.</p></speech>

Before Christmas I committed to him that when I bring the report to the cabinet I will publish it.  That position has not changed.  I very much hope that I get a positive response.  I am fairly confident that I will.  I believe that the options in the proposals are very reasonable and genuinely reflect an acknowledgement on my part, as I have already said, that some people have had a disservice done to them arising from the length of time they contributed to the State.  That is simply not fair.  I am very hopeful, obviously, that the proposal I am putting forward will be received positively.  Whether it is or not, however, I made a commitment to the Deputies before Christmas that I will publish the report and I will do this on Tuesday afternoon.</p></speech>

The Minister seems to think it was an anomaly that arose from the 2012 changes.  I argue against that; it was a clearly designed measure taken in the full knowledge of the impact it would have on our pensioners, especially on women.  There is no question about that in my mind, in the view of the many organisations that are actively campaigning to change this, and in the minds of the many people who are directly impacted.  The Minister may have alternative views on this aspect but I believe it was a conscious decision taken at the time.</p><p>The Minister may be aware of the huge pressure that is being applied.  A press conference is taking place as we are here in the Chamber.  A protest will take place outside the D&aacute;il tomorrow morning and afternoon.  The Minister has an opportunity to make this change.  If and when these changes come in, we need clarity as to whether they will be retrospective and backdated to 1 January this year or to 2012.  Those are big questions and challenges for the Minister but we need clarity on them.  Hopefully, the Minister will get this proposal though the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow and the full Cabinet next Tuesday.  The 42,000 affected need this change.  They needed that change yesterday.  This issue cannot be allowed to be kicked down the road any further.

Assuming the Minister gets this proposal through the Cabinet subcommittee tomorrow, and I wish her the best of luck with that, and assuming it goes to and is approved by Cabinet, can we envisage that the changes will come in more or less immediately?  In other words, I am trying to ascertain the timeline and I presume there will not be a decision by the Cabinet that we are going to do this, that or the other and that we will have to wait until the next budget for the timeline for these changes.  Can the Minister give an assurance that the timeline for the introduction of the changes she proposes, if accepted, will commence before the next budget?</p></speech>

He might think that the changes in the whole should not have been brought in but the changes that happened in 2012 did not only affect 42,000 people, they affected hundreds of thousands of people.  Except for the 42,000 people who were maligned by the averaging system because of the length of their service, all of the other thousands of people who have been affected by the changes do not have the same view that the Deputy would have.  I acknowledge that a disservice was done to those people through the averaging system.  That was wrong.  It is not fair that somebody would have a length of contribution of service to the country and receive less of a pension than somebody who has a small contribution service history to the country.  I acknowledge that today, I acknowledged it months ago and I also acknowledged months ago that I will fix it, and I will fix it.  I am sorry the Deputy is dying for information on this, as I know everybody else is, but I am not in a position to give him something that I have not put to both the Cabinet sub-committee and the Cabinet committee next Tuesday until they have seen it.  Otherwise, why do we have these committees unless we are going to use the protocols of getting what I need to get through them?</p>  <p>  I believe Deputy O'Dea is well aware, as I have said previously, that regardless of whatever is accepted or not accepted, this will involve new money.  It is not that there is a pot of money sitting in the Department somewhere that can resolve this.  It did not form part of the negotiations of the social welfare budget for this year.  The Deputy is well aware of that, as am I.  Therefore, I will be seeking new money and that new money does not exist today.  I am grateful for the Deputy's good wishes and if he could double and triple them over the next few days-----</p></speech>

Although these band changes affect both men and women, there are particular measures of discrimination affecting women who raised their families prior to 1994.  In addressing the question and making the statement that I have asked for, the Minister, given that she was part of the previous regime, might try to explain why that date was chosen, why was it not 1993, 1996 or 1990.  Will she explain if it was arbitrarily chosen?  Was it calculated on the basis of the amount of savings the State would make, because it knew that prior to 1994 there would not be that many people retiring for the next 20 or 25 years, in order to get us out of the austerity period?  I am asking the Minister the same question as the previous ones with a different emphasis on the issue of discrimination against women who made their homes prior to that date.</p></reply>

She is specifically asking about the homemaker's credit and not about the anomaly.  If she does not mind, I am going to shoot to a supplementary response because it more freely answers the question she has asked me.  In practice, there are a number of factors that make it impossible to be precise.  That is not the correct reply - I beg the Deputy's pardon.</p>  <p>  When the contribution pension was introduced in 1961, a yearly average approach was used for calculating entitlements.  As reckonable social insurance had just been introduced eight years prior to that, no one would have had the 30 to 40 years of contributions necessary to be paid under a total contributions approach.  However, having a yearly average model would allow many people to qualify for a full pension and with the extension of PRSI over the year, notably to self-employment and farmers in 1988, a total contributions approach can be used from around 2020 without disadvantaging people in those sectors.  They will have a 30-year window to accumulate what their contributions are.  The main difficulty with the yearly average approach is that it is possible for people to start to pay social insurance at a much later stage in life and still qualify for pensions to the maximum rate, which is not very fair.  That is why the yearly averaging system is going to be changed, hopefully, to a total contributions model.</p>  <p>  The reason the change was introduced at that time - I cannot tell the Deputy whether the date was arbitrarily chosen and, obviously, I was not around at that time - was to acknowledge genuinely that women stay at home and we take choices to come out of the workforce and to rear our family.  That change was introduced at that time to acknowledge the huge service to the family, community and society.</p>  <p>  I am speaking off the top of my head, only because I have had experience of introducing measures since I became Minister and I have had to pick a start date.  I commit to the Deputy that I will find the answer to why that date was picked and whether we looked at different dates at the time.  If the Deputy can give me some space, I will come back to her later today with a specific answer.  I do not know whether that date was arbitrarily chosen or whether we picked it for a reason.  I will come back to her on that later today and I am sorry I do not have a better answer for her on that.</p></speech>

The question that jumps out is this: why it is recognised that women leave the workforce and rear children for those after 1994 but not for those before then.  As we speak and was mentioned by other Deputies, there are people across the road in Buswells Hotel having a press conference.  One of them is a woman from Kildare called Joan McLoughlin who left the workforce in the 1970s to rear her family.  She has been very active in Pensioners for Equality, who had the last protest outside the D&aacute;il.  She was reported in a local newspaper in Kildare, from where she comes, as having said it is not about her, she runs a B&amp;B and is not too badly off but she is down &euro;55 a week on her old age pension.  However, she said, others are worse off.  She said one lady she was speaking to said when she goes back home she has to count out the pieces of coal.  She said, imagine in 2018 having to count every piece of coal and that is the reality for some people: it is.  There are pensioners living in poverty and many of them are women because they did the job that was expected of them, which was to be mothers and to rear their family.  I know the Minister wants to fix it and that she will try to fix it and she has said she will have to find new money.  She should remember that we are living in an obscene society-----</p></speech>

Therefore, the 1994 business will be defunct once we reach 1 January 2020.  I know that does not help us today but that is where we are going with this, namely, that 20-year credit will be able to be assigned to any year one stayed at home.  For the likes of the Deputy's mother or my mother with respect to the 1994 issue, once we reach 2020, they would benefit in the future.  I will come back to the Deputy later today on her question regarding why the change was introduced with respect to that date.</p><p>There is an issue with the incidence of fuel poverty.  During the passage of the Social Welfare Bill Deputy Willie O'Dea requested that I conduct an inquiry to the changes we might be able to make to social transfers.  I could not agree to his request because it was not within the remit of my Department.  However, I have found a back door to do what we were seeking to achieve and I will conduct the review in the next couple of weeks with a view to examining the rates of payment and the periods of time for which we make payments.  It must also be acknowledged that the price of fuel has increased.  I look forward to working with the social welfare committee on the issue.</p></speech>

There are very angry people, particularly women, who are saying this issue must be sorted out now and payments backdated.  They will not put up with the loss of &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 a year when they are living in Povertyville.  Some 42,000 pensioners are affected now, but they will become hundreds of thousands, as people retire, unless this issue is sorted out.  This needs to happen as soon as possible.  I ruge those not affected now but who will be to attend outside Leinster House tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. with their brothers and sisters from Age Action Ireland, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Pensioners for Equality and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  It is important that they do.  We had a revolution a number of years ago when Fianna F&aacute;il attacked the medical card system.  Let us have another over the attack on pensioners and I know that the Government will respond to it.

This includes ensuring applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance, evidence must be provided of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirements, the level of care the carer provides and the carer&rsquo;s means.  In general, applications under social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  This is compounded if the documentary evidence provided at the initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient.  This is often the case in the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance applications.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2017 the average waiting time in processing new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications was 17 weeks, with 5,284 applications awaiting decision.  The number of carer's allowance applications in hand is also a consequence of the continued increased intake of claims, with the number of applications in 2017 being 26% higher than in 2015.  Therefore, the second reason is the huge increase in the number of applications received.  </p>  <p>  Staff have been reassigned within the carer&rsquo;s allowance area to work on claims processing and it is expected that this will improve processing times under the scheme in the coming weeks.  A redesigned application form will be published shortly.  The new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with the aim of providing deciding officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  We are, therefore, also hoping the new redesigned application form will speed up the process. </p>  <p>  The Department experienced delays in the processing of domiciliary care allowance claims during 2017 owing to a number of factors.  First, there was a significant increase in the number of applications being received.  The year-on-year increase in recent years has consistently been in the 15% to 20% range.  Second, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical officer and deciding officer to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating it to the customer.  Corrective actions were taken by the Department, including the allocation of additional resources.  The time required to finalise domiciliary care allowance claims has returned to the departmental standard, with claims being processed within 12 weeks on average during December 2017.  At the end of December, there were 1,240 domiciliary care allowance claims awaiting processing, representing a claims intake of just over two months.</p></speech>

However, I am informed that it takes between nine and 18 months to make a decision.  Are applicants for domciliary care allowance and carer's allowance waiting for periods between nine and 18 months?  Neither figure was mentioned by the Minister of State who gave average waiting times.  Persons in need of care cannot wait for decisions.  There is something wrong with a system that, by the Minister of State's own admission, has an in-built delay of 17 weeks.  We know on the ground that the delay is much longer.  In addition, there is an appeals system which results in further delays.  What is the Minister of State saying to those at home in need and those who are exhausted in providing care which they do with love because they have been beaten down by the system?</p></speech>

To my knowledge, at the end of December a claims intake of just over two months was awaiting processing.  That is what I am being told by departmental officials.  The Government acknowledges the crucial role carers play in society.  It is important, therefore, that the Deputy know that we are fully committed to supporting carers in their role.  Reform and investment are under way.  The carer's allowance is paid to persons providing full-time care and attention for elderly people or people with disabilities whose income falls within certain limits.  It is also important to state there are 74,887 persons in receipt of the carer's allowance, with 44,000 qualified dependent children.  Expenditure in 2017 was &euro;694 million.  The figure for domiciliary care allowance payments which are made to 34,000 families is &euro;200 million.  A strong message is being sent that we are providing support for carers in society.  We respect and value their work.  There are many more issues related to the national disability inclusion strategy to be dealt with in the next two to three years.  We have started to rebuild and invest in carers.  We will also make our best efforts to reduce waiting times.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that the country could not function without the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is a given.  We also know from witnesses appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts that sometimes there is a deliberate policy not to give documentation.  We took issue with this and argued that it was an appalling thing to say.  Some 99% of people move forward with documentation.  The Minister of State is telling the House the numbers of people who are benefiting.</p><p>We know that.  They benefit as of right.  They are saving the State an absolute fortune.  The Minister of State knows that better than anyone.</p> <p> What specific actions are being taken, and on what timeline?  What is a reasonable period to process an application?  I would have thought a matter of weeks - at the maximum, three weeks.  What needs to be done to ensure that?  What staff have been put in place?  I really would like a specific answer so that I and my colleagues will not be standing up here again asking these questions.  It should be a matter of course.</p></speech>

I do not know where the Deputy is going here on this question.  We have put in extra staff to resolve the problem.  The direct answer to the Deputy's question is that the claims, in accordance with departmental standards, are processed within 12 weeks on average during December 2017.</p>  <p>  Of course we recognise that there are problems.  There are people who, in filling in the forms, make mistakes.  That is life.  That is the way it is.  We are changing the application form as well, to modernise it and make it consumer-friendly.</p>  <p>  We are also investing a lot of funding in services for the carers.  We are sending out a strong message here today, unlike the Deputy, that we support the carers in this country and we are doing our best to support the carers.  That is something that is important to the State.</p></speech>

These supports include the JobPath service and programmes such as community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person's opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.</p>  <p>  JobPath aims to place jobseekers into full-time sustainable employment by providing intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment.  People who have completed their year-long engagement with JobPath may apply, if eligible, to participate in a work programme such as CE or T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.  Given the significant drop in the live register, it does not necessarily follow that difficulties filling vacancies would not have arisen if any of our schemes did not exist.</p>  <p>  In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of all the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes, such as T&uacute;s.  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented in July 2017.  They included the qualifying age being reduced to 21 years.  In addition, while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major award, the participant's time can be extended by up to two years to allow him or her to complete the training which will enhance his or her overall employment prospects.  This allows for three years continuous participation on the CE schemes.  Those over the age of 55 years can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  I will continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that those on CE schemes and their host organisations do in communities.  We all know the real value of the services they provide and are appreciative of it.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In this regard, if any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, it should contact its local Intreo centre for assistance.</p></speech>

In outlining the role of the CE and T&uacute;s schemes, the Minister indicates that the Government does not see them as sustainable pathways for people on their own and that her primary focus in relation to their objective is entirely towards placing people back in employment.  While that is a key objective, we also have to recognise the tremendous role which these schemes, and those who work on them, carry out in communities, whether it be in community associations, Tidy Towns groups, cr&egrave;ches, soccer clubs or GAA clubs.  In many ways, those who contribute to their community through a participation in a CE or T&uacute;s scheme help make communities tick and help make sustainable communities.  It is important we recognise that.</p>  <p>  It is also important we recognise that it is appropriate that some, particularly those who are reaching the end of their working life but who are also reaching the limit in terms of their participation in T&uacute;s or CE schemes, be allowed to continue to contribute to the community and that the guillotine simply does not come down and leave them in a situation where they are blocked from further participation in a scheme and contributing to their community and also not in a position to get employment.  We need to review the position in that regard.</p></speech>

They are not providing sustainable, long-term jobs and they were never designed to do that.  They are employment activation schemes, which is what it says in the documents from when the Deputy's party started CE schemes.  Many people are providing services in their communities and I agree with the Deputy that communities could not survive without them.  I acknowledge, respect and totally appreciate what they do.  They do not see it as employment activation; they genuinely see it as a job and a service and they are incredibly proud to do it.  We have broken hearts by the way the system currently operates.  If one reads between the lines, I am telling the Deputy I agree with him.  If a CE placement gives a person pride in serving his or her community, I do not see the benefit, if he or she does not have a job to go to, of taking the person off that scheme and sending him or her home to be in his or her house for a year before he or she can qualify.  We are continually looking at the two schemes and if and when I can make changes to reflect what I think the Deputy feels, I will try to make those changes.  The difficulty we have is they were established purely as activation measures to move people into jobs.  In some cases, with older people, for example, those jobs just do not exist.  I think I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700008#F00200"><p>I echo and endorse everything my colleague, Deputy McConalogue, said.  I have a very similar position.  The Minister's answer touched on this a number of times.  Are these schemes intended solely as job activation measures or are they recognised as having a social inclusion element, which is absolutely essential?  As Deputy McConalogue alluded to, many of these schemes facilitate individuals who may not be in a position to attract normal, gainful employment and who may not be able to contribute in a commercial environment but who can contribute effectively, productively and usefully to their communities.  There are two groups of people affected by the difficulty in sourcing people for community employment schemes, the difficulty getting onto T&uacute;s schemes and the impact that JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec are having on that.  We have two groups of people who are losing out.  We have the individuals themselves who in many cases are denied the opportunity for dignified and worthwhile activity and an occupation that gives them pride, a reason to get up in the mornings and all the other good things such as contributing to mental health.  We also have the host organisations, whether they are GAA clubs, parish councils, tidy towns groups, local history groups or heritage groups, which are invariably working in the community on a not-for-profit basis.  They are coming to us and saying they do not have the stream of assistance which was beneficial to both the individual and the host organisation.  It conflicts with the two new providers, Turas Nua and Seetec, which maybe have a more commercial focus.  There are measures that could be introduced to tackle that and let them work more closely together in a more collaborative fashion.  I hope the Minister will look at that.</p></speech>

Everything the Deputy has said is true.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of participants, in CE and T&uacute;s schemes who are doing social inclusion activities and our communities desperately rely on them.  The problem is my Department was not established, and CE and T&uacute;s were not established, to provide social inclusion services.  It is an employment activation measure.  It is no different from JobPath, which is not commercial; it is an employment activation measure.  The sole purpose in statute for the organisations that are hosting CE and T&uacute;s schemes is to give employment experience and opportunities to people so they can move on to full-time sustainable jobs.  The dilemma we have is that tens of thousands of people who have participated in them will probably never - or will never want to - get a full-time sustainable job.  I do not know how to change that because if I change it, it will not be an employment activation scheme and will not fall under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I acknowledge there are thousands of people on CE schemes who respect and value the social inclusion services they provide but do not achieve employment activation.  We need to square that circle by acknowledging, respecting and rewarding what they are doing but not under the guise of employment activation because if we continue to call these schemes employment activation schemes, we have to continue to move people on which is causing upset to the host organisations, the community service organisations and groups and the people who are doing the work.</p></speech>

The reality is it is within the power of the Minister, Government and Parliament to influence and mould these schemes and to shape them in a way that is appropriate.  I am very proud it was my party that established the CE schemes in the first place because of the tremendous role they have gone on to play and the people within them who contribute on a daily basis to the local communities.  We need to acknowledge how it has evolved and what is involved in it now and we need to ensure it can continue to fulfil that purpose.  That requires amending it as appropriate.  We should keep its job placement and empowerment potential while recognising it has another role to facilitate many people in the community who will not go on to other jobs and who contribute to their communities.  Many of those people are forced to leave the scheme and are then not able to contribute or get a job.  The Minister can change that and we are saying she should change it and look at it again.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister comment on the supervisors who were in full-time jobs managing these schemes over the years?  Will the Minister give us an update on the position on the 2008 Labour Court recommendation that required them to be provided with pensions?  That is something the Government is yet to follow through on. </p></speech>

The first is a realignment.  She mentioned the difficulty of job activation versus social inclusion.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, took his first question time in seven months yesterday.  Perhaps his Department of Rural and Community Development could assist in this.  Historically, there was a cross-departmental approach to these schemes.  Maybe sometimes things moved from one Department to another.  Perhaps we could recategorise at least part of the scheme to help with that.  An assessment should be done upfront when somebody is referred to JobPath rather than a person spending 12 months going through a programme which may not be suitable for them.  It may be eminently suitable for many individuals but there are some who may not be a good match.  That should be identified in the first week or two and they should be sent back to CE or T&uacute;s if that is more appropriate.  I understand that Turas Nua and Seetec would be happy to facilitate that.  If a person is working in his or her local GAA hall as part of the CE scheme and is only required by JobPath to be available for one 30-minute session a week, for example, for interview preparation, there is no need for that person to sit at home for four and a half days of that week when he or she could be back working in the GAA hall.  Allowing people to remain on the CE scheme while in JobPath, if it does not hinder their efforts in the JobPath scheme, would be very welcome.  The rules on eligibility and continuation, especially for older people, who present greater complexities when re-entering the job market should be considered.  The rules around the barrier to re-entry if somebody comes off a JobPath should also be looked at.  People should not be prohibited from going straight back to a CE scheme if that option is open to them.  They are some immediate changes that could be made and would be welcome.  If there is an issue with categorisation I am sure it could be solved.  If they need to be called social inclusion schemes, let us call them that.  If we need to go to the Department of Rural and Community Development, let us do it.</p></speech>

We pick the candidates and we only pick people who are suitable for JobPath.  It is not the case that people sit down in an Intreo office and say they want to do the CE scheme but we say they cannot and that we are sending them to JobPath.  We only send people to JobPath who are jobs ready and need help on a one-to-one basis which might aid them getting a full-time, sustainable job.  Deputy McConalogue takes the credit for setting up the CE scheme because Fianna F&aacute;il was in power for hundreds and hundreds of years.  I give him that credit.</p></speech>

What the Department does not do is provide employment; we provide social inclusion measures.  The difficulty with trying to do what I wanted to do before Christmas is that we cannot neatly separate all the people on all the schemes.  It is not the case that, for example, a host company in Donegal is doing only social inclusion and a host company in Letterkenny is doing entirely work experience and activation and, therefore, we could separate them.  That is not the reality.  The reality is that on every single scheme, we have people who are doing social inclusion measures and people who are doing employment activation and training measures.  How do we have different rules for the same people who are on the same schemes?  It is not possible.  If we bring it back to the higher power, which is what the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is, it is statutorily responsible for employment activation and the welfare of people who are required to be looked after by the State.</p><p>At no point does it state that I am responsible for providing services to communities.  Therefore, I cannot separate them out even if it was physically possible for me to do it because it would not be within the remit of my Department.  I am trying to reflect the reality that some people who are involved in T&uacute;s and CE most likely will never work again in full-time employment because of their age or other difficulties they might have.  I am trying to be flexible with the terms-----</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister was not present for Report Stage when I got an opportunity to try to amend the recent Social Welfare Bill so that this would be addressed in 2018.  I ask her to expand on what she is now preparing to do on foot of a Cabinet decision.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700009#G01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 14 and 18 together.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension (contributory) were introduced in 2012, replacing the previous rates introduced in 2000.</p>  <p>  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, on which many pensioners were solely dependent, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced.</p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over a 50-year working life will still get an 85% pension.  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands from January 2018, would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million each year thereafter.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, even accounting for inflation, people affected by the 2012 rate-band changes receive a higher rate of payment now in real terms than they would have at the start of 2007.</p>  <p>  The national pensions framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State pension (contributory) from 2020.  I hope to start a consultation process regarding this reform shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach.</p>  <p>  This reform will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemaker's provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children or adults with a caring need.</p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to ensure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and hold their value in the coming years.  The planned reforms will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  My Department has examined in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  My officials have done extensive work and I take this opportunity to thank them for that.  We have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to Cabinet sub-committee A on Thursday at 2.30 p.m.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendments and further discussions, I will bring the proposal to Cabinet on Tuesday and I will publish the report thereafter.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

In reality, as the Minister is aware, up to 40,000 of our senior constituents have lost out very badly in the 2012 changes.  The Minister said it was part of the political and economic environment at the time.  It was an environment with which I profoundly disagreed and I voted against it.  The Minister also had the opportunity to vote against it, but she did not.</p>  <p>  Over those years, those mostly senior women workers have lost a significant amount of money because of this.  I note the first thing the Minister said about pensions is that they have to be affordable.  The reality is that a grave injustice was done to that cohort of women workers.  As I said to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, almost a year ago, he let down his own generation and treated them badly.  They lost a significant amount of pension to which they were entitled.  As Professor Alan Barrett of the ESRI said, the Government changed the rules of the game in the middle of the game for that cohort of mostly senior women workers.  A grave injustice has been done.  We know the reality and the facts.  It is more than a year since Maureen Bassett produced her great report on this injustice for Age Action.  We have been talking about it for a year.  What does the Minister propose to do?</p></speech>

We have had this conversation with a variety of Members of this House on a variety of occasions.  I acknowledge that some people were adversely affected because of the averaging system introduced in 2012.  I have also acknowledged that we will fix it.  The report with my proposals is ready to go to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow afternoon.  If I get agreement there, it will be brought to the Cabinet for discussion and approval on Tuesday.  I can give the Deputy no more details than that.  That is what I said before Christmas; that is what I said earlier this morning; and that is what I am saying now again.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet sub-committee A is meeting at 2.30 p.m. on Thursday and mine is the first item on the agenda.  Following the discussions there I will bring the report to the Cabinet meeting.  I will publish that report on Tuesday and the Deputy will be able to see its contents.</p></speech>

I recognise that the Minister has prepared a report on it.  We need a clear timeline and roadmap for how things will be corrected.  Every week people are losing out on income and every week more people are being hit by those cuts.  It needs to happen sooner rather than later.  I understand that the report will be brought to the Cabinet sub-committee tomorrow.  In the event that the committee is not satisfied with it, will she publish it?</p>  <p>  When the Minister requested that report, did she focus only on the people who will become eligible in future or did she also focus on the people who have already been hit by these cuts going back to 2012?  In requesting that report, did she also ask for homemakers to be taken into consideration?  A clear roadmap needs to be set out in the interests of those hit by the 2012 cuts.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that there will be a roadmap.  If an agreement is reached this week or next week, it will be very clear what we can do and when.  I again say that it will involve new money that I do not currently have.</p><p>The Deputy asked whom we looked at when doing the report.  We looked at everybody who has already been affected.  I do not know who might be affected next month or next year until they apply - they probably do not know.  Therefore, I can only look at the people currently on the books.  I have an estimation of the people who will be affected.  Obviously, whatever changes we make will affect the people who have already been affected and affect people who have not been affected yet.</p><p>In answer to the Deputy's second question, the homemaker's credit is not part of the anomaly relating to the people who have had a reduced pension because of the averaging system over their lifetime.  Therefore, it does not form part of the report whatsoever.  The report will be published on Tuesday and the Deputy will be able to see clearly what we have looked at and the options to be put to my Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday.</p></speech>

I raised it with the then Minister and now Taoiseach and with the previous Taoiseach.  I also raised at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight the question of what could be done to remedy this, but it did not seem that the Minister for Finance was very forthcoming.  As such, I ask again whether the Minister has the support of the Minister for Finance and whether she expects the support of his Department to remedy the injustice done to this cohort of women workers.  Is finance available in the 2018 budget to make the changes which should be made and which have worked out overall at a basic &euro;10 million a year?  It was done purely and precisely on the grounds of budget cutting which the Government in office from 2011 embarked on, continuing the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il.  That has happened over eight or ten years.  Will the Minister provide the House with a guarantee that we will see the full restoration of this and an end to this injustice next week?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for the detail she provided.  It is good that the report will be published next week.  Will there be an opportunity to debate the report once it is published, either here or at the sub-committee, or will the Minister be in a position to implement changes immediately?  She mentioned earlier that after 2020, a total contributions scheme will be in place.  In the event that people find that the new system is not as favourable to them as what is now in place, will they have the option to switch from one to the other to ensure they get the maximum pension available?</p></speech>

The working family payment is a working support which provides an income top-up for low-earning employees with children and offers financial incentives to take up employment.  The payment benefits more than 57,000 families with almost 130,000 children through an estimated spend this year of &euro;431 million.  It is definitely working and doing exactly what it is aimed to do.  As part of the process of developing the working family payment, the Department carried out extensive analysis of the range of supports it provides to assist individuals in their attempts to take up employment and move away from welfare dependency.  The analysis showed that the existing in-work supports were actually very effective and were working well to assist individuals to make the transition from unemployment to employment, in particular work supports such as the working family payment and the back-to-work family dividend.  As I agreed during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in 2017 which was enacted in December, I am committed to bringing forward a report reviewing the operation of working family payments to the Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That includes the requirement to work for 19 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight to qualify for the payment.  We are working on that report currently and I will bring it to the committee as soon as it is prepared.  I expect that to be a matter of weeks or a short number of months.</p>  <p>  The redesignation to "working family payment" provided for in the 2017 Act better reflects the nature of the payments.  The Department intends to encourage families to determine whether they are eligible for the payment by carrying out a promotion and information campaign early this year.  I am sure there are still considerable numbers of people who do not know they can avail of this payment.  We will carry out a proper campaign using national and social media.  It is also intended to review continually the package of supports offered to working families to continue to ensure that payments meet the objectives of those they serve.  Budget 2018 increased the income thresholds by &euro;10 for families with up to three children, and that change will take effect from 29 March alongside the other changes we made in the Social Welfare Act.  The likely result of this increase is that additional families not currently in receipt of the working family payment will become eligible for the scheme.</p></speech>

She is most kind.  Will she tell the House when, approximately, we will be in a position to see the report in order that the committee can discuss it?

The working family payment will cover a wider area and, as such, the budget will be considerably larger.  Does the Minister agree?</p></speech>

As it is an in-house report, we are not waiting for external bodies.  I would say the maximum period is three months.  If I can do it before that, we will talk about it and put it on the schedule for the committee.  The Deputy is right.  While &euro;431 million is what is budgeted, there is a bit of wriggle room on the basis that it is not what we spent last year.  However, this is going to be demand-led.  If more is needed, more will be found and that is the end of it.  I want to ensure that everyone who should be availing of the scheme does so, not only because of the &euro;10 increase in the threshold but also because some people genuinely do not know about it.  They should learn about it, apply for it and get it in order that it can be as effective as it has been for the other families moving from welfare dependency into employment.  If we can make those changes around the 19 hours and the 38 hours which are important to Deputy O'Dea to make it more effective and flexible, let us do that.  It is taxpayers' money and it is there to help people to move from a culture of dependence on social welfare payments to being wholly independent just by being supported by the State as opposed to being totally supported by the State.  Let us do that as soon as we can.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is right; the at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 36.2% in 2015 to 40.2% in 2016.</p>  <p>  I hope we would all acknowledge that the best way to tackle poverty, particularly among lone parents, is helping them find a job.  The recently published Indecon report shares this view.  The report found that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme made over the last number of years increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low-paid employment, which is something none of us wants any of our people to aspire to, will not on its own ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.  What we want for people who do not have a job is a job, a better job and then a career.  We need to ensure that the training and support services, particularly for lone parents who historically would not have been working in any real numbers, provide them with a career path so they can get decent paid employment and not just part-time minimum wage employment.</p>  <p>  In 2017, further budget improvements were implemented and I have continued to emphasise improvements for lone parents in particular.  I hope my Department's social impact assessments of all budgets for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household.</p>  <p>  Budget measures recently announced which will take effect from 29 March 2018, specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for qualified child rate, will see a lone parent on the one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transitional payment who is working 15 hours a week on the national minimum wage better off by nearly &euro;1,000 per year.</p></speech>

She put out a press statement after the publication of the SILC report and referred to it again this morning but she specifically left out any mention of lone parents because it is an increase and that goes against the narrative that everything is on the up.  It certainly is not on the up for lone parents.  A 4% increase in the at-risk-of-poverty rate is a huge increase and this is borne out in the Indecon report published last October so there is clearly a problem here that is not being addressed.</p>  <p>  I agree that the solution to this is getting people back into the workforce but there are huge barriers, particularly for lone parents.  One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Burton, who made the changes that directly impacted lone parents, said she would not introduce those changes until we had affordable child care, which is a huge barrier to getting lone parents in particular back into the workforce.  This has not been addressed and will not be addressed - certainly by this Government.  Outside of that, what specific measures are being taken for children in lone parent families to ensure they are not in that poverty trap?</p></speech>

There are barriers to everybody who is unemployed - be they long or short-term unemployed - and the job of my Department, my officials and I is to break down those barriers and assist people.  We have a specific plan that has been enacted that the Indecon report shows is working notwithstanding the fact that many of those people who are less welfare-dependent have a lesser income.  However, as I said to the Deputy, my role and that of the Department is to get people a job, a better job and a career.  This is why we are focusing so much on education, advancement and training for lone parents.  The bursaries were introduced by the Department of Education and Skills.  There are incentives within my Department to improve the standing and skills of people in that area.  That is our job.</p>  <p>  Perhaps it is natural and human that when a report comes out, one will concentrate on the positive parts of it but I have never shied away from reflecting on the fact that lone parents are probably one of the most maligned and vulnerable sets of people in this country, which is why they were my main priority in the budget.  I do not think we can discount that.</p></speech>

I admit there were small changes.  I do not think they went far enough.  A &euro;2 increase for a qualified child must be regarded as small.  It is trivial.  If the Minister looks at the Indecon report and the survey that was carried out, she will see that 11 specific questions were put to lone parent families regarding the affordability of basic items like fuel, a decent coat or decent shoes.  Anyone who was surveyed said that they are in a worse position than they were 12 months ago.  There are huge challenges here.  The Minister can talk and say she is on their side but action speaks louder than words.  There are many other actions that should and could be taken.  Certainly Sinn F&eacute;in put forward many of those in our alternative budget.  These figures are for 2016.  The Indecon report is probably more up to date.  There are huge problems here and the Minister needs to take them on board and make changes.</p></speech>

There have been slight improvements in poverty levels but does it not worry the Minister that in respect of some indicators for lone parents, it is moving in the opposite direction?  For example, the risk of poverty for lone parents increased from 36.2% in 2015 to 40.2% in 2016.  There have been slight improvements in the other indicators but the fact still remains that one in four lone parents in this country are still living in consistent poverty and more than one in two are experiencing deprivation.  When I read the Indecon report, it seemed to suggest that the changes brought about by Deputy Burton in 2012 gave rise to an increased probability of risk of poverty.  As Deputy Brady alluded to, what we have been doing since those changes were introduced is bringing in incremental measures here and there to alleviate the consequences of what was done in 2012.  Would it not be simpler and more efficient, and I suggest just as cheap, to revert to the 2012 situation?

I think that is a pity and says a lot about the Deputies.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Dea, we are not willing to reverse the changes that were made because they are working.  Two separate things were done around 2012.  In respect of changes made through us intensifying our activities with lone parents in order to move from them being entirely dependent on a social welfare system to getting a job, and I am moving that policy from just getting a job to getting a better job to getting a career; through the introduction by the Minister of Education and Skills of the bursaries to provide full-time educational supports for lone parents; and through my intensifying the interactions with lone parents to make sure we do not just tick a box because they happen to be working in a local supermarket, coffee shop or school, I want to make sure that when we move these people from social welfare dependency to employment, it is good, sustainable, long-term and well-paid employment.  The only way we will do that is to continue our interactions with people to make sure that when they get a job, they get a better job and then get a career.  That is the commitment I am giving to lone parents.  We will not be reversing any of the changes that were made in 2012.  What we will be doing is drawing back on the cuts that were made that affected those people and intensifying our interactions with people who face barriers to getting full-time employment to make sure we break those barriers, be they child care or lack of training.</p><p>If we need to take other facilitative measures, we will do so.  The job of the Department and its Intreo offices is to make sure that we provide those services to people who need them.</p></speech>

The Government provided &euro;36 million for exceptional payments last year.</p>  <p>  The exceptional needs payment scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need.</p>  <p>  Statistics are maintained on the payments but not on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  Approximately 100,000 exceptional needs payments have been made over each of the last three years.  Details of the exact number of payment are set out the in the table.  For reporting purposes this data also includes the number of urgent needs payments that were made which accounts for a small number of those payments.  An urgent needs payment is a once off payment made to persons who may not ordinarily qualify for a supplementary welfare allowance payment but who have an urgent need that they cannot meet themselves.  While it is nuanced, it is slightly different in that people who would qualify for an urgent needs payment might not qualify for supplementary welfare payment.  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment should be encouraged by all Deputies in this House to contact their local Intreo office where our social welfare community officers will be very happy to facilitate them.</p></speech>

They will read of the very hurtful manner in which this young woman was treated, causing enormous distress to her and her family.  The complete lack of empathy shown at that time by agencies of this State was shameful and is a damning indictment of the institutions of the State and of society at that time.  She was wrongly accused of murdering a baby and was put through an horrendous tribunal, which was meant to inquire into the failures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its conduct of the investigation but which essentially turned into a cross-examination of Joanne Hayes herself.  In the words of Brendan Kennelly, one of our most famous poets, the tribunal was like a "medieval witch hunt" with the victims burning at the stake and the crowd dancing around the fire and that just about sums it up.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that on the release of State papers, people will often say that it was a different era and that everything is attributable to the era.  Sometimes that is true and, in this case, it partially explains some of what went on and the context.  However, even at the time the then Garda Commissioner, Larry Wren, described the performance of garda&iacute; as revealed in the State papers as "grossly negligent".  There are also lessons for us today.  There is no room for an absence of professionalism in agencies of the State in terms of investigations, the conduct of tribunals and so on.  Notwithstanding the culture of the era and the mores of the time, there are still very significant lessons to be learned by the agencies of the State today in terms of how we deal with citizens in our society and the moral approach we can take.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Taoiseach has issued an apology on behalf of the State to Ms Hayes and her family, which I welcome.  Deputy John Brassil has spoken to the Hayes family, who are very anxious that their privacy would be respected.  Joanne Hayes and her family do not want to relive the horrors of what happened back then again.  On their behalf, I am making a general plea that their privacy would be respected at this difficult time.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste whether the State, without any negotiation, will adequately and properly compensate Joanne Hayes for what happened.  The State should not put her under duress or force her to go through any process but should do the honourable thing by acknowledging the terrible hurt that was caused and providing adequate, appropriate and fair compensation.</p></speech>

I want to personally welcome the apology that was made yesterday by the acting Garda Commissioner to Joanne Hayes and her family.  As T&aacute;naiste, I also want to join the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach in apologising on behalf of the State.  I was thinking yesterday, as I am sure others were, of where I was and what age I was at that time.  I was starting secondary school and would like to think it was a very different Ireland in terms of the approach to women and pregnancy in those days.  However, I also accept the point that real policing mistakes were made.  There were also mistakes made in the subsequent tribunal in terms of how a woman and her family were questioned.  The way in which the tribunal was conducted was described as insensitive, very, very frightening, harrowing, quite horrific and shameful by the D&aacute;il committee on women's rights subsequently.  There are lessons here for the State.  There is also a need to respond to the family's wish for privacy so that a woman who had to go through an extraordinary ordeal of accusation and blame does not have to relive that awful period in her life.  Her extended family should not have to go through that either.</p>  <p>  I wish to restate the Taoiseach's apology to Joanne Hayes and her family.  In terms of the final question that Deputy Martin asked about compensation, we will certainly try to deal with this issue in as sensitive a manner as possible but I am not empowered or at liberty to say right now how that should take place.  However, I am sure that it is something on which the Government will try to make a quick decision.  </p></speech>

I reiterate that the Hayes family have been speaking to Deputy John Brassil and are very anxious that this does not become a political football.  They are also anxious that their privacy would be respected.  Given the trauma that has already been caused, they certainly do not want to go through all that again and that has been very clearly articulated to us.  The lessons are there to be learned in terms of how we approach issues like this, even in today's world.  We have had a number of cases relating to children and only recently, a number of worrying reports from Tusla.  It is a warning to us and a reminder of the absolute necessity to keep looking for the highest of standards in terms of how State agencies conduct their affairs.</p><p>The only reason I have raised the issue of compensation is that the State generally takes a defensive approach to issues such as this, even when it is very clear that a wrong was done by it and when apologies have been issued by it.  By the way, I am not articulating on behalf of anybody.  Nobody has asked me to make this point.  There comes a time for the State to take the lead in dealing with certain issues and certain events.  It needs to do the right and the fair thing in a situation such as this.  I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's comments.</p></speech>

Given the extraordinary circumstances of this case, I do not think it sets a precedent to try to deal with it in a sensitive way.  With the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Taoiseach, I will ensure this aspect of the issue is raised.  I remind the House that there is an ongoing and active Garda investigation into what happened to baby John in this case.  I join the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and others in urging anyone with information on the death of baby John to come forward in order that the other tragic element of this case can be resolved through an appropriate Garda investigation.  Our primary thoughts today need to be with the Hayes family and I hope the call for privacy will be heeded by the media and politicians.  By responding to families in these circumstances in a respectful manner we can show that Ireland has moved on in how these tragic stories are covered by the media and debated by politicians.</p></speech>

The re-emergence of this tragic case is bound to be traumatic for her and her family and the mother of baby John.  I express our solidarity with them.</p>  <p>  I raise with the T&aacute;naiste the Government's abject failure to provide essential services for children with disabilities who are in the care of the State or who are in the community at large.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach yesterday following the Ombudsman for Children's damning report on the treatment of Molly, a teenager with Down's syndrome and severe autism.  The investigation found that the State had denied Molly the supports she needed and abdicated its responsibilities.  It found that its actions had had a negative effect on her and that she had not had an opportunity to reach her full potential.  The HSE and Tusla have accepted the recommendations set out in the Ombudsman for Children's report - they had little choice - but they have also pointed out that meeting their commitments depends on the provision of resources.  Other serious issues such as the lack of respite care services and the poor treatment of carers arise in this context.  There is a significant deficit in the resourcing and funding of child and adolescent mental health services.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, one of the privileges of being a Member of this House is that we frequently meet carers and groups in the voluntary and community sector that provide services for citizens with disabilities.  Such services should be provided by the State in the first instance.  I commend all those who are doing outstanding work in this sector.  If they were not providing these services, many more people would fall between the cracks.</p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies provide a range of vital care services for citizens who are living with disabilities and need hospice care, rehabilitation and various health services.  The funding for such agencies was cut by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2010 and again by a Fine Gael-led Government in 2012.  Front-line staff had their pay cut in line with the cuts for public service workers.  They also lost increments.  Not only is it absolutely unfair that the restoration of pay is being refused, it also represents bad economics.  If these services are further reduced or removed, the citizens cared for will be condemned to a lesser quality of life.  If they end up in hospital or the care of some other over-stretched service provider, the State will have to pick up the tab.  The crisis in section 39 agencies has reached a tipping point.  The Government needs to put in place a pay restoration process for the staff of such agencies.  It has a responsibility to address this issue before the planned strike takes place on 14 February.  If the strike goes ahead, it will compound the crisis that is being sharply felt by vulnerable citizens.  It is not too late to act.  Will the Government sit down with the unions that represent the workers to work out a positive and fair solution?</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Children's report which is very concerning highlights a gap in the provision and co-ordination of supports and services by Tusla and the HSE for children in foster care who have diagnosed moderate or severe disabilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, are taking and have taken the findings very seriously.  The Ombudsman for Children's report has been accepted in full by Tusla and the HSE which are committed to implementing the recommendations set out in it.  I have received a note on the matter from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, which confirms that Molly's supports are now in place.  A joint protocol that has been agreed and is being implemented will result in structures being put in place to support better care planning and transitional arrangements between the HSE and Tusla.  This gives us an important opportunity to review all existing placements.  According to Tusla reports, there are 450 cases in the moderate to severe to profound disability range.  We are responding as necessary to a need and a gap that has been exposed by the case of Molly.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the invaluable services provided by section 39 organisations.  I am sure a number of Deputies have met representatives of such organisations.  I have met them in the context of hospice care, in particular.  There is no doubt that there is work for the Government to do to resolve this issue and we are committed to doing so.  The Ministers, Deputies Simon Harris and Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, have been working collectively on it for some time.</p></speech>

Others will be familiar with the case of Marymount Hospice in Cork, for example.  Such facilities are providing essential health care services and have essentially been mirroring the pay agreements that apply within section 38 organisations and across the HSE generally.</p></speech>

We have just dealt with an historical case.  We deal with many historical cases, but the report of the Ombudsman for Children does not deal with an historical case.  This is happening now on our watch.  Children with disabilities are being denied backup support.  The refusal to restore the pay of the people who look after such children is also happening now.  It is great that Molly has her supports, but it took 15 years.  To get to that point her foster mother was put through the wringer.  The Labour Court has acknowledged the link between public service grades and staff in section 39 agencies.  To my knowledge, the Government has not so far engaged with SIPTU.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give a clear commitment that talks on a pay restoration process will be opened.  This is needed for the sake of the workers involved and the vulnerable citizens they serve.</p></speech>

Was he referring to what I had said about the case of Molly, disability services generally, the significant increases provided for or the efforts being made to resolve the section 39 issue?</p><p>The Government has engaged with the trade unions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met representatives of SIPTU just before Christmas.  We have been engaging and are seeking a sensible and appropriate solution to the issue.  The Government acknowledges the need for it to be resolved and will not oppose the Fianna F&aacute;il Party motion to be debated this evening.  Our approach to the motion is a signal of what we are trying to do.</p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has asked the Health Service Executive to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 organisations to establish the factual position on pay reductions and restoration.  At this point, it is not clear that cuts were applied in a universal manner, although it is clear that cuts have been applied in certain organisations.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the new Government, Taoiseach and Minister and the various new plans, the housing crisis has worsened.  To any reasonable observer, it has become an emergency, with people dying on the streets and the number of homeless children increasing by 30% since this time last year.  Declaring a housing emergency is a prerequisite to dealing with the housing crisis in a sustainable manner and allowing the Government to pursue alternative solutions.  While the private market will have a role to play in providing these solutions, public construction of housing, the provision of affordable houses, shared ownership schemes, regulated rented markets and a much greater role for co-operatives will be vital in providing alternative solutions once the Government sees its way to declaring a housing emergency.</p>  <p>  Tragically, none of this is happening.  The Government's failure to learn from its mistakes and its reliance on the private market to provide housing, albeit with the full support of taxpayers' money, is worsening the crisis.  I will focus on Galway as an example of what this reliance on the free market has allowed to happen.  The beautiful city of Galway has a population of 80,000 and a housing waiting list of approximately 13,000 people dating back to 2001.  Lands in the inner city, at Ceannt Station where 14 acres of land is available and in the inner docklands area where more than 2 ha. is available, have been earmarked as key regenerative areas, but there is no master plan, area action plan or overall vision.  We are back to developer-led development.  Development in Galway, where land has been zoned and public land is available at Ceannt Station and the docks, is developer-led on the sites that have been sold.  Moreover, the authorities are in the process of selling public land at the Ceannt Station site.  There is no master plan or local area plan in a city with a development plan that demands and sets out objectives for such plans and refers to sustainable development, mixed communities and the development of communities in the city.  A regional plan was also drawn up further to a discussion document that referred to moving away from developer-led development and learning lessons.  No lessons have been learned.  Not one house has been constructed with public funds in Galway since 2009.</p>  <p>  At this point, all I can do in the three minutes available to me is to draw the T&aacute;naiste's attention to the crisis, ask him to use whatever legal power is available to him to intervene in Galway and listen to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government which, in its previous guise as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, set out that, at a minimum, a local area action plan should be developed prior to any strategic zone being adopted for the lands in question.</p></speech>

We need to ensure we rebuild a housing sector that can provide social and affordable private housing in a more effective and planned manner and do not leave this task to the vagaries of the market.  This applies to Galway and many other towns and cities.  It is for this reason that the Government will introduce a new national planning framework in the next few weeks.  The purpose of the framework is to plan for 20 years ahead and for an additional 1 million people and to ensure cities such as Galway, Cork, Waterford and Limerick will plan in a sustainable way to accommodate the needs of people who need homes and housing.</p>  <p>  While it is true that there is a reliance on the private sector to provide social housing solutions in the absence of publicly owned and built social housing, the Government is changing this position rapidly and dramatically increasing the number of social houses being provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Private sector delivery of the homes people need is also being ramped up.  The figures for last year bear this out.  Just 18 months into the five-year Rebuilding Ireland plan, it is clear from the figures that the plan is working.  Last year more than 17,500 new homes commenced construction last year, an increase of 33% on the figure for the previous year, and more than 19,000 homes were connected to the ESB network, meaning that they were either newly built or had not been occupied for the previous two years.  In addition, planning permission was granted for more than 18,000 new homes.  This figure does not include planning applications made under the new fast-track planning system for large developments.  The number of new households that had their housing needs met reached 25,892 last year in terms of social housing demand.  These figures are significantly higher than those for 2016, 2015 and 2014.</p>  <p>  It will take time to solve the problem.  Those who call for instant solutions and the construction of tens of thousands of social houses within six or eight months are not being realistic.</p></speech>

The figures available to me show that 100 houses were bought, newly built or brought back into use for social housing last year and that there are a further 350 social housing units in the pipeline.  I can provide Deputy Catherine Connolly with exact details on their locations, although I am aware she is very familiar with the city.</p></speech>

Let me deal with facts.  I am a pragmatic and realistic woman and asking the Government to take action immediately, not to build houses tomorrow.  I also ask it to take action in respect of the developer-led development of sites in Galway city that will result in 2,600 jobs for office workers in a multi-storey complex and not one single home.  I ask it to take action on the absence of a local area plan and a master plan for brownfield sites in the city that are being sold, principally at Ceannt Station and in the docks.  I ask it to take action to deal with flagrant non-compliance with the city development plan, the Government's national planning framework, with which I am familiar, and all of the national planning guidelines.  We have a housing crisis, but we also have public land in the hands of various public agencies.  When office accommodation and not one home is to be built for 2,600 people, not only do we have a scandal on our hands, but it is also clear that we have not learned anything from this debacle.  I again ask the T&aacute;naiste to listen on the issues I raise and act on them.  I am not asking that houses be constructed tomorrow but that the Government ask serious questions about why there is no interconnecting plan for lands that would solve or partly solve the housing crisis in Galway in the next few years through the building of homes.</p></speech>

Those conversations are continuing.  There is ongoing dialogue between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local government in Galway to ensure plans are being addressed.  One of the reasons we asked local authorities to produce an audit of all available land for housing and commercial development was for that very reason.</p> <p> We have to try to ensure that we develop mixed developments and that we do not use every portion of land we have for housing if, in some circumstances, it is unsuitable.  We must ensure that we build communities and that we will have sustainable societies in future that can address housing need as well as employment need and so on.  It is about balancing these competing interests and getting it right.  That is what the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should be doing.  My understanding is that is exactly what departmental officials are doing together in the context of Galway.</p></speech>

I hope the political parties that contributed to the atmosphere of that time and to the witch-hunt of that woman will draw the necessary lesson, that is to say, women should have privacy and autonomy over their own lives.</p><p>Five weeks ago, an all-party Oireachtas committee voted in favour of having a referendum on a simple repeal of the eighth amendment and of providing for abortion to be legal up to 12 weeks without restriction.  This was the culmination of a process that was set up by the Government.  Yet, people are none the wiser on the simple question of whether the Government is now going to accept or set aside the recommendations of the committee.</p><p>Later today, many young people are expected to assemble at the D&aacute;il as part of the Strike 4 Repeal movement.  They want to listen to the debate.  The questions they want answered are simple.  These young people know nothing of the Ireland that we got a glimpse of yesterday, that is, of dead babies on beaches or Salem trials of a woman.  They believe in bodily autonomy.  They will not accept politicians procrastinating.  They are the people who will actually face crisis pregnancies in future.  We need certain questions answered.  Is it the Government's intention to honour the Taoiseach's commitment for a referendum in late May?  In order to meet that timeframe, will the Government do three necessary things?  First, will the Government move the First Stage of a repeal referendum Bill late next week?  Second, will the Government set up the referendum commission, which has asked for 16 weeks in which to operate?  Third, will the Government publish legislation that contains abortion up to 12 weeks on request?</p><p>Four weeks ago, the committee report was published.  Given the number of Deputies who have not had time to read it, one would think they were asked to read <i>War and Peace</i>rather than a short report.  As usual, when it comes to the rights and decisions of women, Deputies are wrestling with their consciences in a way they never do when it comes to cutting hospital beds or bailing out banks.  Anyway, women should be allowed to examine their consciences about this decision rather than politicians - that is the reality.  Let us worry about whether people with crisis pregnancies can sleep at night rather than the T&aacute;naiste or Deputies.</p><p>This really should be simple for politicians.  As Professor Aralkumaran put it at the committee, do we support legal or illegal abortion?  That is the simple question.  Do we want to force people to remain pregnant?  That is all anyone need ask themselves.  Societal attitudes have moved on considerably.  There is now a new middle ground.  Even if there was not a majority now for abortion rights &ndash; the figure was 60% in the last RED C poll &ndash; parliaments have to legislate for societal need and reality.</p><p>My question is for the young people who will gather at 5 p.m.  Will the Government respect the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a date for when the repeal Bill will be first moved through the House to allow the referendum commission to be established?  Will the Government ensure that legislation gives real abortion rights, regardless of the T&aacute;naiste's personal opinions?</p></speech>

I will address the timeline in terms of what the Government needs to do.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government is committed to a referendum, but there is a procedure that needs to be followed to ensure that becomes a reality.  This is something the Government agreed as a three-step process some time ago.  We agreed to set up a Citizens' Assembly, which did a very good job.  Then we agreed that the recommendations from that process would go before an Oireachtas committee, which also did a very good job in debating, discussing and making recommendations.  There was not unanimous agreement but there was majority agreement.  The third part of the process that the Government committed to was consideration, following a debate in the Oireachtas, of the recommendations of that report and making a determination in terms of how a referendum should proceed and what question would be asked.  We are moving through that process.  We are now at the start of the third stage of it.</p>  <p>  The timeline for procedural steps, compiled by the Department of Health, envisages a series of memoranda being submitted to Government in the period from late January to early March.  Subject to Government approval of each memorandum in turn, it is proposed that a constitutional amendment Bill must be initiated and passed by both Houses during the period from March to mid-April.  A referendum commission must also be established, subject to Government approval.  Previous commissions have indicated that four months is required for such a commission to do its work properly.  A referendum must be held not earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after the constitutional amendment Bill has passed the Houses of the Oireachtas and a polling day has been agreed.</p>  <p>  Of course, in parallel we have committed to putting together at least the heads of legislation.  The aim is to try to set a context around answering the question people will rightly ask if they are asked to vote either to remove a section of the Constitution or to replace the existing provision with something else.  People will want to know what the reality will be after that in terms of legislative certainty.  That is a question people will want answers to.</p>  <p>  We are beginning a detailed debate in the House this evening.  I do not think we should be drawing conclusions before that debate even starts, as Deputy Coppinger seems to be suggesting in terms of making commitments.  The Government wants to hear what all parties and all contributors to the debate have to say.  Then, the Government will have to make decisions around the Cabinet table in terms of how we proceed.</p></speech>

When that debate is finished, today or tomorrow, my next question arises.  It relates to meeting the timeframe of 25 May.  I imagine everyone would agree that is an optimal time to have a referendum because it would allow young people and students to vote before exams begin etc.  We need about six weeks for the repeal Bill to move through the D&aacute;il.  That was the timeframe according to advice given to the Government before the committee sat.  It seems there is new information suggesting we do not need that period.  That is why I am raising the matter now.  The hemming and hawing taking place from the Taoiseach and many others is not giving any confidence that it will actually happen.</p>  <p>  I agree that legislation should be published on abortion.  The reason I agree is that I have no confidence that this D&aacute;il, with its current make-up, could actually be trusted to enact the legislation unless it gets a public endorsement in this referendum.  People should know what they are voting for.  I am confident that they will accept it.  The key issue now is whether the Government will meet the timelines.  It is a matter of a simple repeal Bill.  We all know what is needed is a simple Bill of one or two lines.  I have a draft Bill along those lines before me.  If the Government does not wish to move an appropriate Bill next week, maybe Solidarity-People Before Profit will move a Bill next week.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do - the Taoiseach has given great leadership on this - is recognise the fact that there are differences of opinion.  These are deeply held and linked to people's personal circumstances and experience.  Many in the House have strong views in respect of these issues in the context of the need to protect women in a more comprehensive way than we do today and in the context of the responsibilities we have towards children and unborn children.</p><p>The Government is trying to bring forward a proposal that can allow the people to make an informed decision about our Constitution and the consequences, that is, what the new realities will look like, if they decide to change the Constitution.  This is complicated and not straightforward.  It requires legal advice from the Attorney General and thoughtful, political debate that listens to everybody's perspective and tries to come up with an approach that all parties will be able to support in order that we can take party politics out of a very divisive difficult and emotive issue.  That is what the Taoiseach is trying to give leadership on.</p></speech>

He said it was too complex and needs to be streamlined.  I have had to make many representations on behalf of people who need treatment abroad, particularly those with rare conditions or whose consultants determined that a particular treatment was required.  The staff in the section are very helpful and co-operative but the policy context has changed.  The former Minister, Senator James Reilly, changed the situation whereby patients in public hospitals, who are entitled to treatment as public patients, can be assigned as private patients, but this can be used as a potential bar to a patient accessing treatment abroad later in the treatment process.  A restrictive policy context has been brought into the treatment abroad scheme.  It was always a basic thing that if a consultant recommended treatment abroad, the patient should get it.  Will the Minister indicate that the Government will change direction and make the scheme far more accessible for people who are entitled to it?</p></speech>

We are all agreed, and I have just said, that sections of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na treated Joanne Hayes and her family in a disgraceful way.  I remember the case and a friend of mine, the late Steve McDonogh, published a book highlighting how Joanne was treated.  Yesterday, I raised concerns about funding and resources available to GSOC as the lead agency to investigate allegations against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Taoiseach glibly replied that he did not know of any public body which did not want more staff.  This is in the face of Ms Justice Ring saying she cannot conclude investigations arising from protected disclosures.  We are also all agreed that there are lessons to be learnt from the Kerry babies tragedy.  One of the lessons would be to address the concerns raised by Ms Justice Ring and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to do that.  For her to say she cannot bring investigations to a conclusion is very damning and should not be dismissed.</p></speech>

I am glad we will debate it soon but will the Minister be engaging with Mandate and ICTU to take on board the criticisms that have been levelled at the proposed Bill?  These include the question of eliminating the exemptions for casual workers, reducing the time for which the protections kick in as the current 18 months limit would exclude the workers outside, the need to narrow the bands, and the need to deal with bogus self-employment, which I know the Minister has separately referenced as an issue that will be dealt with but is not included in the current draft of the Bill.</p></speech>

We have been trying to extend the community hospital in Clogheen in Tipperary for six or seven years.  It is a fabulous facility and excellent care is provided there.  A number of local organisations, Friends of St. Theresa's and Boston Scientific, have contributed &euro;400,000 to the extension which has got planning permission and for which a builder has been appointed.  The Minister visited the hospital on 15 September 2017 and we were promised that works would start before the end of 2017, but there is no sign of any work at the moment.  It is totally embarrassing and Boston Scientific has stated that it will reallocate the money to another project because it has a timescale.  The fundraisers are highly embarrassed because people, such as families and former patients, made contributions in good faith but there is no <i>quid pro quo</i>from the HSE.  When is it going to progress this development?  Will it be included in the capital plan, which we are told will be announced imminently?</p></speech>

I gave a commitment then to fix the issue and the anomaly in respect of the 42,000 people, 60% of whom are women and 40% men, who are currently disadvantaged by the changes that were made in 2012.

The Government and, in particular, the Taoiseach talk repeatedly about supporting rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I note from a press notification that the Taoiseach indicated last night to the farmers at the IFA conference that he would be a champion of the self-employed and people who get up early in the morning.  He went on to say that nobody gets up earlier than farmers.  He is right about that; they get up very early.  However, they have no access to broadband to do much of the work that they are now required to do online, to communicate with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The T&aacute;naiste will be familiar with that work from his time in the Department.  Their children, who study in school and come home to do their projects, do not have access to high-speed broadband.  Those who go on to college and come home at the weekends to work on the farms and assist their parents to live and work there do not have access to high-speed broadband to do their college work.

As we all know, there have been numerous cases where ambulances have taken an hour to reach patients in life-threatening circumstances.  We also know that the policy of dynamic deployment is failing and will not work.  Paramedics and ambulance drivers are being put under pressure to travel long distances to reach an incident.

There is a total investment of over &euro;130 million in roads in Sligo included in the capital plan.  There are some significant projects which are about planning for future growth and expansion to ensure Sligo will be able to fulfil its potential, including in terms of the regional impact it can have in the north west.  I expect a lot of positive news for people in Sligo in upcoming plans.</p></speech>

I am looking for support for eight young people with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities who are seeking places in a secondary school.  They are in an excellent ASD unit in Scoil Na Naomh Uilig.  For the past 12 months, with others, including their parents and the principal of the school, I have been seeking appropriate places at second level.  It is incredible to think eight to ten years after they started in primary school in a mainstream setting they now have no place to go to.  We have been down the road with SENOs and the Department, but absolutely no places have been identified.  There was a possibility of places being provided in a local school, but that option is no longer on the table.  The children may have to go to Dublin or Carlow in order to attend school.  When I raised the issue in December, the Minister said he would get back to me, but I have heard nothing since.  On behalf of the children, parents, school and community, something needs to be done.  As the children and their parents need help, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to prioritise the issue.  Will he ask the Minister to meet me and the parents of the children?</p></speech>

They are not the only eight young people who are having difficulties in transitioning from primary to secondary school in terms of the provision of special needs supports.  The Deputy has raised the issue with the Minister and I will raise it with him again and make sure he will come back to the Deputy with a response.</p></speech>

Yesterday a list of forthcoming legislation was published by the Government.  Amazingly, despite the significant housing crisis, there was no mention of an affordable housing scheme.  Many citizens remain excluded from the housing market.  The Government made a commitment to resolve the housing crisis, yet we will not have an affordable housing scheme.  When will we see such a scheme?  What is holding things up?  It is not rocket science to introduce a proper system.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that this is the Government's second term and we still have not seen an affordable housing scheme.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste's colleague, Brian Hayes, MEP, took a cut off the Department and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the issue of motor insurance.  Businesses across the country are facing increased insurance costs.  People are considering the viability of their businesses because of the cost of insurance, particularly in areas where there is a large footfall.  We will debate section 39 organisations later today.  St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville has seen its insurance costs increase from &euro;100,000 to almost &euro;500,000, which is incredible.  No decisive action is being taken by the Government with the insurance industry which is crippling householders, businesses and section 39 organisations.</p></speech>

It was decided to review the insurance industry, an approach which was led by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, when he held a different brief.  For the most part, the report and recommendations have been implemented and resulted in motor insurance premiums stabilising.  The changes will have a positive impact over time.  Phase 2 of the approach taken was to examine business insurance costs.  The process is under way, but the group has not yet reported.  When it does, we will take the same approach that we took to the cost of motor insurance, namely, making sure we implement the recommendations made.</p></speech>

I refer to the north-west region or CHO 1 as it is called in the HSE.</p><p>We have 204 children waiting for initial assessment in the child and adolescent mental health services.  Sixteen of those are waiting for more than a year and a further six of them are waiting more than 15 months.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste, like me and many others in this House, have spoken to some of the children but more so to the parents and friends of those children who are going through difficult times.  For some of them it is depression, others anxiety, eating disorders or ADHD, while still others are self-harming.  We know that the prevalence of self-harming in this State is dramatic.</p> <p> The fact that children who are vulnerable have to wait for more than a year and in some cases 15 months for initial assessment is a complete and abject failure of this State to look after the welfare of those children.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste what he and the Government are going to do.  We have 30% vacancies within CAHMS across the State.  What is the Government going to do to ensure that those children and their families do not have to worry about their mental health anymore and that when they reach out for support from the State, it reaches back a hand of support to help them through their difficulties?</p></speech>

Clearly, services are not as good as they need to be in many parts of the country.  Waiting lists are too long and we are working to reduce them with some positive results, certainly in the second half of last year.  The instances Deputy Doherty outlined are examples of the need for reform, increased investment and increased staffing numbers in certain sectors to improve services, in particular for children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700019#R01200"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to extend the minimum notice period for a tenancy termination by a landlord, to make rent data available to tenants, and to increase the maximum value of fines applying.</blockquote><p>I seek leave to introduce the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018.  There can be no doubt that we are living in the middle of a housing emergency.  Rents are at record levels.  Homelessness is at record levels.  The supply of new housing is painfully slow.  It does not take a genius to work out that there is a clear connection between each of those three phenomena.</p><p>Many people are affected by this dreadful negative spiral but one of the groups most vulnerable to homelessness is those living in private rented accommodation.  There is growing evidence to show that since the introduction of the 4% rent cap in rent pressure zones, some landlords are seeking to avoid the limits by terminating the tenancy of their existing tenants and using some exemptions in legislation to justify large rent increases for their new tenants.  How else can one explain the 11% increase in rents in Cork, for example, or the 10% increase in Dublin?  That has put some tenants in a very precarious position, especially those who are in short-term tenancies.</p><p>Under current law, a landlord is required to give a minimum of just 28 days' notice of termination to his or her tenants.  The period increases the longer the tenancy is in existence, but two and a half years into the tenancy, for instance, the notice period is still only 56 days.  It is almost impossible in the current housing market for tenants, or the homeless services that support them, to find alternative accommodation with such short notice.  The short notice period is undoubtedly a factor in the surge in homelessness.  Accordingly, the first item in the Bill is to help to reduce the risk of homelessness by introducing a new minimum notice period of 90 days for all tenancies of less than one year's duration and 120 days for all tenancies between one and five years' duration.  That would bring Ireland into line with countries such as France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany where generally a minimum notice period of three months or more is required.</p><p>The second proposed change in the Bill is to address one of the anomalies in the legislation that set up the rent pressure zones.  At the moment, there is no way in which a new tenant can test whether the 4% cap is being applied correctly by the landlord.  Section 3 provides that new tenants would have access to details of the amount of rent paid by previous tenants.  This would ensure that there is a check available to tenants on whether the maximum rent increase charged in designated rent pressure zones is being applied correctly.</p><p>The third proposal is to increase the maximum penalty that applies under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Under current law, if a landlord breaches the requirements on minimum notice periods, a maximum penalty of just &euro;4,000 applies.  The Bill would raise that to &euro;15,000.</p><p>Overall, the Bill proposes three simple changes to legislation to strengthen the rights of tenants and to help reduce the risk of homelessness.  A wide range of additional measures are required such as a proper cap on rents, measures to prevent tenancies ending because the accommodation is being sold, proper policing of exemptions used by landlords, far stiffer penalties on rogue landlords, and clearer responsibilities for tenants.  We also need an efficient and timely dispute resolution system which is adequately resourced.  We note that the Government has promised action in some of these areas and we look forward to dealing with such legislation as soon as possible.  In the meantime, however, we strongly urge support for the measures proposed in this Bill.  They are a genuine attempt to help reduce homelessness and strengthen tenants' rights, and we urge Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill.</p></speech>

I assumed I would be speaking to Minister of State Deputy Finian McGrath, about this because I have spoken to him about it previously.</p>  <p>  It is with deep concern that, once again, I must raise with the Minister of State the fact that there is no psychologist providing services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 years in the Waterford area.  In Waterford Community Services, there are 1.6 whole-time equivalent staff providing early intervention psychological services.  An additional senior psychologist commenced towards the end of last August, which is very welcome.  This brought the figure up to 2.8 whole-time equivalent posts, but this increase has still not resulted in the targeting of the children between six and 18.</p>  <p>  I have had several meetings with parents, Oireachtas Members and the staff of the HSE over the past two years.  The HSE staff in Waterford have made the decision to aim all the psychological resources at those between birth and six.  As we all know, early intervention is key and the most headway is made at an early age.  I, for one, am not criticising what the staff do.  They are the experienced psychologists but I have just outlined the facts of the matter.  This is an extremely difficult decision for any team to make.  Although the section is understaffed, however, the service provided is excellent once a child can gain access to it.  I genuinely thank the team involved.  It does fantastic work with limited resources.</p>  <p>  When a child in Waterford reaches his or her sixth birthday, the service of a psychologist stops.  It is non-existent.  All the good work in the previous years lies dormant, with no follow-up of any substance.  The children aged six are placed on a waiting list and the average waiting period is three years.  This means the service simply ceases for a child in need of support who has just taken the first steps in formal education and who is learning how to cope in a classroom environment and learning new coping, socialising and behavioural skills, or for the parents of that child.</p>  <p>  Mothers have sat in front of me and cried when their children turned six, knowing the excellent support their children received previously and the improvements made through early intervention would just stop.  A mother told me yesterday that her son, who was recommended for emergency intervention 18 months ago, is still waiting.  He is aged 11.  Parents are trying to fumble their way through meeting their children's needs and demands.  They are doing their best, hoping they are proceeding correctly, and they have no guidance or input from the professionals when their child reaches the age of six.</p>  <p>  Just before the summer recess, Deputy Cullinane and I brought two parents from Waterford here to meet the Minister and HSE representatives.  They said they would consider the issue, but unfortunately parents have informed me nothing has changed in regard to those aged between six and 18.  How can the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE stand over a system in which a group of children with disabilities, in their formative years and who are crying out for help are unable to gain access to services when they reach the age of six?  This has been permitted to go on for too long.  It results in isolation and a sense of betrayal among parents in addition to a sense that their children are not regarded as worthy of services.  The Government, including the Minister of State, does not want to be responsible for this.  Fundamentally, it wants to ensure that all children in need of services are treated equally.  Unfortunately, because the children in question live in Waterford, this is not the case.</p>  <p>  The reason I draw attention to this matter today is based on an answer I received to a parliamentary question as late as last September.  The line in the response that is so damning states there is no psychologist providing services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 years and living in the Waterford area.  That is the fact of the matter.</p></speech>

I am pleased to outline the position on psychological services for children with disabilities, including autism, in Waterford.  Waterford disability services provide a range of multidisciplinary supports and services for children with disability, including early intervention for those between birth and six, and school-age services for those between six and 18.  There have been significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for assessment, including for autism spectrum disorder, and for disability services generally, which has led to delays in timeframes.</p>  <p>  With reference to psychology posts, there are 3.8 whole-time equivalent psychologists providing services within Waterford early intervention services to children up to six years of age.  There is currently no psychologist providing dedicated services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 in the Waterford area.  This is due to a combination of factors, including increased referral rates and demand for services ,which outweigh current capacity, more complex cases presenting, and a reduction in trained paediatric staff available to address the waiting lists.  There is also a national shortage of psychologists.  However, every effort is being made in the area to examine the available resources across children's disability services as a whole and find a solution for the provision of this service to children of school age.  There is also some limited psychology service provision as part of a pilot project in Waterford city for those between six and 18 years.</p>  <p>  The HSE regrets the difficulties in accessing psychology services.  It is seeking to reduce the waiting times and address issues arising for all children and their families through a number of measures, including outsourcing some services for children with ASD to reduce waiting times.</p></speech>

I acknowledge he has to read out what has been given to him but unfortunately it states once again that the service is not available for children aged between six and 18.  We are going to have to find a solution, and I believe we can.  I welcome the pilot programme, although it is phased.  It is a small step in the right direction that will deal initially with some children in Waterford city.  We need this programme rolled out across the whole city and county, however.  I definitely regard it as a step in the right direction.</p>  <p>  An issue arose over the posts.  There were originally 1.6, which increased to 2.8.  There are now 3.8 but the additional post is only temporary for 12 months.  Savings found in a different department were allocated to increase the number to 3.8, but the post is not permanent.  The fundamental point is that we need whole-term equivalent senior psychologists.  We need to be guaranteed at least six of them.  I acknowledge it is all down to budgets but, ultimately, when the HSE states there is no psychologist available to a child aged between six and 18 in Waterford, just because of where he or she is living, it is very damning.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to play one county against another but I refer to Kilkenny because it has a similar population base.  Kilkenny actually has six posts.  We have 2.8 permanent posts and the same population.  We need to find a solution and find one fast.  The only way we will find one is by having permanent posts because, unfortunately, it is very hard for any qualified psychologist to uproot himself or herself and his or her family and move to Waterford if the post there is not guaranteed and is only temporary for 12 months.  I welcome the small steps regarding the pilot programme but I believe the only way forward is to get some kind of guarantee that we will have whole-term equivalent senior psychologists.</p></speech>

In addition, her constructive approach has been very consistent.  She has been consistent on this matter, and it deserves more attention.</p>  <p>  As it happened, I had a number of meetings on more global issues this morning.  They covered the provision of services to young people, in particular, and trying to deal with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, waiting list.  These matters are all connected.  There is a shortage of psychologists.  This is difficult for me and the Department, and much more difficult for those waiting to gain access to services.  To address this, we must examine how we do what we do and start doing it in a different way.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be well aware, a consultant psychiatrist heads each CAMHS team but the reality is that we cannot have a consultant psychiatrist filling every gap that exists.  There are similar difficulties at psychologist level.  We are currently trying to recruit assistant psychologists.  Assistant psychologist is a lower grade.  "Grade" might be the wrong word but I refer to a lower level of intervention.  We are trying to recruit 114 assistant psychologists, which is proving challenging.  In the next year, I hope to roll out a system whereby we would operate a scheme such as CAMHS but with lower level intervention services for children across the country, thereby trying to fill in the gaps with assistant psychologists.</p>  <p>  This morning, I said to my officials in the Department that I would like to see tele-psych services in operation.  IT has enormous potential in the area of mental health.  It does not with physical health.  There would not be a need for a consultant psychiatrist to travel 100 km from one post to another if the patient could avail of tele-psych services in a primary care centre through digital technology.  The technology is so advanced nowadays that the experience would be the exact same as sitting in a room with the psychiatrist.</p><p>There are new ways at which my team and I are looking to address these issues.  I will continue my drive and focus in that regard.  I will also continue to keep a close eye on the service in Waterford and liaise with the Deputy on it.  I appreciate that by raising it here she has provided me with an opportunity to focus on the particular matter to see if we can address the significant issues involved, particularly the disparity between the numbers employed in Kilkenny and Waterford.  I will also take up the Deputy's point about whole-time equivalents with the HSE.</p></speech>

One of the core areas in the better balancing of population will be Cork, particularly the Cork metropolitan area.  I have tabled parliamentary questions before on this matter to the Minister, but I felt it was important to tease out the details with him in the Chamber.</p><p>The population growth targeted by Cork City Council and Cork County Council is substantial.  A target of 850,000 for the county has been set, with a population of 500,000 in the metropolitan area by 2050.  Significant road projects are planned for Cork such as the M28, the Dunkettle interchange upgrade and other similar important projects which need to be delivered.  Even when these projects are delivered, however, with such a level of growth in population predicted, if we continue to rely to the extent we do on the car as the main mode of transport in and around Cork city, the roads mentioned will be full again in ten years.</p><p>What is needed is a real vision for Cork.  No one in Cork expects immediate delivery of light rail or bus rapid transport schemes.  What is clear, however, is that such projects take a substantial amount of time to deliver.  We propose that the process begin now.  The Minister and the Department should express clearly that they are, in principle, in favour of the development of light rail and bus rapid transit schemes in Cork in the interim.  The process of planning these projects can then begin.  While clearly they would be complex and expensive, they are absolutely essential as the population of the city and surrounding areas will increase enormously in the coming period.  The road from Ballincollig to Carrigtwohill, along which the city is developing, is 30 km long.  It requires servicing, but to ensure we intensify development within the area, there is a need for quality public transport.  To unlock the potential of the enormous docklands area in the middle of the city, it needs to be linked.  We do not need thousands of additional cars coming into the city centre from the docklands.  We need to have as many of those people as possible coming in by public transport.</p><p>This development needs to be phased.  In the interim, I would be in favour of the Minister looking at schemes such as a bus rapid transit system.  Cork City Council has examined such models in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.  In the longer run that is where we need to get to.  Cork City Council included such proposals in its submission to the national planning framework process.  Cork Chamber of Commerce has also emphasised the issue.  Its chief executive, Mr. Conor Healy, recently stated:</p><blockquote>What we need to ensure now is that we are planning, that there is early investment going in and that the Government is recognising the need for investment in transport infrastructure in Cork outside of the traditional modes.  With the scale of Cork's growth and development, it needs a new form of public transport over the next number of years to ensure we are building properly for the future.</blockquote><p>It is that recognition of the need identified that is required at this stage.  The initial setting of plans and their development can then occur.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.  This is not just a need in Cork, as Green Party and Labour Party Deputies have also identified similar needs in other cities as part of investing in the shift nationally from the car to greater use of public transport.</p></speech>

I certainly do not give the impression that Dublin is the only place in which there is a chronic traffic problem and public transport need.  That is not the case.  I acknowledge and recognise the needs of Cork which should be addressed.  They need to be and will be addressed, funds permitting.  My top priority in the next few years is to increase rapidly investment in public transport in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and other areas, while also increasing public transport services.  Budget 2018 provided for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment in public transport, with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion to 2021.  It will enable us to enhance the capacity and quality of the public transport network across the cities to ensure that, as far as possible and practical, increased transport demand will be met by greener public transport.</p>  <p>  The need for investment in public transport infrastructure and services in Cork city and the manner in which they will be provided in the coming years is being examined as part of a transport strategy being prepared for the Cork metropolitan area.  The transport strategy will address all transport modes and its objective will be to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Cork metropolitan area in the next two decades or so.  It will be used to inform transport investment levels and investment prioritisation in both the longer and shorter terms.  It will be able to inform sustainable integrated land use and transport policy formulation at the strategic CMA level and the local level.  The strategy which commenced in mid-2017 is being prepared for the National Transport Authority, in conjunction with Cork City Council and Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is expected that a draft transport strategy will be published for public consultation by the end of February.  It will include a range of proposed transport interventions across all modes of transport, with complementary measures, including transport demand management, intelligent transport systems and park and ride facilities.  The strategy will be finalised in the light of the feedback received.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that between 2014 and 2017 over &euro;20 million was allocated to Cork City Council and Cork County Council under the regional cities programme which is managed on behalf of my Department by the NTA.  Further funding of &euro;130 million was provided in budget 2018 for the next four years for a sustainable urban transport programme, also to be managed by the NTA, which will build on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects.  It will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster higher quality public transport services in the main cities.  Funding is also provided for the NTA for accessibility programmes to improve access to public transport in the regional cities.  In the case of the Cork City Council area, the investment has been focused on the implementation of the city centre movement strategy and several radially based strategic transport corridors, linking the city centre with the city's suburbs and county environs.  In the case of the Cork metropolitan area, the sustainable urban transport programme will continue to be focused on the Douglas area, based on the recommendations of the Douglas land use and transportation study, DLUTS.  The principal objectives of the study are to reduce congestion, improve local connectivity by sustainable transport modes and the performance of the many bus services operating through the area, complementing the transport investment made in the city centre and strategic corridors.</p></speech>

The transport strategy is welcome and I look forward to examining it when it is published.  I hope it will show the ambition required.  I am aware of some of the items which have been funded, including the city centre movement strategy and the DLUTS.  There are many good points in them, but most of them have to do with managing traffic.  While that is welcome and will help to reduce congestion, I do not believe that, in and of itself, it will be central to ensuring a shift from the car.</p><p>A great deal of ambition has been shown by Cork City Council, Cork County Council and Cork Chamber of Commerce in planning for Cork as a significant European city and a sizable balance to Dublin.  Those targets will not be reached by accident but through investment.  It will ultimately require a serious, substantial effort in areas such as infrastructure, particularly in public transport, so that the density of the population in and around city centre areas in particular and through the area as a whole is intensified.  This is crucial to ensure that we get that increase in population.  The Minister has given the current Department position and the official answers.  Much of that is welcome and positive but, while I am not expecting budgetary commitments or anything like that, I want to hear if the Minister agrees in principle that an investment of this kind for the delivery, in the medium term, of a light rail and bus rapid transit system in Cork is essential and that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is likely to support something like that in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

It is desirable.  The Deputy is looking for public transport solutions in Cork city which will include light rail and bus rapid transit.  I will say unequivocally that they are not ruled out.  I do not want to make commitments.  The Deputy knows it is foolish to make commitments under the financial constraints with which we work.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has taken the lead in looking at this and the transport strategy.  These solutions are certainly not ruled out and I would agree with the Deputy that such systems are desirable.  He will be aware that the NTA has made it clear, as have I, that while BusConnects is starting in Dublin, the intention if it is successful is to expand it to other cities, which should include Cork.  I would address exactly the same principles and have the same enthusiasm for any project which is successful or necessary in Dublin or in Cork, and such projects should be promoted.  It is an indication of our goodwill for this that we and communities are putting so much money into BusConnects in Dublin with the intention of expanding it to other cities as soon as possible.</p></speech>

About a year ago, the N11 became a car park at about 7.30 a.m.  It is now a car park near Kilmacanogue and some of the Bray junctions by about 6.45 a.m.  It is a problem that is rapidly getting worse and thousands upon thousands of men and women, in the morning and in the evening, are stuck in this gridlock and are desperately looking for targeted investment in the N11 to alleviate the congestion.  I have written to the Minister about this many times and I have requested several meetings with him, all of which have been refused, which is why I have had to bring it to the floor of the House.  However, I have been working closely with some State agencies.  In April last year, following requests, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, completed a needs assessment of the route around north Wicklow and it concluded that there was a serious congestion problem.  It helpfully identified targeted investment that was required.  Some of it related to upgrading junctions and some related to a third lane being provided between junction 6, which is the central Bray exit, and junction 8.  The report states: "Any further delay in investment in this section of the M11/N11 will lead to further increases in congestion along the corridor and indeed within the wider area; and will further constrain growth in the north and east of Wicklow and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown area, as a result of reduced competitiveness and productivity."</p>  <p>  In December, TII informed me that it is proceeding with procuring professional services to start putting documentation together for the design of the pieces of road it has identified to alleviate congestion.  It also confirmed to me that no funding has been made available from the Department to proceed with the work.  We have a major road network, the N11, the main artery for commuters from Wicklow to and from Dublin.  We have a capacity study from the State which confirms that there is a serious and growing issue; a study from the State which identifies solutions to that issue; and a report from the State confirming that failure to invest will not only make it worse but will further harm economic development in the area, but unfortunately we have no funding.  I raise the issue in light of a recent An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling on a development for the old Fassaroe area for 3,000 houses, an active open space, hopefully a sports campus and community hub and many local jobs.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la gave three reasons for refusing it.  Two would be easily dealt with by any future development plan but the third, which can only be dealt with by this Government and the Minister, is that with the congestion, the capacity on the N11 simply does not exist to allow this to happen.  In the middle of a housing crisis, we have a development ready to go which would provide approximately 3,000 houses, local jobs and a sports campus, but lack of investment in the N11 is probably the single biggest impediment to that.  Given all that, does the Minister accept TII's findings that the congestion is serious and getting worse and that failure to invest is damaging Wicklow and will continue to damage Wicklow and parts of south Dublin?  Does he accept that failure to invest is stopping the development of 3,000 new houses in Fassaroe and everything that goes with that?  Will he commit to seeking further investment for the project to alleviate congestion on the N11?  Will he commit to seeking the funding required for this upgrade in the forthcoming capital investment plan?</p></speech>

I feel that what he is saying represents me as much as anybody else and maybe with more eloquence than I have done so far when I have made representations about this myself.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority has statutory responsibility for the implementation and development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, including Wicklow.  The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for 2016 to 2035 provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades, including development of improved public transport links for County Wicklow.  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  There were very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis because of the national financial position.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years and I envisage that this emphasis on maintaining the assets we have will continue into the next capital plan period.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan - Building on Recovery for 2016-2021 and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward to restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for some investment in road improvement schemes.  The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten year capital investment plan will align with the existing capital plan as supplemented as part of the capital plan review.</p><p>As regards the M11-N11, as the Deputy said, a strategic study of this road corridor from its junction with the M50 to junction 14 at Cullenmore was undertaken by TII, working closely with Wicklow County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the NTA.  This study provides an overview of the measures to enhance capacity on this section of road which could be implemented on a phased basis.</p> <p> The additional funding being provided following the capital plan review will facilitate the start of work related to the findings of the corridor study.  In this context, I understand that it is the intention of Tll to add this scheme to the pipeline of schemes at planning stage.  In this regard, I can confirm that TII is appointing consultants to start work on the scheme appraisal and business case as required in the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework.  In conjunction with this, a safety scheme to provide a parallel service road to the southbound lane in Kilmacanogue is being developed and it is hoped that this project will proceed to construction, subject to planning approval, in late 2018.  I hope the Deputy will regard those two measures as progress.</p> <p> As regards the timing for the implementation of measures identified in the M11-N11 corridor study, following ten years of retrenchment there are many potential projects across the country in respect of national, regional and local roads.  The scope for progressing new road improvement projects will depend on the capital funding allocated to my Department under the proposed ten-year capital investment plan.  Given the many competing demands, the appraisal and prioritisation of projects in line with the requirements of the public spending code and my Department's capital appraisal framework will be key to assessing which suitable major and minor national road projects can be advanced and the timeframe for implementation.  I will certainly keep in mind the Deputy's representations and, indeed, my own self-interest when I am making those considerations.  That last remark is frivolous just in case it is taken up the wrong way.</p></speech>

Most of the answer is Civil Service boilerplate text.  It essentially says that future investments will be considered in line with the future investment strategy at some point in the future.  I acknowledge that minor work is being done to the southbound route at Kilmacanogue, which is useful.  However, much of the early morning congestion occurs around the village in the northbound route.  There is nothing in the reply that says there will be relief of the existing congestion.  It will get worse.  I appreciate there are demands for capital investment in roads all over the country but the N11 is an extreme case.  Anecdotally, every morning, given every road that could be reported on in the country by AA Roadwatch, early congestion on the N11 features.  Most roads are not car parks by 6.45 a.m.  On top of that, there is a lack of public transport.  There is over-capacity on Irish Rail heading north in the morning.  The chief executive officer of the company told me that this will worsen over the coming years because no new rolling stock will be available.  Most of County Wicklow is not well served by buses and, therefore, the only available option for many workers from the county is to use the N11.  Will the Minister request from his Department or the relevant State agency a comparative analysis to identify where the congestion is worst in the list of competing demands, which I accept?  Which roads are the first to become congested in the morning?  If the N11 is on the list, I ask that priority be given this year to the design and implementation of the works identified by TII for the road.  North Wicklow has been identified as a high growth area.  The development in Fassaroe will provide 3,000 houses in the middle of a housing crisis.  The biggest impediment to that is lack of investment in the N11.  Will the Minister factor that in?  Perhaps he will write back to me or we can meet to see if that can help expedite investment to alleviate the ongoing congestion.</p></speech>

I take his point about Fassaroe and the 3,000 houses, which is important.  He will, however, have to understand that the competing demands are overwhelming sometimes and it is difficult.  I cannot just come to the House and say, "Yes, you are going jump the queue".  This morning, I met a delegation from Meath, which raised similar problems.  This is a country-wide issue and does not only affect Dublin.  I understand the case the Deputy has made.  The TII has acknowledged the problems he has identified in its report and it has addressed them but the problem is funding and priority.  It is something that we will undoubtedly address in the future.  The order in which projects is decided will be subject to the appraisal required under the public spending code.  My Department examines the cost and urgency of projects on a regular basis and it will decide in co-operation with the NTA, stakeholders and myself which are the priorities.  I take the points the Deputy has made.  Five phases are planned for the N11-M11.  The first phase is being addressed and if he wishes, I will meet him and discuss that with him.  I apologise if I have not replied to requests for meetings with him.  Of course, I will meet him.  That must be some hitch in the system.  I am happy to do that and I hope he will acknowledge that we will regard this as a problem which is a matter of urgency but along with many other problems which are matters of similar urgency on our roads.</p></speech>

For the first few years, the Government completely dismissed that warning.  Now that we have a housing crisis, which has become an emergency, the Government has finally acknowledged it but if the announcement yesterday in the newspapers is anything to go by, far from the learning the lessons of its failed policies which have produced this crisis, the Government continues to persist with its addiction to privatisation and a dependence on private developers to provide the social and affordable housing we need when they patently will not do that because they are driven by profit.  We have been calling for a new State agency that will deliver housing for six years.  We said specifically that NAMA's assets and resources should be used to deliver social and affordable housing.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that could be tricky because of state aid rules.  Let us be clear for the public what they are.  They are ideological, market driven rules of the EU which say the state cannot distort the market by building public housing or public infrastructure without private sector involvement.  The Taoiseach says we cannot do that but we can have an agency, which will, according to the reports, assemble the hundreds of sites that are currently owned by the public and for the purpose of delivering housing, these land banks will then be sold to private developers to construct private social and affordable homes as well are as for commercial use.  What on earth is the Government doing setting up a new public private partnership handing over public land which should be used now to provide public and affordable housing?</p><p>I heard the Taoiseach say we do not just need council houses, we need affordable housing.  I agree, but where is the evidence that private developers or the private sector are going to deliver either of those things?  Private developers are in it for profit.  Average house prices in south Dublin are now &euro;560,000.  What on earth makes the Government think private developers are going to make those prices affordable?</p> <p> With regard to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding the Government promised would deliver some affordable housing, we discover in the case of Cherrywood that it may deliver as little as 2% of the overall development as affordable, and even that will not be affordable because it will be in the region of &euro;300,000.  What on earth is the Government doing?  It is planning to hand over 800 public sites to this new agency which, if it has to comply with state aid rules, will be majority privately owned by private developers in public private partnerships.  We look at what happened with Carillion during the week, where public private partnerships collapsed, resulting in schools in this country and across Britain being put in serious trouble because they were dependent on the private sector.</p> <p> I would like clarity on this plan.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is not the way forward.  What we need is public housing built on public land by a public construction company and local authorities.</p></speech>

The Deputy refers to an article in today's newspaper but it actually refers to a part of our national planning framework document which has been circulating here for the last year.  I raised this issue recently at the Committee on Rural and Community Development because it is one we have flagged in Ireland 2040 as a mechanism to manage land.  That is what we are discussing here and it is what I will focus on.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming national planning framework, Ireland 2040 Our Plan, estimates that by 2040 our country will grow in population by 1 million people, who will need at least 500,000 new homes, half of which are likely to be in key cities.  It is vital, therefore, that we implement planning policies that achieve compact, smart growth in both our urban and rural areas.  Drawing on the positive experience and delivery achieved under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which incentivised Departments and agencies, in collaboration with local authorities, to pool resources in delivering a major enhancement of supply of serviced lands for housing, I expect that the new national development plan being prepared by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on behalf of the Government will deliver a number of initiatives to support sustainable growth in Ireland's five cities and other large urban centres as well as in our small towns and villages.  This will involve using existing land sites, particularly infill sites in built-up areas, which is a key element in preventing sprawl which is unsustainable and represents a backward step in proper planning.  Central to this will be a new approach to the delivery and location of the homes that society will need over the next decade and beyond.  We need an integrated approach to housing development and management of the land needed for housing, including publicly owned or local authority housing.  We also need mechanisms put in place to ensure a plan-led and delivery-focused approach to securing compact smart growth in line with the national planning framework principles and priorities.</p>  <p>  The Government also recognises that to ensure that plans get implemented and that housing is built in a more affordable way, both by the State and by wider housing providers, as well as being more affordable to buy and rent for our citizens and households, the State must take a stronger role and lead in managing its own lands for strategic Government policy purposes.  Again, we discussed at the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and at the Committee on Rural and Community Development the need for local authorities to be in a position of strength to manage land and to be able to dictate what happens on that land.  We must not just zone it and walk away, but actually make it happen in places where we want it to happen.</p>  <p>  Recognising this public policy need and the need for cross-Government work, the Government is considering the establishment of a new public development and renewal agency under the national planning framework that will work with local authorities and that will have the power and capacity either to use public lands or buy other lands in the right locations for future public and private housing provision that will be affordable for housing providers to develop and for people to buy or rent.  It is not about selling off State land.  It is about combining landbanks in order that housing is built in a sustainable way and in the right place according to the timelines we want and at an affordable price, which is exactly what the Deputy has wanted for years.  He should not try to scaremonger and say it is about selling off State lands because it is not.  It is about trying to manage lands.  Whether we take this route, we have flagged it in the national planning framework and it is something we will tease out over the months ahead.</p>  <p>  It is the intention that such an agency would work with local authorities in assembling and releasing key and strategic areas for renewal and revitalisation, and it will have access to publicly owned but redundant or underutilised lands suitable for redevelopment designated by the Government.  Such an agency would also help to create a national centre of expertise in development and renewal to ensure that existing lands are utilised to their fullest and best extent, and in a manner which complements the sustainable planning and development of our urban and rural areas.  The Government will be considering these issues fully in the context of the finalisation of the national planning framework and the national development plan in the coming weeks.  It is to achieve proper land use and land management in order that we can achieve affordable housing, not just for the next two or three years, but for the next 25, 30 and 40 years.  That is what we are about - looking ahead and putting the State in a position, with local authorities, to be able to manage land and deliver housing.  We do not want just to talk about it but to make it happen.  That is what we are considering here and it has been flagged in the national planning framework for the past year.</p></speech>

There are 96,000 families who are waiting up to 15 years on housing lists because they cannot afford the prices in the market, either for rental or purchase.  There are 8,000 people, including 3,000 children, in emergency accommodation.  There are 70,000 people in mortgage arrears, many of whom face the possible repossession of their homes.  There are tens of thousands of people who are being evicted or face potential eviction because of rent increases by the private sector which wants to make more profit from the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Against that background, the Minister of State is talking about an agency which is going to hand over, partially or fully, public land to private developers who in turn, supposedly, are going to give us social and affordable housing when there is no evidence whatsoever they will do that.  In Cherrywood, as I pointed out, a new town of 8,000 houses is being built.  While the State has put a lot of money into that, and although it was on NAMA land that it sold to a private developer for a song, it appears we will only get 2% affordable housing for the money we put in.  That is not going to deal with the crisis.  There is no point in them building houses for &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 if the vast majority of people who work in this country or who are dependent on social welfare cannot afford them.  In fact, that is what led to the last crisis, given we had houses being built in their tens of thousands that nobody could afford.  What we need to do is build public and affordable housing on the public land we have and use the resources and cash of NAMA to build public and affordable housing that is not built for profit.  Instead, what the Government is proposing is more privatisation.</p>  <p>  I will give an example.  Apollo House was sold to private developers and there is no residential or affordable housing there.  What is going to happen to Hawkins House, the Department of Health building, which is another site that could be used for public housing?  What about the motor taxation office?  Properties are being sold off to private developers and the public are getting nothing back.</p></speech>

Some 25,000 households who were not in a house last year are in a social house this year.  In the year ahead, there will be more than 8,000 new social houses available to the local authorities that were not there two years ago.  Despite all the Deputy's complaining, we are making progress.  We all accept it is not enough today to solve the housing crisis but adding thousands of houses every year is the only way we are going to solve that housing crisis.  Despite what the Deputy would like us to do, we are making progress.</p>  <p>  The discussion today is about making plans for the future.  It is, of course, a matter for the Government and the relevant Ministers, in this case Deputies Donohoe and Murphy, to reflect on the most appropriate and effective structures to deliver on our ambitious plans in Ireland 2040.  Again, it is about where we build the next 500,000 homes, where we locate people and how we compact our cities and ensure rural Ireland's towns and villages have life brought back into them.

I am keenly interested in how we handle this, and it is an issue we have discussed at committee on numerous occasions.</p><p>A development agency is worthy of consideration at national level, as it can provide an opportunity for a new approach to Government land management that drives the renewal of strategic areas that are not being utilised to the full potential and delivers the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework.</p> <p> What the Deputy wants us to do is what we are trying to do.  On publicly owned lands, it is our job to deliver, and we will do so, thousands of social houses and affordable homes.  We own approximately 800 sites, which will provide for in or around 50,000 social and affordable houses.  The Deputy should not try to muddy the water.  We are doing what we are doing and are making progress.  He might not like that progress, but we are achieving it and are continuing on our journey.</p></speech>

Section 39 organisations are those bodies funded by the HSE that provide a range of vital health and disability services across the country.  They include some of our local hospices, national organisations such as Rehab and the Irish Wheelchair Association, and local organisations like the Western Care Association in my constituency of County Mayo.  I welcome to the Public Gallery representatives, including unions, of workers in section 39 organisations.  Others are watching in because they could not travel to Dublin, unable to take time away from their important jobs.</p><p>Could the Minister of State imagine being the person with ministerial responsibility for disability services without section 39 organisations and their workers?  His job is already difficult, but could he imagine how much more difficult it would be without the work they do?  If he can imagine that, why can the D&aacute;il not give them their proper funding?  They provide essential services on a daily basis, including training and support to families in respite and to people with disabilities.  They make life-ending illnesses a little easier on the patient and the patient's family.  Just as the T&aacute;naiste did this morning, the Government keeps insisting that workers in section 39 organisations are not public servants, but no one can deny that they and these organisations provide an essential public service.</p><p>There has long been a link between the pay of those employed directly by the Government via the HSE and so-called section 38 organisations and those who work in the independent section 39 organisations.  That link has been confirmed by the Labour Court many times.  It was confirmed by the Taoiseach to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in this Chamber on 8 November.  It was reiterated in the manner in which the HSE implemented wage cuts under the Haddington Road agreement in 2014 and previous arrangements.</p><p>I have a letter written by a HSE area manager to a section 39 organisation in 2013.  Among other points, it reads:</p><blockquote>The clear intention is that all agencies including section 39 agencies are to make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost reduction measures, in line with other publicly funded bodies... The intention is that the menu of options and the underlying principles encompassed in the [Haddington Road agreement] will also be applied in respect of section 39 funded agencies and other voluntary providers and that their grants from the HSE will be adjusted accordingly... It is our intention [that is, the HSE's] to include in service agreements with all agencies, including those funded under section 39 the condition that staff should not be remunerated at levels above the statutory pay scales.</blockquote><p>This letter was written on 7 October 2013.  As such, it was clear in 2013 that the HSE was cutting its workers' salaries and that it considered that section 39 workers had to take the same reductions.  They took them, as they also did in 2010.</p><p>If it was good enough then to apply reductions, why is the Minister of State now putting his head in the sand and not providing the HSE with the resources necessary to give increases in line with the pay restoration that the House discussed immediately prior to Christmas?  It suited the Government at the time to say that reductions had to be applied, but it is now saying that section 39 workers are not public servants and, therefore, not entitled to pay restoration.  The Government hammered them with the same cuts.</p><p>If someone is a home help worker, a palliative care nurse, a worker in disability services or working overnight in a respite house and employed by a section 38 organisation or the HSE, that person is on the pay restoration path.  If someone is doing all those vital jobs under a section 39 organisation, that organisation will not have the resources to give him or her the same increase because the Government or the HSE has not provided the appropriate resources.</p><p>This situation cannot continue.  These organisations are losing workers to the HSE and section 38 organisations.  Vital skills and professionals are being taken from them because of the pay apartheid.  Their capacity to provide essential services is being compromised on a daily basis.  As some of them are not in a position to commit contractually under part 2 of the services schedule to a specific range of service provision, given that they cannot guarantee the availability of staff over this issue, the HSE is withholding further funding.  That is a double whammy for some of these essential organisations.</p><p>This cannot continue.  Members of the D&aacute;il need to combine.  On behalf of section 39 organisations, those who work in them and those who receive their services, it is time to say &quot;Stop&quot;.  It is time to put a process in place that will allow these workers to share in the pay restoration that their equivalents in HSE organisations are receiving.  It is time to stop passing the parcel from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department of Health and the HSE.  When that parcel is opened in the end, there is nothing in it for workers who are providing essential services.</p></speech>

From meeting with section 39 organisations as our spokesperson on health and a constituency Deputy, it is evident that these bodies, which provide wonderful health care and disability services, will be incapable of functioning if this situation continues.  We cannot have dedicated people who are providing essential services to those who need them being unappreciated in terms of pay restoration.  While we welcome the unwinding of the pay cuts that were implemented in recent years, the idea that we would not address the rights and entitlements of section 39 workers is not acceptable.  It is essential that we address them.</p>  <p>  I am primarily making this contribution because of the services that these workers deliver.  From travelling the country in his role as the Minster of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows well the importance of section 39 organisations and what they do.  Across the country, oversight, fiduciary duties, fundraising and capital investment are provided voluntarily.  We are simply asking that the State makes its contribution through pay restoration for the workers providing these essential services.  We are not asking for anything beyond that.</p>  <p>  It is incumbent on the Minister of State and the Government to at least put a process in place between now and March to address these issues.  The Government must determine how many section 39 organisations there are and budget for their cost implications.  All this must be done soon.  The matter must be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, if we are to start unwinding the pay cuts and ensure parity between section 38s and section 39s.  If the Government does not do this, there will be a continual downgrading of essential services in communities across the country.  Organisations will not be able to guarantee services because they will not be able to retain or recruit staff.</p>  <p>  The Government is getting exceptional value for money.  The many audits of section 39 bodies that were conducted during the downturn showed the majority to be exemplary in their financial prudence and efficiencies.</p><p>In my constituency there are many such examples.  It is evident across the county of Cork and the country and every Deputy is aware of it.  We need to ensure the Government acknowledges the importance of the role they play and is upfront on the issue of pay restoration in order that the workers will have their basic rights and entitlements restored, just like workers in section 38 organisations and the rest of the public service.  The Government must also ensure those who depend on the services provided will have an opportunity to avail of them from workers who have parity of esteem with those in section 38 organisations and the broader public service.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

I know that the Minister of State met representatives of St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville on 12 January 2017 when they outlined to him the issues involved in pay restoration.  I will speak specifically about how the issue is affecting St. Joseph's Foundation and the deficit in funding.  Everyone must accept that section 39 organisations are doing absolutely massive work.  St Joseph's Foundation has been a service provider for 50 years.  It has been expanding the services it provides.  It is looking at new therapies and better ways to help young people with disabilities.  It provides care from the cradle to the grave.  Its interaction with the local community and the way in which it supports it through fund raising are second to none.  However, organisations such as St. Joseph's Foundation are at a crucial juncture and what happens in 2018 will define them.</p>  <p>  We are calling on the Government to ensure flexibility on the block grant section 39 organisations must negotiate every year with the HSE.  There is no give or encouragement from the HSE which is constantly looking for cutbacks, value for money audits and so forth.  There is no doubt that funding for the organisations has been pared back to the bone in the past ten years and what happens in 2018 will tell a lot in how they move forward in recruiting and retaining staff if they do not receive adequate funding from the HSE.  The staff and boards of organisations such as St. Joseph's Foundation work so hard to comply with HSE regulations and budgets.  We are at a critical point and it will be a crying shame if critical services for clients of all ages are cut back because of staff shortages.  We were told back in November that there was reason to be hopeful with regard to pay restoration, but we are now in January and the issue is nowhere near to being resolved.  Pay restoration must be top of the agenda.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take this on board.  This is not just another Private Member's motion; it deals with a very serious issue that is affecting people at all levels and we need action to deal with it.  </p>  <p>  There are many other issues facing disability services.  This morning I raised the issue of insurance costs.  There are also issues for service providers in complying with HIQA regulations without the provision of additional funding.  One arm of the HSE is stating the service providers must comply with regulation A, B and C, while another is refusing to provide additional funding to enable them to do so.  This will cost services for people who badly need them unless the Government agrees to increase the block grants to section 39 organisations.  It will not be enough to increase the grant in 2019 or 2020; this is a critical year for the organisations.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Dara Calleary and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for tabling the motion.  </p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations operate on a voluntary basis and provide a wide range of vital services such as hospice care, disability support services and home help services.  They do amazing work that, to all intents and purposes, the State should be doing.  They provide exceptional value for money and release the State from significant levels of expenditure.  In my constituency of Wexford there are numerous section 39 organisations which are doing commendable work for local communities.  They include St. Aidan's Day Centre in Gorey, New Ross Community Hospital, the Ardao&iacute;bh&iacute;nn community initiative in Wexford town and the County Wexford Community Workshop in Enniscorthy.  Pay restoration for section 39 organisations should not require a Private Members' Bill.  It is wholly inadequate that the Government is continuing to turn a blind eye to the unfairness for employees of section 39 organisations.</p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue in October 2017 and was disappointed with the reply from the Minister for Health.  In his reply he pointed to the responsibility of those working in section 39 organisations to negotiate their own salaries.  However, he conveniently ignored the fact that the HSE was the body that provided the funding to deliver agreed services which required an appropriate level of staffing to do so.  In many ways, the answer reflected the Government's ambivalence, inaction and detachment on the issue.  When the last Government cut funding to the organisations, front-line staff suffered significant pay reductions.  They suffered significant pay cuts as part of the wider public sector pay reductions imposed by the last Government.  However, staff in the organisations have not been given a pathway to pay restoration in line with their colleagues in the public sector.  Historically, there was a link between public sector workers and section 39 staff and now that the State's finances are in a healthier position, funding for section 39 organisations should be increased to allow for pay restoration in the same manner as it has occurred for public sector staff.  The organisations are losing essential staff to the HSE and section 38 organisations and their vital work is being undermined.  It is vital that the Minister seek additional funding from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the annual funding for section 39 organisations, with the express intention of bringing about pay restoration.  Leaving it up to the management of the organisations to choose between restoring pay and maintaining services for the most vulnerable in society is an abdication of responsibility by the Minister and the HSE.  The staff do work that is on a par with that done by their public sector colleagues and they are entitled to pay parity.</p></speech>

Wicklow Community Services and the Ardeen Cheshire Home in Shillelagh are excellent examples of organisations that provide much needed support for vulnerable people and families in County Wicklow.  These support services are excellent, with dedicated and hard-working staff.  The Government has consistently washed its hands of the issue and dismissed this unjustifiable inequality for far too long.  This has caused even more stress and frustration for section 39 organisation workers in County Wicklow.  Staff feel undervalued and under-appreciated because of the dismissive attitude taken by the Government.  This means that section 39 organisations are struggling to retain and recruit staff.  Pay disparity is affecting the provision of vital services in County Wicklow, on which many people rely.  It is also placing section 39 organisations under huge financial and service pressures and industrial action may occur in March unless there is a resolution.  It is important to recognise that if section 39 organisations were to stop providing services, it would cost the State far more to provide them in County Wicklow and elsewhere and, in many cases, they would not be provided at all.  It is time for fairness and immediate pay restoration.</p></speech>

I welcome our friends and colleagues from section 39 organisations who are in the Visitors Gallery and thank and commend them for their work.  I have met many of them in the past two years as Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities.  I have made no secret of the fact that I have great sympathy for the workers who are affected by this issue.  As Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, I understand the importance of the work done by section 39 organisations.  They are particularly important in the disability sector, more so than in other parts of the health service.</p>  <p>  The Government is not putting its head in the sand on this issue.  We are very aware that pay disparity within the public health sector is an increasing problem for section 39 organisations.</p><p>That is why the Government is not opposing the original motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, we are opposing the amendment.  Our objective is to put in place a process to resolve the impasse.  The Independent Alliance is very strong on this issue.  I am sitting beside my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, who has met the staff and the unions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has met the unions as well.  We have all sat down and listened very carefully.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Canney, are also very supportive of these efforts.</p></speech>

We have been listening in recent months.  That is why we have met those I have mentioned.  We know this issue needs to be addressed.  It is a complex matter that needs careful thought and consideration if a solution is to be reached.  Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE funds organisations by means of a grant.  The service level agreements that the HSE has in place with voluntary providers set out the level of service that is to be provided through those grants to individual organisations.  The value of these grants can range from millions of euro to just a few thousand euro.  I will put the scale of what is involved here into context.  In 2016, the HSE provided over &euro;874 million in grants to 2,240 organisations under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The motion we are debating calls for FEMPI cuts to be reimbursed "as was expected".  As employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants, however, they are not covered by public service stability agreements.  This crucial point is accepted by people on all sides of the argument.</p>  <p>  It is important to be aware that there are many organisations involved in the community and voluntary sector.  We need to bear in mind the number of people involved.  This goes beyond the health sector.  In a response to a oral parliamentary question on this matter in December, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform estimated that as non-public servants, the number of staff working in these organisations could exceed 100,000.  Approximately 300,000 people are working directly for the State.  The State cannot afford to increase the number of public service workers by approximately one third, and it does not want to do so.  The staff of these organisations were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions.  Section 39 organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members, and nor are they obliged to provide for any pay restoration that may be negotiated as part of public service agreements.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each section 39 organisation, as the employer, to negotiate salaries with its staff as part of the employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.  All agencies had their budgets cut during the financial crisis and were expected to make savings.  As a large part of the budget of each organisation is spent on pay, the pay budget was the logical place to start.  It is understood that pay cuts were imposed on section 39 employees, but it is not clear how these cuts were applied.  We have heard that different organisations did different things.  There may have been increment freezes.  All recruitment may have been stopped.  The number of staff working in the agency may have been reduced over time.  They needed to do more with less, and this is what they did.  An exercise needs to be carried out to establish the true extent of the pay cuts that may have been applied.  This gives rise to other questions.  If the HSE funds just 70% of the budget of an organisation, such as a hospice, and it is found that the staff were subject to pay cuts, how is restoration to be applied?  Should the HSE fund restoration to all staff in that organisation, but just to the value of 70% of the cut?  Should it fund restoration of the full value of the cut to just 70% of staff?  If an organisation receives a grant of just a few thousand euro from the HSE under section 39 of the 2004 Act, should the HSE be responsible for restoring pay cuts which the management of that organisation applied to staff?</p>  <p>  It is clear that this complex issue needs to be carefully managed.  It has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Health and their officials for some time.  I do not accept the claim in this motion of "passing the buck" or of "ongoing inertia" on the part of the Department or its officials.  Along with my Independent Alliance colleagues, I have been raising this issue at Cabinet level.  There is heightened urgency with regard to this issue because industrial action in a number of these organisations is threatened for 14 February.  The Minister for Health and I are committed to doing all we can to ensure there is no disruption to the delivery of services.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 agencies in the health sector to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and pay restoration.  It is anticipated that this process will bring about the necessary clarity and transparency and will ultimately lead to an agreed way forward for all the parties involved.  My Independent Alliance colleagues and I strongly support this move.  We hope it will lead to a resolution and avoid the negative impacts of industrial action.</p>  <p>  I have devoted my time as Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities to working on developing better services and increasing investment.  I have had some success, given that almost &euro;1.8 billion has been allocated for disability services in 2018, which is almost &euro;92 million more than was available in 2017.  The Independent Alliance got this over the line when the programme for Government was being drawn up.  I am aware of how hard-fought it was to get this additional funding.  The Independent Alliance is very strong on this issue.  We want to ensure the staff on the ground receive part of this funding.  I am happy that a process of engagement will be undertaken with the section 39 bodies.  We cannot allow some sort of blanket restoration to all these agencies.  It would not be right and it would not be proper.  Taxpayers' money needs to be used in the best and most efficient way.  We should not have it any other way.  We need to proceed with caution.  The Independent Alliance will do its best in the interests of the people who use these services.  We have a plan and a vision for the disability sector.  We want to invest in and reform these services.  We want to ensure people with disabilities and ill people who are receiving services from section 39 organisations are at the centre of those services.  That is why the Independent Alliance will be pushing very hard on this issue.  I strongly commend and thank all those who work in these services.  I want to ensure those staff want to work in these services, are well-paid and are looked after in the future.</p></speech>

We are very disciplined in this party.  We will be supporting this motion.  Unlike the Government, we will also support the amendment proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit.  While the Fianna F&aacute;il motion does not address all the issues we would like to see addressed, it addresses the fundamental issue of equal treatment of all section 39 workers in relation to pay restoration.</p>  <p>  I had a speech prepared, but then I listened to the Minister of State.  It is not very often that I disagree with him, but I have to say that his contribution to this debate was quite insulting to many of the section 39 workers, to be honest.  I refer to his statement that these "organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members".  It is very clear that the pay of such staff has been reduced.</p><p>If, the Minister of State asked, the Health Service Executive is only funding 70% of an organisation's budget, should only 70% of the pay that was cut be restored.  It would be insulting to do so considering that the affected front-line workers save the State a fortune by doing jobs the Government, through the Department of Health, should be doing in many areas.  All the pay cuts were applied to them over the years and the unfairness that applies in respect of pay restoration must be addressed.</p> <p> The Minister of State indicated he had great sympathy with the workers in question.  They do not want sympathy.  They want their pay restored as quickly as possible and to the same extent as it is being restored for all other public sector workers.  When the pay of these workers was being cut, they were treated as public sector workers.  Now that pay is being restored, we are being told they are outside the relevant agreements and the matter is one for the organisations in question to address.  This is a load of codswallop.  The Government must step up to the plate and recognise the value these workers are delivering to citizens, whether terminally ill patients, people receiving hospice care or disabled persons.  They do a tremendous job and while it is fair to praise and commend them, it will not put food on their tables or a roof over their heads.  The Minister of State must step up to the plate.  He argued he was not passing the buck but that is precisely what he is doing.  The Government must take responsibility for this issue.</p></speech>

They are people who face all the same demands and responsibilities in life as everyone else.  They are not different, and in a recovering economy they must not be left behind.  That, however, is what is happening.</p>  <p>  They had their pay rates cut at the insistence of the Health Service Executive in line with their public service counterparts under the so-called financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts.  The Government, in its various guises, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health and its agents, the HSE, is refusing to restore the block grants to the section 39 agencies to allow these organisations to restore pay rates to their employees in line with what is happening across the public service.  How can the Government insist that the wages of the workers in question be cut in line with those of another set of employees, while refusing to restore the pay of the workers in question in line with pay restoration for their public service counterparts?  It cannot sustain this argument because unless the block grants are increased appropriately, the section 39 agencies will not be able to restore their employees' pay.  The alternative would be further service reduction to those most in need.  That option cannot be contemplated.  There must be no service cuts.  There can only be restored provision to allow for restored parity of pay.</p>  <p>  There are some heavy hitters among the list of section 39 agencies.  One could argue that a small number of them may have independent capacity to address the need to restore pay rates.  The Minister of State should make no mistake about this, however, because the overwhelming number of section 39 agencies have no such wherewithal and are wholly reliant on State support through the HSE to sustain and develop the much-needed services and supports they provide.</p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies have service level agreements with the HSE to provide services at a community level in the areas of intellectual disability, learning disabilities and sensory needs.  While section 39 agency employees are not public servants, they had their pay rates cut in line with public servants on the instruction of the HSE.  There is no doubt that there is a direct link between the pay rates of these two sets of workers.  This link cannot operate only in one direction.  If a linkage is made when cuts are implemented, a linkage must also be made when pay restoration takes place.</p>  <p>  Since the commencement of pay restoration to public servants through the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, section 39 agencies have sought the restoration of their block grants to allow for the reversal of the pay cuts imposed on their employees.  The HSE has thus far not moved, however.  The Taoiseach confirmed the pay linkage in the D&aacute;il before Christmas.  It is now past time that he translated his words into actions by having this glaring anomaly and injustice addressed by his Ministers and their Departments.  I urge unanimous support for the motion before the House.</p></speech>

Bizarrely, he then stated that the pay of employees in section 39 organisations should be restored but he did not know how this should be done.  This is a complete abdication of responsibility.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not have a plan and he and the Government are behaving like headless chickens.  They do not know what to do because they do not want to do the right thing.  Despite knowing that cutting the funding of section 39 organisations would reduce the funding available for staff pay, the then Government, which included the Labour Party, proceeded to do so.  It now does not have a plan to support the affected workers and ensure they get their money back.  Rather than making a speech in which he says nothing, the Minister of State should have outlined a plan in order that the workers present in the Public Gallery and those protesting for their just entitlements outside the D&aacute;il, which they should not have to do, get what they deserve.  The onus is on the Minister of State and Department.  He must return to the Chamber with a plan rather than waffling and using words that insult the affected workers.</p></speech>

It may be a case of the federation versus the alliance.  I have before me a letter from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The view of the federation is clear.  The letter was written on behalf of section 39 member organisations that have fully complied with FEMPI legislation as well as the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements in the period since 2010.  Pay cuts in respect of staff employed by these organisations were implemented to ensure compliance with the then revised Department of Health consolidated salary scales.</p>  <p>  In 2010, when Fianna F&aacute;il cut the grant, I represented those workers.  We were under no illusions where the instructions were coming from: they were coming from Government.</p>  <p>  What did the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, do when he came to power?  He picked it up and ran with it.  He instructed those agencies to cut the pay of their workers.  Now, he is saying they were only subject to a 70% cut or that they were only 70% funded.  They had a 100% pay cut.  They deserve 100% pay restoration and nothing less.  It is an insult to those people for the Minister of State to come to the House and read out what he read.  Day in, day out they work hard.  They do not have public service pensions or job security.  They are entirely dependent on the block grant, as the Minister of State knows.  The block grant funds everything they do.  Caring for people, minding them and looking after them is labour-intensive.  Labour costs represent the biggest chunk of the money they spend.  Of course wages were cut and the Minister of State knows it.  They were cut 100% in many instances, exactly in line with the FEMPI legislation.</p>  <p>  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward the motion.  If those in Fianna F&aacute;il have any humility, they would apologise for what they did to those workers.  Fianna F&aacute;il started the cuts and then Fine Gael and the Labour Party picked up and ran with further cuts.</p></speech>

They are seeking a pathway back.  They need a pathway to pay restoration.  It is the least they deserve.</p>  <p>  We outsource a good deal of work from the health service to these agencies.  It is not fair to disrespect repeatedly these workers.  They are delivering a service that the State should be providing.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the Solidarity-People Before Profit amendment.  We believe that it will take time and that it will be onerous.  We understand the process will be complicated because we know all the various elements that are involved.  We believe the Minister of State should make a statement of recognition to the effect that these workers do the same work as their counterparts in the public service.  The principle of equal pay for work of equal value holds.  The Government has an opportunity to send a message.  The Government either values their work in the same way as it values the work of those in the public services or it does not.  The Government has an opportunity.  I echo the call from Teachta Cullinane for the Minister of State to come back to the Chamber and give them the support and assurance they need.</p></speech>

I will set out some history for colleagues.  The cuts were introduced in 2010.  The Labour Party started unwinding FEMPI in October 2014.  I am keen to set the record straight on that point.</p><p>I welcome to the Gallery my colleagues from the various unions, including my union, SIPTU, as well as all the workers who I have met on numerous occasions.</p><p>I listened to the speech of the Minister of State and I have a copy of it before me.  I had a flashback to some years ago when I served in government and sat where the Minister of State is sitting.  I remember when the Minister of State was in opposition.  If he was in opposition now while this debate was under way I can imagine how he would perform.  The Minister of State has certainly done a <i>volta face</i>and changed totally in the meantime.  The Minister of State says he knows the issue needs to be addressed.  He said it is complex and needs careful thought and consideration to reach a solution.  Can the Minister of State imagine if it was three years ago and he was sitting in another seat?  Can he imagine what he would have said?  He would not have accepted the speech he has just given.  He would not have accepted the speech put before him which he read with passion.  I have no doubt the Minister of State has passion for the disability sector.  I genuinely know that for many reasons, as the Minister of State is aware.</p><p>This is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that we are even discussing and debating the matter tonight.  At the core of this is the fact that workers who are side by side are being paid two different wages through no fault of their own.  We know there are up to 12,000 of them.  We all know them.  They are in all our constituencies.  I have many relations and friends who work in section 39 organisations.  The fact is these people, who have to be as qualified as their HSE counterparts, are being paid a different wage.  That is unacceptable from a labour point of view and from the point of view of the health service they provide.</p><p>This is a point I am keen to explore.  The services are being depleted.  The service being delivered is being impacted by the fact that these people are leaving.  I know this directly from highly qualified people working in the sector.  In one case, a person spent six years in college.  These people are leaving the service even though they have a vocation for the work they do in intellectual disabilities.  They are leaving because they cannot live on the wages they are being paid - it is as simple as that.  They cannot live or hope to prosper or move on in life and do the normal things that everyone does.  This has to be addressed as a priority.  This should be the number one priority for the Minister of State.  He should deal with this as quickly as possible.  This must be dealt with; it is not simply an anomaly.</p><p>It is not only about workers, although they are at the core of it.  It is also about the service users.  They are being badly affected.  People will down tools.  There will be a strike if the matter is not dealt with or if a pathway towards dealing with it is not found.  These are reasonable people.  They have been very patient but they have been left behind.  They are going to have to take action.  Is that what it is going to take?  Is it going to have to get up to that stage for the Minister of State to do his job and actually stand over what he believes in?  Do the Minister of State and the Independent Alliance have the capacity, despite all the talk, to deliver this in government?  That is the core issue.  Does the Minister of State have the capacity to deliver something so fundamental and something that he believes in for these workers and the service users?  Service users are being affected because the workers cannot stay on the wages they are being paid.  That is the key question for the Minister of State.  I hope he will be able to answer it in the coming months for all concerned.</p></speech>

I support some of the points made by members of Fianna F&aacute;il, especially the Cork members and Deputy Michael Moynihan in particular.  Deputy Moynihan referred to one of the organisations in Cork.  Most Oireachtas Members from Cork met the organisation in the past week or so.  Those involved articulated to us that they are in a position where they received approximately &euro;17 million from the HSE.  The overall turnover of the organisation is &euro;20 million.  The organisation gets additional moneys through various other subscriptions.  Already, employers' liability insurance costs &euro;500,000.  The organisation is already down &euro;500,000 on the &euro;20 million before it opens its doors on 1 January.</p>  <p>  I support the point made by Deputy Moynihan.  We are hitting an inflexion point where the very existence of the section 39 organisations is being threatened by virtue of the fact that their overall costs are increasing exponentially such that their ability to deliver the essential services is being impeded and impinged in a major way.</p><p>The motion before us seeks to address the inequality that exists between workers who are doing the same job on the same shop floor but getting different rates of pay.  It needs to be supported and I was hoping the Minister's response would contain a more thoughtful exposition of how difficult it is for section 39 workers who are seeking to have their rights vindicated.  If there is a possibility of industrial action, it is not sufficient for the Minister to say it has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health, or between their officials, for some time.  He said the Minister for Health had instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 agencies in the health sector to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and restoration.  Am I to interpret the Minister as saying there will be a move by Government to equalise the situation?  The Minister is nodding but is he saying there will be a restoration of pay for section 39 workers?  The Minister has stopped nodding but he is still smiling.  I am hopeful there is something in the Minister's language that gives some comfort to those workers in advance of 14 February.  I was hopeful there would be more clarity from the Minister because despite the fact that, as he stated, there was an extra &euro;92 million spend on disability services in 2017, for which I give credit to him and his colleagues in the Independent Alliance, we are not seeing any evidence of it in the section 39 organisations which Oireachtas Members from Cork met last week.  We need the Government to articulate how that extra spend is translating into real benefits for these organisations because they are still put to the pin of their collar and their future sustainability is still at risk.</p> <p> We support the motion and I hope the engagement with the HSE leads ultimately to the restoration of pay.</p></speech>

The Government and the HSE must see sense before the deadline for the action.  If they do not, the responsibility for any ensuing disruption and stress will be entirely on their shoulders, including those of the Minister.</p><p>We have submitted an amended version of the motion for a number of reasons.  The employers in the section 39 sector have conceded the argument in the Labour Court that their employees should receive pay restoration in line with their public sector comparators but cited an ability to pay, passing the buck to the Government which funds the wages of their employees.  The Government's responsibility is correctly the main focus of this debate.  That said, we should keep some of the spotlight on the employers too.  The State provides funds to more than 1,300 section 39, section 38 and private companies for salaries and public services delivered on behalf of the State.  Many of these organisations have a salaried chief executive, and we all recall the scandal of chief executive pay at Rehab, and their own boards of management.  This, ultimately, is no way to run public services, nor is it a way of ensuring people across the State receive the care they need at various stages of their life.  Many of these organisations, with origins in the religious orders, have a record of hostility to or non-recognition of unions and have historically sought to take advantage of the commitment of their employees by regarding their jobs as vocations rather than careers which should be properly rewarded.</p><p>There is an element of piety in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion which gives the incorrect impression that the interests of workers and employers in the sector are one and the same.  They are not.  Our amended version of the motion seeks to delete two clauses which call for the strike action to be deferred, as we do not agree with that.  Beside the SIPTU membership in the sector, other unions, including F&oacute;rsa, Unite and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, organise in this sector and the action on 14 February would be much more effective if they were to join the action.</p><p>Our amended version of the motion also mentions that section 39 workers never enjoyed all the conditions of the public service in respect of pensions.  I have no confidence at all that the 1,300 or more organisations are capable of administering a defined benefit pension fund for their employees.  For this and other reasons, these workers should ultimately be fully integrated into the public service.  Our support for the restoration of the link, in so far as there was a pay link between section 39 workers and their public service comparators, should not be interpreted as acceptance of the remaining legacy of attacks on public service pay and conditions.  Two-tier pay and other cuts to allowances and premia need to be addressed, as do the issues of the pension levy and real pay rises, reflecting the cost of living increases coinciding with the last decade of pay stagnation.</p><p>The current set-up of section 39 organisations is a vestige of our past dependence on the church, church institutions and charities plugging a gap in health care, hospices and care of the disabled.  In the 21st century, this method of public service delivery should be redundant.  We need an Irish national health service which takes the majority of section 39 organisations into the public health system and allows for public service pay rates and pension rates for all their staff across the board.</p></speech>

I welcome all the workers to the House.  It is only because of their determination to take some action that we are discussing this today.  Standing up for oneself is crucial in this day and age and it is fundamental to getting change.</p>  <p>  Workers have been left behind to a huge degree in this so-called recovery.  In the recovery, we have seen profits, economic growth and property prices rising but the share of the national wealth that was taken from workers and given over to employers and profits has not been restored to those workers, in particular in the case of public sector workers.  Further down the pecking order, the section 39 workers are those who have been penalised the most.  It is no accident that we have seen an extraordinary increase in precarious contracts in all of the sectors, with zero hours, low hours and minimum pay rates being applied.  There is a war on workers in this country and a war on wages, and in this war the Government has supported the employers and the wealthy.  I am shocked to hear the Minister, a former trade union activist, say it is too complicated to restore the pay of these workers.  If it was too complicated to restore it, how come it was not complicated to cut it in the first place?  I do not believe his priority should be getting profits back to where they were in 2008.  It should be rather about getting services and workers' rights back and restoring pay levels these workers absolutely need.  This injustice will lead to industrial action in which we will fully support the workers.</p>  <p>  I am sure the irony of those on all sides of this House, including those in power at the moment and those who were in power in the previous Government, who brought in the FEMPI legislation, falling over themselves to support section 39 workers will not be lost on those workers.  The workers can only rely on themselves to get change.</p><p>If I were them, I would not be trusting any element of the political class to deliver on their behalf.  There is a force they can rely on, namely, the force of their own power and their own ability to make the Government listen to them and ensure that the restoration happens.  It will not happen by platitudes from the Minister of State's side of the House.</p> <p> There is a connection between the crisis in our health services and the fact that we have section 38 and section 39 workers, who provide vital public services in disability, mental health and cancer treatment.  These vital services are, in the main, provided by charitable organisations stemming from the legacy of Catholic charities dominating the health service.  The last section of our amendment calls for all section 39 workers to be fully integrated into the public service and to have the same rights and entitlements bestowed on them, including pension rights, public service comparators and the full restoration of FEMPI cuts.  We cannot continue to deliver services in a society that treats these workers differently and in which these services are delivered differently and largely depend on charity for their funding.</p> <p> I know people in the community sector, as I am sure does the Minister of State, who are told that although they should restore the FEMPI pay cuts to themselves as has been directed by the Minister for Finance, they will not be getting the money to do it and will have to cut some of their services.  We cannot continue to allow that happen, nor can we continue to allow the workers be penalised.  The workers do not accept the argument that it is complicated to restore their pay or that there are all sorts of machinations that have to be considered.  We commend our amendment to the House and fully support the action the workers are about to take.  It can only be avoided if their pay is fully restored by the Government between now and the date of strike action.</p></speech>

We take very easily to cutting funding for people with a disability, yet even a slight suggestion that we would increase corporation tax is treated with derision.</p>  <p>  Almost a year ago, there was a meeting between the Minister for Health, Department officials and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Certain actions were agreed to try to bring about a quick resolution to this matter.  Obviously, there has not been a resolution.  We know the background, namely, the cut to the funding that was made in 2009.  In the public pay sector, funding is now being restored.  However, it is only available to section 38 workers and not section 39 organisations.  Historically, these workers were linked to the HSE pay scales.  It is unjust that among workers who are providing disability services for the State and are employed by the HSE, those working for a section 38 agency are on one salary while those doing the exact same work under a section 39 agency are on a different pay scale.</p>  <p>  The section 39 agencies are, as we know, under obligation to award the restored pay scales as per the various Lansdowne Road and public pay agreements.  Where is the funding going to come from so that they can honour those agreements?  The danger is that the impact will be on services and that there will be an impact on section 39 agencies retaining staff.  This is a matter of justice for section 39 workers.  They were public servants when it came to taking the pay cut but suddenly they are not public servants when it comes to pay restoration.</p></speech>

I raised the issue several times in this House during 2017 and, in particular, in support of the claims of the workers of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I made several representations to the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and, indeed, to the Taoiseach during Leaders&rsquo; Questions on 21 June last year.  The Taoiseach, of course, gave the usual disingenuous answer by saying he would take a dim view of any organisation that used its block grant to give the proper increases to its workforce.  I also wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, on 19 December asking that they intervene and provide the requisite additional funding to the HSE urgently.  I also raised the matter at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the context of budget 2018.</p><p>The additional funding is long overdue following the Labour Court recommendation of 20 November, which found that pay scales between staff of section 39 organisations and public servants in the same roles in section 38 organisations and the HSE generally are indeed aligned and therefore must be restored.  At the end of March last year, the Not for Profit Association, of which the Irish Wheelchair Association is a member, met the HSE to discuss the matter of pay restoration for member organisations and their staff.  While the staff of section 39 organisations are not technically State employees, their pay scales had been historically aligned and during the crash the same pay cuts were imposed on section 39 staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s and the State&rsquo;s refusal to provide additional funding to realign these pay scales has put these vital agencies and organisations under great strain, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has just described.</p><p>The HSE directed that the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, would have to go through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to determine whether the pay scales were aligned and pay restoration due.  The IWA and SIPTU took part in a conciliation conference which was unsuccessful because of the obduracy of the HSE and the State.</p><p>On 4 September, the matter was referred to the Labour Court.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has never denied that pay restoration is due to its hard-working and dedicated staff, who are completing the same work as diligently as their counterparts in section 38 organisations but for less money.  It has merely said that additional funding would be required from the HSE to meet those pay demands.  The IWA was unable to meet pay restoration demands from 1 April last year.  The Labour Court hearing was held on 31 October 2017 and provided its recommendations exactly in line with what we had expected.  It recommended that the pay scales are indeed aligned and therefore pay restoration is due.  I thank Mr. Paul Bell of SIPTU for giving us information around that process.</p><p>Before Christmas, a copy of the Labour Court recommendation LCR21609 was forwarded to the Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris.  It makes for very interesting reading, especially given the consistent statements in this House by those Ministers that pay was not linked between section 38 and section 39 organisations.  We knew, of course, that this would be the outcome of the Labour Court recommendation and that those pay scales were indeed linked.  During the crash, when pay cuts were imposed the recommendation was that if workers had benefited from pay linkages when salaries increased then they could not seek to break from those linkages when salaries went down.  Of course, SIPTU put forward this same argument once pay restoration for public servants began under the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p><p>The Labour Court recommendation of 20 November stated: &ldquo;The Court has given careful consideration to the submissions of both parties and is clear that the worker&rsquo;s pay is clearly aligned with the HSE pay scales.&rdquo;  The last paragraph of the recommendation is of utmost importance.  Many trade union representatives and leaders of these organisations fear that the current impasse is a delaying tactic by the Government and the HSE and that every section 39 organisation will have to go through the same long drawn-out industrial relations process.  The Labour Court recommendation states: </p><blockquote>It appears to the Court that one of the reasons that this matter is before it, is because the Employer feels obliged to do so, in order to satisfy an administrative requirement of the HSE, which is its main funder, rather than to seek a resolution.  It is not a function of the Labour Court to provide an administrative endorsement to meet the requirements of a third party who is external to the case at hand and any process requiring such an endorsement could be considered, [<i>sic</i>] to be an abuse of the Industrial Relations process.</blockquote><p>This is very clear, yet the additional funding has still not been forthcoming.  The IWA wrote to the HSE on 24 November to seek confirmation of when the additional funding would be provided.  Almost a month later, just before Christmas, the IWA had only received an acknowledgement of the letter.  SIPTU has therefore advised the IWA that members will be balloted for strike action, set for 14<sup></sup>February 2018.  The case has been very strongly made that these workers' pay scales should be restored.  They were cut during the height of the bank bailout.  I welcome the motion before us.</p></speech>

When the country hit a wall in 2009 and 2010, these workers were told they were the same as the HSE and that they had to take the cuts.  They took them, like most people in middle Ireland, while at the same time the Government decided to put &euro;65 billion into banks to make sure they were okay.  Ordinary people right around the country struggled.  Now that things are improving, the same workers under section 39 have been told they are different.  This is intolerable for them.</p><p>In his speech, the Minister of State said he would look at the issue.  There was nothing in it.  I remember sitting beside him when we were in opposition.  He would have jumped up and down if he saw workers being treated in such a way.</p> <p> The Minister for Finance has pulled a cunning trick over the past number of years.  Pay increases were announced, but the money was not given back to where it was needed.  Whether the money has to come from the HSE or a different body, the Government has to give it.  The funding needs to be provided immediately.</p> <p> It is especially sickening that this debate is happening at a time when it has been announced in all the newspapers that ex-taoisigh and Deputies will receive increases of between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000.  People in middle Ireland who have struggled throughout the past four or five years to pay their mortgages and raise their families, and who go out to work every day have been left in a situation whereby the Government did not care whether they got their funding back.  As Deputies, we need to examine where all this is going.</p> <p> Middle Ireland has not been given a fair say.  Talk and sympathy does not put food on the table.  Pay needs to be restored immediately to the 10,000 or 12,000 people affected.  Fair play to those who protested outside the D&aacute;il on a cold day like this.  Paul Bell was with them.  They need to ramp up their campaign if they are not being listened to.  There is a duty on us, as politician, to act.  While the motion will not solve the problem, there is a need for the Government to come out with a clear message and say that pay will be restored.</p></speech>

Section 39 agencies include our local hospices, community and disability organisations and other health care providers who offer vital services to our communities.  Groups like the Marymount hospice do incredible work for our sick family members and friends around Cork.  Community and voluntary groups, such as meals on wheels, the Goleen community council or the Schull community care association, provide social services to the elderly under section 39 funding.  Most section 39 agencies save the State tens of thousands of euro weekly and work hard throughout the year, including during the Christmas period - some organisations in west Cork worked on Christmas Day.</p>  <p>  Employees of section 39 agencies experienced the same cuts as all public sector employees did under the FEMPI legislation over the past number of years, although they are only partially funded by the HSE.  Including section 39 employees in FEMPI cuts seemed like a harsh measure at the time.  However, this has now been amplified by the notice that section 39 employees are now not entitled to the same pay restoration as a other public service employees who were originally hit by the FEMPI cuts.  This is not the first time that I have raised the issue of FEMPI pay restoration for public services, in particular our GPs and the detrimental effect FEMPI has had on their local surgeries.</p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies provide necessary services to our elderly and sick people and take huge pressure off part-time care givers and family members.  The threat of industrial action by these agencies is a cause of great stress and anxiety to service users, and the Government, along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, must act immediately to rectify the pay differences in order to deter any possible strike action.  The cost of industrial action to the State is far greater than the cost of restoring these anomalies.</p>  <p>  It is simply not good enough that certain groups can be excluded from the Government finance reform programme, and the fact that the Government and HSE has treated section 39 employees with such contempt is disgraceful.  This is similar to other wrongdoings on the part of the Government.  The west Cork development partnership delivered a Government Leader programme for up to 20 years.  When the previous Government kicked it out, it did not have the decency to give the staff their statutory notice or their proper redundancy entitlements.  Instead, people were only offered advice.  The remainder of the company was under charitable organisation status.  We have turned into a great country.  Section 39 employees got up early in the morning and delivered a top-class Leader programme for over 20 years in west Cork, but were treated disgracefully by the Government, just like it treated the issue of women's pension.</p>  <p>  All our health care workers, whether in fully funded or partially funded HSE roles, are worked to the bone.  This issue was highlighted most recently in the horrific trolley crisis over the Christmas period.  I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Government to examine these anomalies and restore pay to section 39 employees without further delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700032#LL00400"><p>I wish to concentrate on two issues in respect of section 39 organisations.  One is the financial sustainability, viability and quality of care section 39 organisations provide.  Pay is an issue, but the provision of quality care to patients is paramount.  Section 39 organisations supply essential services to patients, which are not provided by the HSE.  They provide those services on behalf of the HSE.  There is an expectation that they will provide the same quality of service as section 38 organisation organisations which are completely funded through the public service.</p>  <p>  The other issue is the training of staff.  Quite often, section 39 organisations are training grounds for other organisations.  When staff have completed their training, they are poached by section 38 organisations or the HSE, because they have been trained to a very high standard, at a cost to the section 39 organisation.  Section 39 organisations are suffering from a lack of continuity of care and professionals who are providing that care.  Paradoxically, staff are being poached by the HSE, a Government-funded organisation which has reduced funding to section 39 organisations.</p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations strive to supply the same level of care and service which is provided through publicly-funded services such as section 38 organisations, yet they have great difficulty in doing so.  There is an imbalance between section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Quite often, section 38 and 39 organisations are working side-by-side and are supplying the same service.  Service users do not care how an organisation which is supplying a service to them is funded; they just want the same quality of service.  When the Minister of State said section 39 organisations were not obliged to pass on pay cuts, that is not quite correct.  They were advised that they should take into account what was happening in the public service and observe the pay reductions which were being inflicted on the public service.  While organisations were not told they had reduce pay, they were certainly given a very strong indication that they should do so.  There is no rhyme or reason for having a discrepancy between section 38 and section 39 organisations.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins referred to FEMPI.  It is not just section 39 organisations which were subject to FEMPI.  Self-employed people such as GPs were also subjected to it, and they are expected to provide a level of service as they did prior to FEMPI, despite having had substantial reductions made to their resources.</p></speech>

The nice flowery language from the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Jim Daly, will not help the people in the Gallery and those who protested outside.  In my book, fair play is fine play.  Everyone had to take the cuts, except the preserved few, including senior civil servants.  They were also exonerated from having to pay the pension levy.</p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations are invaluable.  Section 38 organisations also do valuable work, but section 39 organisations employees are being discriminated against.  Many of us have had our loved ones looked after in day in, day out in hospices.  Meals on wheels operate in every town in Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel, Tipperary town, north Tipperary, Thurles and everywhere else.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State might say that organisations were not told to impose cuts, but they were expected to do so and it was demanded of them.  Voluntary boards run many section 39 organisations.  The Irish Wheelchair Association runs on a voluntary basis and has to do significant fundraising to keep afloat.  Such organisations have to pay for insurance and everything else.  We have the dreaded HIQA imposing guidelines on organisations.  One section of the HSE is telling another to do something, but the HSE will not pay for it.</p>  <p>  The Government is not stepping up to the plate and paying people.  The Government and the Department should remunerate employees appropriately.  We discussed equality in many areas.  Where is the equality in this?  These people give sterling service.</p><p>As Deputy Harty said, many of them are poached, and rightly so, because they are good workers.  They are keen, trained and up for it.  They want to work and play a valuable part in society.  All they want is a modicum of respect.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, might think the Department will get their services on the cheap but it will not because that destroys the community spirit and ethos of the organisations.</p> <p> There have been hints that the situation might be sorted out.  The Department should carry out a proper audit of how many section 39 organisations exist.  It has not done this.  We also need to know how many employees they have and the costs involved.  The Department must make a reasonable effort to look at the situation holistically and fairly and provide a roadmap as to how it will sort out the matter.  Fair play is fine play but this stinks.  We have money to bail out the bankers and for many other areas as well.  Let us take, for example, the money the HSE spends on legal bills, PR, and reports that are gathering dust on shelves every day of the week.  The Department should pay the people a fair day&rsquo;s pay for a fair day&rsquo;s work.  All people want is equality with the section 38 organisations and other organisations.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, must act up.  It is a pity the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has left the Chamber because when he used to sit here we could not keep him quiet.  He was always on the attack and defending disability organisations in particular.</p></speech>

I joined the Irish Transport and General Workers Union as it was then.  I then moved to work in Bulmers where I became a member of the Federation of Rural Workers.  Following that, I moved to a leather factory where I became a member of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, now Unite.  Since then I have been a member of the Irish Local Government Officials' Union, which became the Local Government and Public Services Union, which then became IMPACT and in recent weeks F&oacute;rsa.  I have also been president of Clonmel Trades and Labour Council.</p>  <p>  I support the workers in the section 39 organisations who are faced with having to withdraw their labour on 14 February because the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform simply will not face up to their responsibilities and pay them the correct rates of pay and ensure pay restoration for them.  I hope they are not forced onto the streets by the Government and by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who as another speaker said, would be singing a very different tune if he were on this side of the House.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt the work being done by the section 39 organisations extends right across the country and is essential for all kinds of work in the health and community areas.  I support the motion, especially the amendment tabled by Solidarity-PBP.  It is worth referring to what the motion outlines.  The amendment calls on the Government to address the anomalies and reimburse the FEMPI cuts as was expected; to recognise that both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health need to take responsibility for this issue, primarily in order to prevent services being cut as a result of their ongoing inertia; to cease passing the buck between Departments and prevent cuts being applied to services in order to allow staff to have their FEMPI cuts restored; to undertake a detailed analysis and commit to a process to reimburse the section 39 employees who have been paid public service rates and who had the FEMPI cuts applied to them; to fully implement the finance reform programme in the HSE so that section 39 and section 38 organisations can be easily identified; and to integrate all section 39 workers fully into the public sector and bestow upon them the same rights and entitlements, including pension rights, as their public service comparators.</p>  <p>  There is a lot in the amendment but it is essential that what is sought would be done from the point of view of fairness to the employees, the organisations involved and the services they provide.  If the Department refuses to come up with the money, there is a strong possibility that services being provided by the organisations will be badly affected and there will be a knock-on effect on service users.  This is a very black and white situation.  The workers in question have been always paid the same rate as public service employees.  They took the cuts when public service employees took the cuts.  They were told they simply had no choice but to do that.  However, now they are being told that although they took the cuts they will not get the restoration.  That is simply not good enough.  The situation must change.  The workers in question must be supported.  I commend Paul Bell, the official responsible for dealing with the matter, who sent us some information.</p>  <p>  Numerous organisations have been mentioned that would be affected by the situation.  I wish to refer briefly to an organisation with which I have been involved from the day of its foundation, namely, Cuan Saor or Safe Haven, a women's refuge.  It is a section 39 organisation that was established in 1994.  I have been involved with it since then and I am currently a member of the board and have been for many years.  The organisation provides a range of services for women affected by domestic violence.  Information, advice and refuge are provided.  Accommodation is also provided as a building was sourced in 2000 and the refuge currently has four units available for women and children who are in difficulty.  There is also a 24-hour helpline.  Support and information is provided on a drop-in basis and by appointment.  Counselling is also provided.  Outreach services are provided in all the towns throughout south Tipperary, in Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town, Killenaule and Ballingarry.  A very important court accompaniment service is also provided by staff of Cuan Saor.  This domestic violence support organisation that is based in Clonmel and which covers all of south Tipperary also provides an aftercare service, in addition to training and awareness raising and child and family support.  That is the type of organisation whose staff is affected by the refusal of the Department to ensure pay restoration.  It is unacceptable that the services of such organisations, including hospice groups and many others, would be affected.  I support the motion, in particular the Solidarity-PBP amendment, and call on the Government to deal with this matter urgently and to agree to the pay restoration for staff in the section 39 organisations.  Otherwise, there will be very serious difficulties for the organisations, their staff and the services they provide.</p></speech>

The section 39 organisations and their workers have been providing vital services across the country for many years.</p><p>In County Wicklow St. Catherine's Association is well known.  The National Learning Network in Bray provides vital resources for people who have had accidents and those with an illness or a disability.  The Irish Wheelchair Association is very active in County Wicklow.  Enable Ireland is very active in Bray.  These bodies are critical to the local community, particularly people with disabilities and those with a wide range of other issues.</p> <p> What happened?  The pay of the staff was linked with public sector pay levels.  We know this because there is a Labour Court judgment to that effect.  During the crash the organisations were instructed to reduce staff wages just like in public sector bodies.  Although public sector wage levels are going back up and restoration is occurring, workers in section 39 organisations are not getting an increase.</p> <p> I acknowledge that the Government is not going against Fianna F&aacute;il's motion.  I put it to the Minister of State, however, that the statement from the Government is utterly disingenuous.  It claims the cuts had nothing to do with the HSE in terms of how the organisations passed on the cuts.  We all know that is not true.  The wages of section 39 workers were linked with public sector pay levels and that the organisations had to reduce wage levels in line with the FEMPI legislation.  We all know that happened, but now the Government is stating it is not really the case and that if the organisations want to increase wages, it has nothing to do with it.  Of course, it does because the money comes from it to do so.</p> <p> I ask the Government to rethink seriously, acknowledge in the House that there was a link and acknowledge the work of section 39 organisation staff and that their pay should be restored as it is for their colleagues in the public sector.</p></speech>

More importantly, I acknowledge the work carried out by the employees of section 39 organisations.  Without their work, the lives of many people who depend on them would be adversely affected.  It is important to remember this in the light of potential industrial action.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed with the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who stated section 39 organisation workers were not public servants and, therefore, not covered by the public service stability agreements.  He said that point was crucial.  Last year the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, made a very similar point when addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said section 39 organisations were not obliged to pass on any pay reduction to their staff members.  That is simply not accurate or true.  If the Minister of State believes that, no wonder we cannot go about resolving the issue.</p>  <p>  Around the time the Rehab group had a number of issues, at the request of the Minister for Health, the HSE wrote to the CEOs of al section 39 agencies outlining health sector pay policy and requesting each of them to have due regard to it, particularly in the case of senior management.  On 7 October 2013 a letter was written by the HSE to a particular organisation which referred specifically to section 39 agencies.  It stated that while the immediate focus on the implementation of the Haddington Road agreement within the health service had centred on public bodies and public servants, that is, the HSE and section 38 bodies, the clear intention was that all agencies, including section 39 agencies, were to make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost-reduction measures in line with other publicly funded bodies.  The intention was very clear.  There was a very direct link.  As staff in other organisations are receiving pay restoration, the employees of section 39 organisations have every entitlement to receive an increase and in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

Section 39 organisations have lobbied us all and we see the great work they all do in our communities.</p>  <p>  Fairness in all Government decisions should be the standard.  We have seen that, in government since 2011, fairness has been sacrificed in search of financial savings.  Time after time, we saw decisions being made in which the Government sacrificed the rights of ordinary people, while at the same time allowing vulture funds to operate completely unregulated in the country.  This is another example of the unfairness to which I refer.</p>  <p>  Section 39 health organisations provide vital health services for society and communities throughout the country.  They include hospices, disability organisations and other agencies.  The Government has completely washed its hands of the issue and for far too long has dismissed it.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2004 covers section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Employees in section 38 organisations are public sector workers and thus subject to pay restoration.  Section 39 employees technically are not public sector workers.  Traditionally, however, pay levels in section 39 organisations shadowed pay levels in section 38 organisations and the public sector as a whole.  This meant that in 2009 and 2010 the HSE reduced the grants paid to section 39 organisations.  It communicated with the organisations and the cut in funding was applied to the payroll of each organisation. </p>  <p>  When pay restoration began in the public sector, it was not reflected in the grants paid to section 39 organisations.  Someone in a section 39 organisation doing the same work as someone else in the public sector is now being paid less for it.  This has an effect on a section 39 organisation's ability to retain or recruit staff.  The disparity is affecting the provision of vital services, on which people rely.  I plead with the Government to recognise the unfairness in that regard and ensure pay restoration in section 39 organisations happens immediately.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Dara Calleary for initiating the process to expedite a positive outcome.  I welcome the service providers and staff present in the Visitors Gallery, especially the representatives I met from St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville.</p>  <p>  Day in and day out, legislators have been urged to close the gender pay gap and pay new entrants to the workplace the same wages as those in similar employment who do the same work.  There is blatant pay discrimination against the staff of section 39 organisations who effectively carry out the same duties, engage in the same practices and deliver the same services as staff in section 38 organisations.</p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations, like their sister institutions, accepted severe cuts in funding during the economic downturn.  The majority of the cuts were to the pay package of the employees and management who, it must be acknowledged, did well to deliver their services during the recession-hit days.  As stated in a letter received from SIPTU, their members' pay was reduced in 2010 and 2012 directly in line with the reductions affecting their public service equivalents as a direct consequence of an historical pay link.  The historical pay link is the issue.</p>  <p>  On 8 November 2017 the Taoiseach confirmed to my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that there was an established pay link between section 39 agencies and the public service.  The Government and the HSE have been hiding behind the bloc grant allocation mechanism, which is like throwing sheep to wolves.  It was a matter of making the management of section 39 organisations make the hard call on how to divide their spend.</p>  <p>  We must also acknowledge that many section 39 organisations have gone above and beyond the call of duty in facilitating the provision of extra services with no extra financial resources.  An example is St. Joseph's Foundation in Charlevill, which came to the aid of the HSE when Grove House in Cork was closed.  While the foundation took in some residents, the appropriate budgetary funding did not follow.  I ask the Minister to sign the draft for the pay increase.</p></speech>

Section 39 health organisations such as Enable Ireland, Rehab, Cheshire Homes and the hospice in Kildare provide vital services for individuals, society and local communities throughout the country.  I welcome the workers who are present in the Visitors Gallery for the debate.</p>  <p>  The Government has completely washed its hands of this issue and for far too long dismissed it.  This has caused considerable stress and frustration for section 39 organisation workers who, understandably, feel undervalued and under-appreciated.</p><p>In 2009 and 2010 the HSE reduced the grants paid to section 39 organisations.  It was communicated that the cut in funding was to be applied to the organisations' payroll to ensure the salaries paid to those in section 39 agencies would be the same as those in section 38 agencies.  That was fair enough, but the Minister cannot have it both ways.  When pay restoration began to happen in the public sector, it was not reflected in the grants paid to section 39 organisations.  Their workers are already disadvantaged because they do not have access to public service pensions.  At this point, they are trebly disadvantaged, with no access to public service pensions, no increments and no pay restoration.  Accordingly, section 39 organisations are struggling to retain and recruit staff.  This disparity is impacting on and affecting the provision of vital services, on which we all rely.  This is creating a two-tier system, similar to what is happening in the case of teachers which is equally wrong.  However, that argument is for another day.  We are pitting section 38 and section 39 organisations against each other.  If section 39 organisations were to stop doing what they do, it would cost the State far more to provide these vital services.  In many cases, they would simply not be provided.  </p> <p> This is all about the service users and what they should have.  They need consistency, compassionate and capable professionals who are valued and appreciated on every level, including financially.</p></speech>

It is clear from the contributions made in the House that we are all agreed that there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  However, it is a complex one which will need careful thought and consideration to reach a solution.  Like my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, I have sympathy for the workers employed in section 39 organisations who find themselves affected by this issue.  The motion refers to feelings of frustration and anxiety.  I fully appreciate that the situation must be difficult and frustrating.  I represent older people who benefit from the services provided by section 39 agencies.  I must stress that the work and contribution of the staff in these agencies are highly valued and appreciated.  The successful development of palliative care services has been based on a long-standing tradition of positive engagement between the voluntary and statutory sectors.  It is the Government's desire that everyone be provided with the type of palliative care service he or she needs, regardless of his or her diagnosis, age or where he or she will die.</p>  <p>  Government funding for palliative care services has increased steadily in the past five budgets to &euro;78.2 million in 2017.  We now have 223 specialist palliative care beds at 11 locations countrywide.  The majority of these beds, 143, are located in section 39 hospices.  We plan to open a further 110 beds in the next five years.  All HSE areas have community specialist palliative home care teams which play a vital role in enabling people to die at home.  Specialist palliative day care is provided at seven locations.</p>  <p>  We have achieved much in a few short years, but there is no room for complacency.  Many challenges remain, particularly the need to ensure geographical equity of access to specialist palliative care.  In budget 2018, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charity sector, the Government introduced a VAT compensation refund scheme to compensate charities for the VAT they incurred on their inputs.  The scheme took effect from 1 January and will refunds be made one year in arrears.  This commitment will assist to reduce the burden on charities.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working in co-operation with voluntary sector organisations, including section 39 providers, to continue to ensure Ireland will have a palliative care service which is recognised as one of the best in the world.  That is one of the reasons the Government is not opposing the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  We know that there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  As stated, however, it is a complex one which will need careful thought and consideration before agreeing a solution that will be acceptable to all.</p>  <p>  Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE funds organisations by means of grants.  It has in place service level agreements with voluntary providers which set out the level of service to be provided for the grant paid to the individual organisation.  The grants can range from a high value in the millions of euro to a low value of just a few thousand euro.  On the scale involved, in 2016 the HSE provided over &euro;874 million in grants for 2,240 organisations under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  The motion calls for the FEMPI, financial emergency measures in the public interest, cuts to be reversed, as was expected.  However, employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants and, therefore, not covered by the public service stability agreements.  This point is crucial and accepted by all sides of the argument.</p></speech>

Adding potentially 100,000 people to the numbers in the public service cannot be afforded by the Exchequer.  Budgets were cut across the public service during the financial crisis and everyone was expected to make savings.  Given that the large part of the budgets of section 39 organisations is spent on pay, the pay budget was going to be focused on.</p></speech>

Different measures such as increment freezes, pauses in recruitment and reducing staff numbers may also have been used.  I was happy to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, advise the House that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, had instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 agencies in the health sector to establish the factual position on pay reductions and pay restoration.  It is anticipated that this process will produce the necessary clarity, as well as transparency, and, ultimately, an agreed way forward for all parties involved.  I also strongly support this move and hope it will bring about a resolution to avoid what none of us wants, namely, industrial action.</p>  <p>  I have devoted my time as Minister of State with responsibility for services for older people to working towards developing improved services and increasing investment.  Overall funding for older person services will increase from &euro;763 million in 2017 to &euro;811 million in 2018.  This additional funding was hard fought for and I am aware of our responsibility, as public representatives, to ensure the best value is achieved for this money.</p>  <p>  There is no dispute or disagreement about the contribution made by the workers of section 39 charities to the well-being of citizens.  Every side of the House acknowledges, appreciates and recognises the work and contribution they make.  It will take time to evaluate fully what happened in section 39 agencies.  There is disparity across the agencies as a blanket pay cut was not applied.  Staff in many of them may have had one, but others may not.  We are looking for time to enter into the process to engage with all section 39 organisations, as the Minister has instructed the HSE to do.  In its motion Solidarity-People Before Profit call for a detailed analysis to be undertaken of what happened during the financial downturn.  I appeal to Deputies on all sides to work with us to ensure we wo;; have a speedy, right, proper and moral resolution of this issue.</p></speech>

Given that the staff of section 39 organisations are categorised as not being public servants, why did the HSE make them subject to the FEMPI legislatin cuts?  The matter is further exacerbated by the fact that the HSE is unable to identify the full number of section 39 organisations in existence.  Section 39 organisations complied with the measures in good faith.  However, they now find themselves left behind as their section 38 colleagues who do exactly the same work are benefiting from pay restoration.</p><p>This is grossly unfair and will impact greatly on organisations across west Cork.  These organisations are of great assistance to the people of west Cork, as the Minister of State knows.  How can one expect employees to remain with these services when they can receive as much as 10% more by working with section 38 organisations?  Employees of section 39 organisations cannot be expected to accept such unfairness and, to avoid industrial action and the negative impact that this will have, it is imperative for the Government to address the matter with the relevant Departments and ensure that these workers receive the payments that they are entitled to receive.</p></speech>

The Minister of State does not need me to tell him the important work that section 39 organisations and their staff do, or about the work that they provide at a very difficult juncture for our health service.  They need our support.  I think the Minister of State is being disingenuous, or at least his Department is when it tries to suggest that the motivation behind this motion is to somehow make public servants out of these staff.  We are trying to get a correlation between the wages paid to people who do exactly the same work.  The Minister of State and the Department know that the directive issued was issued to ensure that the staff in section 39 organisations had their pay cut to the same level as public servants.  All we are asking is for parity of esteem and that, as the economy has improved, for people to be treated in the same manner.  The work that these people do is extraordinary.  It is done in difficult circumstances and is emotionally draining.  They are under pressure and need to believe that the State is treating them adequately and fairly.  There is an opportunity to do that now.  The Minister of State does not need to kick it to touch.  He can accept that these people are not trying to get all the benefits associated with being public servants but they expect to be paid equally for equal work.  I implore the Minister of State, on behalf of everybody in this House, to stop the filibuster, to call out the Department and to say to it that this is the right thing to do and to do it.</p>  <p>  We have done it ourselves.  We are not civil servants.  We took pay cuts in line with the section of the Civil Service that we are linked to, as principal officers.  The Minister of State is linked to an assistant secretary, and Ministers are linked to Secretaries General.  We are not civil servants.  Our pay was reduced in line with their pay.  Our pay is being restored in line with their pay.  The Minister of State should do the same for section 39 workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700036#PP00300"><p>I only have a short time so I must be brief.  We know there were significant cutbacks across all public services as a result of the economic downturn.  As the economy has improved in recent years, many sections of our public services have seen restoration of pay and conditions.  However, our section 39 agencies are being largely ignored and as a result they are now facing serious dilemmas on the ground.  In my county, Kilkenny, I receive regular contact from section 39 agencies on this matter.  One such agency, SOS Kilkenny, which I welcome to the Public Gallery, provides a vital life service to people in need of service for disabilities and of palliative care and greatly enhances the quality of life through opportunities of social inclusion for their service users.  This is very important work.  It has endured an annual financial deficit of &euro;100,000 for some time and has begged, borrowed and stolen to hang on to its very talented and passionate staff and keep the show on the road.  That has been happening for four or five years.  This position is simply not sustainable and such problems are being echoed all across the section 39 sector.  We must enable section 39 agencies to be able to pay and look after their staff.  These workers are very well trained and have a genuine vocation for the important work they do and we must keep them and pay them what they are worth.  We cannot afford to lose them because they cannot afford to live on what they are being paid.  It is an unthinkable situation in 2018.</p>  <p>  We must also remember the service users all across the country whose lives are greatly improved as a result of the crucial work done by our section 39 agencies and workers.  They are the ones who will ultimately suffer a downgrade or interruption in services and a lowering of general standards if we cannot hang on to the great staff we have in this sector.  They are well-educated, well-trained passionate people who do crucial work.  We are reliably informed that section 39 workers are being headhunted and pinched from the agencies they work for because the agencies cannot afford to offer them the same level of pay and benefits that are offered elsewhere.  That includes the HSE, which is pilfering employees from section 39 agencies because it is able to pay more money since its increments were improved.  It is important to point out that if we end up in a situation in which services are interrupted or removed, it will become the responsibility of the State to care for the service users which will ultimately cost more than pay restoration and equality.  I hope the Minister of State will take these concerns into consideration.  If we lose these services, they will come back on to the State and cost the taxpayer more in the long run.</p></speech>

We used to have Teflon politicians.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly and Finian McGrath, are Tesla politicians because they think their Department is driverless.  They think that they are not the Ministers of State in charge of the Department, that one is not the Minister of State with responsibility for older persons and the other is not the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, based on the response the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, gave this evening.  He repeated the line that section 39 organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members, absolutely ignoring the instruction from the HSE to organisations in 2013 to apply reductions directly to staff costs.  The Minister of State spoke about complexity and how we would recompense staff.  I suggest that he recompenses them in line with the comment that section 39 organisations are to make an appropriate, proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost reduction measures.</p>  <p>  May I suggest that the Government make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of pay restoration measures in the same fashion that it instructed organisations to in 2013?  That would solve that conundrum.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, was slightly detached from the notion that the industrial action pending on 14 February has something to do with him.  He made the plaintive cry that we should try to resolve that.  He is the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and Deputy Daly is the Minister of State with responsibility for older persons' services.  They can do something about it and actually take action on this motion this evening.  They should not treat it like they treat all other Private Members' motions where they know that they will lose it so they will let it through and do nothing about it.  They should do something about this one.  I will hold the Ministers of State to do something about this.  If those workers who work so hard in section 39 organisations decide they have no other option on 14 February, Valentine's Day, but to go to the picket lines, on the Ministers' watch be it.  On their watch be it where families and services will be impacted and where communities will have their services impacted.  The Ministers of State keep parroting the line that these staff are not public servants and have nothing to do with financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  That is the evidence that they have.  They were good enough to be instructed to take a pay cut but the Minister of State does not want to hear about them when it concerns pay restoration.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State's sentiments about palliative care.  We acknowledge the enormous improvements that have happened in palliative care but tonight there will be palliative care nurses in the last minutes and last hours of patients' lives.  They will be there with distraught families.  When they go and get their pay cheque tomorrow or tomorrow week, it will be less than what they would have got had they been employed by the HSE.  They do amazing work and the Minister of State is right to point to the development but if he is that committed to and that passionate about palliative care, then pay the nurses properly.  Pay the disability workers properly and the people who will spend nine or ten hours tonight in a respite house with people with a disability.  Respect them not with just words or platitudes, but in their pay cheque.  Respect their qualifications as professionals.  They get up early in the morning.  The Minister of State's leader is fond of that phrase.  They go to bed late at night.  The difference for them is that while they have the Government's platitudes, they do not have its money.</p></speech>

Today is a moment where we, the Members of the 32nd D&aacute;il, come face to face again with such an issue.  In doing so, we come face to face with our history - a history that continues to unfold and continues to hold up a mirror in which we sometimes do not like what we see, whether it is the damp cold of the Magdalen laundries creeping into our bones, or the sundered silence of mother and baby homes being broken, or the glimpses of what was an all too acceptable culture exposed by the Kerry babies case.  All these are connected by the way we as a country have treated women, and particularly the way we have treated pregnant women.</p>  <p>  I think of another cold January like this one in 1984 when the 15 year-old Ann Lovett gave birth alone to her son beneath a statue of Our Lady.  The death of Ann and her baby son in these stark and lonely circumstances is a memory that chills us still and one we should not forget.  We now arrive at another moment on a long journey, starting with the insertion of the eighth amendment of the Constitution in 1983 through the court cases that made us think about the pregnant victims of rape and incest, through the bravery of families faced with fatal foetal abnormalities who made us think about the particular cruelties we add to their tragedies, and, after all this, perhaps arriving at the realisation that each crisis pregnancy is different and each involves a real woman facing a very difficult and very personal decision.</p>  <p>  These are real women such as the 36 from County Carlow who travelled to the UK for an abortion in 2016, or the 38 from Mayo, the 69 from Tipperary, the 85 from Wicklow, the 241 from Cork and the 1,175 women from Dublin.  Women from every county in the Republic travelled to the UK in 2016 and we need to acknowledge them all, including the 49 from Kerry; 130 from Kildare; 21 from Leitrim; 20 from Roscommon; 69 from Wexford; 39 from Cavan; 15 from Monaghan; 99 from Limerick; 53 from Clare; 38 from Westmeath; 63 from Donegal; 113 from Galway; 44 from Kilkenny; 42 from Laois; 83 from Louth; 100 from Meath; 28 from Offaly; 29 from Sligo; 16 from Longford; and 56 from Waterford.</p>  <p>  In 2016, 3,265 Irish women travelled to the UK alone and we know that Irish women travel to other countries such as the Netherlands as well.  More than 1,200 of the women who went to the UK were aged between 30 and 39; more than 1,500 were aged between 20 and 29; 255 were aged 40 or over; ten were girls under the age of 16; and 230 were teenagers.  More than half of the women who travelled were married, in a civil partnership, or in a relationship while 85% of them were between three and 12 weeks' pregnant.  It is estimated that at least 170,000 Irish women have travelled to other countries for abortions since 1980.</p>  <p>  These are not faceless women.  It might be convenient for us sometimes to think that they are.  They are our friends, neighbours, sisters, cousins, mothers, aunts, and wives.  Each woman is dealing with her own personal situation and making what is a deeply difficult decision because this time around - let us be honest about this &ndash; this is not a decision or a procedure that anyone undertakes lightly.  Women agonise about it and consider every possibility for dealing with the particular crisis facing them, and sometimes they arrive at the conclusion that there is no other option for them but to terminate their pregnancy.  When they arrive at that difficult decision, the country we live in, which we hope has come a long way from the dark events that continue to haunt this Chamber, tells them to go and get their care elsewhere - go to another country or head off somewhere else.</p>  <p>  In 1992, we formalised the right of Irish women to travel for an abortion and to obtain information about it, but we have been temporarily exporting women in crisis for an awful lot longer than that.  I cannot help but wonder what we would have done if we did not have a neighbouring island to help us turn a blind eye.  Sometimes turning a blind eye is the same as turning your back.  We need now to seek to build a society which accepts our own challenges and addresses them honestly, maturely and openly, which does not seek to deny reality or to outsource it to another country, and which does not reject women at the most vulnerable moments in their lives.</p>  <p>  As I stand before this House at the commencement of what I genuinely believe in time could be seen as an historic debate, I am fully aware of the sensitivities and complexities of this issue.  I want to acknowledge the deeply held, genuine views on all sides of the House and throughout the country.  No matter what may divide us, I accept that all of us are trying to do what is right.  All of us are guided by our own conscience and our own sense of humanity.  Some of us have changed our views over the years.  My own views have changed and been formed by listening to women and doctors, and coming to recognise some hard realities.  Some of us bear the scars of past debates and fear what is to come.  However, this time, I firmly believe that it is possible for us to have a respectful debate on the issue.  Please do not call that na&iuml;ve and do not dismiss the idea that we can maturely recognise that each of us has deeply personal and genuinely held views, all of which deserve to be heard, understood and respected.  It is an issue that troubles most of us as individuals.  For some of us, it challenges us to hold what appear to be conflicting views simultaneously.  Which of us does not value and love human life, and which of us does not want to see that protected?  No one has a monopoly on that.  The tactics name-calling, pigeon-holing, and stereotyping need to be consigned to history because they have only led to paralysis, fear and division.</p>  <p>  It will require effort and attention from all of us, regardless of our views, but it is so important that everyone has the chance to hear clearly in order that when, as a nation, we come to make the next decision on this issue, it is informed.</p><p>We do so as a country with a particularly complex past which, in fact, dates back to 1861, when abortion was a felony under the Offences against the Person Act, a felony with a sentence of penal servitude for life.  In more recent decades, it has been an issue dominated by referendums and court cases.  As Members know, 1983 saw the first referendum.  In 1992 there was another with three questions.  Legislation followed in 1995.  A third referendum on abortion was held in 2002 seeking to overturn the X case but it was defeated.  In 2014 the issue came before this House again when we passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.<br/><br/>I remember vividly that debate and some of the offensive comments about floodgates opening.  I remember the language used, which seemed to suggest women would even fake a threat to their own lives to obtain a termination - quite unbelievable really, when we look back only those few short years.  Obviously, none of this has come to pass and the reports laid before this House each year bear that out.<br/><br/>Since the passing of that law there has been a clear legal basis for abortion in Ireland but it has become clear that the Oireachtas can go no further without constitutional change.  Other Members have tried to bring forward thoughtful legislation to assist families with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, for example.  I have been the Minister to respond to these Private Members' Bills but on each occasion the legal advice has been clear that without the repeal of the eighth amendment, we, as an Oireachtas, could not address these issues.<br/><br/>Abortion is a reality for women living in Ireland but not just women in the limited circumstances in which it is legal under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, nor for the many women who travel to other countries, as I have outlined.  There are now new realities on top of that.  The Oireachtas committee heard evidence of abortion pills being bought on the Internet and used by women in this country without any medical supervision.  Research from the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i>shows a 62% increase in the number of women from Ireland contacting one online provider over a five-year period, up from 548 women in 2010 to 1,438 in 2015, and that is just one provider.<br/><br/>Can we pause and picture what this is telling us, because we can get lost in numbers and years?  Is it acceptable to any of us that women are once again left in a lonely and scary place, sending off for a pill to be sent through the post instead of being able to access the medical advice and support they need?  This is happening in Ireland today.  It is a fact.  How can we ignore it?  How can we consider it to be all right?  If it is the sad reality that we have been exporting this issue for many decades, are we now accepting that, on top of exporting it, women must import their own solutions?<br/><br/>I want to turn now to the substance of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I commend all the members for their work and thank them for the contributions they made.  They have served the Oireachtas well.  I wish to thank Senator Catherine Noone, in particular, for her calm and balanced handling of the issue as Chair.  We, as an Oireachtas, asked these colleagues, on a cross-party basis, to do a very important body of work: to listen to experts, to hear evidence and to report back to us.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for the time and dedication they applied to their task.  I would also like to commend the chair of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, and its members for their careful deliberations and to acknowledge their valuable contribution.<br/><br/>The Citizens' Assembly and the committee have given us a model for addressing this issue in a rational and measured way, and I believe it is one we should follow.  I want to recognise that the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report represent the views of the majority of members but there was not unanimous agreement on them.  I respect the views of those who dissented from the recommendations but I believe the recommendations are the basis on which we must proceed on this issue.  The main conclusion of the committee&rsquo;s work is that change is needed to extend the grounds for lawful termination of pregnancy in the State.  In order to effect that change, the committee recommended that Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>should be removed from the Constitution.  The committee then went on to make recommendations on the grounds on which termination of pregnancy should be permitted in Ireland, if Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>is repealed by the Irish people.  It recommended extending the law on abortion to cover cases where the health of a woman is concerned, cases of fatal foetal abnormalities and a broader legal regime that allows abortions where the woman seeks it from her medical practitioner if her pregnancy is under 12 weeks gestation.<br/><br/>I am working with my chief medical officer and officials of my Department, and the Attorney General, to consider how best to translate these recommendations into legislation, should that be the wish of the Irish people.  It is my intention that, in the event of a referendum, as much information as possible would be available to people so they can make an informed decision.<br/><br/>While it is understandable the focus so far has been on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the eighth amendment, it is important to put on the record of the House that the committee did not only make recommendations on termination of pregnancy, but also on the services and supports that should be available to women.  I am fully committed to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services in our country should receive the same standard of safe, high quality care.  Every woman, from any corner of Ireland, should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs.  I am confident that, through the implementation of the first-ever national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, the quality outcomes envisaged by the committee will be realised.  In some ways, it is incredible it is the first-ever national maternity strategy.  Officials in my Department, under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer, have now established a group to address and formulate an effective and comprehensive response to the issues raised by the committee in its ancillary recommendations.<br/><br/>We have made other progress which provides the base for delivering the kind of integrated care women and their babies deserve.  We have established the national women and infants health programme.  We now have HIQA&rsquo;s standards for safer better maternity services and new HSE national standards for bereavement care to ensure clinical and counselling services are in place to support all women and families in all pregnancy loss situations.  The HSE&rsquo;s Positive Options crisis pregnancy counselling service is also available in 50 centres nationwide.<br/><br/>As someone born three years after the 1983 referendum on the eighth amendment, I never imagined I might one day be the Minister for Health responsible for a referendum on its repeal.  I come at it from a perspective that I think was sadly absent in 1983, that is, from the perspective of women&rsquo;s health care.  In the Ministry I have the honour to hold, it is my duty to work to ensure that people in this country receive the highest possible standards of care, and to protect and promote the health of our people under the laws of our land.<br/><br/>I realise the issue before us challenges us - it challenges me.  It causes us to ask difficult questions of ourselves.  It makes us uncomfortable at times as we collectively wrestle with what is, at its core, a very personal and private matter.  Women become pregnant and it is a joyous thing for so many, but it is a terrifying thing for some and a tragic thing for others.  Irish women are driven today to find their own solutions.  Sometimes they put themselves at risk in doing so.  As things stand, they are often left without help, advice or support at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives.  I hope that, as a country, we can no longer tolerate a law which denies care and understanding to women who are our friends, our sisters, our mothers, our daughters, our wives.  Ultimately, there is always a deeply personal, private story behind each individual case, which I believe is a matter best served by women and their doctors.  I believe the people in this country trust women and trust their doctors to make these difficult decisions.<br/><br/>I look forward to what I hope will be a constructive debate on the issues raised by the committee here and in the Seanad.  I hope we can show here that this debate can take place in an atmosphere of respect for each other's views so that the same is possible in the context of a referendum campaign.  After this debate concludes, I expect to return to Government in the coming weeks with a series of proposals which I believe can deliver a referendum by the end of May or very early June, should the will of the Oireachtas be to facilitate that.  I do not doubt that, as long as I remain a Member of this House, I will continue to witness moments in this Chamber that remind us of darker times in our history, but let this be a different type of moment.  Let this be a moment people will look back on as one where their representatives confronted one of the most complex issues we have faced as a country with clarity, with compassion and with care.</p></speech>

Like the Minister, I was too young to vote in that campaign, although I am a few years older than him.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700039#SS00300"><p>I was only three years short of being able to vote in 1983.  All of this indicates that there is a large swathe of people who have never had an opportunity to cast an opinion on this issue.  It should be borne in mind that it is primarily women of childbearing age who are most affected, yet they have never had an opportunity to cast their view.</p><p>Since being appointed Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health, I have been grappling with this issue.  We debated it in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  I sat on the committee chaired by now Senator Buttimer that formulated that debate.  It was insightful because that was the first time that we as an Oireachtas tried to deal with the issue in a non-political way, recognising that it was socially divisive and people had strong feelings on it.</p><p>My leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, subsequently allowed us a free vote - a vote of conscience.  Some parties have followed us in that while others have not.  That is entirely their entitlement.  It is not for me to say whether they should or should not.  Since being appointed health spokesperson, I have tried to take the political element out of this issue, given that it has been charged for a long time and has occasionally been used by political parties of all persuasions and none.  We have gone beyond that now.  Our society is mature enough to have a respectful, incisive and decisive debate on this issue, with the people ultimately deciding.</p><p>I also sat on the joint Oireachtas committee.  I pay tribute to the Citizens' Assembly, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who outlined the assembly's workings and the reasoning behind its conclusions and recommendations.  Our committee was charged by the Oireachtas to examine those recommendations and reach our own determinations.</p><p>The committee did not reach a unanimous view.  Rather, there was a majority view and a dissenting view, with varying views even within those.  I respect every one of those views.  If we are to allow the people the space to grapple with this issue, we in this Chamber must equally acknowledge that people have deeply held views - morally, ethically and even religiously.</p><p>That aside, my personal or political discomfort is nothing compared with the discomfort caused to women every day of the week who are grappling with crisis or unwanted pregnancies or the devastating news of fatal foetal abnormalities.  We must be conscious of that.</p><p>The Minister outlined that 170,000 plus women had left this State for terminations.  We have been exporting our problem for a long time.  It is our duty to address this issue.  With the best will in the world, and although people have varying opinions on this, we cannot do anything other than what we have legislated for already unless we repeal, amend or replace Article 40.3.3&deg;.  We have to change what is in our Constitution.  That will be the first step towards addressing this issue.</p><p>It would be easy for me and others contributing in this debate to keep our heads down and hope that the issue goes away but, as a generation of politicians, we have to deal with it.  We have to give the people an opportunity to express their opinion in light of the fact that the last time they had such an opportunity was in 1983.  Ireland has fundamentally changed in many respects since then, as outlined by the Minister.  It has changed most in how women have become more assertive.  They now have an opportunity to put themselves at the heart of this debate, which is primarily about women's rights and health care and about giving them equal opportunity in the Republic.  We cannot have a situation in which a woman becomes a second-class citizen upon becoming pregnant.  We must understand that that is no longer acceptable.</p><p>People have asked me how the committee arrived at our recommendations.  The Citizens' Assembly made 13 recommendations, the most fundamental one being that there should be a change to Article 40.3.3&deg;.  The assembly outlined three options.  The committee's majority recommendation was for a repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, that is, the article should just be removed from the Constitution, and for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be allowed to legislate for what was primarily a health care issue for women.  There were varying views on that in the legal advice that the committee sought and was given.  I am sure that different advice may even be given to the Government by the Attorney General.  What I do know, however, is that if we continue allowing Article 40.3.3&deg; to be the bulwark for dealing with this issue, the <i>status quo</i>will prevail.  Every night, four or five women will self-administer abortion pills at home and ten women will get on planes every day to fly abroad.  We as a Parliament will have to live with that if we fail to grasp this issue.</p><p>We must show political leadership by having a debate that is respectful of every view that will be expressed in this Chamber and then allowing the people to make their decision based on the full information.  I urge everyone involved not only to respect one another's views, but to engage in the debate so that the question can be decided one way or the other.</p><p>I have expressed my view that there must be a repeal <i>simpliciter</i>or a variation of same that removes Article 40.3.3&deg; from the Constitution.  I am open to a new constitutional article giving the Oireachtas the supreme authority to legislate on this issue.  I would take on board the Attorney General's opinion and that of others.  However, we must be honest with people.  If Article 40.3.3&deg; is replaced or repealed, the Legislature will govern from then on, but we cannot guarantee anything.  We could publish legislation in advance of this referendum campaign that would give people guidance as to what the likely outcome would be, but if the Oireachtas is to legislate in the event of a repeal, then it will be the Oireachtas that will decide, not necessarily this one either, but possibly a changed Oireachtas following a general election.  All we can do is be honest with people about what we believe the Oireachtas in its current composition would pass in the event of a repeal.</p><p>I urge people to examine the committee's recommendations and consider why we came to those determinations.  They are more conservative than the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  For example, the assembly referred to a 22 week gestational period whereas we are calling for a 12 week period in the majority of cases.  It would be a matter for the clinicians and the woman with a view to her health and life.</p><p>Many people have stated their desire to address the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have a friend whose wife received a diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality.  They wanted to have this child.  They kicked the sand up and down Garryvoe beach for weeks on end because of that diagnosis wondering what they would do.  Would she continue with the pregnancy or would she have it terminated?  They spent weeks deciding.  If they decided to terminate the pregnancy, given that there could have been no survival outside of the womb, the only difficulty would have been that they would have had to go abroad.  They made the decision to go abroad.  It was inhumane that our country could force this on our citizens.  They decided to terminate the pregnancy because they felt that they could not go through with it in light of the prognosis of certain death <i>ex utero</i>, so the idea that we would ask people like them to FedEx their little baby back home to Ireland is inhumane.  For that reason, the recommendations in the report are critical to this debate.</p><p>The issue of rape and incest is one about which a lot of people speak.  Even people with quite conservative views in this area will say the issue of incest and rape should be addressed.  All of the empirical legal evidence we have shows that it would be impossible for us to legislate on the ground of rape.  We have to trust the integrity and honesty of women.  Are we to put people who have been subjected to a vile act through another inquisition to find out and determine whether they have been raped in advance of having a termination?  If we are to have restrictions in this area, these are the things that will actually have to happen.  That is why, in the context of the recommendations of the committee, we also looked at the 12-week limit and decided that it should be a matter for the woman and her clinician to determine the reasons for a termination within that period.  That would also address the issue of incest and rape in the vast majority of cases in that we would not need to have an inquisition of women to establish whether they were telling the truth.  I firmly believe we should trust women in this context and that we have a duty to ensure they have the space, with their clinicians, to make the best decision for themselves and the lives they are living.<br/><br/>The Minister spoke about the age profile of those travelling abroad for a termination.  I have received several emails from people which, to say the least, I find quite alarming.  I am alarmed that there are people in our society who think this way because in their emails they are effectively saying the women who travel abroad are just using abortion as another form of contraception.  I find that grossly offensive.  I do not know of any woman who will get onto an aeroplane lightly and head to Liverpool, Birmingham or Holland for a termination of a pregnancy.  I know women who have had terminations, an issue with which they grappled before they made their final decision.  That it is just another form of contraception is a grotesque, offensive view of women.<br/><br/>As my party has allowed members a free vote, I am speaking in a personal capacity.  I am speaking as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy but in a personal capacity and as a representative of the people of Cork North Central.  I leave my personal and political views outside the door when I speak about these issues because I have listened to the evidence given at the committee, heard the personal testimonies about what people had to endure and spoken to individual constituents who brought to my attention the challenges they faced when they received the devastating news of a fatal foetal abnormality or, in some cases, a foetal abnormality and the decisions they had to make.  Space should be given in this debate.  If we expect the people to behave in a manner that allows respect for varying views, the very least we should do is expect the same from each other in this House.  If we are to lead by example in any way, we must allow space for varying views to be expressed.<br/><br/>Committee members held varying views on the issues before it, but majority views were expressed in a number of areas.  The Citizens' Assembly made recommendations to allow a termination for various reasons, the first of which was a real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman.  Reason No. 2 was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide.  Reason No. 3 was a serious risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 4 was a serious risk to the mental health of the woman.  Reason No. 5 was a serious risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 6 was a risk to the physical health of the woman.  Reason No. 7 was a risk to the mental health of the woman.  Reason No. 8 was a risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 9 was pregnancy as a result of rape.  <br/><br/>As a committee, we concurred, by and large, with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, we did deviate from some of its recommendations, primarily in the area of disability.  We were very clear that disability should not be a ground for a termination.  Let us be honest - people make decisions and choices.  Are we to adjudicate on and be judgmental about the decisions they make?  Who are we to judge a person who has just received the most devastating news that the baby she is carrying has a profound disability or will die <i>ex-utero</i>?  The committee did state, however, that after a period of 12 weeks, disability would not be a ground for a legal termination.  That was the strongly held view of a lot of committee members, even those who had quite open views on this issue.  It was not the case that the committee was a slave to the Citizens' Assembly.  It deliberated on every one of the recommendations and came to its own conclusions and did diverge in certain areas.  <br/><br/>I fervently hope the Government can keep to its timetable and that we can have the substantive issue of the repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>dealt with by the summer.  Publishing the scheme of a Bill in that timeframe will require a lot of resources.  We must be honest when we are talking about legislation, people having concerns about a 12-week limit, foetal anomalies, fatal foetal anomalies, incest and rape and so forth and point out that nothing can be done unless we remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>from the Constitution.  All the talk about what might or could happen is only relevant in the event that Article 40.3.3<sup>o </sup>is removed and the only ones who can remove it are the people.  My vote has the same value as that of any person outside the House.  It will be the citizens who will decide.  Our duty, first and foremost, is to facilitate the holding of a referendum and establish the commission to observe that it is fair and impartial.  Political parties and individuals must ensure, at the very least, that they are honest and up front, whatever view they hold, and that we will all be respectful of each other.  As someone who will be 50 years old next Saturday, I do not want to preside over the continuation of the current situation, knowing that next year, the year after and the year after thousands of Irish girls and women will board aeroplanes to seek health care in other countries or climb the stairs to their bedroom with an abortion pill because the State has failed them.</p></speech>

I am also grateful to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I commend its members, including, in particular, its Chairman, Senator Catherine Noone, and the three Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, Deputies Louise O' Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Senator Paul Gavan.  I also thank the Citizens' Assembly and its chairman, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  I commend the Minister for Health for his very compassionate remarks.  I also commend the thoughtful remarks made by Teachta Billy Kelleher.</p>  <p>  One hundred years ago this year Countess Markievicz was elected to the first D&aacute;il.  She went on to become the first female Cabinet Minister in Europe.  She was part of a revolutionary strand of the national movement that included women such as Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Kathleen Lynn and Elizabeth O'Farrell.  They were fine women who serve as role models for many of us to this day.  They led the struggle for women's rights in extraordinary times, buoyed by the freedom charter that was the 1916 Proclamation which addressed itself equally to Irish men and Irish women.  They must have felt betrayed after the counter revolutionary period which resulted in the development of two conservative, narrow-minded states that championed public policy that was anti-women, chauvinistic, cruel and intolerant.</p><p>Women were written out of history.  Their status in this State was confirmed in the 1937 Constitution, which provided that the place of women is "in the home".  Women who strayed beyond the so-called norms were sent to Magdalen laundries or mother and baby homes, where they endured unbelievable hardship and were denied everything by a State that condemned them for no reason other than the fact that they were women.  Such attitudes permeated every facet of Irish life.  The architecture of the State ensured women were consigned to a lesser status.  The employment marriage bar remained in force until 1973.  Domestic violence was not recognised as an issue during this era.  It was not until 1976 that a wife could seek a barring order against her husband.  Criminal conversation, which enshrined in law that a wife was the property of her husband, remained on the Statute Book until 1981.  Contraception was not available without a prescription until 1985, and even then only in chemists until 1991.  Simple things like the purchase of a television or a radio on hire purchase were not possible without a husband's signature at this time.</p> <p> While strides have been made in addressing some of the historic injustices forced on women by this State, the legacy of that treatment remains with us in respect of issues like pay equality, or the lack of it.  It can be seen in the scarcity of women from many aspects of public life, politics and leadership positions in commerce, academia and other sectors.  This injustice is evident in the continued existence of the 1983 amendment to the Constitution, which was already out of touch at that time.  This amendment prohibits access to what is considered, and was considered even at that time, to be basic medical treatment in any developed society.  That is not right.  It is wrong.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to end that injustice.  The business of the State should be to ensure women have access to proper health care services if they need them and choose to avail of them.  The State has a responsibility to support women.  We should not fool ourselves.  Abortion is a reality in Ireland.  Abortion pills are available here.  They can be ordered online and taken by women without medical supervision.  Women in distress can go to England, which is an English solution to an Irish problem.</p> <p> I have my own position on abortion.  As a legislator, I have no right to impose that view on anyone.  It is not for any of us here to cast judgment on anybody for doing what they feel they need to do.  It is for women to make that judgment.  I believe they are fully capable of doing so and are entitled to do so.  Those who are opposed to abortion are entitled to their opinions.  They are equally and fully entitled not to have terminations.  Everyone has the right to choose.  Those who subscribe to a particular faith can heed the guidance of their religious leaders if they so choose.  My strongly held opinion is that it is not appropriate for anyone to foist their views on anyone else.  Some of those who will oppose that analysis are friends of mine.  They are good people whose sincerely held views I respect.  Tolerance has to be the hallmark of our discourse.</p> <p> Ireland has changed.  That change has been spearheaded by women in the first case.  Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann are not going to accept as dogma the continued guidance, mar dhea, of a Constitution that was written when they were second-class citizens and was revised in 1983 under false pretences.  Women do not need moral diktats and certainly do not need condemnation.  They need and deserve respect.  They need the right to make decisions about their own health and their own lives.  Repealing the eighth amendment is the right thing to do.  It will correct an historic wrong.  I hope a referendum to give the people the right to repeal the eighth amendment happens as soon as possible.  I hope the people will support that proposition.  Thereafter, we can debate the merits or otherwise of the legislation that will follow.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the need for abortion to be available where a woman&rsquo;s life, health or mental health is at serious risk or in danger and in cases of rape or sexual abuse.  This has been our policy for a long time.  We recently dealt with the issue of fatal foetal abnormality at an Ard-Fheis.  I never knew there was such a condition.  We listened to compassionate people explaining how they or their partners, sisters or friends decided to carry a fatal foetal abnormality to full term while others could not do so.  We changed our position accordingly.  I think that is what we have to do.  The first step we need to take is to allow women the right to make a choice on these deeply distressing matters.  It is their business, it is their right and it is their choice.  Sinn F&eacute;in will fully support the repeal of the eighth amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700041#UU00200"><p>I would like to add my voice to those who have commended the work of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I particularly commend my colleagues, Teachta&iacute; Louise O'Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Seanad&oacute;ir Paul Gavan.  I also commend the Chairman of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone, who did a very fine job.  As an Oireachtas, we made a big ask of our peers and colleagues on the committee.  I believe they conducted themselves with great dignity, compassion, intelligence and thoughtfulness throughout the hearings.  I commend them on that.  I was disappointed that some members of the committee tried unsuccessfully to thwart its work.  I do not say that to sound a note of rancour, but because it is important that the disrespectful commentary which featured in the course of the committee's work is not allowed to set the tone for the public debate.  As we move to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution and agree a new legislative and regulatory framework, I hope and believe it will be an historic and momentous journey for all of us.  I hope all of this work can be done in a respectful, well-informed, calm and fair atmosphere.</p>  <p>  The harrowing experiences of Joanne Hayes, and all the horrific events surrounding what became known as the Kerry babies scandal of more than 33 years ago, have played themselves out again in heartbreaking detail in the past 24 hours.  The scale of the abuse Joanne endured at the hands of the State was unprecedented and horribly and agonisingly public.  I welcome yesterday's apology from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and today's apology from the Taoiseach.  Such statements are most welcome.  The Taoiseach must now move to make good today's statement on compensation for Joanne Hayes.  She is entitled to a full and formal apology from the State for its persecution and vilification of her and her family.  She also deserves compensation and redress.  Back then, having failed Joanne and having pursued her case in the most corrupt manner, the Garda went viciously for a second bite at the tribunal of inquiry.</p>  <p>  I remember hearing Joanne Hayes's name when I was a girl.  I remember the Kerry babies being spoken of.  I also recall the incredible atmosphere of hostility directed at women and girls in 1983.  I can still feel the very toxic atmosphere in which the eighth amendment was conceived, debated and inserted into the Constitution.  I do not think there is a woman of my age in Ireland who cannot still feel how that atmosphere felt.  After all, this was the Ireland of the mother and baby homes and the Magdalen laundries.  It was an Ireland where women were to be subjugated and kept quiet inside the home to accept their fate.  This obsessive control of women did not happen by accident.</p><p>It was very much intended by a powerful conservative cohort across society - in government and the churches, across the highest ranks of the public and Civil Service and among the professional elites.  Women's subjugation was part of a carving up of power and influence in the public and private spheres, which did not happen by accident.<br/><br/>The then journalist and current European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, wrote the following in 1992:</p><blockquote>The widespread passive acceptance of the patriarchal nature of Irish society also enabled the conservative lobby to hold sway.  Nothing threatens the system more than when women are enabled to take control of every aspect of their lives, public and private.  And there is nothing more critical to the exercise of that control than the ability to decide how many children to have, if any, and when to have them.</blockquote><p>The eighth amendment was in effect a constitutional coup and the reactionary codification of the suppression of women.  That is what happened in 1983.  In the decades since, women in Ireland have had to live with the abusive outworkings of the eighth amendment.  The X case, in particular, brought into sharp focus the worst expression of the conservative coup.  A child who was pregnant as a result of rape was dragged through the courts by the State, whose sole and stated intent was to force her to continue with the pregnancy from rape to full term.  I still struggle to fully comprehend the callousness of the State in so aggressively and cruelly forcing a child victim of rape to continue with pregnancy.  It is hard to fathom that any individual or agency could heap more abuse and trauma on a child who had already been violated.  Even after the Supreme Court judgment, the public outcry and the horrors endured by Miss X and her family, successive Governments refused for more than two decades to legislate for the X case.  It is important to record that this is a source of shame for successive Oireachtais.  It took the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar and the alphabetical array of cases taken by incredibly brave women to shame government into finally enacting in law the Supreme Court decisions in the X case.<br/><br/>There is now broad acceptance across the Oireachtas and in wider society that the eighth amendment must be repealed from the Constitution.  I passionately believe that now is the time for leadership and in that regard, I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, on his words this evening.  Leadership must come from the front.<br/><br/>Abortion is a divisive issue.  That statement echoes throughout this debate.  While that may be the case, the abuse of women and indifference to our health and bodily integrity are not divisive issues but unacceptable positions to take in public life.  Some people argue that because abortion is a divisive issue, votes of conscience must, therefore, be allowed.  I do not share that view and I say this as someone who is deeply respectful of diverse views and fully understands that some people will struggle with this issue.  However, in the final analysis, this debate is a matter of public health, women's health, our right to decide and our right to respect for our conscience as we decide on matters for ourselves.  The clinicians and doctors, not least in the hearings of the joint committee, made clear that the eighth amendment casts a long shadow over their practice and relationships with their patients and jeopardises women's health and their lives.<br/><br/>The first issue for the Oireachtas to address is the nature of the question to be put for repeal.  A simple repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, as recommended by the joint committee, must be delivered.  There can be no equivocation on this by anyone.  If legal advice that takes a contrary view is offered, for instance, if it is suggested that instead of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, an enabling clause should be inserted in the Constitution, the Government must share this advice with all Oireachtas Members because we need transparency and informed debate above all.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy Billy Kelleher and my party colleague, Deputy Gerry Adams, that the first order of business is the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Thereafter, we must debate and acquire an understanding of the legislative framework.  The first task and duty of the Oireachtas at this time is to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution.  It is time to right a fundamental wrong that occurred in 1983.  As legislators, we cannot accept the terrible impact of the eighth amendment on women's health, their obstetric care and well-being, and their and our fundamental rights.  We must state loud and clear that we trust and respect women and that there is no place for the cruelty of the eighth amendment in a modern and diverse Ireland.<br/><br/>There can be no place for unnecessary dogma or doctrinaire positions in the coming months.  I accept, however, that we must listen to, acknowledge and engage with people's concerns.  It is, after all, our shared responsibility to protect women's rights and health now and into the future by engaging in a respectful debate and delivering a successful referendum result, which means the repeal of the eighth amendment. <br/><br/>As we are all being confessional and owning up to our ages, I was 14 years old when the eighth amendment to the Constitution was made.  As I was reflecting on this debate and listening to Joanne Hayes, I wondered how I would explain to my 14 year old daughter what Ireland was like then and what the hostility experienced by women and girls felt like at the time.  I am very happy to say I could not begin to explain to my 14 year old daughter what that was like.  That is a great thing.  It is now time for the law, politics and every Member of the Oireachtas to catch up with public opinion and the new Ireland, the country in which my 14 year old daughter and all our daughters and granddaughters - and our boys and men - live and give us and them a decent, human rights-based and respectful Constitution that acknowledges women as full and equal people.</p></speech>

I do so as leader of the Labour Party and the first speaker in this debate who was a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1983.  At that time, I was a newly appointed Member of the other House and I was present in the Seanad on Wednesday, 4 May 1983 when the then Senator Mary Robinson moved an amendment on behalf of the Labour Party group.  The amendment stated that Seanad &Eacute;ireann refused to give a Second Reading to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill on the grounds that the legislation was so unclear and ambiguous that it was not a proper subject for a proposal to be submitted to the people in a referendum.</p><p>That was the unanimous view of Labour Party Senators, of which I was one.  The Taoiseach at the time, Garret FitzGerald, described the constitutional amendment Bill as dangerous and unacceptable.  At the same time, he urged Fine Gael Senators to abstain on the Labour Party amendment.  The amendment to refuse the passage of the eighth amendment Bill in Seanad &Eacute;ireann was lost by 18 votes to 15, with Fine Gael Senators abstaining and all Fianna F&aacute;il Senators opposing the Labour Party amendment.  At the time there were three Northern Irish Members of the Seanad, all of whom supported the Labour Party position.</p> <p> I believed then, as I do now, that the Constitution is not the place to determine our laws on abortion.  Others have said that Ireland has changed radically in the past 35 years, and so it has.  The issue of abortion, throughout this period, has been divisive and challenging.  Unlike any other issue of social policy, it has not been those most directly affected who have been involved in the debate - it has not been the women.  We have heard how at least 170,000 women since 1980 have availed of abortion services outside the State.  For the most part, they have been silent and unseen.  Their voices and experiences have gone largely unheard.  Often, they have been unable to discuss their choices or health needs with friends, relatives or even medical practitioners.  Instead, by and large, the debate 35 years ago and since has been led by individuals and groups who come to the issue with moral certainty and crusading zeal.  In that context, I commend the work undertaken with care and openness by the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee.  In particular, I commend the work of the chairperson of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone.</p> <p> The report of the committee is clear and thorough.  The committee addressed two fundamental issues.  First, it examined the requirement or otherwise for constitutional reform.  The eighth amendment of the Constitution was passed on 7 September 1983 after what the report characterised as a bitterly contested referendum.  I believe that characterisation is accurate, indeed understated.  I remember it.  I was going to include some of my memories of that time but I decided that would only contribute to further divisiveness.  Anyway, the experience of that campaign impacted on all political discussion of the issue subsequently.  I welcome the change in atmosphere thus far, although judging from some e-mails and letters already received, I doubt if that will continue.</p> <p> The recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly was to replace Article 40.3.3o with a provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of pregnant women.  I strongly agree with the view taken by the Oireachtas committee regarding the effect this proposal would have on the separation of powers.  The recommended approach of the committee, that is, to simply repeal Article 40.3.3o is, I believe, a better and safer course of action.</p> <p> The first and fundamental issue is that the Constitution is not the appropriate place to deal with an issue as complicated as abortion, impacting as it does on evolving medical practice and technology.  I believe this view is widely supported.  In many ways, therefore, it is not what will replace Article 40.3.3o by way of legislative provision in the event that the Oireachtas was free to legislate in this matter that has been the greater focus of the Oireachtas committee.  The first issue must be to allow the Oireachtas to make those decisions and to remove Article 40.3.3o from the Constitution.</p> <p> Whatever proposals we determine &ndash; I intend to deal with them in some detail &ndash; will evolve over time in any event.  Many have argued prior to 1983 and since that a constitutional provision is required because neither the Oireachtas nor the Judiciary can be trusted on this issue.  The original objective was to tie the hands of elected Deputies and Senators to prevent change in our abortion laws, regardless of changes in medical practice, knowledge or understanding as well as changes in drugs and general access to drugs.</p> <p> The constitutional provision of 35 years ago remains unaltered.  Given all the experience of the past three decades, it is surely now time for change.  The Oireachtas must be given scope to address these critical issues in an evolving world.  The members of the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas Committee showed how these matters can be addressed calmly and thoroughly having regard to the complexity surrounding abortion and maternal health.  They provided proof, if proof were needed, that the Oireachtas can be trusted and, equally important, should be trusted to act in the best interests of all the people.</p> <p> The legislation that should be enacted in the event of Article 40.3.3o being deleted from the Constitution was a significant focus of the committee.  A total of 13 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly relating to the grounds on which termination of pregnancy might be lawful were considered in turn.  The committee also examined the operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  In general terms, I believe it is fair to say that the Oireachtas committee did not recommend change as far-reaching as that recommended by the Citizens' Assembly, a point made by Deputy Kelleher.  Clearly, the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that abortion should be lawful up to 22 weeks' gestation on socioeconomic grounds was not supported by the Oireachtas committee.  Instead, the committee recommended that the law should be amended to permit termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to the reason, provided that it is availed of through a GP-led service delivered in a clinical context as determined by law and licensing practice in Ireland with a gestational limit of 12 weeks.  Although this recommendation is, as I said, far more restrictive than that proposed by the Citizens' Assembly, it is still likely to be the most controversial of the committee recommendations.  For that reason, I believe it deserves most careful consideration and an examination of the reasoning that brought the majority of the committee members to this conclusion.</p> <p> In truth, to fully understand the development of thought it is necessary to have listened to or read the submissions and presentations to the committee.  The report condenses this important and vital work into a few short paragraphs, but it is clear from the work of the committee that, in the context of any move from general declarations of principle to actual practical law, the committee recommendation makes sense.  How can we achieve the objective to allow for abortion in the case of rape or incest in any other way?  It cannot be that we need a police investigation and court prosecution to have concluded before determining that an abortion can be lawful.</p><p>God protect us from going down that route again.  To attempt to legislate for rape or incest on a stand-alone basis would open a nightmare world for already traumatised women.  It would involve garda&iacute; and lawyers when what is needed is medical and psychological support.  The reopening of the appalling circumstances surrounding the Kerry babies case should be evidence enough of that.  Our laws have to be practical, enforceable and humane.  The committee&rsquo;s recommendation in this regard is, therefore, I believe, the correct one.  That view is immeasurably strengthened by the fact of life of the broad availability today of abortion pills.  Unless it is our intention to arrest and prosecute every woman who imports or takes such pills, we need to face up to that reality.  While there may be some who would advocate such arrests and prosecutions, I have no doubt that such action would be repudiated by the majority of our people, not to mention the implication for women&rsquo;s rights in international law.  When the matter is carefully examined, it is clear how and why the committee came to make this recommendation.</p> <p> Another area where the Oireachtas committee differed with the Citizens' Assembly was in the assembly's recommendation allowing for abortion up to 22 weeks' gestation in the case of foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.  The committee&rsquo;s view, with which I agree, was not to accept this recommendation.  The committee recommended that provisions in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 needed to be amended.  That Act was drafted under the constraints of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  Many of us, including Members such as myself who were in government when the Act was enacted, will be very happy to see the Act amended in the event of constitutional change allowing us to do that.</p> <p> There is much more in the report dealing with sex education, obstetric care and counselling, and contraception.  It is a very important and welcome body of work.  It is now time for the rest of us in the Oireachtas, those who were not members of the committee, to do our bit.  We need to address, without delay, the steps to be taken to allow the people to have their say before the end of May.  Talk of slipping into June is not acceptable and we have already received large volumes of correspondence from young people who will be out of the country in June, having finished their studies.  Students start their leaving certificate on 6 June and it would be perverse if the very people who will be most affected are excluded from having their say, for the first time, on this truly important issue.</p> <p> We need to address the steps to be taken to allow this to happen before the end of May.  The T&aacute;naiste today set out the path before us.  The Minister for Health is to bring memoranda before Cabinet between now and March.  We need to pass the referendum Bill.  We need to establish a referendum commission and allow it adequate time to do its important work.  Equally important, in my opinion, is to ensure that all of this is done in time for a May referendum.  Members have commented favourably on the Minister's speech on this issue and I thought it was a very thoughtful speech.  However, it was a speech that said we needed to bring about change, not a speech that said, "I am the Minister and this is what I intend to do.  Having considered the report, this is what I am going to recommend to colleagues."  We need to get to this point.  We have had decades of debate and there has been concentrated debate in the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee in the past year.  It is now time to set out the timelines for achieving this objective and to allow the people to have their say.</p> <p> I began by reflecting on the debates in these Chambers in 1983.  Seared by the campaign that followed, I express the hope that we can do things differently and more respectfully now.  In the intervening years, as Minister for Health I had my office and home picketed.  Children&rsquo;s coffins were brought to my Wexford office and things that I will not mention were posted in my home town.  I hope that the past is another country and that it is possible for all of us to listen as well as speak and to acknowledge difference without vile attack.  For my party, that is what I pledge.  The Labour Party accepts the Oireachtas committee report and its recommendations.  We will campaign for change with vigour but with respect.</p> <p> My party has been at the forefront of social change for as long as I can remember, in campaigns that look amazing in retrospect such as to provide for legal contraception, to allow for divorce and, most recently, to provide for marriage equality.  All, in their time, were strongly resisted.  All, in their time, came to pass.  Often we discover that the people&rsquo;s thinking on social policy is more advanced than that of the elected Members of these Houses.  Let the people decide this matter.  Let us also work to ensure that they can do so in an atmosphere of reason and without interference from groups or elements outside our State.  No doubt many groups will engage in this campaign and some will seek to characterise it as something which it is not.  What is in question here is an important matter of social policy for our people, not the contest of State and church or the defeat of anyone.  Simply and importantly, it is a matter of supreme importance to thousands of our citizens, as families and individual women try to make the best possible decision for themselves and their loved ones.  After decades of fear, the people in 2015 overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to allow same-sex marriage.  For many who voted yes, that was a journey of self-discovery and tolerance.  Perhaps it is not too much to hope for something similar on this issue too.</p></speech>

I welcome the people who are in the Gallery for the debate but there are hundreds of people outside, members of the Strike 4 Repeal movement, in freezing cold temperatures, listening to the debate.  Young people in this country are watching this issue like no other political issue and it will be the biggest political and social issue in 2018 and for many years to come.  The people outside are waiting to hear the response of the D&aacute;il to the all-party committee report and the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, and an action plan from Government outlining what will happen and when it will be implemented.</p>  <p>  The nub of the issue is that people want a simple repeal referendum by late May because that is the optimal time for the maximum participation of young people.  Lest anybody be under any illusion, young people are the people most affected by this decision.  This D&aacute;il is not made up of young people but of a very unrepresentative sample of society in many ways.  They want a referendum that will lead to change and real abortion legislation.</p><p>At the very minimum, that legislation must provide for unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks.  If anybody thinks that repeal can be avoided or that we can put it off until the autumn or until next year, if that was even contemplated, there would be a revolt among young people.  If anyone thinks we can have a repeal referendum with very little change following it, that would also lead to a huge reaction.  The tide cannot be held back on this issue any longer.</p> <p> I have spoken on the issue of abortion a lot.  I am tired of listening to myself, never mind what other people are tired of listening to.  This is for a reason.  It is because the idea of bodily autonomy is an absolute for young people.  Abortion rights are what people want - not on this or that ground, not a "deserving" abortion.  The concept of abortion rights is what most young people and a growing section of the population now believe in.  Political parties cannot just hide behind repeal and think they can sail through the referendum without saying what will follow it.  They cannot try to pretend they stand for things that they may not stand for.  They can cut that out as well because-----</p></speech>

In effect, this will be a referendum on abortion rights.  In a sense, that is only natural.  I do not think that this D&aacute;il has the guts or the composition to bring in abortion legislation without a massive public endorsement and a push to do so.  The concept of 12 weeks will be key in the referendum.</p><p>Solidarity-PBP is obviously pro-choice.  It was the only fully pro-choice formation in the D&aacute;il up until recent times.  Hopefully, that will change.  We have played a lead role in arguing this case and in the active movement for repeal.  Solidarity-PBP recognises that these are historic recommendations.  It is only four short years since the very same parties, arguing for change, voted in a 14-year jail sentence for women.  That is a fact.  What has brought this change about?  We have heard many on the committee and others saying they were on a journey.  The phrase has become very well worn and they have decontextualised it from the actual reality.  People may have been on a journey but they were pushed to go on it, in many cases kicking and screaming.  Change has been forced from outside.  The evidence that was heard at the committee was very important.  I played a role in arguing and advancing some of that evidence, very importantly in the case of the abortion pills, which are a crucial factor in the decision that has been reached and which have been cited by many people.  The civil disobedience that was undertaken with regard to the abortion pills was also hugely important.  The use of the abortion pill tripled in about three years, since particular actions were taken by organisations like ROSA and others.  We need to be honest about where the change has come from.</p><p>We also need to be honest that this D&aacute;il set up the Citizens' Assembly in an outsourcing fashion and assumed it would come back with a much more minimal recommendation.  There is always a danger when we entrust ordinary people with important decisions.  They might actually listen, engage and fact-check the evidence they hear.  They might come up with essentially compassionate and pro-choice recommendations.  The recommendation of 12 weeks on request came from the Citizens' Assembly.  I also want to put on record that socioeconomic reasons up to 22 weeks unfortunately was not agreed by a majority of parties and groups but it was advanced by a strong minority.  It was a bit of a cop-out, to be honest.  Many women will not be able to fall in to a 12-week timeframe for many reasons and usually they will be the most vulnerable, the poorest and the youngest.  All we are doing is continuing travel outside the State.</p><p>The other question I want to address is disability and severe abnormality.  It is quite clear that people who are anti-abortion are going to use very emotive arguments about disability, Down's Syndrome, etc.  We have heard them already throughout this campaign.  It is the case that the committee did not take a majority position of support in respect of severe abnormality.  I take no moral lectures from anybody about a woman who would make a decision on those grounds.  It is not a cake-walk bringing up a child with a severe disability.  I refer particularly to parties and individuals who have done nothing to make their lives better and who have voted for cuts in disability services, etc.</p><p>The response of a huge number of Deputies has so far been to run for cover.  A huge number have still not declared where they stand on this.  If examining one's conscience was an Olympic sport, numbers of Irish Deputies would be winning gold medals.  There was a great play made around the time of the marriage equality referendum that everyone held hands in the D&aacute;il and walked out and won the referendum.  That was not the case and it will not be the case here because parties will not be united.  There is not a party whip.  The winning of the referendum will be down to huge numbers of active people, young people, women and communities.</p><p>For politicians who are feeling troubled, it is very simple.  The two questions they need to ask and answer are these: first, whether they support abortion being legal or illegal, because it will continue regardless and, second, whether they actually support forcing people to remain pregnant who do not want to be pregnant.  That is the logic of supporting a ban on abortion.  People say there are extreme views on both sides.  I do not think I have an extreme view.  My view is that the person involved ultimately should make the decision.  I think that is a humane view.</p><p>We need to give huge credit to the active campaigns like those from the people who are outside the House this evening.  The protests have mushroomed in the last years, with the repeal jumpers being worn, people taking part in repeal protests and the strike for repeal.  Women have themselves defied the unjust ban by ordering abortion pills online and we have seen events like the abortion pill train, bus, etc. that I mentioned.  The recommendations of the committee arise from those social movements that have taken place on the ground.</p><p>Many people have invoked 1983 and 1984, the year that followed the eighth amendment, the crass hypocrisy around Ann Lovett, the Kerry babies, etc.  There is now a growing movement for gender equality.  We have seen it with Trump and with the #metoo movement.  The movement taking place outside on repeal is the exact same.  It is a movement for bodily autonomy and for abortion rights.  The time is up now for politicians to be hiding on this issue.  There is no hiding place left.  Young people will not accept any further procrastination or restrictions.</p><p>I ask the Minister to state the date of the referendum.  It has not been set.  That is a key demand and question in the minds of people outside.  The information we got from the T&aacute;naiste earlier that the Government is not going to move a repeal Bill until early March is leaving it extremely tight.  We need at least six weeks plus 30 days' grace before the referendum can be called.  Maybe the Minister would clarify that.  To be clear, it has to be repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  This was debated by the committee.  I do not have time to go into it.  We will then need a complete scrapping of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.</p></speech>

Only that I am a Deputy and the garda&iacute; recognised me, I would not have been able to move.  Why is there such paranoia about this subject and women?  Why is society so terrified to allow women to have a voice on an issue that has everything to do with their bodies?  The vast majority of people out there are ordinary young women.</p><p>They were not going to storm the gates of Leinster House and come in with submachine guns to mow us all down.  They are out there to plead with us for God's sake to get on with it. </p> <p> This D&aacute;il has a shameful history of dealing with this issue.  I saw that with my own eyes long before I came in here.  It used to crease me to see that for 21 years after the Supreme Court ruled on the X case, there was cowardice played out in this House.  No party had the guts to move on this issue until Deputy Clare Daly brought in the first Bill in, I understand, April 2012.  That was the first time anybody had the guts to say this was an issue and we have to confront it.</p> <p> There was a campaign in 1983 for the eighth amendment, and I am acutely aware of Joanne Hayes, the Kerry babies and all of the statistics.  I am also acutely aware that anybody under the age of 45 years, not just Deputy McDonald's daughter, is horrified today having read the details of what happened to Joanne Hayes all those years ago.  We are not just talking about the darkness of the 1980s.</p> <p> In 2017, a young woman was sectioned under the Mental Health Act because she said she was suicidal and wanted to have an abortion.  In 2014, we kept a clinically dead woman alive for several weeks against the wishes of her family because the foetus inside her had a heartbeat.  In 2014, a raped asylum seeker was forced against her will to continue with a pregnancy.  In 2012, Savita Halappanavar died, having requested an abortion in a hospital in Galway.  We have the alphabet soup of Miss X, Miss C and Miss D.  I could go on and on.  We have the condemnation by the UN Human Rights Commission that what happened to Amanda Mellet was inhumane, degrading and cruel.  What does that say about this country and the political representatives who have run it for the past decades?  It says a lot and we are indeed living in the dark ages.  We do not have to think about the Kerry babies.</p> <p> I know there are genuine people who do not want to see this happen again and are ashamed of that shameful dark history.  They are worried when they hear that the floodgates will open and that women will want to have abortions every other day of the week because it is a great way not to get pregnant or that women will get pregnant just to get rid of it and will get pills and swallow them.  If people do not want to see any of these incidents repeated, they need to vote to repeal the eighth amendment.  The obstetricians and gynaecologists who came to the committee gave evidence that the eighth amendment creates a chill factor for the medical profession when it comes to dealing with women.  They are afraid of their lives to intervene when there is a heartbeat because of the eighth amendment.</p> <p> To those who are middle of the road, I ask them to vote to get rid of the amendment.  Until they do, we will have a repetition of the X, Y and C cases, Amanda Mellet and others.  That has to be stated clearly.  The vast majority of people in this country do not wish to see that sort of the society, even though there is an extreme atmosphere around this issue, in particular in the corridors of religion and sometimes in the corridors of power.</p> <p> I wish to speak to those who want to stop women having bodily autonomy.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a very good speech.  It was very conciliatory but there were some gaping holes in it because he referred to the 1861 Act, which subjected women to penal servitude for life.  I understand a life sentence is about seven years.  We have an Act which subjects women to a 14 year sentence, but the he forgot to mention it.  He also said that he wanted to give out as much information as possible during the course of the referendum.  Can we please ensure that all Deputies have a sense of responsibility?  If they give out information, they should make sure it is accurate so that we are not told by a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy that the floodgates will open for abortion on the grounds of Down's syndrome.  One cannot get a test for Down's syndrome prior to 12 weeks' gestation without paying &euro;400.</p> <p> Deputy Coppinger referred to socio-economics.  A woman could always have an abortion in this country if she could afford it, by getting on a plane, going away and paying for it.  When a woman is poor, an asylum seeker, living direct provision or a worker who cannot take time off and has to scrape pennies together to pay up to &euro;2,000 for an abortion, that is when she is discriminated against.  That is one good reason to remove discrimination on the basis of class and discrimination against a cohort of women who do not have the right to enter and leave this country freely.</p> <p> We also have to have respect for doctors and the medical profession and give them the space to work with women to make decisions about their health.  It is the only time in the maternity care system when an individual does not have the right to say what happens to her body.  I know many women who go through miscarriages are forced to wait for 20 or 25 hours because a doctor is not allowed to induce them.  They have to wait in terrible pain until the miscarriage is seen through to the end.  That has left many women I know of, who are my age, distressed for their entire lives and has had an impact on their families.</p> <p> I wish to make a strong appeal to those who think that protecting the eighth amendment means they are protecting something precious.  They are not.  All they are protecting is the dark history of this country.  They are not going to protect any unborn foetus or potential child by protecting the eighth amendment.  We cannot force women to be pregnant when they do not want to be.  They will find a way out of it.  As has already been said, it is a case of supporting legal abortion or supporting illegal abortion, or supporting the extradition and enforced exile of women from this country to Liverpool, London, Holland and elsewhere.  It is forcing young women, in particular, to have abortions on their own, in their own beds, by taking the pill without any medical supervision, and because of the chill factor of the 14 year sentence, they are afraid to tell their parents.</p> <p> In Northern Ireland three women have been arrested and charged for using or procuring the abortion pill.  One was a mother who procured it for her child and the other two women procured it for themselves.  That also has to change.  I hope that if we get the eighth amendment out of the Constitution and begin to establish legal safe abortion for women in this country, it will cross the Border and the Brexit factor will not stop it from happening.  It should have had it long before us under the 1968 Abortion Act in Britain.</p> <p> I want to say to those who think they are protecting precious life to think about it in this way.  There are children living in this country who have been born in this country.  One fifth of them live in poverty.  Approximately 3,000 are in homeless accommodation today.  Molly, who we heard about during the week, is an example of one of the hundreds of children who have not had their rights met.  They are born, they are human flesh and they are living.  We have not endorsed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We continue to force children into homeless accommodation.  If people feel so passionately about life, join us in fighting to change that, get the rights of people with disabilities acknowledged and end homelessness and poverty among lone parents, which is at the highest ever rate.</p> <p> There are many ways to skin a cat and protect human life.  That is what I would like to say to those who think I am some kind of terrorist.  I am sure many others have received the literature which called us terrorists for supporting a woman's right to choose.  The right to choose, by the way, is to be able to choose to have a child as well.  How can a woman choose to have a child with dignity and respect if she has no home, proper health service or job, or no access to IVF treatment when she is finding it difficult to get pregnant?  Choice work both ways.  Women should be able to choose to control pregnancies and have a child.  That is the sort of future society we want to live in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700046#ZZ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I thank Senator Catherine Noone and all of the members of the committee and the Citizens' Assembly.  I also thank the Minister for his speech, its content and the way he delivered it.  However, I have two reservations which have already been mentioned.  One is that he gave no timeline and the second is the failure to mention the draconian 2013 legislation.</p>  <p>  I fully support the various recommendations of the committee.  The Constitution was amended in the 1980s.  The 1980s gave us the case of Sheila Hodgers who died on 19 March, prior to the referendum.  We knew exactly what we were doing in the country when we passed the referendum.</p><p>She died two days after delivering her baby prematurely.  Her cancer treatment had been stopped by the hospital which claimed it would harm her pregnancy.  She was also denied X-rays and pain relief.  That was prior to the amendment.  When we passed the amendment it was a time in Ireland when we had the Kerry babies tribunal and when Ann Lovett died, 33 years ago at the end of this month, on 31 January.  It was an Ireland that sent Eileen Flynn from her position in a school in Wexford simply because she loved a man whom she subsequently married, with whom she had a child and whose children she raised.  It was the 1980s of the moving statues, limited contraceptives and when marital rape was not recognised.  It was a time when we had no divorce and many other things were absent.</p> <p> As somebody who lived through that time as a young woman it was the Ireland of secrets, shame and mass emigration.  It was an Ireland that told us that if we stepped out of line and did something we would be punished severely one way or another.  Those secrets and that shame came to light and they were overseen by the pillars of society at the time both in the church and outside it.  Subsequently, we saw those pillars fall to the ground.  I am not here to mention names but one has to mention some names such as those of Fr. Cleary and Bishop Casey, and the subsequent exposure of horrific abuse.  We had different types of inquiry, for example, into clerical abuse in Ferns, Cloyne and Dublin.  Institutional abuse was examined in the Ryan report.  The abuse in families was exposed by numerous inquiries such as those in Kilkenny and Roscommon.  The report into the abuse in the Kilkenny incest case was subsequently published in the 1990s.  We had the 1980s of secrets, which followed on from previous decades of secrets, and that has continued as previous speakers said right up to today as we grapple with the mother and baby home in Tuam.  We still have not learnt to be honest, straight and direct.  I am pleased the Minister is nodding his head in relation to that.</p> <p> I have thanked the Minister and the committee but I wish in particular to thank the courageous women who have brought the inadequacy of the eighth amendment to our attention repeatedly in the most appalling of circumstances.  I refer, for example, to the 17-year old who refused to allow herself to be classified as suicidal ten years ago, back in 2007.  She was being pushed to say she was suicidal when she simply wanted a termination because she had discovered that she had an anencephalic pregnancy.  She was adamant that she was not suicidal and she was forced to go to the High Court.  Many cases have arisen since the introduction of the eighth amendment which I do not have time to go into.  It was quite clear at the time to me and to other people that it was an appalling amendment to the Constitution.  Even as young women we knew there were going to be problems.</p> <p> In 1992 there was the case which famously became known as the X case.  It involved a 14-year old girl who was raped by a family friend.  She had to go through absolute torture to get a termination.  In 1997 a 13-year old girl was raped and became pregnant.  Again, the circumstances were appalling and there was an appalling process involved for her to try to get a termination.  The D case took place in 2006.  A fatal foetal abnormality was diagnosed and again it was a difficult process to get a termination.  I mentioned the 17-year old Miss D case in 2007.  In 2010 there was the A, B and C cases.  Miss C was pregnant and suffering from cancer.  In 2012 in my own city we had Savita's case.  Again, there was an absolutely appalling lack of basic treatment but the fact is that more emphasis was put on a foetal heartbeat than on the treatment of obvious sepsis and that should not have happened.  In 2016 there was the Amanda Mellet case and in 2017 there was the Whelan case.  Over that period we have been forced to confront this issue by very brave women whose health has suffered, some of whom have died.  We have also been forced to do so by European court judgments, and a United Nations committee which has clearly told us that what we are doing to our women is inhuman, degrading and amounts to certain torture.</p> <p> I am here tonight to proudly add my voice to say the amendment simply has to go.  It is time to trust women to make decisions.  I make my comments in the context of the centenary celebration of women getting the right to vote, albeit a limited right, and 70 years after No&euml;l Browne bravely tried to introduce his comprehensive mother and child scheme.  That was not successful.  Seventy years later we have a very welcome report from the Oireachtas committee with its ancillary recommendations telling us that in the 21st century, in 2018, we have significant gaps in the provision of maternity services.  The Minister clarified that this is the first maternal strategy.  We are excluding women from the health service in the 21st century, 70 years after Noel Browne's gallant attempt.  Women are excluded from the health service in terms of getting a termination and they are going abroad in their thousands.  The figure of 3,265 was mentioned.  Those women come back bleeding, having travelled through airports, and we stand over that and exclude them from any follow-up treatment.  We should cringe, collectively, that it has taken us this much time and effort from vulnerable women who have had the courage in the most appalling circumstances to stand up, and also our colleagues such as Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Wallace, and all the other people who have tried to raise the issue.  If I mention names I might forget somebody so I pay tribute to all the Deputies who have brought or attempted to bring Bills before the D&aacute;il to deal with the matter in a humane way.  It is time to treat this society as a secular society.  Ironically, for those who are totally against abortion, whose opinion I fully respect, the best way to reduce the rate of abortion is to look at those countries which have liberal regimes as they have a very low rate of abortion.  For me, that is the most ironic fact in all of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700047#AAA00200"><p>First, I acknowledge the hard work and informed research carried out by the members and the Chair of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution over the course of four arduous months.  It could not have been easy and the burden was huge but we are grateful that the committee members have done the groundwork to enable a constructive, respectful debate on the issue of abortion in this country.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the Citizens' Assembly and committee prove that once armed with informed research and information and personal accounts of people's experiences, the compassionate support for the right of women to access abortion reveals itself overwhelmingly.  I also believe that people are ready to engage on this issue and I am hopeful that the majority of the public will support a repeal.</p>  <p>  There is a narrative in the media that this committee report is extreme in its liberalisation of abortion provision in this country.  While I am supportive of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, I believe they do not go far enough and I am disappointed that unrestricted abortion provision only goes to 12 weeks.  Legislation should provide for access to abortion after 12 weeks on broader grounds.  My reason for this is that once we start introducing restrictions, inevitably someone will fall through the cracks and term limits inevitably become political and moral barriers which end up affecting the most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  We need to acknowledge that every situation is unique and that we should support women no matter what choice they make about their bodies.  For me, it is a fundamental human right for someone to enjoy bodily autonomy but right now in this country only men can enjoy that right.</p>  <p>  I remind the House that the effects of the eighth amendment are all pervasive.</p><p>The amendment restricts women on a number of fronts, including in regard to access to sexual health information owing to the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 and the issue of consent throughout the provision of maternity care, not to mention the fact that the amendment has accounted for one of the strictest abortion regimes in the world.</p> <p> The committee is strong in emphasising that all women should have equal access to improved health care services, including basic services such as scanning and testing, and that these should be made available irrespective of geographic location or socioeconomic circumstances.  All these services help to inform women to make the best choice for them, and this can be only a positive step for society.  It will, however, be a resources issue.  I encourage the Government to devise a national strategy that would see improved access to reproductive services for all women and girls, including better sexual health and relationship education, family planning services, contraception - including free contraception for medical card holders - perinatal hospice care, counselling and support services, and termination of pregnancy, if required.  All are vital in every part of this country.</p> <p> Not only have we denied women the right to health care in this country but we have also denied the existence of abortion.  Abortion is a fact of life, and it will be always a fact of life.  We have only to look at the statistics.  Between January 1980 and December 2016, at least 170,000 women and girls travelled from the Republic of Ireland to access abortion services in another country.  In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Irish addresses at UK abortion services.  A 2016 report shows that 1,642 abortion pill packages were sent to Ireland in the three-year period between 2010 and 2012, and that was just by a single provider.  These are the facts.  We all know of people who supported women to get on planes to avail of services that should have been available in this country.</p> <p> An interesting fact, which struck a chord with me, was that 70% of Irish women who seek an abortion in the UK are in a relationship while over half of them already have children.  This statistic is from the advocacy group One Day More in the UK.  We have to accept that life is complex and we need to face that complexity by supporting people making difficult life choices.</p> <p> I acknowledge the committee's comment that the State should provide specific resources so that there would be social supports for carers and better facilities for people whose children have specific needs.  People with disabilities should be supported so they can lead a life of dignity and respect.  It is not a fair argument to equate abortion provision and disability-selective abortions because, again, each case is unique.  I, for one, support women irrespective of the choice they make.  Women's bodies should not be used to address the stigma around disability; rather, it is the job of the Government to make sure that society treats all its people equally regardless of disability.  A separate debate on this is much needed but it does not belong here.  One should not forget that people with disabilities are also affected by the eighth amendment, which restricts their rights to bodily autonomy and family planning.</p> <p> Ultimately, the constitutional provision makes no legal sense and was inserted as a political weapon at the time of the referendum.  For 34 years, the eighth amendment has been inherently ambiguous in its meaning and scope and the courts have not been able to fully clarify its content.</p> <p> I want to end with a quote from the National Women's Council of Ireland which states, "...the person who can best protect and nurture a developing life is of course the pregnant woman herself.  Not lawyers.  Not judges.  Certainly not the Constitution."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-01-17a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011700048#BBB00200"><p>I commend the Minister on his speech.  I commend the work of the committee and the Citizens' Assembly.  I was critical of the Government's decision to delegate these deliberations to the Citizens' Assembly.  While I believe that any Government worth its salt should have taken responsibility itself for ending Ireland's cruel and degrading treatment of women, I respect the work done and sacrifices made by the members of the Citizens' Assembly and the committee.</p>  <p>  It is important for us to understand how the committee arrived at its recommendations.  By this, I mean that if Members of the House or members of the public have a conscientious objection to, or are wary of, the recommendations, I urge them to try to understand the building blocks and logic of the committee's deliberations.  In this respect, I first want to address the issues of a threat to the life of the mother and a threat to the health of a mother.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act permits abortion only where there is a risk to the life of a pregnant woman.  While I fundamentally opposed the introduction of this incredibly restrictive Act, and still do, I believe most people would agree, even if they described themselves as pro-life, that where there is a threat to the life of a mother, access to abortion should be permitted.  It would be perverse to think otherwise.  While I have been always in favour of access to abortion when there was a threat to the health of the woman, there are those who see the life of the foetus as being more important than the health of the woman.  Obviously, I do not agree with this view, but there are others who do.  As I said, however, we need to understand how the committee arrived at its recommendations.</p>  <p>  Fundamental and crucial to the decision of the committee is the timing of critical clinical decision-making in saving a woman's life.  Maternity medical professionals say it is dangerous and unworkable to leave or ignore a threat to a woman's health until a clear threat to her life is identified.  That transition between a threat to the health of the woman and a threat to her life can, and does, happen extremely quickly and it can quickly become too late.  Medical practice requires flexibility, which the current law does not permit.  Doctors cannot adequately measure or grade risk.  Medical risk, especially medical risk during pregnancy, is just too unpredictable.  It is also too personal to be divided into low or high risk.  I am referring here to the doctors' definition of risk but also, of course, to the woman's definition of risk or, indeed, to a father's or partner's definition of risk.</p>  <p>  Some women may have a high tolerance for risk and may be even willing to let that risk shift - it can shift very rapidly until it is too late - from a risk to her health to a risk to her life.  That, of course, would be her decision and she would be free to make it, but no woman should be forced to put her life at risk.  We should not define risk in the Constitution or legislation.  Surely that is self-evident.  Medical risk should be considered in a clinical setting, in real time, by medical specialists.</p>  <p>  The crucial building block in the committee arriving specifically at its "12 weeks and without reason" decision was the issue of pregnancy as a result of rape or other sexual assault.  Opinion polls indicate that the majority of Irish people do not think it is humane to force a woman to carry to term a pregnancy that is the result of rape or incest.  Irish people are not that cruel.  While people may accept this, they may have issues with the 12-week period and the recommendation that no reason for a termination should be specified.  I urge people to remain open-minded in terms of understanding the logic of this recommendation.  The expert legal advice given at the committee established what is essentially the impossibility of legislating for rape.  This impossibility relates to the burden of proof that would be required in such cases.  The precedent of an adjudication process has been already established by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and would see a raped woman questioned, put on trial and forced to relive the worst experiences of her life.</p>  <p>  It is an accepted fact that rape is considerably under-reported.  Rape victims have incredible difficulty reporting rape to anyone, never mind the Garda or an adjudication panel wishing to determine whether they are deserving of a termination.  Four hundred silent calls were received by the Rape Crisis Centre last year.  That is absolutely heartbreaking.  Imagine being a victim of rape, picking up the phone and not being able to get the words out - not a single syllable.  Some people will take a long time to report their rape and others never will, for a variety of complex reasons.</p>  <p>  Rape removes power and autonomy from victims.  Every single rape involves non-consensual sex and, therefore, involves an abuse of power.  The inclusion of an adjudication process for rape cases in legislation would remove even more power from raped women.  They would be judged before being allowed to access medical services.</p>  <p>  If rape is a specific basis for abortion, then someone will have to decide whether this basis has been satisfied.  The "up to 12 weeks without reason" is specifically a way to deal with this problem and to avoid retraumatising rape victims.  This is why the committee has recommended access to termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reason.  This recommendation needs to be understood in this context.  It is not the result of some big liberalising agenda; instead, it is an act of compassion for the victims of rape.</p>  <p>  Abortion is already a reality in Ireland and has been for a very long time.  We just outsource the services to the UK.  Some 170,000 women that we know of have travelled for abortions since the eighth amendment was introduced.  We know that, in 2016 alone, there were approximately 3,000 requests from Ireland for abortion pills online.  One may not agree with abortion in certain or any circumstances but it is already a reality, and we owe it to women to legislate for it.  </p></speech>

I become nervous about any debate or speaking in public.</p><p>The reason I am nervous this evening is that I believe passionately in what I am going to say.  Nobody can blame me for that or hold it against me.  It is just my heartfelt belief.  It is the way I was brought up and I am grateful for the opportunity to say my few words on what I believe and give my viewpoint.<br/><br/>I want to acknowledge a great group of people with whom I have had the privilege of dealing over many years in County Kerry.  They are the people involved in the right to life movement, Pro Life campaigners, with whom I have worked and debated alongside.  We have been trying to put forward our point of view over many years.  There is one special person, Mary Fitzgibbon, a lady I admire very much, who has a great heart and is a great advocate for the unborn.  She passionately believes in what she believes in.<br/><br/>I also want to compliment a report, which I was glad to read, by Deputies Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  I know Deputy Mattie McGrath will not mind me saying that I heard him say at one stage that he found being on the committee which teased out all of these issues one of the most trying and difficult periods in his political life.  Again, nobody can blame him for his beliefs or why it hurt him so much to hear what he heard in the committee.  Nobody can because he is entitled to his opinion, as is everybody else.  I respect that.<br/><br/>I want to talk tonight about the unborn children of the past, the present and the future.  There are all types of solutions out there and all types of ways of dealing with problems.  I received a private text a while ago from a very close friend of mine.  He is a private man and a very respectable worker.  He gave me permission to read it out.  This point is about parents who might not be able to deal with their own children.  The text message states:</p><blockquote>Michael, food for thought for the future.  My sister and I were adopted in 1981 and 1983.  We had the best in life.  [I know the two of them and they had a great life.]  We had all that was good.  There are solutions out there for all.  My sister found her mother; I did not yet.  You can say this wherever you want and I have no problem talking about it to anybody.</blockquote><p>That is a person of courage, a private person who sent me that message before I came in to speak in the D&aacute;il tonight.  He said he was a child whose parents may not have been able to deal with the situation but he ended up having a great life.  I want to talk tonight about the opportunity of life.  Members opposite can call it whatever they like.  I believe, however, that from the moment of conception, the person is a baby, a child to be protected in the same way we would protect a child in a pram on the street if we thought something was going to happen to that child.  I just do not agree with abortion.  I just do not think it is right.  Nothing will ever change me from that point of view.<br/><br/>I have given a lot of time over the years to debating this issue.  I knew eventually we would come to the stage where we are at now.  I did not know I would be in this House.  I did not know if my father would be here or that there might be no Healy-Rae here.  I feel privileged that I am able to speak from the heart about what I believe in.  I will try in the best way I can.  I feel inadequate that I might not be the best at explaining myself.  However, I will try to explain why I am the way I am.<br/><br/>Ireland has progressed.  We have seen what happened and the awfulness of the Kerry babies case which we debated earlier today.  Nobody wants an Ireland like that.  Nobody wants an Ireland where, if a young lady becomes pregnant, it is as if there is something wrong with her because she became pregnant.  That is a total abomination to me.  Many young girls who became pregnant  in the past were locked up in mental institutions.  There were 1,200 or 1,300 people in mental institutions when there might not have been 50 of them who actually had a mental health problem.  They were perfectly sound, sensible people.  Many of them were young girls who became pregnant.  It was a case of shunning them away.<br/><br/>That is not the Ireland of today.  If a person becomes pregnant today, there are back-up services, support and family support.  There is no shame in being pregnant.  If one is married or not, that does not matter a God damn to anybody.  Nobody is judging anybody like they did in the past.  The past was a horrible time.  What happened to Joanne Hayes and other young girls who had to have their babies in private and who died while giving birth to their children, as did the children, was awful, dark and horrible.  It was described by Brinsley MacNamara in his novel, <i>The Valley of the Squinting Windows</i>.  We are gone from that, thanks be to God.<br/><br/>We are at a stage now where if a person becomes pregnant and they want to have the child, all the supports are there.  If they cannot see their own way to keeping the child, there are so many parents and young people in this country who would give anything, even the last euro in their pockets, to have a child of their own.  They might not be able to have a baby for one reason or the other but they would love to bring up a child.  Like the friend who sent me the text to which I referred earlier, they had the best of adoptive parents, highly respectable working people who gave them a great start in life.<br/><br/>If my viewpoint turns people against me and costs me my seat and the right to be here in this Chamber, I would gladly lose it.  All politicians are entitled to believe in what they believe - they are 100% entitled to their view - I am also entitled to my view.  A politician who will not stand for something will fall for everything.  I believe in what I believe in.  If tonight were to be my last night in the Chamber, saying these words, I mean it from the bottom of my heart that I want to stand up for the unborn children of the future.  Who am I to deny them the right to life?  Who am I to deny them the opportunity that I had to come into the world, lead a life and do everything to the best of my ability?<br/><br/>The recommendations that came forward from the committee were wrong.  I studied the evidence that was given.  At the time I apologised I could not attend the committee because I was chairing another committee, as Deputy Mattie McGrath knows, which was sitting at same time.  We have to be fair about the evidence given.  It was the same as the Kerry babies case and the tribunal held at the time.  When people look back at the transcript of eighth amendment committee, they will have to admit it was weighted one way and not the other.  That is the truth.  I compliment Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzpatrick and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen on the sterling work they did because they were up against it.  They were unfairly outweighed and the evidence given was biased, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>If we go back, people voted for the eighth amendment in huge numbers.  It has saved many lives.  It could be 100,000 lives, 50,000 lives or it could be 5,000 lives.  Thanks to that amendment, there are thousands of people living in this world today and walking the streets today who otherwise may not be here.  Now we are talking about repealing it.  This House cannot deny that the eighth amendment has saved lives.  However, the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee did not hear from even one person representing those lives and those who know their child is alive today because of the eighth amendment.  How can that be fair?  How can that be democratic?  How can that be in the best interests of the people, if we gloss over such an incredible story?</p><p>People are alive today because of that amendment.  They have been given the right to life because of it.</p> <p> Buried beneath all the spin against the eighth amendment is something very positive.  It is a story of hope against the odds.  There has been a deliberate attempt to look the other way and pretend that no good has come from the eighth amendment and to keep referring to it as controversial as if it is no good and to never talk about it in a positive way.  The eighth amendment is an excellent lesson in how we can debate things today.  The lesson is that we do not debate things at all.  Too many people in this House and the media simply attack what they do not like.  Everybody in politics and the media knows that the pro-life side has been largely shut out from the process.  We were fortunate enough to have a number of strong representatives, who I have named already, on the committee.  If those three people were taken out of it, it would have been a completely weighted in one direction and it would have been a one-sided debate.  There would have been no debate except for those Members being there.</p> <p> I have become familiar with many stories in recent times from talking to people about this issue.  I think about the story of one woman who has spoken out about how she contemplated abortion, only to change her mind.  She talks about how grateful she is for the eighth amendment.  She says the time it took her to book an abortion and get ready to travel to England was the time she needed to change her mind.  These are very powerful stories.  That was a child, a human being, and an adult today.  At present, some pretend that when we talk about introducing abortion, it is not really going to end the lives of many babies, specifically babies with disabilities.  We hear stories and sad statistics about all the babies aborted in countries such as England or Denmark simply for having a disability.  They are truly shocking stories.  The reason over 90% of babies in these countries are aborted is for having Down's syndrome.  We really have to think about that.  I have had the privilege in my lifetime of befriending children of friends and neighbours who have Down's syndrome.  They are a joy and pleasure to know.  They have their own ways, friendly personalities and they make a contribution to life.  If we go down this road, will we have a situation in the future where people will play God with these people's lives and a person will not be born if he or she is imperfect?  I do not agree with that.  I believe that there is only one God, who is not here in this Chamber.  It is the right of these people to be born as much as anybody else.  If one is not perfect and is inside the womb, one has the same right to come into this world as the person who is perfect.</p></speech>

I have specific people in my head but we are always told that we are not supposed to name people and I do not want to embarrass anybody.  We have high-profile people in this country who have severe disabilities and many Deputies will know the young people I am talking about.  They have made a massive contribution, not only in their parishes and counties, but in this country.  They have gone on national television and told their stories.</p></speech>

At the same time, if abortion was freely and readily available in this country, they might not have had the right to come into this world because they might have been taken out of it before they had the opportunity to be born.  I do not agree with that.  I could never vote for or support that.  Who am I to come along and say that if a person is not perfect, he or she does not have the right to come into this world?  I think it is so wrong.  I will quote a couple of recommendations from the minority report, the joint assessment by Deputies Peter Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.</p><blockquote>We reject, with particular emphasis, any attempt to provide for abortion on any particular ground of disability.  We believe that the disability ground for abortion, so prevalent in the Western World, makes a mockery of nations&rsquo; aspirations to champion the rights of people with disability.<br /><br />Although Ireland has some way to travel in the championing of the rights of persons with disabilities, it can be said that Article 40.3.3., in this way also, has been a shining light.</blockquote><p>Think about what we are doing.  In this Chamber, we have a Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, a person who I am great friends with.  I admire him very much.  He is an excellent Minister of State.  We have appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities while, at the same time, what we are proposing here could actively discriminate against and deny people with disabilities the right to even be born.  It is an absolute contradiction.  It does not make sense and it will never make sense.  If I am saying anything wrong or offending anybody with what I am saying, I am sorry but it is what I believe in my heart and my soul.  If I was not honest enough to stand up tonight and say what I have had to say, I should not be here at all.  I should never have been elected if I had not come in here tonight to tell the truth.  I am only saying what I am saying because I believe in it.  If I see something wrong, I say it straight.  I will not mince my words.  The recommendation states: &quot;We recommend the retention of the Eighth Amendment on the grounds that it protects both mother and unborn child, does not endanger top quality medical care for women and unborn children in pregnancy and is consistent with the best standards in the protection of human rights and human dignity.&quot;  Go back to where we are coming from.  We do not need to repeal the eighth amendment.  The <i>status quo</i>is acceptable and protects the mother and child.</p><p>We can study the values of Ireland over the years.  We and the State have made mistakes, as I have already highlighted - I quoted the Kerry babies case - and we all loathe the horrible events that have taken place in institutions of the State, such as the Magdalen laundries, and we know the mistakes we have made in the past.  At the same time, Ireland is a special place and the church in Ireland has done great things.  We can be critical and say it has done things wrong, which have to be recognised, but at the same time we have to admit and acknowledge that our church did great things in the past.  Ireland is special and I do not want to see us go down the road of England, America or other countries in Europe where human life can be so disregarded and people do not value human life or babies.  I do not agree with that.</p><p>When I was a young councillor and I knew abortion would be an issue at council level and in the Oireachtas, where my father was, I wanted to understand what it was all about.  I studied exactly what an abortion was.  When I saw it, it horrified me.  It made me sick, and I am tough.  It takes a lot to rattle me and anybody who really knows me knows I am not in my comfort zone talking tonight.  If I was talking about bridges or roads, I would be fighting, be on my game and be myself.  I am not myself because I am outside of my comfort zone in talking about this because I am so nervous about it due to feeling inadequate.  When I studied what an abortion was and the enormity of it hit me, I thought that if I ever had a say in it, I would always stand up for the life of the unborn child.  It is what I believe in and the way I was brought up.  I know, God be good to him, if my father and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's father was here, exactly what he would say.</p></speech>
