To do so will create poverty traps, work disincentives and increase the number of children in poverty".  The T&aacute;naiste went on to break that promise, as the Government cut child benefit by &euro;10 per month.  The Government now is introducing a new tax on mothers and families, namely, the maternity tax.  Women will wonder what they did to the T&aacute;naiste or to the Government to deserve this latest attack because pregnant women will lose up to &euro;2,500 per year to save &euro;40 million.  Women do not go on maternity leave to earn extra money and that suggestion and assertion by the Government should be withdrawn because in essence, coming on top of child benefit cuts, the property tax and cuts to family income supplement, particularly for families in receipt of carer's allowance, these are savage attacks on families and children.  In some cases, this involves &euro;450 per month for up to six months.  For working women who already have made a significant contribution through PRSI and have paid substantial amounts to it, this is highly unfair because there are additional significant costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth and this particular maternity benefit always has been a cushion to protect mothers and families against such costs.  The Government had choices but has made a wrong choice in this case.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to reverse it.</p></speech>

This proposal was set out clearly on budget day and the general reaction to the measure after the budget appeared to acknowledge it was only fair that two individuals earning the same amount of income should pay the same amount of income tax, regardless of whether that income came from pay or maternity benefit.  The proposal is exactly the same as was announced on budget day.  It is in the news now because the Finance Bill is going through the D&aacute;il at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700003#A00800"><p>It was a slow burner.</p></speech>

The measure has no impact on women who are solely reliant on maternity benefit or low-paid workers who are outside the tax net.  The measure brings the treatment of maternity benefits in line with other social welfare benefits, including illness benefits, pensions and unemployment benefits.  A woman on maternity benefit, whose employer continues to provide a full salary during maternity benefit, will continue to receive precisely the same take-home pay as she did while working.  As I indicated, the measure will not affect the position in respect of the universal social charge and PRSI, from which maternity benefits will remain exempt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700003#A01000"><p>That is a very weak defence of what has occurred, because the T&aacute;naiste was categoric in respect of the child benefit issue and how families are finding it extremely difficult to rear children given the associated costs.  The T&aacute;naiste has articulated a view that also has been articulated by the Minister for Finance.  He used the phrase that it is correcting an anomaly.  Pregnant women are not an anomaly and the bottom line is that &euro;450 per month is a savage cut by any yardstick.  While people are taking cuts across the board, the idea of imposing such a large amount on one particular family income is excessive.  This will affect 48,000 women per year, that is, working women who also have contributed to PRSI.  It is excessive to do this in one fell swoop and it should be reviewed.</p></speech>

That assertion should be accepted.

Moreover, it will have a highly significant impact in the case of some people.  In particular, I have come across young families in receipt of family income supplement, for example, who also were in receipt of the carer's allowance.  A measure undertaken in the previous budget took &euro;100 per week from them.</p></speech>

This tax takes no account of ability to pay, those in negative equity, those who paid massive stamp duty or the 180,000 families currently in mortgage distress.  Let us acknowledge it is a tax championed and proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, which is now being implemented by Fine Gael and the Labour Party; a tax with no waivers; a tax for which the exemptions are a joke.  The family home tax Bill is draconian legislation and it takes no account of the impact of this additional bill on families where people are at work or out of work, on the elderly and on the economy at large.  The Government is actively pursuing a policy that will drive people into debt and some into poverty.</p><p>  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to set out for us the approach that will be taken in the event of non-payment or non-compliance with this tax on the family home.

What will then happen is each householder will have the opportunity of making a return to the Revenue and declaring what he or she understands the value of his or her property to be for the purposes of the property tax.  The Revenue Commissioners will pursue an information campaign beginning next week informing householders about the steps they can take to make that declaration and the steps they can take where letters have been issued either in error or in duplicate form because, up to relatively recently, there was not a full database of properties owned in the State.  What we are dealing with over the next number of weeks is a period where householders can contact the Revenue Commissioners.  If the estimate is considered to be inaccurate or wrong, they can make a declaration as to what is the value of their property and I encourage everybody who gets a communication from the Revenue Commissioners to make that contact with them where they believe that the information sent to them is in any way inaccurate, overstated or wrongly stated.</p><p>  This is a tax measure, which is required to be collected.  The Revenue Commissioners is the authority which collects tax in the country and as with all taxes for which it is responsible it will use the methods available to them to ensure the tax is paid.  I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in, along with every other party in the House, will encourage everybody to be tax compliant.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste should not try to lay this on the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation rushed through this House by the Labour Party and Fine Gael will allow this family tax to be taken from social welfare payments, wages and people's bank and credit union accounts.  It is clear from the Government benches that some of its members are in the Land of Nod or in a parallel universe.  How on earth can the T&aacute;naiste justify a situation where the Government through the Revenue Commissioners will put its hand into the pockets of people who are struggling and will deduct this tax from a social welfare payment such as jobseeker's allowance or an old age pension or from people's wages, which have been cut or, worse still, will reach its hand into people's bank and credit union accounts?  How does he defend that?  He should not give us the line on tax compliance and smart alec rhetoric.  People do not have the money.  Does he grasp that?  How does he defend a system whereby people who are struggling will have the hand of Government put into their pockets?  If ever there was a case of heavy handed tactics by a government and the State against citizens and Big Brother government, this certainly is it.  The T&aacute;naiste should forget about the Revenue Commissioners; he is in charge.  He should defend those measures for us.</p></speech>

The new property tax is nowhere near as high as the property tax that Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty in defending north of the Border.  Sinn F&eacute;in's hypocrisy has no boundaries, either in terms of debate or territory.  As far as the collection of the property tax is concerned, there are well established mechanisms in place for the collection of tax.  This is a responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners, which will do a campaign, beginning next Monday, of informing householders of what is the estimated valuation of properties and what will be householders' tax liability.  There will be a period within which householders may engage with the Revenue Commissioners about the valuation.  If somebody believes the Revenue Commissioners have got the figure wrong, he or she can make a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners about the value of the property in question and this will be the value on which the property will be assessed.  There will, therefore, be a period in which householders will be able to engage with the Revenue Commissioners on the issue.</p><p>  Perhaps Sinn F&eacute;in will address the following issue.  I note a campaign is under way urging people not to pay or co-operate with this tax.

The figures, which were provided by the Minister for Education and Skills, were an upward revision of estimates made previously by guidance counsellors.  The Minister failed to address a more revealing statistic, however, showing that cuts introduced last September have resulted in a 51% reduction in counselling services for essential one-to-one work at a time when, according to many school principals, demand for counselling services has reached crisis level.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that guidance counselling is critical for second level students as they make important decisions to cope with a broad range of personal difficulties.  School is a good place to nip in the bud the distress that may be experienced subsequently at significant social and fiscal cost to the State.  The bottom line is that students are suffering as a result of these short-sighted cuts.  An astonishing one in ten children is presenting with some form of depression or serious mental health problem.  </p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that teenagers are especially reluctant to ask for help.  For this reason, it matters more than ever that signs are detected early.  Many of today's stress related problems were unknown to the older generation because they are linked to modern, fast-paced lifestyles.  Body image, cyberbullying and severe peer pressure have all contributed to teenagers being at greater risk of depression, sometimes with disastrous and desperate consequences, including young people taking their life.  Last week, I spoke to a school principal in Dublin who has attended two funerals of teenagers who have taken their lives. </p><p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment to ring-fence funding for students?  It is bad enough that they are saddled with a huge national debt and will leave school at a time when unemployment is at crisis levels.  While I accept that budgets are tight, surely the happiness and well-being of our young people depends on the Government taking action rather than paying lip service to this issue?</p></speech>

The NCGE surveyed schools in March 2012 before the budget measure was introduced and the following October after its introduction.  While its final report will be published in the coming months, initial findings were presented to the Department in preparation for the conference to which the Deputy referred.  These findings suggest that schools continue to prioritise guidance programmes.  The report also states there has been increased group work and class based activity at senior cycle, which is in keeping with best practice in guidance.  Such best practice suggests that one-to-one guidance counselling is best conducted after such group work.</p><p>  While there have been some reductions in the number of guidance hours available to schools, they are certainly not of the order claimed by some.  Schools continue to provide and prioritise guidance.  In terms of hours, the National Council for Guidance Education survey suggests there has been a reduction of approximately 25% in allocated hours for guidance.  The reduction depends largely on school size and is as follows.  In second level schools with fewer than 400 students, the reduction is, on average, four hours per week.  These schools would typically have had a part-time guidance counsellor under the old allocation system.  In second level schools with between 400 and 700 students, the reduction is, on average, five hours per week.  These schools would typically have had one full-time guidance counsellor under the old allocation system.  In large schools with more than 700 students, the reduction is, on average, 11.5 hours per week.  These schools would typically have had more than one guidance counsellor under the old allocation system.</p></speech>

At issue is the provision of one-to-one counselling, not group counselling.  For example, when a student presents who is gay or experiencing a problem of a personal nature at home, he or she does not want to discuss the matter in group counselling and will require one-to-one counselling.  What is the point of supplying schools with documents on health initiatives, bullying programmes and so forth if sufficient resources are not available to implement them?</p><p>  My facts and figures are always correct and I speak to people who work on the coalface dealing with the problem.  I have spoken to seven or eight school principals in Dublin and Waterford who believe the position has reached a critical point.  Students presenting with serious problems are increasingly unable to discuss them with someone.  In some other European countries, a social worker is employed in every school specifically to deal with problems associated with teenagers growing up.  As a consequence, teenage depression, mental health issues and, ultimately, the problem of young people deciding to leave this planet by taking their lives, have been comprehensively addressed. </p><p>  While I do not wish to criticise the T&aacute;naiste, it is of little use paying lip-service to this problem.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to speak to school principals and parents because they will tell him that counselling in schools is in crisis.  They need one-to-one counselling as opposed to group counselling. </p></speech>

Work is done all the time at one-to-one level between individual teachers and students in cases where a teacher is either told of a particular problem or senses there is a problem and decides to act.  The work done by school principals and guidance counsellors is far-reaching.</p><p>  This is an issue to which the Minister for Education and Skills has given particular emphasis.  He recently published guidelines on cyberbullying and a strategy and policy on well-being in schools which addresses the very issues Deputy Halligan raises.</p><p>As part of the reform of the junior certificate cycle, the issue of well being in schools is being integrated into it.  This issue cannot be set aside or treated as a separate segment of school activity.  It is a part of the overall work that is done in schools by teachers and principals working with pupils.  A revised policy framework has been put in place by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

One of the key commitments in the programme for Government was that the Government would remove guillotines from non-emergency legislation.  The programme referenced the significant use of the guillotine for non-emergency legislation.</p><p>  No. 29 is on the establishment of Irish Water and giving it the capacity to install water meters and impose water charges in the next two years.  There are various estimates as to when all of that will be done.  Some have claimed that it will be post 2014.  The Bill establishes an entity that makes water vulnerable to privatisation and other risks.  The T&aacute;naiste may claim that this is not the case, but I do not see the emergency dimension to this Bill.  The Government must heed its own commitment in the programme for Government, given the farcical situation of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 and, before Christmas, the Social Welfare Bill and the property tax Bill.  People were given no time to debate anything.  In principle, we are against the Bill.  No. 3 is a short Bill with which we have no difficulty.</p><p>  I urge the Government to take the D&aacute;il and its own commitment on guillotines seriously.</p></speech>

Our amendments are aimed at addressing this because obviously there will be a cost to the householder down the line.  Even at a cost of &euro;1.2 billion, divided by 1.5 million households, we are talking about an average cost of approximately &euro;700 per household.  On top of that, there is the proposed installation of water meters, which will require the borrowing of up to &euro;500 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, although the local government professional services steering group believes the figure will be higher.  The cost of that will also be put onto the householder.  I ask the Minister of State to address this issue, which has not been addressed in any of our previous debates on this legislation.  The funds for the installation of meters will have to be paid back on top of the cost of the water service, which will increase the annual charge.</p><p>  Accountability under the new water service structure is also an issue of concern.  Irish Water will be a private company, limited by guarantee but in State ownership.  I accept what the Minister of State has said, that it is not the intention of this Government, at this point in time, to privatise it.  The Minister of State can look me straight in the eye and tell me that and I will believe he is telling me the truth.  However, had I asked a previous Minister two or three years ago if he or she intended to sell off the harvesting rights in Coillte or large chunks of Bord G&aacute;is, I would have been told that the Government had no intention of doing so.  The point is that intentions change with circumstances.</p><p>Currently, there is democratic control within the local authority system and the process is owned by householders and those who pay rates.  When a company is created and a meter is placed outside my door and every other door, the process becomes a cash cow.  There will be a commodity value for a private company and international investors from the likes of China or whoever has the cash to buy it.  That is where the danger will lie down the line, as the new Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be exposed to privatisation.  The current Government will be in power for a certain length of time but even in that time, circumstances may change.  That is the concern that Sinn F&eacute;in has.</p><p> Amendment No. 38 relates to poverty-proofing.  I have asked whether a poverty impact analysis has been carried out, as there would be a significant impact, particularly on low-income people.  Yesterday I raised here the commitment in the programme for Government relating to a waiver for refuse collection.  Low-income households in County Laois have been waiting for 26 years for a waiver system that exists in other parts of the country.  There is no waiver or exemption in this process; it is the same with the household charge.  The can can be kicked down the road but the bill will be put in the pocket.  The bill can be paid when the house is sold.</p><p> Refuse collections have no waivers or exemptions.  There is an exemption for low-income households in the North, as well as other exemptions in the rates system.  We are not totally happy with the system but as one of five parties, we have limited power to change.  That is a key point.  How will water charges affect low-income groups, large households, disabled and sick people and premises that need much water for medical reasons?  Those households will be affected in a very bad way.  As I mentioned with regard to refuse collection, there is no waiver scheme or relief, with the household charge coming and bills dropping through the letterbox next week.</p><p> I told the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, last Friday that I met people in Graiguecullen last Thursday night and it is not a case that they do not want to pay but rather that this is affecting their physical and mental health.  The accumulation of what has happened in the past four to five years has ground down these people mentally, physically and economically.  They are exhausted and terrified of what is coming.  I do not want to overstate the matter but I have never seen people as concerned and in fear of what is coming.  Although I will not overstate the Government's proposals, I will not understate it either.  I believe in giving facts to people.  Will the Government take on board amendment No. 38 in order to poverty-proof the process?  There should be relief for people if the Government is going to follow through on the issue.</p><p> The accountability issue runs through a number of amendments.  Currently, a Deputy or town or county councillor can contact an area engineer and get a response.  However inadequate the system is under the local authorities, councillors and Deputies were able to get a response during the big freeze.  Officials in the Custom House may be removed from this but the people on the ground trying to ensure that services keep going saw the benefits.  During the big freeze most of the Twenty-six Counties saw this benefit and were able to keep a reasonably good water supply going.  Where there was disruption, the problem was remedied fairly quickly because of a good working relationship between local elected representatives and the water services section in a council.</p><p> In the North it is a different story, and the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister had a major battle to get any kind of response.  County Louth - the Minister of State's home - had to supply parts of County Down with water.  That is how far the water was moved because of the separate company involved, Northern Ireland Water.  I am highlighting the bad elements in the North, which are evident in the system we inherited.  The Assembly was established but Northern Ireland Water had been set up for a number of years.  It is inadequate so we must have democratic control in the local authority system, particularly with regard to essential services like roads, water, sewerage and housing.  We must have that in a democracy.  Those who set up local authorities may have founded the Minister of State's party or my party but they had in common an acceptance of the need to have local control over local services.  We are advocating a national framework team to oversee the process, co-ordinate it and implement standards.  We must work through the local authority system to make that improvement.</p><p> The Government is prepared to sell the operations of the lotto system and trees from Coillte.  I heard a Labour Minister quipping that Coillte sells trees but currently it sells the product directly to local sawmills.  The Government is proposing that it would sell trees to a multinational company, which would sell the product to sawmills or the highest bidder.  If the Government is prepared to sell trees, the lotto and the profitable parts of Bord G&aacute;is, it tells me that it would have no qualms about selling the water company if the need arose.  That would be a step too far.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendments we are putting forward in good faith.  We are trying to knock the rough edges from the Government's actions.  The day we establish Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be a bad day for democracy.</p></speech>

Nobody has told me anything different.  We will have to contact a call centre and get some kind of a response.  We should be clear that the relationship will be same as the one we currently have with Bord G&aacute;is.  It is a fairly good company but it can be difficult to deal with it with regard to problems in service.  I have no problem dealing with a local authority and there is no great problem in dealing with a Department because there is a line of accountability to us in the Chamber and every council chamber in the country.  This Chamber, which has little enough power already, will be taken completely from the equation with regard to water and sewerage.  Most of the power should rest with local authorities but we will be taking the power from them.</p><p>  It is ironic that this is happening at the same time that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is telling us how he will enhance local government.  The Portakabin that houses the tourist office for six months of the year will come under local authorities but the water services - which most local authorities have done a good job in providing - will have their heart ripped out and taken from the control of local councillors and county managers to be given to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The Government's promise to reform local authorities is cosmetic.  I wish the Government would carry out the reform and my party would fully support meaningful efforts.  We are engaging with the Government and trying to maximise the efforts to bring about this reform.  Nevertheless, we cannot speak about reforming local authorities if the Government is ripping away the core services of water, sewerage, roads and housing, which is almost privatised.  Down the country, people are being steered to housing agencies, which have already accumulated large housing stock.  They are not answerable to anybody in their allocation of houses and there is no democratic control.  I can see the scheme of letting for Laois and Offaly County Council.  Deputy Cowen can do the same.  We were involved in the making of it and officials are bound to operate by that document.  The core services, like water, must be kept within the democratic system.</p><p>  The Government's actions will destroy local democracy and diminish national democracy.  It is ruining the democratic structures in the country.  Although it is not the intention, the Government is leaving the new Uisce &Eacute;ireann wide open to being privatised.</p></speech>

Having said that, I wish to raise the point being made specifically within these amendments in respect of the poverty-proofing issue.  To elaborate on this, it is necessary to revert to the costs associated with setting up Irish Water.  To that end, I sought on Committee Stage confirmation and exact figures on Irish Water.  We have no objection in principle to the concept of water charging but we do object to the absence of information on the setting up of Irish Water and the costs associated with it.  Can it be confirmed, in the first instance, that the cost to the State of water metering will be &euro;500 million?  A figure of between &euro;300 million and &euro;500 million has been mentioned, and the legislation caps the figure at &euro;500 million.  This means that the cost, at the high end, could be &euro;500 million.  Can the Minister of State confirm this?</p><p>  Where is the commitment given by Bord G&aacute;is when it got the contract to carry out a full audit of the networks throughout the country?  It promised to put on paper a commitment to rectification, reinstatement and making the network fit for purpose.  This promise, in addition to its billing network, is partly why it won the contract rather than Bord na M&oacute;na.  I would have believed Bord G&aacute;is would have been able to stand up to that commitment.  It has not done so to date, yet we find ourselves discussing what has been described as an &quot;interim Bill&quot;.  It is an effort to give some indication of progress having been made in this regard in the absence of all the required legislation coming before the House.  I would much rather, in the late autumn, that we were discussing the whole Bill with knowledge of the total cost and all the ramifications, rather than expecting Members to vote in the dark.  The latter is what we are doing.</p><p>  Let me return to the figures.  In the absence of an audit, can the Minister of State, who is as much in the dark as I am, confirm the cost of making the network fit for purpose throughout the country?  Will it be another &euro;500 million?  Will the Minister of State confirm Bord na M&oacute;na's figure in regard to rectification in Dublin?  Is the cost &euro;500 million?</p><p>  Deputy Stanley referred to existing national maintenance costs, in respect of which the figures vary.  Do these costs amount to approximately &euro;700 million?  I am not using the highest estimate.  As I stated on Committee Stage in respect of counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath, the current maintenance costs are in the region of &euro;12 million per annum.  With approximately 20,000 houses in each of those counties, the cost is approximately &euro;600 per household.  This is the existing cost and it results in a total of &euro;2.2 billion, which does not include the new maintenance cost or the provision for the directives in regard to having upgraded and reinstated networks.  Over time, the upgrading and reinstatement costs are expected to diminish but the front-loading cost will be quite high.</p><p>  With regard to the call centre, the sop is that 400 jobs are being created.  I am sure there is a skirmish around the Cabinet table over where the centre is to be located.  As has been said, the simple fact of the matter is that we have call centres in every county at present.  We have expertise and local knowledge of the networks as we know them.</p><p>  Contrast what happened north and south of the Border some years ago during the big freeze.  A body similar to that which the Minister of State proposes to set up was put up in place in the North and it was not able to deal with the complexities and difficulties arising from what happened at the time.  The favourable reaction, commitment and dedication of the staff in the local authorities throughout the country to the public was plain to be seen over the Christmas in question.  I availed of their services, having been out of water for two weeks.</p><p>  When will we have the audit?  Will it be ready before the next Bill is introduced?  When will we know the costs and have confirmation?  The Minister of State may rubbish the figures I have given him.  Is it proper and fair to proceed to establish Irish Water in the absence of the figures?</p><p>  What is the Government's position on the service agreement with local authorities and the existing staff, for example?  The Minister of State mentioned on Committee Stage that Irish Water would enter into service agreements for a two-year period?</p></speech>

I do not how long metering will take so I do not know how long the service agreement will last.  Will it be from today or next year?  Will there be a one-year arrangement?  I do not know and many of the staff do not know either.  Many of them do not know where they will stand in 2018 considering that the Minister of State is saying the first agreement is to last until 2017.  Is it likely to continue thereafter?  I do not know.</p><p>  What provision is made in the central government funds for local authorities in regard to the costs associated with personnel involved in water services?  An absolute information deficit remains, yet the T&aacute;naiste stated earlier today that the Opposition is bankrupt of reasons for not supporting this Bill.  He is pretty bankrupt himself in his own head at the Cabinet table.  Perhaps the four-person brigade is looking after this matter at the Cabinet and the T&aacute;naiste is outside the loop.  I do not know but I would have believed that he would have known the exact costs.  I estimate the exact cost to be &euro;2.2 billion.  How much of this will come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  How much is to be capitalised and over how long?  Can the Minister of State give any indication to anybody in the State as to the likely cost?  If we knew this, we might know what the end user will face.  When will the billing procedure be in place?  When will people know?  Given the current rate of progress, I hazard a guess that they will definitely not know before June 2014.  The Minister of State knows the implications of this, that is, if the first year and half is anything to go by.</p><p>  When poverty proofing, all the issues must be on the table before any guesstimate can be given, never mind a hard and fast rule.  What are the implications for those in group schemes?  What exercise has been carried out to determine the implications?  Those who have a private source of water are completely outside the loop with regard to the proposals in question but many group schemes use a public connection.  Water quality and safety are paramount and are more important than anything we discuss here.  We saw the detrimental consequences of threats to water quality when there was a problem with cryptosporidium in Galway some years ago.</p><p>  Many directives effect local authorities and group schemes.  Are they being followed to the letter?  Will the new arrangements result in new demands on the schemes?  If so, will this increase the maintenance costs associated with them?</p><p>In the event they cannot be maintained and the initial commitments to users cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, what obligation is the Government placing on Irish Water to take them in charge?  Will that be done purely on the basis of cost-benefit analysis or on the basis of a revenue stream?  They are the very issues that would be considered by anyone who sees an opportunity down the road to buy this company.  Many would have said before that was never a likelihood for Bord G&aacute;is and it is currently under way.  We fear that because of the way Irish Water is being configured under Bord G&aacute;is, the potential for it to be sold in future is real.  If the Minister of State can tell me what Irish Water's obligations will be in the short-term with regard to group schemes, it might offer some comfort to those within those schemes on any potential sale in future.</p><p> The Minister of State could not possibly have done the necessary poverty-proofing of the proposals and their implications for households in future because no one in the Government has confirmed the absolute costs associated with the establishment of Irish Water, the upgrade of the networks, particularly in Dublin, and the maintenance contracts that have not yet been concluded.  How can the Minister of State tell the House this has been poverty-proofed and no one will find this body wanting when it comes to the provision of water?  He cannot even tell us what the free allowance targets might be, which would go some way to resolving the question.</p><p> Against that background and the commitment the Government gave when it announced this in the first instance, we are no further, even though this interim Bill has been introduced and the Government wants us to blindly support it.  I am sorry but that will not happen.  We have no problem with the concept of charging for water and we support it, but not in the manner in which the process is being undertaken.  Despite the best efforts and intentions, especially as a result of leakage and problems with the network throughout the country, we have what many would describe as an inefficient service.  I do not want to walk through the &quot;T&aacute;&quot; lobby with the Minister of State as a first step in a process that will lead to charging people for an inefficient service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700011#J00200"><p>We do many things in the wrong order and this is one of them because we are doing it in the absence of the sort of detail we need, as is indicated by the number of amendments that have been ruled out of order which relate to the wider picture as opposed to the specific nature of the Bill.  We do not know the detail.  When we get to Report Stage, we are not talking about broad principles, we are talking about detail, but that detail is entirely absent.</p><p>  In principle, I have no objection to metering water to ensure it is not wasted, but there must be a sufficient free supply so people can live.  This is not a commodity and there must be investment in building wastewater treatment plants to the specifications required and upgrading of deficient water pipes.  That level of investment necessary would be significantly less if more than 48% of water treated arrived in people's houses.  Wastage levels of 52% are outrageous and none of us would defend that.</p><p>  We are being asked to take a leap of faith and while I do not doubt the Minister of State's personal bona fides, when I look at the packaging of Irish Water and consider the obligations the European Union has placed upon us in terms of our debt to GDP ratio, I know not meeting that 3% target will be a significant issue for us.  We all know the Government will tax fresh air to reach that 3% target.  There is not sufficient control over the taxing of water, particularly if this asset is sold off, and I am seriously concerned that it will not remain in public ownership.  I do not see water as a commodity and feel it should remain in public hands.</p><p>  On Committee Stage, we were told &euro;1.2 billion is needed and that &euro;300 million is provided in subsidy.  Is there any guarantee of that subsidy continuing?  We saw with the property tax how much money has been withdrawn from the local government fund.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was not behind the door in telling us that &euro;150 million was being withdrawn from the ring-fenced local government fund, not because we need to maintain the roads but to pay the national debt.  Can the Minister of State give us a guarantee that the &euro;300 million subsidy will continue into the future?</p><p>  One of the amendments I tabled that was ruled out of order related to the free allowance.  I wanted to see some assurances on these two issues: ownership and the free allowance.  The free allowance should make poverty less of an issue.  In the absence of a respectable free allowance, we should insist on poverty-proofing.</p><p>In the absence of those assurances, I would be completely in support of the points to which I have referred.</p><p> Shortages arise, not only in summer.  In north Kildare we have experienced difficulties, sometimes because developers have taken shortcuts in the way pipes have been laid so that they are far too close to the surface and will freeze in winter.  Then there is the inadequacy of supply where there is enough water in the country but it is not in the right place and it is not all treated.  There is an abundance of water in the west but on the east coast there are times when the water supply is on a knife-edge.</p><p> There are other aspects of Irish Water in terms of metering.  It will not only be a matter of metering.  With some of those pipes that are laid far too close to the surface, when one lifts up the cover on the stopcock one finds it is practically at the surface and there will not be a place to put the meter, if meters are to be put on top of the valve.  It depends where they are put.  They can be put closer to the house.  There is an argument for doing so because one would capture what happens outside of the house, including on the property of the homeowner.  I want to hear what the Minister of State has to say about what will be done in terms of metering in situations where those deficiencies are encountered.</p><p> There will be residents resisting payment of a water charge, even in the context of waste, where they can be without water for days on end.  Whereas that might have been satisfactorily dealt with in some places, over the two bad winters I came across residents without water for up to two weeks.  That was in an urban area, not in a rural area on a hill-top.</p><p> There are also deficiencies where all kinds of engineering feats were attempted to open up ways of putting more water into a system where those at the end of a supply chain are always the ones whose pressure is reduced.  Owners of such residences will resist these attempts in the absence of being guaranteed reasonable water pressure that will provide them with a supply.  This is not necessarily to do with leakage or waste.  Some of these deficiencies have occurred because of the lack of oversight when housing estates were developed.  It is an issue that must be remediated.</p><p> Clearly, there is a difficulty with the amount of water supply.  In Kildare, for example, the water is primarily purchased from Dublin City Council, from Ballymore Eustace, and from Fingal at its Leixlip water treatment plant but the amount of water required, for example, for Intel, would be equivalent to that for the town of Leixlip, which has a population in excess of 16,000.  No doubt if we reduce the waste of water, it reduces the kind of pressure on the amount of supply, although north Kildare does not feature large in terms of the amount of water that is wasted because the percentage is in the low 20s.</p><p> The important aspect for me is the free allowance and the absolute guarantee of Irish Water staying within the State sector.  We are passing this legislation in blind faith.  We have been talking about process for the past number of months in terms of how we do business here, and the way legislation is presented to us is part of that, especially with regard to a project that is being implemented on a piecemeal basis.</p><p> I would also ask the Minister of State about the governance issue.  It is essential that we see the architecture of it, not least for the protection of those who work within the water services and who often do a good job.  There are good leak detection units and some of the big water treatment plants are very well run.  It is essential to see a complete governance approach.  That is one of the elements that is missing.</p><p> With regard to an aspect that arose on Committee Stage, the Department's favoured approach is through PPPs.  It is almost as though one does not get one's upgrade unless one does it by way of PPP.  The international experience appears to suggest that this is the wrong approach.  We were given examples, such as Paris, where the PPP had to be bought out and the system had to be brought back within public control.  Will Irish Water be free to look at best governance or will it continue with the approach taken by the Department, that while other options are viable only the one approach will be taken?  This often does not produce the best financial return for the State.  Consumers are concerned about how their money is used and it is important we know what kind of arrangements will apply where there will be new facilities put in place in addition to the water supply and the metering issue.</p></speech>

The purpose of section 24 is to provide the commission with the necessary powers to prepare for the performance of regulatory functions and to advise the Government on the development of policy regarding the regulation of water. It is important that this work commences as soon as possible.  The impact of Deputy Stanley's amendment, if it were to be agreed, is that they could not commence that work until after 1 January 2014.</p><p>  Amendment No. 38 proposed that a poverty impact analysis should be carried out by the Department of Social Protection before this section is commenced.  I assure the House that work is very much underway to examine all of the issues, particularly regarding affordability and water poverty, and the Department is in active consultation with the Department of Social Protection and other stakeholders on this matter.</p><p>  I refer to some of the points raised by the three Members opposite.  All of them - Deputies Stanley, Cowen and Catherine Murphy - are particularly concerned about the issue of privatisation.  The Bill is an amendment to existing legislation which forbids the sale of any water asset to any private person or persons, in other words, the legislation which the Bill is amending already protects the State or local authority water assets from privatisation.  In the second Bill, which will come before the House later in the year, there will be a legal guarantee to give an absolute assurance as best we can that there will be no question of privatisation arising as an issue.  I would agree with Members opposite that the supply of water is a fundamental activity of any state.  The ownership by the state of water infrastructure is the rule rather than the exception, and that will be the position here.  I am not aware of any other model, apart from that in the UK, of which there is significant criticism.</p><p>  Members also mentioned the issue of transparency on costs and raised questions about audits and future plans.  It is generally agreed that &euro;1.2 billion was the figure in 2010, for both administration costs and capital investment.  Clearly, we need to improve the amount of capital investment in the water supply.</p><p> Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cowen referred to the Bord na M&oacute;na proposals for augmenting the water supply for greater Dublin area.  Deputy Murphy lives in a constituency where there has been significant investment by private enterprise to improve the water supply in terms of the industry that is involved.  I believe they are paying &euro;29 million in advance to the local authority for future water supply.  So there is an issue there regarding improvement.  Everybody accepts that the infrastructure needs to improve and it is no secret that to have state-of-the-art water services nationally we need to invest &euro;600 million per annum on capital improvements in order to meet the future demands of the greater Dublin area and to mitigate climate change issues that arise.  As Members have said on Second and Committee Stages, 42% of all the water we treat, pump or store never reaches any household.  It is referred to as unaccounted water.  A significant proportion of that comes from leaks.  Infrastructure, which in some cases is 150 years old, needs to be radically improved.</p><p> We need transparency on the cost of all these issues - everybody wants to know how much they will pay.  That will be determined by the energy regulator and not the Government, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann or Irish Water.  The regulator will need to get the business plan from Irish Water, and examine all the existing running costs and the future capital investment.  In the United Kingdom when the regulator decides a price it remains fixed for five years and if there is a significant increase in inflation, it can adjust it within the five-year period.  All of those issues will be dealt with openly, transparently and accountably.  There is no question of people not knowing what it will cost.  There is no question of not having total transparency and accountability from Irish Water to the regulator.  When the regulator makes proposals, they will be put out for public consultation and then there is also the question of making its determination.  An important part of all our administration here is the accountability for Irish Water to the Oireachtas.  The legislation provides for accountability through the annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have been a member of Oireachtas committees in the past.  The committee will have the power to call representatives of Irish Water to appear before the committee if an issue arises of concern to it.  That will be a very important part of the democratic accountability process.</p><p> Deputy Stanley and others referred to the accountability to local representatives on the ground.  This is a critical issue.  Deputy Catherine Murphy pointed out that some of her constituents had no water supply and did not know whom to contact - I have also come across such people in my constituency in the past.  Local authority staff have a very proud record of being able to respond in times of emergency.  The accountability of Irish Water to local authority representatives, the Oireachtas and most of all to public is a critical issue.  The structures will need to ensure that accountability is there and that elected representatives - Deputies, Senators and members of local authorities - have the same access to the management team in an area as they have at present.  Where the service levels exist Irish Water will be in a position to ensure that the local elected representative has that number.  Irish Water will be accountable to elected representatives on the issues that arise.</p><p> The second piece of legislation covering many of the governance issues that have been raised will be properly teased out here in the Oireachtas.  Many people are concerned about how to resolve a possible conflict between the water infrastructure requirements for a local authority development in a city, town or community and any Irish Water plan for improvement of water infrastructure.  One possibility would be that many of the planning decisions might be made at a regional authority level.  That framework will need to be spelled out in fine detail before any charges will commence.  The Bill before the House is effectively enabling legislation to allow the regulator to commence its work and to set up the company.</p><p> Deputy Cowen asked for the estimated cost of the metering programme.  It would be inappropriate to release estimates of the cost of the metering programme in advance of completion of the ongoing competitive procurement process.  It is intended that the metering programme would be funded through borrowing on commercial terms from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and that is from the Fianna F&aacute;il national recovery plan, published in 2010.</p></speech>

It is a critical issue for people.  We need to identify the types of households and the types of people in order to ensure that people are not in what is termed as water poverty - that is when more than 3% of their income goes towards the cost of water.  That is the benchmark mentioned in the literature I have read.  We sought and got more than 200 submissions to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers on all the issues.  Department officials and I have met representatives of specific interest groups who have a mandate and are advocates for those who would be deemed to be from low-income households.  We have commissioned an ESRI report on this specific issue.  When that report is finalised it will be in the public domain.  All the issues on poverty proofing, free allowance, etc., will need to be addressed here in the Oireachtas and I will be happy to ensure there is full and proper debate on every aspect of that.  Key to the credibility of what we are doing is for people to accept the very difficult economic situation we are in.</p><p>  Deputy Cowen said that unless all these issues were properly discussed today, his party could not accept the process.

Notwithstanding the troika agreement, it is a matter for the Government to decide when charges will commence.  I believe the Deputy mentioned June 2014.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government signed up to 1 January of that year.</p><p>On the information deficit about which Deputies expressed concern, all of these issues will be dealt with transparently in the Oireachtas before charges commence.  </p><p> On group water schemes, as I understand it there will be no change to existing arrangements between group water schemes and local authorities.  Next Wednesday, I will address the National Group Water Scheme conference, at which time I will discuss that issue.</p><p> I believe I have dealt with most of the issues raised by Deputies.  It is important we get across the message to people that water is a scarce resource.  We must continue to ensure the quality of our water.  In terms of water quality, 99% of our water is as good as the best in the world.  However, there are significant issues we need to address, including the impact of climate change and how we propose to remediate that impact and how we propose to address the potential water shortage in the Greater Dublin Area from 2020 onwards.  </p><p> While we have an abundance of water in Ireland, in terms of rainfall, it does not always fall in the right places.  People need to understand that while water falls freely from the sky prior to use it must be treated, stored and pumped.  We need to secure efficiencies in terms of water wastage.  We cannot as an economy afford to spend &euro;1.2 billion on water treatment and infrastructure while 42% of it never gets to the tap of any home.  We will also need to educate and inform people about this issue.  Irish Water will engage proactively with the public in terms of empowering people to understand how they can reduce their consumption of water.  I met recently with members of a group water scheme, which was an amalgamation of three group water schemes, which has reduced its pre-metering water consumption by 60%.  In this regard, they have involved everybody in the community, including young people.  Every national school student has a card which identifies him or her as a water deputy.  They see it as their social responsibility to assist their community, which is a rural community, in the protection of its water supply.  </p><p> The Green Flag scheme run by An Taisce is important and worthwhile.  The water complement of that scheme is also important.  It is important we get the message across to everybody that water is such an important but scarce commodity we must conserve it.  We need the help of everybody in the country to do so, which will require that we educate people and ensure transparency in this regard in our politics.  This is what this legislation is about.</p></speech>

The local elections will be held in the first week of June 2014.  Can the Minister of State confirm if people are to be billed for water from 1 January 2014?  The question of when water charges will be introduced has been asked a number of times, in respect of which the response has been that they will apply from 2014.  The Minister of State appeared to be alluding today to their being introduced on 1 January 2014.  Perhaps he would confirm if that is the case.</p><p>  The issue of the cost of establishing the water services company and the cost of water to each household has not been addressed.  There will be a direct correlation between both issues.  The new company will be a stand-alone company that will have to wash its own face and pay its way.  That is what we have been told.  The current cost of water provision is &euro;300 million per annum.  The Minister of State said in his response that in future &euro;600 million per annum will be required.  </p></speech>

I am sure the chief executive officer of the new company - I understand it will be Mr. John Tierney - will confirm that figure for us if and when necessary.  As it stands, a &euro;600 million capital investment will be required and the cost of installation of meters will be, taking the most commonly used figure, &euro;500 million.  Operational costs are estimated to be approximately &euro;1 billion.  I believe the cost will be higher and that the new company will not do the job as cheaply as the local authorities.  Taking all of those figures together, households will be faced with colossal bills.  This issue has not been addressed to date, including by the Minister of State today.</p></speech>

The Government has been in office now for two years.  I would have expected it to have made a conscious decision at this stage to stop blaming the previous Government for everything.  It is not wearing with the electorate.  The Government has appointed Bord G&aacute;is rather than Bord na M&oacute;na.  While Bord G&aacute;is gave commitments to keep to the timescale provided for in the agreement, it has not done so.  It also has not provided the information I requested.  The Government is hiding behind a procurement process, which I believe is complete.  The Minister of State told us today that setting the price will be the job of the regulator.  Some would argue the Government will hide behind him too.  </p><p>  I recently spoke to the Minister of State about the energy regulator's delay in agreeing a pricing policy in respect of power.  This process has been ongoing now for 11 or 12 months.  I am not asking for interference in the decision rather I am asking that the regulator make a decision in the interests of the State and a reduction in costs, which would mean less charges in the electricity sector.  On the Government's commitments in this area, this legislation is poor and late.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that this legislation provides no certainty that water services will not be privatised.  He also said that matter will be addressed in future legislation in this area.</p></speech>

There is an element of Teflon about that about which I am more than uneasy.  The Minister of State also referred to the annual report being laid before the D&aacute;il.  We hear this all the time.  While the policing report was laid before the D&aacute;il on budget day, it was not debated, which is a deficient method of oversight.  We must put in place a mechanism which ensures such reports are debated in detail.</p><p>  I am concerned that poverty proofing of this legislation has not yet been completed.  That is a serious issue.</p><p>I asked the Minister of State about several points, including the &euro;300 million.  Will this continue to be invested?  The Minister of State said it was a subsidy.  With regard to the preferred method of building new treatment plans and the approach the new company will take, will it take its lead from the Department?  Dr. Eoin Reeves gave the joint Oireachtas committee very useful information stating local authorities had conducted value for money tests and concluded in favour of traditional procurement.  However, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has not granted project approval because design, build and operate is its preferred method of procurement, even when a value for money report shows one can save money by using the traditional route.  We need to know what the approach will be.</p><p> With regard to consumer protection, the service must be fit for purpose, and there must be redress for people whereby they can complain or an element of consumer protection.  Where is this?  Will it be in the next piece of legislation?  It must be somewhere.</p></speech>

The company designed, built and operates it, and it is operated very efficiently.  The local authority deals with it every day and there is a resident engineer.

page 11, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:13.&#8212;(1) (<i>a</i>) In relation to borrowings by the Board under <i>section 12</i>, the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, may guarantee, in such form<blockquote>and manner and in such money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) and on such terms and conditions as he or she thinks fit, the due repayment by the Board of the principal of any money borrowed by the Board or the due payment of instalments or other amounts of money owed by the Board under a contract entered into by the Board or the payment of interest on any money, instalment or amount or both the repayment of principal or payment of such instalments or amounts, as the case may be, and payment of the interest, and any such guarantee may include a guarantee of payment of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with such borrowings or such contract.<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) In relation to borrowings by the subsidiary under <i>section 12</i>, the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, may guarantee, in such form and manner and in such money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) and on such terms and conditions as he or she thinks fit, the due repayment by the subsidiary of the principal of any money borrowed by the subsidiary or the due payment of instalments or other amounts of money owed by the subsidiary under a contract entered into by the subsidiary or the payment of interest on any money, instalment or amount or both the repayment of principal or payment of such instalments or amounts, as the case may be, and payment of the interest, and any such guarantee may include a guarantee of payment of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with such borrowings or such contract.</blockquote>(2) Where a guarantee under this section is or has been given, the Board or the subsidiary, as may be appropriate, shall, if the Minister for Finance so requires, give to him or her such security (including debentures) as may be specified in the requirement for the purpose of securing to the Minister for Finance the repayment of any money which he or she may be liable to pay or has paid under the guarantee. <br /><br />(3) The Minister for Finance shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of every financial year, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement setting out with respect to each guarantee under this section given during that year or given at any time before, and in force on, the commencement of that year&#8212;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) particulars of the guarantee,<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) in case any payment has been made by him or her under the guarantee before the end of that year, the amount of the payment and the amount (if any) repaid to him or her on foot of the payment, and<br /><br />(<i>c</i>) the amount of money covered by the guarantee which was outstanding at the end of that year.</blockquote>(4) (<i>a</i>) Money paid by the Minister for Finance under a guarantee to which <i>paragraph (a)</i> of <i>subsection (1)</i> applies shall be repaid to the Minister for Finance<blockquote>(with interest thereon at such rate or rates as he or she appoints) by the Board within such period from the date of payment by the Minister for Finance as may be specified by him or her after consultation with the Board.<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) Money paid by the Minister for Finance under a guarantee to which <i>paragraph (b)</i> of <i>subsection (1)</i> applies shall be repaid to the Minister for Finance (with interest thereon at such rate or rates as he or she appoints) by the subsidiary within such period from the date of payment by the Minister for Finance as may be specified by him or her after consultation with the subsidiary.</blockquote>(5) Where the whole or any part of the money required by <i>subsection (4)</i> to be repaid to the Minister for Finance has not been repaid in accordance with that subsection, the amount so remaining outstanding shall be repaid to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.<br /><br />(6) Notwithstanding the provision of money under <i>subsection (5)</i> to repay an amount to the Central Fund, the Board or the subsidiary, as the case may be, shall remain liable to the Minister for Finance in respect of that amount and that amount (together with interest thereon at such rate or rates as the Minister for Finance appoints) shall be repaid to the Minister for Finance by the Board or the subsidiary, as may be appropriate, at such times and in such instalments as he or she appoints and, in default of repayment as aforesaid and without prejudice to any other method of recovery, shall be recoverable by him or her from the Board or the subsidiary, as may be appropriate, as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br /><br />(7) In relation to a guarantee under this section in money in a currency other than the currency of the State&#8212;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) each of the references to principal, each of the references to instalments or other amounts of money, each of the references to interest and the reference to commission and incidental expenses in <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be taken as referring to the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual principal, the actual instalments or other amounts of money, the actual interest or the actual commission and incidental expenses, as may be appropriate,<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) the reference to the amount of money in <i>paragraph (c)</i> of <i>subsection (3)</i> shall be taken as referring to the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual amount of money, such equivalent being calculated according to the rate of exchange for the time being for that currency and the currency of the State, and<br /><br />(<i>c</i>) each of the references to money in <i>subsections (4)</i>, <i>(5)</i> and <i>(6)</i> shall be taken as referring to the cost in the currency of the State of the actual money.&quot;</blockquote></blockquote>Where provision is included in legislation for a guarantee or borrowings by the Minister for Finance this amendment provides that moneys required by the Minister for Finance to meet any sums payable under section 13 be provided from the central fund.  It provides that the Minister may borrow using the security of the central fund and may create and issue securities bearing interest and pay all borrowed sums to the Exchequer.</p><p><br />  I apologise.

I had the wrong page open.</p><p>  Amendment No. 21 provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the borrowings made by Irish Water or Bord G&aacute;is for the purposes of the Bill.  The provision of a guarantee of the borrowings of a semi-State company is a common provision included in legislation establishing many other State bodies and companies.  This provision provides that the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, provide a guarantee of the borrowings of Bord G&aacute;is and or Irish Water for borrowings made for the purposes of the Bill.  It also provides for the Minister for Finance to seek a guarantee from the board or subsidiary for borrowings and for the Minister to provide details to the Houses of the Oireachtas each year concerning any guarantees made under this.</p></speech>

Will it be 1 June, 7 June just after the local elections or 1 January?  I mentioned earlier that many people are not sleeping, but another group of people not sleeping are those who occupy the Government benches who know what will come through their constituents' letterboxes next Monday.</p><p>  The problem with this amendment is that it will give powers of borrowing to the Minister to hand money to this separate entity without the accountability about which I and other Deputies have asked.  This is the problem.  This has not been thought through.  There is no accountability at present, and as Deputy Catherine Murphy correctly stated, one pays more attention to the wallpaper than something which has been laid before the House.  Somewhere near this building there are probably forklifts stacking books and reports which were laid before the House.  There is no meat in this sandwich in terms of democracy.  It is a non-event.</p></speech>

The limit on borrowings very much depends on the income stream.  I must ask again about the &euro;300 million subsidy.  Suppose one puts a &euro;500 million cap on the level of borrowings that can be made and then withdraws the subsidy in year two and there is inadequate income, what will happen to support the borrowings?  One could run into a difficulty with the imposition of more charges.  Can the Minister of State address the approach the State will take to the &euro;300 million subsidy?</p></speech>

As regards the point raised earlier by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Stanley, when a report is laid before the House, it is up to Members to read it should they wish to do so.  For example, when I was on the committee dealing with transport, we brought in CIE representatives 12 times over a two or three month period.  Oireachtas committees have those powers.  The legislation states that the report must be laid before the Oireachtas, which means that the body is accountable to the Oireachtas.  The relevant committee will then decide when it wants the representatives to come in.  For example, the CIE representatives were queried about auditing and other issues.  We found that useful but it is not the only way in which the House can hold Irish Water accountable.  I presume the Whips can also arrange for a debate to be held.  I cannot imagine that there would not be such debates at regular intervals due to the importance of the issues involved, including climate, costs and the economy.</p><p>  As I understand it, the Minister for Finance must make a full and detailed annual statement to the House on the guarantee he has given and the outcome of funding arrangements.  The sum of &euro;300 million is roughly what the Government is putting in this year.  It is a matter for each annual budget to determine what that amount will be.  Any government can decide what that amount will be depending on financial circumstances and demands.  Irish Water will state what its development plans are and how much it needs, which will determine when it requires various tranches of money.</p></speech>

I could not imagine, therefore, that it would be a runaway train of cost increases.  Everything will have to be tested properly, publicly and transparently.</p><p>  This Bill allows the regulator to start because it has no statutory powers at the moment.  I wish to reassure Deputies that in the second legislative provision we will have full, total and absolute detail on all these issues.  It might be helpful if the relevant Oireachtas committee were to invite the representatives of Irish Water, within a few months of its establishment, to talk about their plans.  The regulator could also be brought in as part of the accountability process.  The regulator will be independent in terms of decisions but there is no reason the regulator should not be invited in to talk generally about how he sees the situation, as well as listening to what Members of the House would like to see happening.  If Members consider that approach to be helpful, it is the way to go.</p></speech>

We established on Committee Stage, when my amendment to have the Bill poverty-proofed was rejected by the Government, that this legislation would not be poverty-proofed.  Provision should be made to exempt from the payment of water charges blind and disabled persons, widows, those in receipt of non-contributory pensions, which is the lowest pension payment, and people on one-parent family payments.  Single parents must manage a household on &#8364;217 per week and meet a range of costs such as paying for school buses and lunches.  Even in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain, exemptions were made for those in receipt of housing benefit and those on low incomes.  The legislation before us does not provide for any such exemptions.</p><p><br />  I referred to the Government's failure to meet its commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a waiver scheme in respect of refuse collection charges.  People on low incomes will be penalised as a result of this failure and penalised again if the Government does not accept the amendment or introduce some form of exemption scheme.  From next week onwards, property tax bills will be posted through the letterboxes of the people with the lowest incomes in the State, including blind people, pensioners, lone parents and those in receipt of invalidity pensions.  Many householders, including the working poor, are in dire straits, while others are in desperate circumstances and clinging to the edge.  I appeal to the Government to accept the amendment in good faith and provide some level of protection for those on the lowest incomes.  It would be shameful if the Bill were to be passed without providing some level of clarity and fairness for the poor.</p><p><br />  As an earlier speaker noted, the Government is asking us to walk with it in the dark on this issue on the basis that something may happen in future.  This debate is the big gig because the legislation before us removes the prohibition on charging for water provided in the 2007 Act.  The Government is asking the House to make this change without providing any protection for the lowest income groups.  Government back bench Deputies have been bleating about meeting people on low incomes in their constituencies, as I am sure they do, but it is no good listening to people or offering them soothing words.  This debate provides an opportunity to put our money where our mouth is by taking action to protect such people.  I appeal to Government Deputies, particularly Labour Party Members, to come up to the mark and provide protection for those whom they continually tell us they wish to protect.  Rather than constantly droning on about it, they should do something by voting for the amendment.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is well aware, the People Before Profit Alliance strenuously opposes the Government's plan to introduce water charges and establish a company that will commence the process of privatisation, notwithstanding its denials that this is the case.  I assure the Minister of State that there will be a major campaign of resistance to the Government's plan to charge people for water.  This campaign will put into the shade the level of opposition to the household charge and property tax.  If, however, the Government insists on going down that road, as appears to be the case, I do not understand the reason it is unwilling to provide exemptions for those who are unable to pay the charges.  Why does it not get the idea that one cannot get blood from a stone?</p><p>  It is obscene that people on the very lowest incomes will not be exempt from water charges.  Dependence on State payments such as jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit and the lone parent payment is an indicator that the recipient is living in poverty and struggling to survive from day to day, week to week and month to month.  It is obnoxious to expect people in this position not only to pay the property tax that will be imposed in the coming weeks, but also to pay for water, which is indispensable to life, hygiene and basic health and safety.  I appeal to the Minister of State to at least include in the Bill a provision exempting such groups from water charges.</p><p>  I suspect the Minister of State knows full well that the action the Government is taking in this legislation will lead to privatisation.  As I pointed out to him, European law, as enshrined in various treaties, specifically, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, requires that once revenue is being generated in any particular sector by a monopoly, the sector in question must become subject to the laws of competition.  As a result, private companies will seek to enter the water market and it will be privatised.  We know this is the case because it is exactly what happened in the area of waste collection when charges were introduced.  At that time, the Government indicated it would provide waivers and the public authorities provided some waivers for people on the lowest incomes.  However, as soon as waste collection was privatised, the waivers were abolished and people who were unable to pay were forced to pay.  We are now taking exactly the same route.</p><p>Given the Government's despicable insistence on introducing water charges, will it not at least insert these protections so that this or any other water company will not be able to charge people on the lowest incomes or deny them water because they cannot afford it?</p></speech>

It is an interim Bill that sets up Irish Water and allows for metering to commence.  The Government, in its wisdom, has stated that, in the absence of all of the information that it sought when the scheme was announced in the first instance, it would plough ahead in the dark and expect us to follow it.  This will not be the case.</p><p>  If nothing else, we have reaffirmed in this debate that poverty proofing is still ongoing.  By association with this fact, we have established that the concept of a free allowance has not been set out in any shape or form.  We have also established that, in light of the audit and the necessary rectification, the exact costs associated with making the network fit for purpose are not known.  As the Minister of State mentioned, there is a 40% leakage rate.</p></speech>

The Government has failed to address the issue of energy provision.  Many companies with external investment are prepared, have licences, are connected to the grid and have planning permission.  They can reduce the cost of electricity to the people we represent, yet the Government will not instruct the regulator to hurry up and make a decision any more than it will give him the necessary information to make provision under this Bill.  In the absence of that information, I cannot blame Deputy Stanley for tabling amendments on the issue of people who cannot afford to pay.  We do not even know what the water will cost.  We are only guessing.  Will the Minister of State please acknowledge the effort being made on this side of the House with answers that would allow us to make reasoned decisions?</p></speech>

There is some confusion over it, but it makes a basic request for a bit of humanity from the system for people who cannot pay.  The past ten days have seen attacks on people with disabilities.  They will not be able to pay.  The Minister of State knows this better than I do.</p><p>  I disagree with the basis of the Bill.  We are handing responsibility for water over to Bord G&aacute;is.  We will have great gas, but we will have no water.  We all know that the Bill is a crude instrument.  The Minister of State is the softer side of the Department.  T&aacute; an Aire, Big Phil, imithe.  Has he gone with the Chief Whip to Australia to see if he can get water?  St. Patrick's Day is not for another ten days.  It is the Flight of the Earls again.  The current Government criticised the last Government.</p><p>  We are forcing people into penury.  In our time on local authorities, we made representations for people.  Now, we might as well write to Santa Clause as write to Bord G&aacute;is.  We have seen how it treats people, for example, disconnecting them or demanding upfront payments.  As Deputy Cowen mentioned, the regulator has given Bord G&aacute;is increase after increase.  There is no accountability, understanding or shred of humanity in this legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700022#U00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time".</p><p>  I thank the spokespersons from the Opposition parties for facilitating the taking of this Bill today.</p><p>Section 17 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the District Court may grant an interim care order in respect of a child on foot of an application by the Health Service Executive.  The order may be made with or without parental consent in accordance with the section.  The application may arise in circumstances where a child is being cared for under an emergency care order, often following a decision by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to remove a child to safety under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  An interim care order may also arise as a result of an application by the Health Service Executive to take a child into its care in circumstances where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of that child.  Before granting an interim care order, the judge must be satisfied that an application for a care order in respect of the child has been or is about to be made.</p><p> The HSE recently made a submission to my Department concerning the need to increase the duration of an extension to an interim care order to 29 days.  The submission set out the practice rationale for seeking to increase the period of an extension to an interim care order and sets out a strong case for urgent legislative change; hence, the Bill before us.  In its submission, the HSE highlighted the difficulties it has been experiencing due to the necessity of having to go back to the District Court every eight days for extensions to interim care orders, including increased stress for all parties arising from the frequency of court appearances; the difficulties for social work staff in forming working relationships with a child and his or her family because of the frequency of adversarial court appearances; the amount of social workers' time taken up by constant court work; and increased legal costs in respect of HSE, families and guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  It is a real issue that must be addressed on a variety of fronts.</p><p><br /> In essence, the current application of section 17(2) of the Child Care Act 1991 is absorbing considerable court time and resulting in valuable social work time being expended in preparing for court cases and attending court hearings.  This is not in the best interest of the child.  It is my view that the HSE submission made a comprehensive and convincing case and I am therefore bringing forward the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 to make the amendments that are urgently required to the Child Care Act 1991 in that regard.  This is also being supported by many of the legal representatives on both sides who have been in contact about the legislation.  In addition, the effect of the proposed amending legislation will be to facilitate, as far as possible, applications for orders or extensions to orders to be heard on the same day each week by the courts, which will facilitate proper planning and use of time.  This would assist the courts and the HSE in processing these applications and reduce the number of court appearances for all parties involved.</p><p><br /> I will now turn to the principal features of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Section 1 amends section 17(2) of the Child Care Act 1991.  Section 17(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Child Care Act 1991 currently allows for an interim care order for a period not exceeding 28 days in the absence of parental consent.  Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend section 17(2)(<i>a</i>) by substituting &quot;twenty-nine days&quot; for &quot;twenty-eight days&quot;.  Section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) currently allows for an interim care order to exceed 28 days with parental consent.  Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) by substituting &quot;twenty-nine days&quot; for twenty-eight days&quot;.  Section 1(<i>b</i>) of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend section 17(2) of the Child Care Act 1991 by substituting &quot;where an extension is to exceed twenty-nine days&quot; for &quot;where an extension is to exceed eight days&quot; in order to provide that an application to extend an interim care order can be granted for a period of up to 29 days without parental consent.  Section 2 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and collective citation.</p><p><br /> I have brought this amending Bill forward as a matter of priority.  The effect of this amendment is that on the enactment of the 2013 Bill, an interim care order or an extension to an interim care order, in the absence of parental consent, may be granted for a period not exceeding 29 days.  I commend this Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the Deputies' views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700023#V00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate today on this short, technical Bill that will ultimately improve the effectiveness of the Child Care Act 1991 and address an oversight in the Children Act 2001.  I thank the Minister for offering a briefing from officials in the Department on the Bill.  Although I did not accept the offer, it is a positive development and perhaps the Minister might consider going even further and having a more consultative approach with the Opposition when new legislation is brought forward.  Those of us on this side of the House have valuable ideas just as the Minister has.  I say this as two of the more important pieces of legislation are coming from the Department later this year, these being the Bill to establish the child and family support agency and the Children First Bill.  It is only right and proper for this side of the House to have a meaningful input into those pieces of legislation.</p><p>  In assessing this legislation, our fundamental consideration must be the best interests of the child.  I have asked whether these amendments will benefit children currently in care, and I believe they will.  Until approximately 12 months ago, the District Court had granted 28-day extensions to interim care orders in cases where necessary consent had not been provided.  That was only changed on the direction of the President of the District Court.  For the past 12 months, representatives of the HSE had to return to the court every eight days for the extension of an interim care order, resulting in increased stress for all parties, as the Minister indicated, particularly for parents.  It also led to insecurity in the children and difficulties for social workers in forming relationships with children and families.  A significant amount of time was taken up with court appearances and there is an increased legal cost associated with the process.</p><p>  The amending legislation will allow for the extension of an interim care order from eight to 29 days where consent has not been obtained from parents or guardians.  It also allows for an interim care order granted without consent to be for a period not exceeding 29 days and for an order granted with consent to be for a period exceeding 29 days.  These changes should ensure that all periods under section 17 of the Child Care Act 1991 will be 29 days.  The Bill has the potential to reduce needless bureaucracy and administration by eliminating the need to go to court every eight days to renew interim care orders.  That will allow more time to find a solution in the best interests of the child and, as Senator van Turnhout argued in the recent Seanad debate, a &quot;rebalancing in the focus from going to court to managing a positive outcome in individual cases&quot;.</p><p>  We are happy to support the legislation and facilitate all Stages in the D&aacute;il but I will highlight a number of concerns.  There has been an unnecessary delay in bringing the Bill before the House.  The anomaly was first raised by practitioners involved in court proceedings who felt the current system was having a negative impact on children.  I understand it was identified to the Department by the HSE almost 12 months ago.  This is short, technical but uncomplicated amending legislation which should have been introduced as a matter of priority as soon as the anomaly was identified.  The entire Bill is only half a page so I do not understand why there was an unnecessary delay.</p><p>  The failure to legislate in recent months has resulted in an unnecessary drain on scarce resources, with representatives of the HSE, social workers and legal teams being dragged to the courts every eight days.  The most recent HIQA reports for the Dublin north-west region indicates that 35% of children in foster care had no social link worker.  The same report highlights 38 allegations and concerns about foster carers made in the previous 12 months, with a significant number confirmed.  Some 34 of the concerns were investigated, with four remaining.  Some children remained in placements that were not approved by the foster care committee, despite allegations being made against foster carers.  That was supported by documentary evidence.  Unfortunately, this is not an old report and it deals with occurrences from two years ago.  Serious child care issues remained undetected because of a lack of social workers.</p><p>I am sure the Minister will agree it is critical that social workers are not caught up in administrative bureaucracy when they should be out supporting the families and children who need them.  The unnecessary delay in bringing forward this legislation has resulted in this.  There should not have been a delay.  The Government often commends itself &#8211; rightly so &#8211; on the establishment of a Department to deal exclusively with children.  Since the Minister has her own Department, why was there such a delay in bringing forward such a small, technical and uncomplicated Bill?</p><p><br /> There is a secondary issue to be addressed, and the Minister referred to it in her contribution.  I refer to increased legal fees as a result of the delay in bringing forward this legislation.  Only two weeks ago there was an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, which I am sure the Minister will have read, outlining that approximately &#8364;30 million was spent on legal fees in 2012 in respect of child care issues.  This leads to a perception that the system is more about keeping lawyers in jobs than anything else.  I do not subscribe to that sceptical view but what is occurring leads to the perception.  If this legislation had been enacted when first mooted in 2012, what would the savings have been?  How much of the &#8364;30 million was attributable to legal representatives seeking interim care orders every eight days?  I accept that the Minister will not have the answer to hand today but I ask her to find out the answer from her Department.  At a time of unbelievably scarce resources, we must seek to ensure that they are made available to front-line services that are most in need of them.  It is disappointing that it took so long to rectify the deficiency within the Department. </p><p><br /> The time it took to bring this uncomplicated and technical legislation before the House has raised concerns about the Department's capacity to introduce the Children First legislation and the legislation required to put the child and family support agency on a statutory footing.  I agree that these Bills are very complicated but they are urgently required to ensure we will have an effective, efficient, transparent and accountable child welfare system in which every citizen can have confidence.</p><p><br /> I supported the recent children referendum, as did the Government and 164 other Members of this House.  However, a large number of people were unsure and voted &quot;No&quot;, thereby implying they did not have confidence in the child care system as it currently stands.  The two Bills to be introduced are critical.  I draw attention to them because of the long time it took for the Department to bring the short, uncomplicated Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2013 to the Houses.  Perhaps the Minister will update us in her closing remarks on the two forthcoming Bills and allay my fears.  The Bills ought to be forthcoming to ensure we will have the efficient, effective, transparent and accountable child welfare system we so richly deserve.</p><p><br /> Just as we support the passage of this legislation today and facilitated it in the Seanad, we are prepared to work with the Minister and her officials to ensure that the necessary important legislation to instil confidence in and revamp our child care services will be accorded the priority status it deserves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700024#W00200"><p>I welcome this Bill as a necessary amendment to the Child Care Act 1991.  It is a further step in the improvement of legislative and administrative provisions for the care of children.  That is a process that I hope we all support.  The strengthening of the foundations of legal rights for children was an important milestone of progress.  We look forward to further necessary legislation, some of which was referred to by Deputy Robert Troy.</p><p><br />  While I acknowledge unreservedly that the Government, not least the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, deserves credit for successfully championing the children's rights referendum, I regret the Government's credit is tarnished by its futile and punitive austerity measures which are increasing child poverty in the State.  That is not just a general statement but a fact that I know most definitely from the cases presented to me as a D&aacute;il Deputy week in, week out.  It is a real set of circumstances that we cannot and must not ignore.</p><p><br />  I look forward to the establishment of the child and family support agency.  I have raised this with the Minister repeatedly.  I raised it last week with Mr. Gordon Jeyes at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  When the agency is established, it will take over many responsibilities currently residing with the Health Service Executive.  We addressed this at this morning's meeting of the committee.  The responsibilities include those covered in this Bill.</p><p><br />  The Bill provides for the extension of an interim care order from eight days to 29 days where consent has not been obtained from parents or guardians.  This will bring the periods in section 17(2) of the parent Act, the Child Care Act 1991, broadly into line as all periods will be 29 days.  This period will be a maximum for an interim care order without consent.  With parental consent, the period may exceed 29 days.</p><p><br />  Part 4 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, sets out provisions relating to the making of a care order and a supervision order.  Section 16 allows the HSE to make an application for a care order or supervision order in respect of a child residing in its area where it appears the child is in need of care or protection.</p><p><br />  A supervision order authorises the HSE to visit a child at specified periods to allow it to ascertain the welfare of the child or to provide advice on the care of the child.  Under section 17(1), where an application for a care order has been made or is about to be made and an urgent protection need arises, an interim care order can be made pending the determination of the care order application.  Section 17(2)(<i>b</i>) provided that the parent or person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> gave consent, an interim care order could be granted for a period exceeding eight days and, where they did not give consent, for a period not exceeding eight days.  This was amended by section 267 of the Children Act 2001, which allowed an interim order with consent for a period exceeding 28 days and limited an order without consent to a period not exceeding 28 days.  Section 17(2) of the 1991 Act also allows for an extension of an interim care order.</p><p>Until now, this would exceed eight days with the permission of the parents or those acting<i>in loco parentis</i>and cannot exceed eight days without that consent.  The legislation before us now would allow that to be extended to 29 days.  It also amends section 72(<i>b</i>) of the 1991 Act to allow for the application itself to be for 29 days maximum without consent and for longer where there is consent.  This is necessary because running to the courts every eight days to have an interim care order reviewed is understandably regarded as excessive by those who are directly impacted by it.  It is not best practice and most certainly, and much to the fore of all our minds, disruptive for the care of the child in question.</p><p><br /> Following the amendment of section 17(2) by the 2001 Act, the practice arose whereby interim care orders without consent were granted for a period of 28 days initially, with extensions of a further 28 days.  Due to the President of the District Court, however, directing that a court cannot make such an order without consent concurrently, there is a need to legislate.  If the Bill is enacted and all time periods under section 17(2) become 29 days, the proposed amendment form 28 to 29 days will facilitate applications for interim care orders, or extensions to them, being heard on the same day each week by the court.</p><p><br /> I mentioned the children's referendum.  It was noteworthy that during that campaign some people had genuine concerns about children in State care, something we all touched upon.  The valid concerns that were expressed were understandable.  Of course, and my memory has not been erased since, there was some deliberate scaremongering also.  Those of us who advocated a &quot;yes&quot; vote argued that concern about children in State care was all the more reason to strengthen children's rights in the Constitution.  The lesson from all the scandals of children in the horrendous institutions of the past was that their voices were not heard and they were largely invisible or made invisible to society.  That must never be repeated.  There is, of course, a responsibility on all of us, and most certainly on the Houses of the Oireachtas, for ongoing vigilance.</p><p><br /> Today the problems are different, but no less serious for the individual children concerned.  The lack of adequate social care for vulnerable children in the State must be put right, irrespective of the challenges of the current economic circumstances and resources.  It is absolutely essential and must be corrected very soon.  Resourcing of the new child and family support agency is crucial and I hope we will shortly see the publication of the facilitating legislation.  I join Deputy Troy in asking the Minister to avail of the opportunity here today to give us an update on its expected presentation, something with which we are all anxious to proceed.  I fully support the passage of this Bill and will facilitate its conclusion today.</p></speech>

It gave me a better understanding of why this is necessary.  Like others, I would prefer more consultation.  The officials said they had nothing to do with it but I got the Bill late last Thursday night and amendments had to be in by 10 a.m. on Friday morning.  The Minister has been in the House much longer than me so she should know that timeframe leaves very little room.  The Bills Office or whatever it is should be changed because that is not an adequate timeframe for anyone to study the Bill and submit amendments.</p><p>  I echo the comments of Deputy Troy on the promised legislation on the child and family support agency and the Bill to give statutory backing to the Children First guidelines.  I am also concerned about resources for the child and family support agency.  It was reported this morning that there would be more than 4,000 staff in the agency.  I hope we get adequate staff, not the dead wood from the HSE.  I am not being disrespectful to any individual in the HSE but we must have consultation and proper examination of this legislation.</p><p>  I will go back to my hobby horse.  It is not a matter about which just I am concerned.  The Supreme Court was also concerned.  I do not want to attach any personal blame to the Minister, although she must take some of the blame, but it was a Cabinet decision to stonewall the decision of the five Supreme Court judges who were very clear in the judgment that they handed down.  They stated they have serious misgivings that the Department stole the money.  We voted &euro;3 million in the House to run the referendum and the Minister pilfered, stole and robbed &euro;1.1 million of that money.  That is not nice.  Reference was made to scaremongering by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and Sinn F&eacute;in is well able to scaremonger, has done so for many years and still does in many cases, but people have genuine fears, and we know, from the Dublin north-west report that Deputy Troy mentioned, why they have those fears.  I have cases-----</p></speech>

I have said so before and I will say it again.  That is what happened - &euro;3 million was allocated by this House and &euro;1.1 million of it was misappropriated according to the judges of the Supreme Court, a higher power than these Houses.  We are the Legislature and the Supreme Court acts on our decisions.  I would like to rephrase it but that is the word I have used before. There is no escaping it, that is what happened and there has been no debate on that in this House, in spite of me asking the Ceann Comhairle for special notice questions.</p></speech>

That is what happened.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister but that is what happened.  The money was allocated by the Oireachtas, it did not go to where it was supposed to go, it was not spent fairly or properly and that is wrong.  The result could have been biased.</p><p>  I am not one of those who went out campaigning on that but I made a decision close to the end of the campaign that the HSE and some of these authorities have too much power.  We see that when we look at the report from the Dublin north-west region.  I hope the Minister will give us an idea of the reaction to that report.  Procedures contained in the Children First guidelines were not consistently implemented.  There was no formal child protection notification system that complied with the guidelines in 2011.  Worryingly, 38 allegations of concerns about foster carers had been made in the previous 12 months and a significant number had been confirmed.  I salute the many foster carers, 99.99% of whom do their very best and should be supported, but the supports are not going the right way.  I am shocked to see that where investigations took place and concerns were addressed, the child's social worker investigated the concern, not an independent social worker.  We have the same problem with the Water Services Bill.  An official will make a decision and if a person wants to appeal that, another official from the same office adjudicates.</p><p>This is even worse, it is the same person.</p><p> We cannot ever talk about the Water Services Bill or any other Bill in the context of child protection because it is so important.  Tragically, we have had to learn so many lessons, with the different reports over the years and now with the Magdalen laundries report.  This morning I watched an interesting video in the AV room from an organisation that is well up on what is happening to children all over the world, and it is horrific.  We are dealing with the State here.  We can never equate it with any of those Bills, but this is very serious.  HIQA, of which I have been critical on many occasions, exposed this.  These children are the most vulnerable members of society and it is imperative that these issues are addressed as a matter of urgency in the forthcoming child and family support agency.</p><p> There have been mistakes.  I have written to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health regarding serious long-term issues in my constituency where foster care has not been supported, and I have issues with the HSE which are significant and worrying.  That needs to be changed.  Yesterday the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, listened to the junior doctors and then to the HSE officials, and they inhabit two different worlds.  The HSE is a fairly autocratic organisation.  It is not accountable to any Minister.  I hope the legislation will encompass that the child and family support agency and any body provided for under the children first Bill will be accountable to the Minister.  We need to bring accountability back to this House.  It was given away by the previous Governments over ten years.  I condemn that.  I accept that the big mistake was the setting up of the HSE but we were promised by this Government that it would take back accountability and we have seen no sign of it.  The replies to parliamentary questions still state that it is not a matter for the Minister; it is a matter for the HSE.  In many cases, the HSE is not capable of doing the business properly, and the waste and the funding involved is significant.</p><p> If we can be guaranteed that it is an effort to streamline this process and give the social workers more time to get an understanding of and feeling for the child and the family and the best possible solution, we must think that this is a good aspect to this Bill.  If it is a matter of streamlining it from eight days to 29 to allow for a cyclical approach within the four weeks and to allow for one sitting day.  We heard the Chief Justice's recent comments about the chaos in the courts.  We cannot have HSE officials, social workers and lawyers in the court every eight days, and that is a good aspect of the Bill.  Apart from the cost and frustration of it, and the angst to everybody concerned, the family, and the guardians, foster carer or whoever, and above all the child or children, that must be welcomed.  It also reduces the costs.  I am glad to hear the Minister state that many legal representatives had agreed with the moves here and believe that what is happening is not right or fair, and that we must deal with it.</p><p> I would have concerns as to why this took nearly 12 months to bring to this stage.  I accept the Minister has a new Department.  I wished her well at the outset and I still wish her well.  I believe she and her officials are passionately interested in the well-being of all children, as we all are in this House.  Why did this take nearly 12 months, if it is so urgent today?  It was in the Seanad a month ago.  I accept there are difficulties here, with the Finance Bill and other Bills and the IBRC issues and the so-called promissory notes, but it took a month to be presented here after its passage by the Seanad.  Why was there such a delay and how long more will it be delayed if the Bills is passed today?</p><p> How long will it take to reach a position where there can be a reasonable period given for these care orders for people to go down to the court so that they can look for a solution.  The most important aspect for the child is to get a proper cohesive long-term solution to bring some semblance of stability to the unfortunate children who are in these situations through no fault of their own.  That is the saddest part of all.  There, but for the grace of God, go I or any of us.  I referred to that telling short synopsis of a film that was made about the children in slavery in parts of the world today.  We must count our blessing here.</p><p> As I stated, if the Bill is necessary to change the process, we all would be happy provided that it is copperfastened and that there cannot be any indefinite orders granted.  Those I represent are worried, as am I, about indefinite orders.  In that regard, the Bill is fairly watertight - pardon the pun about the earlier Bill debated in the House today - and there cannot be any indefinite orders.</p><p> We must tidy up our act.  We cannot have situations such as occurred in the north west which HIQA investigated.  I would like to know from the Minister whether there is systematic examination of care homes and care centres in the regions as occurs in the private nursing home sector.  HIQA is relentless.  We cannot condone bad practices but it is ridiculous at times where HIQA tries to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear as regards a building.  It is fine where there is a new building where one can do all kinds of things at design stage and afterwards through adaptation, but with buildings that are old, such as this House, one cannot make modern facilities.  I have no difficulty with cleanliness, proper care and fire regulations, but I worry when HIQA argues over a few centimetres in the size of a room.  In this area, has the Minister a full report from HIQA as to the number of inspections nationwide and abroad?  I believe we are paying significant sums for foster care and related matters.</p><p> There are a number of houses in my community that are purchased for the purposes of foster care and they are run by the HSE.  There are all kinds of issues surrounding them.  They would not be for young children but there are all kinds of issues and significant costs associated with them.  We need to streamline them.</p><p> We look forward to the children first Bill.  We look forward to engaging with the Minister on it and also on the question of family supports.  It is overdue, although I accept the Minister is only a short time in the job.  This has to be streamlined and must be kept out of the courts as much as possible.  Any of us who have been in a court, even if it was only for a summons for a traffic fine or whatever, will be aware that it is a daunting place to be.  It is daunting place for foster carers and I am sure it is not easy either for the social workers because they can be cross-examined.  However, there must be accountability.  We cannot have situations such as have gone on here in the Dublin region, as referred to in the HIQA report, especially where persons are investigating allegations against themselves.  That is farcical and it has gone on for far too long.  We can be here and make all kinds of passionate speeches about the McAleese report.  At the same time we cannot have this situation happening under the care of the HSE.</p><p> There are too many issues of lack of accountability in and too much power being wielded by the HSE.  That is why so many voted against the referendum.  People had to fight the power and sometimes felt that they were wronged by the power of the State and Big Brother.  It was not for fun that they voted against it.  Many social workers voted against it because they could not see any big change, and they were not happy.  Many care staff also voted against it.  It was not for selfish reasons.  It was in the interests of the children, on whether we were rushing the legislation, and on why, as I asked, were the moneys misappropriated and used for sending out information on the referendum.</p><p> The role of the Referendum Commission was also an issue.  It should be let do the job on any referendum without citizens having to go to the courts to exercise fairness and straightness.  When the Supreme Court made the order, the Minister for Justice and Equality on the 1 o'clock news was still referring back to the High Court.  He did the same on the 6 o'clock news, when I was on the programme with him.  The Minister is a man who should know better because he is a solicitor of some renown and experience.  The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and he was referring back to the High Court, which had upheld the action taken by the Minister and her Department.  Citizens had to pay their own money to take a case and I commend them.  I salute Mr. Mark McCrystal.  I salute the lady, whose name eludes me, who is still contesting that decision, not for anarchy or for the reason, but because there must be fair play.  We were promised so much of that by this Administration and we have seen very little of it.  We have seen a bureaucratic system, a lack of transparency, rushed legislation, voting in the middle of the night and countless guillotines.  A guillotine has been mentioned in respect of this legislation even though the Minister did not need it because she had the co-operation of all parties.</p><p> I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews for his forbearance and the incoming Acting Chairman, Deputy Ann Phelan.</p></speech>

I heard Deputies Troy and Mattie McGrath refer to a delay in the legislation.  We all want everything to do with child protection passed through this House and in operation as quickly as possible.  While everything is urgent, not everything can be delivered at the moment, as we would like it to be.  This is another piece in a jigsaw we have been assembling over the past two years to reform and restructure child protection services.  We have had the children's rights referendum, to which others have alluded, and the announcement of the new child and family support agency, which is an exciting new departure.  We have seen the appointment of more than 200 additional social workers.  What is colloquially known as the child death report has been published and adoption legislation has been drafted.  An entire veil of secrecy, inefficiency and failure has been pulled back on how this State treats children, particularly vulnerable children.</p><p>  This is a technical Bill, but attempts to downplay its importance is doing the Bill and those who will depend on its provisions a disservice.  When a child is taken into care without his or her parents' consent, it occurs for reasons of child protection.  It is done to ensure that a vulnerable child is removed from a potentially dangerous situation.  It is done for a child's welfare.  The amendment to extend the period of interim care order from eight days to 29 days will allow risk assessment to be carried out.  It will enable, empower and most importantly implicitly insist that the State's agencies carry out comprehensive assessments to avoid time running out resulting in people having to waste time running back to the court to seek additional orders.</p><p>  The need for risk assessment was clearly outlined in the child death report, and this amendment will acknowledge and go some way to address the findings in that report.  The President of the District Court has highlighted the deficiency in the current interim care orders and the inability to seek an extension to an order in excess of eight days.  This need for State services to return constantly and regularly to court owing to this anomaly is taking up significant time and resources in our courts for social workers.  We all know the importance of social work hours and social workers need to be freed up to be directed to where they are needed, working directly with vulnerable children and vulnerable families.  More importantly it is completely unfair to a child and against his or her best interests to have such constant adversarial situations in court.  Vulnerable children need to be supported and do not need to be put in unnecessary adversarial situations.</p><p>  In welcoming the legislation I take the opportunity to refer to three issues relating to child care and child protection.  I welcome the work the Ministers, Deputies Fitzgerald and Shatter, are doing to reform family courts.  An issue that often comes up - it was raised during the children's rights referendum campaign - is that we simply do not know what goes on in these family courts.  I understand there are important and sensitive issues of confidentiality relating to the protection of a child's rights and those of a family.  However, we need more data and the scheme introduced allowing someone to collate information, report on what is going on and give us a picture of what is happening without breaching that confidentiality will be really exciting and informative.  It will help educate us and feed into better policy for our family and child courts.  I look forward to further developments in that regard.</p><p>  I share the views of other speakers that another exciting aspect of the children's referendum is that we have now seen the draft adoption legislation.  We look forward to it being implemented to give Irish families the opportunity to adopt children who might have been in their foster care.  Many people have gone abroad to adopt and there is no criticism of that and no doubt it will continue.  However, it is very welcome that families will have the chance of adopting within this country.</p><p>  I have discussed the issue of childminders with the Minister previously.  I know child minding and childminders are covered by the Child Care Act 1991, which we are obviously amending today.  Child minding cannot be excluded from issues relating to child protection and standards.  I accept that the area is extremely complex and I have heard the Minister discuss the matter previously in the House.  Do we really want to regulate and vet every babysitter, granny and aunt?  I understand it gets very complicated.  However, approximately 50,000 young children are being cared for by childminders every day.  That estimated figure came from a Goodbody report Start Strong commissioned in 2011.  There are approximately 19,000 childminders, of whom only 257 notified the HSE of their existence.  The Child Care Act 1991 makes exemptions for the relative of a child or the spouse of a relative; anybody who is caring for children from one family in addition to their own children; and anybody caring for three or fewer preschool children of different families.  However, Childminding Ireland has advised that 53% of its childminders are caring for three children or fewer.</p><p>  I do not profess to have the answer to this situation and while I know these issues are always more complex than they first appear, I ask the Minister to look at best international practice.  In particular she should look at the model in Scotland where considerably more childminders are registered than is the case here.  There are 6,000 registered childminders in Scotland with a very similar population of 5.2 million compared with our 4.6 million.  The quality standards for childminders in Scotland are high.  Scotland has a system of registration rather than notification.  No childminder is exempt - everybody must register and then policy can decide what happens next.</p><p>  This is a complex issue and we have had a proud tradition of people being minded in the home and by relatives.  That tradition is one that people in communities value.  However, quality matters everywhere, including where children are being cared for by childminders in what are generally rather informal situations and small numbers.  As the Minister continues with her ambitious agenda of reform of child protection, I ask her to explore what is happening in other EU countries and elsewhere.  Her officials should look at what is happening in Scotland, a country of comparable size just across the water, and also what is happening just up the road in Northern Ireland where structures are in place.  At some point perhaps we can have a broader debate in this House.  It is not as clearcut or as easy as people like to make it sound at times, but it certainly merits proper discussion in the House at some point.</p><p>  I welcome the amendment and thank the Minister for bringing it before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700027#Z00200"><p>The State of the Nation's Children report, published last year, revealed Ireland has more than 1.1 million children, which at 25% of the total population is the highest percentage we have ever had and higher than in any other EU state.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, recently said that these children represent unprecedented potential for Ireland's economic future and that we must look after them.  Among the many positive trends noted in the report are that the number of newborn babies visited by a public health nurse within 48 hours of discharge from hospital rose to 84% for the first time.  In addition, the number of children on hospital waiting lists dropped by 45% in the four years to the end of 2012.  This is all good news.  However, for many years we have been appalled and distressed by the findings of various reports into child abuse in our society.  There has been a shameful catalogue of 17 major reports on child protection failings in Ireland in recent years.  We must not think these horrors just occurred in the distant past.  Child protection concerns have not suddenly gone away.  The sad reality is they probably never will.</p><p>  The Government is committed to transparency and honesty about the challenges in getting children's services right.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has kept her pledge to make a series of reforms, including strengthening the entitlement of children in care to aftercare services once they reach 18, establishing a new child and family support agency that will take responsibility for child protection away from the HSE and a nationwide consistency of approach in practice and implementation of guidelines on the handling of child-welfare and child-protection cases.  The aim of every reform has been the same - to improve children's chances of growing up strong in every respect.  It has become clear from various reports in recent years that have highlighted the scale and seriousness of child abuse in Ireland that there is a need to improve significantly Ireland's child protection and welfare services.</p><p>  Last year, the Government strengthened children's rights, chose a site for their new hospital and faced up to past failures to care for vulnerable children.  It was the year Ireland began to look a little more child centred.</p><p>The Bill amends section 17(2) of the Child Care Act 1991 and increases from eight to 29 days the period in respect of which a court may grant extensions of interim care orders in the absence of parental consent.  I welcome the clarity this will provide.  Currently, the HSE may seek a court order to take a child into its care for a maximum of eight days, without the consent of his or her parents.</p><p> Parents are the primary protectors of children and must, and will continue to be, supported in every possible way.  In the small minority of cases where parents are struggling and not meeting their children's basic needs, intervention by the State must be such that it is fully confident it will make the child's life better.  Protecting children and supporting families are two sides of the same coin.</p><p> This Government has consistently been about supporting families by reaffirming and underpinning early intervention and family support services to protect children in their homes.  However, when that is not possible, we must step in and protect the child.  It is never easy getting the balance right in the battle between parents and the HSE, and often within the HSE in terms of resources and best practice.  We must ensure children are listened to and that their welfare is paramount.  There are currently approximately 6,000 children in various forms of State care, many of whom have been in care for years.  The number of referrals for suspected child abuse or neglect has increased by 50% since 2006, placing the child protection system under significant pressure.  While there has been a big leap in this regard over the past two years, if we were to design a new system for children it would look nothing like the current system.</p><p> Many children in care are, and will remain, troubled.  The publication of the independent child death review group report into the deaths of children in State care shocked the nation.  It examined the decade from 2000 to 2010, during which time almost 200 children died in State care, or shortly after leaving it on reaching 18 years of age.  Most of these deaths were from unnatural causes such as homicide, suicide and accidents.  The report states that most of these children received an inadequate child protection service, that in some cases files were in complete disarray and that there was evidence that social services had closed files on some cases even though children were still at risk.  More shocking still were the individual stories of ruined childhoods and preventable deaths.</p><p> There is no doubt but that the State failed in the past to adequately care for some of the children in its care.  However, it is no solution to this problem to say that these children should have remained at home.  They only found themselves in State care in the first instance because they suffered appalling neglect or abuse at home.  A small minority of children will always require State intervention to protect them.  Their welfare will be served by placing stronger obligations on the State to meet their needs and not by leaving things as they are.</p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE have powers to intervene if there are reasonable grounds to believe there is an immediate and serious risk to the welfare, safety or health of any child.  The independent child death review group report demonstrated that while the short-term needs of the children identified in it had been met, in that they were taken into care because of a problem in their life at the time, this was not enough.  Inevitably, many children in care are, and will remain, troubled.  Appreciating the long-term difficulties that these children will face requires more action, which action is being taken by the Government through the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  If these young men and women are to navigate the turbulence that awaits them in a world away from State care, there must be a commitment to the provision of a full range of services.  According to the annual report of the Courts Service, the number of child care orders sought more than doubled last year.  It is a striking statistic that care orders for children at risk more than doubled in 2011, which is a rise of 119% on the 2010 figure.  This does not include emergency and interim care orders.  </p><p> Ireland has fewer children in care per thousand of population than does England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Australia, which indicates the change management within our health and family services is working.  We are also fortunate in this country in that more than 91% of children in care are in foster care, in a stable family setting.  Almost eight out of ten children placed in care last year were removed from their homes because of abuse, neglect and serious family problems.  One in five of the 2,218 children removed from their homes were taken into care because of chronic neglect.  According to figures from the State's child protection services, some 736 of admissions were as a result of emergency or non-voluntary care orders.  Every call to social workers on the child protection team reveals details of another human catastrophe, family breakdown, drug addiction, mental illness or child abuse.  It is normally a hidden world of families living on the edge of society, on the edge of the health system and, in extreme circumstances, on the edge of life.</p><p> Child welfare practitioners tell us that they come across two types parents, namely, those who are vulnerable and love their children but cannot care for them and those who do not.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will spend &euro;260 million on early intervention and child care services this year and every year.  However, this is not just about finances.  We need to continue with a greater appreciation of the need for collective thinking and collective responsibility and the potential to learn from the other person's perspective.  Children get lost when people step into defensive mode.  Following publication of the report of the independent child death review group, many people expressed incomprehension at the scale of the tragedies and missed opportunities and questioned how such gross failings could occur in a system designed to protect the welfare of vulnerable children.  We are moving forward and there are signs that these reforms are working.  Social workers in the area say there are no waiting lists for child protection and that every case brought to their attention is allocated a social worker and responded to.  There are many good news stories that will never make headlines but are profoundly benefiting many young people and families.</p><p> Protecting children is everyone's business.  We will only get this right if the State, non-government organisations, communities and families work together.  There must be greater accountability and better analysis of spending, with brave investment in policies such as early intervention, breakfast clubs, family support and early identification of speech and language difficulties that may not show immediate results, but will yield tenfold in a short space of time.  A great many changes have been put in train.  The Government is determined to get children's services right.  Upon taking up office, this Government immediately made significant inroads to improving Ireland's child welfare and protection systems with the appointment at Government level of a Minister and Department of Children and Young Affairs.  These are very important steps.  </p><p> We have seen momentum in reform of our child protection services, through, for example, the child and family support agency, the children first legislation, the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill, all of which mark significant progress in the direction of Ireland's commitment to improving child protection and welfare and set Ireland on course to meeting the recommendations set out by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2006.  We need laws that will protect children from harm and give them status as individuals.  Childhood is a precious time.  It does not last very long.  Children must be protected and their rights promoted to ensure that they are consistently treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  As stated by Geoffrey Shannon, no child should suffer to protect an institution or be made to live a life of unspeakable abuse and neglect to protect his or her abusive parents.  Children must be respected and the State empowered to adequately protect them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1175" speakername="Patrick Nulty" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700028#AA00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There is consensus across the House in relation to the legislation before us, the amendment of which has been long advocated by NGOs and community groups working directly with children.  However, I would like to repeat a couple of points which I have raised previously with the Minister in terms of a more broader reform of this legislation.  I am disappointed that in introducing amendments to the Bill today the Minister did not take the opportunity to make broader amendments, in particular amendment of section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 to provide that after care for young people leaving State care is a statutory right.  When in opposition, Fine Gael actively supported amendment of this section and tabled amendments in that regard.  I am disappointed that this Government, like the previous Administration, is unwilling to adopt a rights-based approach in relation to section 45.</p><p>  I believe the definition of homelessness in respect of children, as set out in section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, should also be amended.</p><p>Given that we now recognise homelessness is a much more dynamic and complex issue than when the 1991 Act was drafted, there is consensus among non-governmental agencies and advocates that the Act needs to be amended.</p><p> There is consensus that it is essential we make every effort to keep families together where we can.  The decision to take a child into care is incredibly complex and not taken lightly.  That said, all Deputies recognise from their experience the massive pressure put on families at present, particularly those in poverty whose living conditions are being made worse on a daily basis by the decisions taken by the Oireachtas on rent allowance, cuts to payments for family occasions and family income.  Although families are being put under massive pressure and strain, under no circumstance is this an excuse for a child to suffer; that is totally unacceptable.  However, we must recognise issues regarding children in care and the well-being of children are directly related to the type of society we have.  Unfortunately, since the Oireachtas was formed we have been building a more unequal society as a direct consequence of the votes taken in the House.  Despite the goodwill which exists with regard to children's rights and making Ireland a fine place in which to be a child, the reality of our economic and social policy is quite different.  We must examine the statistics on this.  Child poverty and inequality in society are increasing and we cannot decouple the issue of child protection from the broader questions of child poverty and social equality.</p><p> I welcome the Bill and the Minister's strong and sincere interest in the area, but we can go much further.  The commitment to provide a statutory right to after-care, which was a Fine Gael pre-election pledge, should be honoured.  It has not been to date.  We cannot hide behind legal advice from the Department as is happening in the case of the mobility allowance.  The argument is that if a statutory right is created, it will somehow place an onerous burden on the Exchequer.  If we believe in children's rights, then the very minimalist referendum we successfully passed last year goes nowhere near far enough.  I hope we can bring forward a more expansive and progressive Bill.  I commend the Minister on her commitment in the area and wish her well in her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700029#BB00200"><p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate and for the very constructive approach they have taken to the legislation.  As the Deputies opposite have stated, this is in the best interests of the child and is the right thing to do in terms of court procedures.  It will allow for proper time and attention for proper risk assessment, which is very important.  It is very clear from all of the reports we have received that assessments on best plans for children, making detailed plans to ensure they get the best services and understanding their problems accurately have been missing in some, but not all, cases.  All sides agreed that returning to court regularly does not help this.  The previous time allowed was 28 days, so this is positive legislation and will lead to better practice and better outcomes for children with regard to court procedures.</p><p><br />  Quite a number of Deputies raised the issue of legal costs, and I can only agree.  It is a shame we have such an adversarial legal system when it comes to decisions about children.  Last year, the total child care legal costs - not total HSE costs - were &#8364;31.1 million.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i> system has not been regulated properly and we need proper legislation to regulate guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  I am in discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on this and we will see action in the course of this year.  We will have more regulation and a clear outline of qualifications.  Guardian <i>ad litem</i> is a very important role to play in terms of representing the best interests of a child.</p><p><br />  Mr. Gordon Jeyes has taken quite a number of initiatives on legal services in the HSE and the approach to attendance in court by social workers.  A new template has been provided for social workers with regard to court practice, because we have had inconsistency throughout the country.  More training has been given to social workers.  A new guidance document has been issued, as has a learning digest to ensure staff throughout the country hear about legal opinions given in other court cases so that they know about the precedents which have been set.  This sounds very basic but we have not had it before, and it is aimed at avoiding repeat expenditure on similar legal services.</p><p><br />  The number of authorised legal service users has been considerably reduced, and this change is very important.  We have not had this type of control in terms of accessing expensive legal services.  A new group is working on this in child and family services within the HSE.  Mr. Jeyes has established a court working group to oversee all of this.  Work is under way to have a better approach.  The bottom line is the adversarial legal system, and this needs to change.  As Deputy Harris stated, we will move towards this with the referendum in the autumn on the courts.  We must develop the model which is most appropriate for Ireland.  Some people mentioned Scotland, but we need to change and move more towards a mediation and contact centres type of approach when making decisions on children.</p><p><br />  I had to give proper time to considering the issues because there was the question of changing what might be seen as fair procedures and family rights.  I received the final report with the views of the HSE on 22 October.  I went to Cabinet six weeks later and got agreement to draft legislation, which I did within a month and it went to the Seanad in February.  I have a heavy legislative schedule and all Departments have limited resources when it comes to drafting legislation.</p><p><br />  With regard to the other legislation about which Deputies have asked, I am happy to have consultation on them.  I will have a discussion tomorrow with some groups on the Children First legislation and I would be very happy to have consultations as requested.  Work has been developing on this legislation, as it has on the child and family support agency.  As Deputy Troy stated, it is significant legislation with well over 100 heads.  We have seen agencies being established in a hurry previously, most notably the HSE.  I want to do it properly.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, it involves the transfer of 4,000 staff.  The difference it will make is that it will be a dedicated agency with a sole focus.  The managers will be primarily focused on child and family services.  Previously, the same managers have had responsibility for accident and emergency services, immunisation, general nursing issues and hospital issues.  Now 17 managers will have a total focus on child and family services and there will be greater accountability.  There will be closer contact between the front line and management, and this is very important.  This is how to have a better service.  When we want to establish quality services, we put a key focus on the issues, and this is what we are doing with the establishment of the agency.  It is important to remember the High Court and the Supreme Court accepted the bona fides of our approach on the referendum.</p><p><br />  A number of points were made on knowing more about what is happening in court.  Dr. Carol Coulter will report, probably within the next month, on her initial findings on the court reporting survey.  This will be published on a dedicated website and will give us more information on what is happening in our courts with regard to child care, which will be a great help.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, will bring forward legislation to change the <i>in camera</i> rule.  While respecting the rights of children, privacy issues and ensuring children are not identified, the legislation will mean we will have more information about what happens in courts.  Inconsistencies exist throughout the country with regard to children in court and this should not be the case.  The first step is to identify the inconsistencies, as a number of Deputies have said, and understand precisely what is happening in the courts.</p><p> A number of other points were made in regard to the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I reassure Deputies that the HIQA reports are being acted upon.  I launched the new standards for child protection.  I welcome these HIQA reports and we will have far more of them.  We will have six or seven in the coming weeks on fostering.  The first report by HIQA on children protection in Carlow and Kilkenny is coming in the next few weeks.  I have no doubt those reports will show that there are improvements still to be made.  These services will not be changed overnight.  I have to look back at the position I inherited in terms of the lack of national systems, national standards, national data and national management.  However, we are moving to a situation where they are in place.  There are 11 new inspectors inspecting child care facilities.  We will have more inspection.  That is a key way forward in terms of improving standards.  It is the right thing to do and it is right that resources be put into it.  However, we must respond to those reports and arrive at a situation where we do not have the same findings as previously but that the position has improved and is improving.</p><p> A review group has gone into the north west.  The findings in regard to child protection there are unacceptable, some of which is historic but some of which is recent.  I put an independent expert in there to monitor what is happening to ensure the next time HIQA reports, we will see the necessary changes, particularly in regard to child protection.  It is clear from the HIQA reports on fostering for Louth, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Limerick that there are consistent and good services in place.  It is important to highlight the areas where work needs to be done but equally to acknowledge where progress has been made.  It is clear that the findings in Dublin north-west are not acceptable and will be dealt with.  I have met the management teams.  Part of the difficulty was that many of the care situations in which the children were placed were relative foster care.  Historically, there was an assumption that the same level of rigorous assessment was not required.  That is not the case.  Wherever a child is placed, we have to be absolutely certain that child protection is the key issue and concern.</p><p> I thank Deputies for raising a range of issues.  Deputy Simon Harris mentioned issues in regard to childminders.  The early years strategy group which I have initiated will examine the issue.  We are going to have a national policy on the early years.  Traditionally, Irish parents have taken a decision to recruit childminders themselves and the State has not interfered.  I would like to see a situation where childminders get more support.  How heavy the regulation needs to be is the question but the Deputy pointed out that at least 50,000 children are in that position.  It has traditionally been left to the private sphere.  If we got to a situation where childminders got the value of registering and the support from the local child care committees, that would be a good thing.  It is disappointing that so few have registered.  However, the early years group will examine the issue.</p><p> In regard to adoption, the Deputy made a point about the adoption of Irish children and the potential for children to get a second chance.  That is an important point.  The position on intercountry adoption is changing dramatically with families in many countries from where children were adopted, such as India and Russia, adopting children.  There was no practice of adoption within those countries, but that is becoming much more prevalent.  Therefore, the number of children available for intercountry adoption is changing.  That is a new context for Irish families to become aware of and understand.</p><p> Deputy Patrick Nulty asked about after-care.  There is a need for a review of the Child Care Acts.  I will review those.  I did not use the opportunity of the Bill before us to do that because it is a more comprehensive job than I was able to get done in the time available.  I hope to bring forward an amendment on child care and, if possible, under the child and family support agency Bill when it comes to the House.</p><p> I thank Deputies for their contributions and support for the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1036" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700030#CC01000"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  I am standing in for Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who is in Brussels to chair a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  I am pleased on his behalf to be able to present the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 to the House today.</p><p>  Over the years many interest groups have called for the introduction of spent convictions legislation in Ireland.  Their calls got a major leg-up when the Law Reform Commission published its landmark report on spent convictions in 2007.  That report was based on robust analysis and provided a solid platform from which the matter was catapulted onto the floor of this House on two occasions.  The report contained a draft Bill which has been before this House twice.  First, the former Minister of State, Barry Andrews, introduced it as a Private Members' Bill which was taken over by the then Government, but which lapsed on the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il.  In May 2011, Deputy Dara Calleary brought it forward as a Private Members' Bill in the form of the Spent Convictions Bill 2011.  While those Bills contained the flaws that had been identified in the draft produced by the Law Reform Commission, they had the effect of keeping the issue on the agenda, and when the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter replied to the Second Stage debate on Deputy Calleary's Bill on 7 June 2011, he announced that the Government would not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but indicated that the Government would bring forward its own Bill, without delay.  This we did with the publication of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 last May.</p><p>  In drafting this Bill during the latter part of 2011 and in early 2012, the Minister was keen to take on board the views of Members of the Oireachtas and the various interested parties outside these Houses.  I want to mention particularly on his behalf the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust, both of whom have produced considered and reasoned analyses of our proposals.  The Minister has reflected on the issues they have raised and, where possible, has taken them into account in the drafting of the Bill.  Deputies will be aware also that the Bill before this House has been amended in a number of significant respects in the other House to take on board the views expressed on the Bill as published.</p><p>  The Minister has come to the Bill with an open mind - open to the extent that he is convinced our criminal justice system must achieve a number of complementary objectives.</p><p>To clarify for Deputy Niall Collins, I stated at the outset that the Minister for Justice and Equality is chairing a Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels and consequently could not be present.</p></speech>

The law-abiding decent citizenry of this country deserves no less.  However, when a person has paid his or her debt to society, it is in the best interests of society and of the offender that the person is rehabilitated and reintegrated with all speed.  Any gap between so-called normal society and the offender is liable to be filled by more offending.  This must be avoided by a focus on youth diversion and by the use of non-custodial options, such as probation, community service and restorative justice.  Members will be aware that in his time in office, the Minister has made it a priority to resource non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment.   None of this is to state that the Government is not in favour of sending people to jail.  However, it believes that imprisonment has its place in a properly planned and resourced penal system, which is something it expects to see emerge from the work of the penal policy review group that is sitting at present.</p><p>  To digress for a moment, in this regard the Minister hopes the fines (amendment) Bill can be published and enacted this year in order that imprisonment for non-payment of fines can be consigned to history, which is where it belongs.  As I indicated earlier, jail should only be used where appropriate.  It is not the place for the person who cannot pay his or her television licence.  Other alternatives are needed to deal with the person who either cannot or will not pay a fine.  In the fines (amendment) Bill, alternatives such as attachment of earnings orders, community service and recovery of assets will be available to the courts where a person has failed to pay a fine, and of course, payment by instalments will be available to all.</p><p>  I will revert to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.  As I observed, Members must do everything in their power to assist people who fall foul of the law to integrate quickly back into society.  It is often said, somewhat tritely, that the best antidote to poverty is a job.  The best antidote to criminality is full and active participation in society and in so far as employment is an element of this, then a job and the discipline that goes with it is critically important.  This Bill has the capacity to assist people in securing and retaining employment.</p><p>  The discourse on the Law Reform Commission, LRC, report and on the Bills produced on foot of it, as well as on this Bill in the Seanad, has been marked by its maturity.  I look forward to the same considered approach in this House during the passage of the Bill and can assure Members on behalf of the Minister that although the Bill as published last May has been amended substantially, he is open to proposals that will improve it further and looks forward to the debate.  A unique feature of this legislation is that when it is compared with the original draft Bill by the Law Reform Commission, almost all of the changes are in the direction of making the Bill more liberal, if that is the right word, in respect of most of its key provisions.  As the Minister has stated previously, it is his strong view that if legislation like this is to have any meaningful impact, it must err on the side of generosity to the offender who has paid his or her debt to society, has left criminality behind and just wants to move on.  The provisions in this Bill are intended to discourage recidivism and support the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into society.</p><p>  This Bill has an important contribution to make to the reintegration of offenders and in my opinion it manages the delicate task of striking the right balance between the legitimate interests of society at large and the legitimate aspirations of the offender who wishes to get on with his or her life.  It is important to state the Bill is not a criminal or police records Bill and it does not change a person's criminal record in any way.  Instead, it focuses on what the offender is required to disclose if he or she is asked whether he or she has a criminal conviction when, for instance, he or she is applying for a job.  In that respect, it is a self-administered regime.  A person applies the law to his or her own circumstances, determines whether his or her convictions are spent and makes the necessary disclosure.  There is no application process, no lawyers are required and no expense needs to be incurred.  Having said that, the Minister is fully aware that to the lay person legislation can appear impenetrable, and to address this he has asked his officials to ensure that when the Act is commenced, explanatory material is available on the Department of Justice and Equality's website and elsewhere.</p><p>  The Bill will allow ex-offenders, after a certain period has elapsed since their sentences were imposed, to move on with their lives.  All Members know people, now in their 20s or 30s, who ran foul of the law for a relatively minor offence in their late teens or early 20s and who believe the spectre of their conviction looms over their efforts to move on with their lives.  While it is possible that in some instances people are overly concerned that the fact of a conviction will discourage would-be employers from recruiting them, the fact that people have such beliefs is something that Members, as legislators, must take seriously.  I should note in passing that there is an extensive and very generous spent convictions regime already in place for children, under section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  In this Bill, the Government proposes to put in place a similar, if somewhat more restrictive, regime for adults.  While the approach to the drafting of the Bill originally and to the amendments that have been made to it since its publication have all been in the direction of making it accessible to the greatest number of people, the Minister always has taken the view that there are certain convictions that can never become spent.  In particular, convictions for serious crimes, which are defined in the Bill as convictions for offences that fall to be tried by the Central Criminal Court, such as murder, manslaughter or rape, or sexual offences covered by provisions of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 2006, can never become spent.</p><p>  Spent convictions legislation has three key elements: the range of sentences that may become spent, the length of time a person must wait - without being convicted again - before the conviction is deemed spent, and the types of employment that are covered by the legislation.  I will turn first to the sentences that may become spent.  The Law Reform Commission report had recommended that only custodial sentences of six months or less could become spent.  Having considered the various views expressed by interested parties, the Minister has taken the view that six months is too short.  The Bill provides that sentences of up to 12 months may become spent.  Furthermore, in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the Minister brought forward an amendment to allow for suspended sentences of up to 24 months to become spent.  Returning to the 12-month threshold for custodial sentences that is provided in the Bill, this covers approximately 85% of all persons committed to prison each year.  The remaining 15% are by definition in prison for serious offences and are not covered by the legislation.</p><p>  The second key variable is the rehabilitation period - that is, the period during which the person must remain conviction-free in order for a conviction to become spent.  The LRC report provides for a relatively crude system whereby custodial sentences would attract a seven-year rehabilitation or waiting period and non-custodial sentences a period of five years.  In the period before and since the publication of the Bill last May, the Minister has considered the various viewpoints put forward suggesting these periods are too long.  The Bill as published provided for a more graduated approach while maintaining the seven- and five-year thresholds.  However, having considered the matter further, the Minister introduced an amendment in the Seanad that reduced the maximum rehabilitation periods to five years for a 12-month custodial sentence and to three years for a fine exceeding &euro;5,000.  He also made consequential changes to the other rehabilitation periods and simplified the categorisation of sentences.  The Minister is satisfied that the regime now before the House, with some rehabilitation periods as short as two years, is proportionate.</p><p>  The third variable is the range of employment in respect of which persons seeking work would be obliged to continue to disclose their convictions.  Needless to say, this is a highly complex area with a wide divergence of views as to what should be included or excluded.  I hope Members will agree that the Bill keeps the list of excluded employment types to the minimum.  These are predominantly those relating to the administration of justice and the security of the State.  The Bill, as amended in the Seanad, does not now list those employment types relating to children and vulnerable persons that are excluded but instead provides that any employment or activity that is included in the Schedule to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 is an excluded employment for the purposes of the Bill.  This linking of the two legislative items makes it clear that the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill cannot be used to circumvent the intentions of the aforementioned vetting Act.  Outside of that, most employment types are covered by the provisions of the legislation.  The LRC report had proposed that the entire civil and public service be excluded.</p><p> The Minister decided against that approach and has, instead, targeted the exclusions to sensitive employments in the Civil Service.  He has provided that other sensitive posts can be added by ministerial order, but only on request from the Public Appointments Service, a body that is recognised throughout the State for its reputation for integrity, probity and fairness.  I reiterate what the Minister said previously on this issue.  The public service, as a major employer should provide a lead to the rest of the country in an area of public policy such as this and we believe that this Bill excludes the smallest number of public service employments possible, consistent with our legitimate concerns regarding sensitive areas.  We have consciously decided against excluding swathes of the public service, as to do so would send out the wrong signal.  Finally on the employment issue, even in the case of excluded employments, we expect that responsible employers would not allow a minor conviction from a number of years ago to prevent them from taking on the best man or woman for the job where the conviction has no bearing on their capacity to do the job.  Responsible, fair employers have a duty to treat people fairly and with respect.  All things being equal, the best person for the job should get it.</p><p><br /> I refer to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1<b></b>is a standard provision containing the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  I draw the attention of Deputies, in particular, to the definition of &quot;excluded conviction&quot; as a conviction resulting in a jail sentence of more than one year; a conviction in respect of an offence reserved by law to be tried by the Central Criminal Court; and a conviction in respect of a sexual offence.  The custodial sentences covered by the legislation are listed.  Essentially, the legislation covers any sentence of one year or less, whether imposed as one sentence, as consecutive sentences, totalling one year or less or as concurrent sentences, the longer or longest of which is one year or less.  Non-custodial sentences are defined as including suspended sentences of up to two years, fines, probation orders, community service orders and restriction on movement orders.</p><p><b></b>Section 2 is a key section.  It sets out the circumstances in which a conviction may become spent once a conviction free period has elapsed.  The Bill is retrospective and applies to all convictions, regardless as to when they occurred.  No more than two convictions may become spent.  Section 2(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that a person must have complied fully with any sentence imposed to benefit from the scheme.  Section 2(2)(<i>e</i>) provides that where a person has more than two convictions, the first two qualifying convictions, in date order, are the two that can become spent.  Section 2(4) was added to the Bill in the Seanad.  It provides that where a person is convicted of more than one offence at one court sitting, this may be treated as one order of conviction for the purposes of the Bill.  This is intended to address the situation where a person is convicted of a number of related issues at one court sitting, for example, a number of road traffic offences or a number of public order offences relating to one incident.  Without section 2(4), the two-conviction limit could be used up or exceeded in one go and the Bill would be of no benefit to many of the people it is intended to assist.</p><p><br /> Section 3 deals with applicable relevant periods, that is, the time before a conviction can become spent.  The relevant periods are set out in tables under Schedule 2.  Part 1 of the schedule deals with custodial sentences and Part 2 with non-custodial sentences.  Section 3(3) provides that the relevant period commences on the effective date of conviction, which is defined in section 1 as the date the sentence becomes operative in most cases.</p><p><br /> Section 4<b></b>covers the situation where further convictions are incurred during the relevant period.  While the general position is that the relevant period must be conviction-free for the conviction to become spent, provision is made to allow for both a first and subsequent relevant conviction to become spent, where the subsequent conviction is incurred during the relevant period for the first conviction.  In this case, the relevant period applying is whichever expires later.  I refer to a relatively simple example where a person has a conviction with a three-year rehabilitation period and during that time, he or she is convicted again of an offence carrying a five-year rehabilitation period.  In this scenario, the rehabilitation period for the first conviction will be extended to the end of the five years applying to the second conviction and both will become spent together at that time.  The rule in section 2(2)(<i>e</i>) stating that no more than two convictions may be deemed spent continues to apply.</p><p><br /> Section 5<b></b>provides that, in general, a person who has a spent conviction may not be required to disclose it.  Section 6<b></b>deals with how spent convictions are to be treated in the course of court proceedings.  Section 6(1) provides that no evidence of a spent conviction is admissible in court proceedings.  It also provides that no question can be asked regarding a spent conviction and, if asked, need not be answered.  However, section 6(2) provides that a court may require the disclosure of a spent conviction, if justice demands it, but the court will take whatever steps it deems necessary to prevent or restrict publication.  Section 6(3) sets out a number of scenarios where a person may be required to disclose a spent conviction: in criminal proceedings, where he or she is a party or a witness; in adoption, guardianship or custody proceedings; in proceedings relating to the provision of accommodation, care, training, or schooling for a child or vulnerable adult; or where the person consents to the disclosure.</p><p><br /> Section 7<b></b>sets out limitations to the general effect.  Section 7(1) provides that a person must disclose a spent conviction to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under questioning following arrest, in an application relating to immigration or during an investigation under Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  Section 7(2) provides that a person convicted of insurance fraud must disclose such convictions when applying for insurance cover.  In the Bill, as drafted, this provision was much broader, requiring the person to disclose all convictions.  Section 7(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that the fact of a conviction being spent under the Bill does not cut across any disqualification, disability, prohibition or penalty otherwise imposed.  For example, if someone is convicted under the Companies Acts and receives a suspended sentence, he or she may also be disqualified as a company director.  This disqualification continues in force regardless of when the conviction becomes spent.</p><p><br /> Section 8<b></b>deals with information sought by another state.  The Bill only applies to Ireland and, therefore, a person may still be required to disclose convictions if the laws of the state making the request or in respect of which the request is made requires disclosure.  This section does no more than restate the law as it stands.  The Oireachtas cannot legislate extra-territorially to provide that our spent convictions regime will apply in other jurisdictions.  While the section does no more than restate the law, it is important and, regrettably, will result in some people not benefitting from the legislation as they may have hoped or expected.  Many of the people who contacted us as public representatives regarding this legislation intend to apply for visas, for example, to the United States.  They fear that the disclosure of a conviction will preclude them from getting a visa.  While I cannot comment on how the US authorities may deal with the disclosure of a conviction, people who are asked by another state to disclose all of their past convictions cannot rely on this Bill to avoid such disclosure.  The request for the information is made under the laws of the issuing country and it is not in our hands to legislate that requirement out of existence.  To avoid any confusion, if a person is asked by a foreign state to disclose all his or her convictions, in accordance with the laws of that state, he or she cannot hide a spent conviction and rely on this legislation to do so.</p><p><br /> Section 9<b></b>provides that certain employments are excluded under the legislation . &quot;Relevant work&quot; is defined in section 1 to cover work or activities involving children and vulnerable persons that require vetting under the vetting Act, those mainly civil and public service employments listed in Schedule 3, and additional employments that are exempted by ministerial order under section 9(2).  The subsection provides that the Minister may, by order, exclude other positions in the civil and public service at the request of the Public Appointments Service and having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and any other Minister with an interest in the particular post.</p><p><br /> We have taken a much more liberal approach to excluded employments than the LRC recommended and my sense from previous debates on the issue in this House and the Seanad is that there is support for this.  However, in a way, there is a more important issue that goes to the heart of this legislation.  A previous conviction, including one that resulted in the jailing of an individual, should not be a mark on that person for all time in all but the minority of serious cases.  Instead, we, as a society, should encourage the person to move on and integrate himself or herself into normal society.  Employers have a duty to consider all applicants for a job on their merits.  Where they apply for a job in an excluded employment, including in the public service, there is an onus on the employer to only take the fact of a conviction, where this is declared, into account, in so far as it calls into question the capacity of the person to carry out the job.   For example, there are a raft of minor convictions that one must disclose when applying for a position with children that have no bearing at all on one's fitness to do the job and a prospective employer should not allow its judgment to be jaundiced by the fact of a conviction that has no relevance.</p><p> Section 10 mirrors the provisions in section 9 in the case of licences.  Persons applying for certain licences must disclose their convictions.  These licences include public service vehicle, private security, taxi and firearms licences.  Since the Bill was published, driver testers have been added to the list at the request of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</p><p> Section 11 provides that where a person requests a copy of his or her criminal record from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the record is to be provided in two parts, with the spent convictions provided separately.  This means that in most cases, a person who is required to provide a copy of his or her criminal record will be able to produce a clean record, provided that, if convicted, his or her conviction or convictions are spent.  Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, are general provisions relating to expenses, transitional arrangements and the Short Title.</p><p> In framing this legislation, the Government has tried as far as possible to make it accessible to those who may benefit from its provisions.  This is a relatively straightforward, self-administered scheme.  Unlike in other jurisdictions, there is no application process, tribunal to attend, judge to satisfy, bureaucracy or cost.  This is not to say the Bill - no more than most legislation - is easily understood by the layperson, particularly where the person has more than one conviction.  Generally speaking, for most people with one conviction that is more than five years old, the conviction will be spent once the Act is commenced.  The position is more complex for people with multiple convictions, some of which may become spent under the legislation while others may not.  With this in mind, we have provided some worked examples in the appendix to the explanatory memorandum and officials in the Department of Justice and Equality are working on a frequently asked questions booklet that will be available on the Department's website once the Bill is enacted.  The booklet will set out the position in layman's terms for a range of circumstances in which people find themselves and will be added to over time as new scenarios emerge.</p><p> This is a landmark Bill, which is complementary to the National Vetting Bureau Act.  It allows Ireland to join the vast majority of its European Union partners in providing a mechanism whereby people can leave behind a past misdemeanour and move on with their lives.  It is not a panacea for every ill, nor does it claim to be, but a measured approach that will allow the vast majority of people with convictions to move on.  It is another step on the road to the development of a more mature approach to how we deal with crime generally.  As I stated, society and the individual both benefit from the earliest possible rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700033#FF00200"><p>I apologise again for missing the start of the Minister of State's contribution.  I was caught on the hop.</p><p>  This Bill aims to bring Ireland into line with most other European Union member states in providing that people convicted of offences can eventually leave their past behind them and get on with their lives.  This is a positive innovation which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports.  The Bill will help former offenders re-enter the workforce and facilitate offenders who have paid their debts to society and want to leave crime behind by encouraging them to do so.  However, a number of amendments are required to ensure the Bill is equitable and effective in its implementation.  </p><p>  The Bill builds on the seminal 2007 Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions, which put forward new ideas on how to deal with rehabilitating people who have paid their debt to society.  It is important that a clear rehabilitative route is open to people who have served their time, particularly those who committed misdemeanours in their youth.  The Bill aims to set out a process for such persons to normalise their lives and fully re-enter society.  Employment restores a person's self-esteem, enhances his or her status among family, friends and the wider community and reduces recidivism.  Securing employment, therefore, is a highly effective way of achieving the re-integration of convicted persons into society.  The Bill also provides for checks to ensure procedures are in place to oversee the future employment of former convicts in employment in which there is contact with children.  A balance must be struck between the justice system as a deterrent, the needs of society and the requirement for the rehabilitation of former convicts.</p><p>  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has proposed amendments to the Bill, of which the Government has accepted a small number.  My party will press to widen the application of the legislation to maximise its impact on rehabilitation.  The Bill brings Ireland into line with other European Union and Council of Europe member states.  Such legislation is a necessary element in ensuring that the commission of a criminal offence does not lead to permanent barriers to re-integration in society.  The current position has far-reaching consequences for those who are sentenced for criminal offences.  Individuals with even minor criminal convictions face ongoing restrictions and barriers to employment, training, education, travel and the obtaining of insurance, as well as in many other areas of life.  In view of the fact that the largest proportion of those who are sentenced by the courts receive short-term prison sentences, fines or community-based sanctions for non-violent offences, the absence of the possibility of having a criminal conviction expunged after a period of time has elapsed is a consequence that can be disproportionate.  It could also be argued that it constitutes additional punishment that lasts a lifetime.  Expunging a criminal conviction enables former offenders to re-enter the workforce and leave behind their criminal pasts.  The Bill is integral to the meaningful rehabilitation of offenders and to helping minor offenders to move on with their lives. </p><p>  Some aspects of the Bill have been criticised, in the first instance by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which broadly welcomed the publication of the legislation as a positive step towards supporting the rehabilitation of offenders.  In particular, the trust welcomed the decision to increase the maximum term of imprisonment eligible to become a spent conviction to 12 months and to shorten the rehabilitation periods to between three and seven years.  Despite these improvements on previous proposals, the trust argues that other issues must be resolved if we are to strike the correct balance between public safety and reducing barriers to reintegration for those who have moved on from offending behaviour.  According to the trust, while the decision to increase the maximum sentence to which the legislation will apply to 12 months marks an improvement on the six-month period originally proposed, the threshold for an eligible conviction should be extended to at least 30 months.  A review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 in the United Kingdom found that a limit of 30-month sentences was too restrictive.  The Government has indicated, however, that it is not willing to move on the issue.  </p><p>  Although the rehabilitative periods of between three and seven years constitute an improvement on the periods originally proposed, the Irish Penal Reform Trust argues that they should be shortened to a period of between two and four years.  The Government has amended the original Bill to reflect this suggestion.  While the length of the required period of rehabilitation must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence committed, it must not be of such duration as to be discouraging.  </p><p>  The Irish Human Rights Commission, in its submission on the Bill, has been significantly more critical.  It notes, for example, in its observations that the proposed legislation is &quot;overly restrictive and will not assist in re-integrating people convicted of minor offences back into society and employment&quot;.  The commission's key recommendations focus on the need to assess the benefits of the Bill in light of the impact of the vetting legislation passed by the Oireachtas, particularly in view of the scope of vetting being undertaken.</p><p>As an example, I refer to the scope of vetting undertaken when applying for a range of CAO courses.</p><p><br /> The commission also identified issues arising from the contradictions in this Bill and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  Dr. Maurice Manning, president of the commission, has stated:<blockquote>The grounds of discrimination in the Employment Equality and Equal Status legislation should be extended to include discrimination on the basis of a criminal conviction.  Without such a prohibition on discrimination the Spent Convictions Bill may be of little assistance in practice.  Such an anti-discrimination provision would enable the future Human Rights and Equality Commission to consider cases of discrimination based on a person's criminal record.</blockquote> I also received a submission from the Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC, which operates at 25 Cork Street, Dublin.  The Minister of State is probably aware that it is an independent law centre and charity that provides free legal advice and representation in the fields of housing and social welfare law to persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  It has detailed some of its observations and stated:<blockquote>The link between homelessness and crime cannot be ignored if either is going to be successfully tackled.  Current legislation in the form of sections 14 and 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act-----</blockquote></p></speech>

As the Minister of State, Deputy White, will be aware, Louth has steadily improved and grown, even matured, since the Good Friday agreement.  There is a new sense of optimism and belief and a new and justified sense of pride.  The town of Dundalk and the region have benefited from increases in tourism, self-belief and investment.  Since the inception of this Government, we have delivered world class businesses to the region, including PayPal, Prometric and eBay, to name just a few.  Tourism has increased with outstanding initiatives in County Louth and east County Meath.  The natural and unspoiled beauty of the Cooley Peninsula can rival any scenery in Ireland.</p><p>  These achievements have come about as a result of collective, sustained and selfless work on behalf of the people.  These laudable achievements are here to stay and we want to bring further benefits to the region.  However, they are under threat if the Minister does not address the issues that I am about to raise.</p><p>  I doubt that the Minister for Justice and Equality is aware of the problems because, if he was wise to the situation, he would never allow it to exist.  How many garda&iacute; and patrol cars does the Minister of State believe police the Omeath to Carlingford and Dromad to Hackballscross area, a distance of some 45 kilometres, at night?  In what is arguably the most volatile stretch of the Border, with 36 crossings rife with criminal and dissident activity, there is the princely sum of one patrol car and two garda&iacute;.  This is not acceptable.  The Dundalk area, including Blackrock, has a population of 45,000 people, but it is only covered by one uniform patrol car.  This is not acceptable either.</p><p>  The situation is reaching crisis level.  Please do not allow all of the good work to date to unravel.  In order to have an acceptable level of policing in the Dundalk area, personnel are required to replace retirees or other personnel who have been permanently transferred.  They number two inspectors, three sergeants and 26 garda&iacute;.  In addition, nine official vehicles have not been replaced, comprising three marked uniform patrol cars and six unmarked cars.</p><p>  These are savage reductions in resources at a time when they are vital.  We have all too recently seen the carnage and devastation that the unlawful activities of ruthless criminals can cause.  I do not wish to rake over the horrific death of my friend, Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe, but if ever there was a time to stand up and be counted, it is now.  Garda&iacute; are not asking the Minister to stand up, fight the criminals and keep the people of this State safe.  They are happy, proud and honoured to do that themselves.  However, they want the resources to do their job.  How many of these resources will the Minister deploy to Dundalk and when?  The proper resourcing of the Garda in Dundalk is a priority.  The Garda is dealing with murders, robberies, diesel laundering, criminal networks, paramilitaries, dissidents and drug dealers, not to mention an array of other crimes.</p><p>  I would appreciate clear and concise answers on what concrete actions the Minister will take.  Garda&iacute; do not need to hear that they are doing a tremendous job in stressful situations or that they are valued.  What they need to hear is commitment, followed by action.  I want the Minister of State to tell me and the people of County Louth what actions the Minister will take to overcome these issues.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the need for cutbacks and, in general, support some of them.  However, it is a different matter when people's security is at risk.  I ask the Minister of State for concrete answers and commitments that can be measured.  A commitment to extra garda&iacute;, sergeants and patrol cars is required.</p><p>  Just so that the Minister of State is aware, when I comment about these Border and security issues, I am not a jumped up, tie-wearing Deputy who is giving lip-service to his constituents.  I am a genuinely concerned citizen.  What is more, I have first-hand experience of these Border crossings and the activities that they afford.  I have stood at these crossings as a proud member of the Irish Defence Forces patrolling the Border during some of the worst times in our recent history, namely, the Troubles.  I know what it is to patrol these crossings in the dead of night.  I know the strain that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under trying to police these crossings against smuggling, laundering and paramilitaries.  It is imperative that extra resources be applied to the region.  If the Minister of State is in any doubt, I will take him to see each of these crossings, from Hackballscross to Omeath.</p><p>  If the Minister does not want to see these achievements unravel, which I am sure he does not, what steps will he take?  The people of County Louth deserve to know whether he is prepared to stand up and tackle these serious issues.  Is the Minister prepared to allow all of the success in the region to be lost?  He does not want the gangsters, smugglers, oil launders, criminals and dissidents to succeed.  On behalf of the people of Louth, I would appreciate his help.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister cannot be present to speak on this issue, as he is chairing a Justice and Home Affairs ministerial meeting in Brussels.  He has asked me to address this issue on his behalf.</p><p>  The House will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel and transport, throughout the organisation and that the Minister has no direct function in the matter.  This allocation of resources is constantly monitored by the Commissioner and his senior management in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on district, divisional and regional levels to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources.</p><p>  Garda numbers have been reducing due to the moratorium on recruitment introduced by the previous Government.  Its current strength is just under 13,400 members.  It is the Minister's objective, despite the significant financial issues facing the Government and the overall reduction in public service numbers, to ensure that Garda numbers will not fall below 13,000.  He will be introducing relevant proposals to the Cabinet in the coming weeks to give effect to this.</p><p>  Regarding Dundalk Garda district, which is in the Louth division, the Commissioner has informed the Minister that 149 garda&iacute;, 45 garda reserves and 23 civilian staff are assigned to it.  These resources are further augmented where necessary by a number of Garda national units, such as the Garda traffic unit, the Garda national drugs unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.  There are also 20 vehicles assigned to the district, which are augmented as appropriate and when required from divisional and regional resources.</p><p>  It goes without saying that no Minister would choose the appalling financial position in which we must operate.  In this context, the legacy that the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government bequeathed to the country included a series of expenditure ceilings for the justice sector that, if applied, would have resulted in devastating cuts in Garda services over which the Minister would not and could not have stood.  The Fianna F&aacute;il national recovery plan was unacceptable and would have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position.</p><p>Fortunately, the Minister was able to secure additional funding over the three year period 2012 to 2014 to ensure that the Garda Commissioner, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, could continue to deliver an effective policing service.</p><p> The Minister has already recorded in this House the additional resources that have been made available in the past three years.  Overall, had the Minister not obtained this additional finance, the Garda would have stood to lose an average of &euro;90 million each year under the Fianna F&aacute;il plan over the years 2012 to 2014.  In 2013 the Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to more than &euro;1.4 billion, is a substantial amount of money.  I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that this allocation will be spent in the most efficient and effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front­line services.  In that general context, a budget of &euro;5 million has been made available in 2013 for the purchase of additional Garda vehicles.  The modernisation of the Garda fleet is a crucial part of supporting policing operations throughout the State.</p><p> The Minister is determined that the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be used in the best, most effective and efficient way possible.  He is confident that the primary Garda objective of combating crime will continue to be achieved, and that despite the pressure on the public finances, it will be possible for the force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the prevention and detection of offences.</p></speech>

There are seven sergeants when there should be ten.  There are 41 garda&iacute; and another 26 are required.  The station is short nine cars.  Personnel are working ten-hour shifts in five units as per the new rostering arrangements.</p><p>  Blackrock has one sergeant and three garda&iacute; but no patrol car.  Omeath has three garda&iacute;.  Carlingford has one sergeant and four garda&iacute;.  Omeath and Carlingford have one car between them.  Hackballscross has one sergeant and four garda&iacute;.

The Minister, through me, wishes to assure the Deputy and the House that both he and the Garda Commissioner will ensure the maximum possible amount of resources are made available to the Garda and that optimal use is made of them.</p><p>  On the specific issues the Deputy raised, I am sure he will have an opportunity to raise them directly with the Minister in due course.

That is most disturbing and frustrating.  I will spell out in black and white what has occurred.  I have been in touch with various people in the Department and I have spoken to an official there but I am not satisfied as the issue has not been resolved.  It should not have arisen in the first place.  The case concerns an applicant for renewal of FIS for the fourth year.  The person's circumstances have not changed at all in the four years.  He got the payment in year one, year two and year three.  The logical conclusion is that he would get it in year 4 but the Department sent out an inspector and stopped the payment and it is now assessing his circumstances in a different way.  That is the kernel of the issue.</p><p><br />  The constituent was contacted by the Department in the context of the renewal of the family income supplement to say that his hours of employment amount to less than 38 hours per fortnight, which means the application was unsuccessful.  However, that is not the case.  The Department has calculated his hours by virtue of what he earns as opposed to the hours he works, based on the evidence provided by his employer.  His employer has given written confirmation of the fact that the individual concerned does work 20 hours per week.  Does the reply given to the Minister of State, Deputy White, take cognisance of the serious issue outlined?</p><p><br />  I have a copy of the employment details of the person concerned as filled out by his employer.  The individual works 20 hours per week at &#8364;10 per hour.  It is written in black and white.  The case concerns a renewal of the family income supplement payment for the fourth year and the circumstances are the same as they were in the previous three years.  It is interesting to note what the Department has done.  It has identified a monthly gross payment of &#8364;800 and an annual gross of &#8364;9,600.  The latter amount was divided by 52 to give a weekly gross of &#8364;184.61 and at &#8364;10 per hour it calculates that only 18.4 hours a week are being worked.  That is ridiculous and time-wasting.  It is causing financial hardship for a family that is doing its best to stay out of a poverty trap.  If the policy change had been widely publicised by the Department then it could be accepted, to an extent, but this is more sinister and it is also clandestine.  People are trying to weather the recession who are semi-welfare dependent, who do not need this type of bureaucratic nonsense to be thrown at them.  I have spoken to a number of officials and tabled parliamentary questions.  This week the person concerned has had to visit a social welfare inspector.  It is time-wasting and also a waste of money to put officials dealing with a case that does not need to be dealt with at all.  I would like to hear in the reply an indication from the Minister that this nonsense will be disposed of and that the <i>status quo</i> will be reinstated immediately.</p></speech>

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  The method of calculating FIS entitlement has not changed for either new or renewal claims.  At both new claim and renewal stages, the deciding officer will first check to ensure the minimum hours of employment of 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight are being consistently achieved.  Then the average assessable earnings are calculated.  To do these, the deciding officer uses the information supplied by the claimant and his or her employer on the claim form, recent payslips and-or a P60.</p><p>  Where, after this process is followed, the deciding officer remains in doubt as to the FIS entitlement, he or she will either request additional information from the claimant or the case may be referred for investigation to a social welfare inspector, SWI.  The SWI will make the necessary inquiries in order to clarify the position which may include interviewing both claimant and employer and inspection of any relevant records or documentation.</p><p>  The entitlement to and appropriate rate of FIS is calculated based on average assessable earnings plus any other income a family may have using the appropriate income limit threshold with regard to the number of qualified children.  To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full-time remunerative employment as an employee.  That is defined as employment which is expected to last for at least three months and paid work for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.</p><p>  Once FIS is granted it remains in payment for 52 weeks as long as the customer continues to be engaged in full-time remunerative employment as an employee.  However, if he or she ceases to be engaged in full-time remunerative employment as an employee, either through loss of employment or reduction of hours of employment, his or her entitlement to FIS ceases.  As with all other statutory decisions made by deciding officers of the Department, FIS claimants are offered the right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</p></speech>

It has changed, based on information supplied by the employer and by the applicant.  I wish to stress that this is the fourth year for the applicant.  In years one, two and three, the application was successful but the renewal application this year is unsuccessful.  Therefore, the assessment criteria or the formula has changed because the applicant's circumstances have not.</p><p><br />  I will read into the record again the documentation supplied to the Department by the employer.  The applicant works 20 hours per week, at &#8364;10 per hour but the some wizard in the Department has calculated, based on some unknown formula, that the applicant works 18.4 hours a week.  That is based on the Department's assessment.  A procedure has been introduced that changes the <i>status quo</i>.  If what was in the Minister of State's speech was correct, the application would have been unsuccessful to begin with.  </p><p><br />  I respectfully request that an official in the Department contacts me to say that this piece of nonsense will stop forthwith and that payment will be reinstated.  As I have outlined, new eligibility criteria or an assessment formula has been introduced that is different from the system that was used for the first three years, resulting in the suspension of the payment.</p><p><br />  The Minister of State represents the Department of Health and I acknowledge the fact that he has taken time out of his schedule to take this topical issue.  I ask that in communicating back to the Department of Social Protection that he requests that the Department would stop referring to people who use the system as &quot;customers&quot; - they are citizens of a republic.  I further ask the Minister of State to communicate my frustration to the Department of Social Protection because it is a complete waste of resources.  The applicant's circumstances have not changed but the system used by the Department of Social protection has changed.</p></speech>

I am advised, as I indicated earlier, that the method of calculating FIS entitlement has not changed for either new or renewal claims.  The Deputy has set out certain facts about a particular applicant's experience in this regard.  Obviously, I cannot deal with a specific case but there is an appeals mechanism in respect of people who make applications and are refused.  The Minister for Social Protection herself does not have an appellate role in this either.  There is a system in place which should be properly applied.  I have no reason to believe that it is not being properly applied but if there is an issue, there is an appeals mechanism to be invoked.  I really cannot put the matter any further than that.</p><p>  Since the Deputy raised the issue, I must say - I know I will get into trouble for saying this - that I share his view regarding the use of the word &quot;customer&quot;.</p></speech>

Baineann s&eacute; le p&aacute;ist&iacute; &oacute;ga a bhfuil b&aacute;s luath i nd&aacute;n d&oacute;ibh.</p><p>  There are 1,400 children in Ireland today with life-limiting conditions.  About 350 such children die each year and most of these young lives are limited to less than one year.  The majority of their parents would, of course, wish to care for their children at home.  The policy document on palliative care for children with life-limiting conditions was published in 2010 by the Department of Health.  On Monday of this week the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Children's Sunshine Home published a needs assessment for the HSE's Dublin mid-Leinster and Dublin north east areas.  This assessment was done to assist with the 2010 document's recommendation that a comprehensive children's palliative care service needs to operate within a co-operative model with close liaison between all stakeholders and relevant service providers.  Another key recommendation was to set up a national development committee for children's palliative care.  </p><p>  Respite is naturally a major part of care for many children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  With this in mind, the 2010 document recommended that a range of respite services should be developed for children with life-limiting conditions who have palliative care needs.  It further recommended that hospice-at-home teams would be developed by the HSE, that inpatient hospice beds specifically for respite should be developed as part of the children's palliative care service and that each HSE administrative area should plan and develop respite facilities for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  One of the priorities identified in the national policy was an audit of existing respite facilities and the Children's Sunshine Home and the Irish Hospice Foundation set out to identify existing services and to assess current and future need within the two administrative areas referred to earlier.  The assessment found that the provision of respite care services varies both between the two HSE administrative areas under study and that it is not available in either area to all families with a child with life-limiting illnesses.  Limited in-the-home and out-of-home services are provided, often supported by a combination of voluntary and statutory funding.  Some services are diagnosis dependent or age dependent, that is, confined to babies or very young children.  Families whose children do not have a definitive diagnosis may find access to respite particularly challenging and it is likely that the voluntary sector will continue to be the key service provider.  Currently, for example, the Jack and Jill Foundation provides respite services to 126 children in the two areas studied.  </p><p>  The assessment finds that the need for a palliative respite service for children with life-limiting conditions is projected to steadily grow over the period to 2021.  It also points out that a range of respite care programmes, developed in a structured and co-ordinated way, will be required to meet the needs of 411 children currently, and up to 478 children by 2021 in the areas studied.  Furthermore, it is estimated that the development and operation of the six forms of respite care outlined in the study will require a budget in excess of &euro;10 million per annum, rising to &euro;12 million plus by 2021, assuming a 70-30 ratio between in-the-home and out-of-home respite care.  It goes without saying that providing care of this nature to a child with a life-limiting condition at home can be physically and emotionally demanding.  </p><p>  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

He has given a very good account of the issue and the background to this important matter.</p><p>  In 2010, the Department of Health published Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland - a National Policy, which provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families across all care settings.</p><p>  Following on from the publication of the policy, the National Development Committee for Children's Palliative Care, NDC, was established by the HSE.  The committee is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation and includes a representative from the Department of Health.  The committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations.  The committee's emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement.</p><p>  The NDC agreed that an assessment should be undertaken in HSE south and HSE west to complete the national picture following an earlier exercise in two HSE regions, Dublin north east and Dublin mid-Leinster, which examined respite care for children with life-limiting conditions.  The Irish Hospice Foundation and LauraLynn, Ireland's children's hospice, in partnership with the HSE published the report, entitled Respite Services for Children with Life-limiting Conditions and their Families in Ireland - A Needs Assessment, on 4 March 2013.  The report provides a national overview of service provision and future respite requirements as part of a palliative care service for children in Ireland.</p><p>  The report identifies some of the challenges involved in planning for respite care such as difficulties with definitions and terminology; determining the numbers of children who require respite care and the numbers currently availing of services; the extent and location of current service provision; and the perhaps at times unnecessary distinction between disability services and palliative care.  As the report highlights, most families prefer to be able to care for their child at home.  In order to be able to do so, adequate support systems need to be in place and this includes the availability of a high standard of respite care provided both in the child's home and also out-of-home, in an appropriate residential setting or respite unit.  The report provides an indication of what is currently available and what is required at a national level to provide for the respite needs of children and families.  The report acknowledges that a significant level of respite support is already being provided but access is inconsistent around the country and can be dependent, as Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l pointed out, on diagnosis and-or geographic location.</p><p>  The report will assist the Department of Health and the NDC in planning for the respite needs of children with life-limiting conditions and is a useful contribution to filling in the gaps in the understanding and knowledge of the way respite services for children are organised.  A number of the recommendations in the report are already under consideration by the NDC and the committee has undertaken to examine all of the recommendations through its ongoing programme of work.</p><p>  My Department will be maintaining a close liaison with the HSE and the NDC in this context.</p></speech>

When we embarked on the course of adapting the working day of the D&aacute;il to include Topical Issues, very strong commitments were given that we would have the responsible Ministers here.  I commend the Minister of State on the job he has done in the Department of Health but I have listened for many years to very strong statements being made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, about palliative care and services for children in need in particular.  Nothing in the report and the response given today would give me or any of the hundreds of parents across the country reason to be confident that the Government will be in a position to deliver the required services.  I am talking about the critical respite area, which allows parents who are caring for children 24 hours a day, seven days a week, some opportunity to take time out or recharge their batteries before returning to the loving task of caring for a child who will not see adulthood.</p><p>  The moneys involved and identified in the report are substantial but there is no indication, either from the Minister of State or in the report provided to him, that the Government is prepared to provide any additional funding.  We have all engaged with organisations such as LauraLynn and, in particular, the Jack and Jill Foundation, and we know they are absolutely cash-starved.  Mr. Jonathan Irwin is in his seventies and is currently quite ill but he is a pioneer, stepping into the role of the State in providing services that would not otherwise be provided for hundreds of children around the country.  It behoves all of us in this House to move mountains to ensure that the funding necessary to support these families is found somewhere in an urgent fashion.</p></speech>

The report is very useful and important and I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  I indicated to the House earlier that a number of the recommendations were already under consideration by the national development committee, which has undertaken to examine all the recommendations.  The report was published three days ago and perhaps it would behove all of us to take a little time to consider the various recommendations.</p><p>  Nobody can disagree with the general thrust of the Deputy's comments on the importance of maintaining - and, if possible, increasing and enhancing - the level of funding and support, ensuring that services are standardised nationwide.  That is one of the issues coming from the report.  There are other recommendations which are extremely important and close attention will be paid to them.  I have no doubt that the Department and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will follow through.  It is an important addition to the stock of knowledge, information and expertise available in this important area.</p><p>  I assert again that the Government, the Department of Health and the Minister, in particular, have made every effort to maintain an adequate level of funding for this important area at a time of extremely difficult financial constraint.  That has borne fruit.</p></speech>

We have had a number of outstanding initiatives in this regard, including the rehabilitation and support project, RASP, in Darndale-Belcamp; the Kilbarrack Coast community programme in Kilbarrack-Foxfield; and the Howth peninsula drugs awareness group, HPDAG, which was led for many years with great diligence by Captain Brian Doyle of Howth.  In 2012, funding ceased for the HPDAG, which had operated for almost a decade.  There is now clearly a strong need for a new education and prevention project to address the gap left by the ending of the earlier drug prevention programme. In addition, the &euro;110,000 in funding allocated to the south-east Fingal catchment area as part of the HPDAG programme remains unused.  Howth Sutton Community Council is the umbrella group for up to 40 affiliated organisations in the Howth peninsula area.  The chairman, Mr. Charles Sargent, and his colleagues, Mr. Raymond Sexton and Mr. Niall Watters, recently briefed public representatives about a proposal they have submitted to the Department of Health and the local Dublin north east drugs task force, which advocates a south-east Fingal drugs and alcohol project.  Their aim is to establish, under the community council, a community-based drugs and alcohol abuse prevention and education programme for the four parishes.</p><p>  Howth Sutton Community Council, through the work of lead researcher Mr. Watters, has provided a detailed and extensive submission which identifies a clear need in the areas referred to for a prevention and information programme tailored to drug and alcohol problems.  Mr. Watters notes that there was a 4% increase in the population of the Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle electoral area between the 2006 census and the 2011 census, with a 19% increase in the Baldoyle area because of the expansion of the north fringe.  There are worrying statistics provided in the Watters report on alcohol and drug prevalence in the north-east region, which underlines the need to provide the programme I advocate today.</p><p>  The most recent 2010 and 2011 National Advisory Committee on Drugs survey on drug use in Ireland reported that in the north Dublin region, 35% of all respondents aged between 15 and 64 reported taking illegal drugs.  In ongoing national surveys, the figure for lifetime use of illegal drugs is generally higher in the north Dublin region than nationally and, significantly, alcohol is also being used by 80% to 90% of the people across the 15 to 64 age group.  Research undertaken by the Health Research Board indicates that in 2010, 33 people were referred for problem alcohol and drug use in the Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle catchment area.</p><p>  Howth Sutton Community Council has identified a series of service needs in the region, where there is currently a significant gap.  These include a structured education and prevention programme, aimed in particular at high-risk young people; enhanced family support services; a concentration on supply control, especially through enhanced co-operation between the local community and the Garda; and anti-addiction, rehabilitation and support measures, including counselling and training.  The proposal sets out clear principles of strict governance under the community council and Companies Acts with a projected budget of &euro;80,000.  It would be based alongside the youth project in the Baldoyle area.  This is a vital project that will provide critical drug and alcohol education and prevention programmes at minimal cost to the State.  It is also important for the Howth-Sutton peninsula that funding is provided for this key service.</p><p>  The Minister of State may remember that in the 1980s and 1990s, part of the vulnerability of Howth, Sutton and neighbouring parishes was our strong maritime connection.  At the time there were allegations that part of the problem of supply was the issue of maritime vigilance and surveillance, and over recent decades monitoring has been much more successful.  There is a particular historical vulnerability in the region in question so I urge the Minister of State to fund and support the proposal by Howth Sutton Community Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700037#KK00400"><p>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising the matter.  On 7 January, my Department received an application from Howth Sutton Community Council for funding to establish a drug and alcohol prevention project in south-east Fingal, which would serve communities in Baldoyle, Bayside, Sutton and Howth.  The council wishes to set up a project to address a gap in service provision that has arisen as a result of the closure in June 2012 of a community-based drugs project serving the Howth-Sutton peninsula.  Funding for the latter project was withdrawn by the HSE as a result of deficits with regard to governance, financial control and accountability that emerged during an audit of the project.</p><p>  The need for support within communities for education on prevention for young people and support for families has been identified by Howth Sutton Community Council on the basis of findings from a strategic evaluation of projects conducted by the Dublin north east local drugs task force in late 2011, as indicated by the Deputy.  This evaluation included the former project serving the Howth-Sutton peninsula.</p><p>Supplementary research undertaken with local schools and community actors in late 2012 also informed the research findings.</p><p> The key recommendations arising from the research are that a project be developed in partnership with existing community and statutory agencies, which would work with schools and youth and family support groups to develop local strategies for substance misuse education and prevention.  The proposal envisages that the project would initially focus on prevention, education and family support, with expansion into client case management to be undertaken in the medium term if resources become available.  The cost of the project, which would involve hiring a co-ordinator and a project worker, is estimated at &euro;79,000 per annum.</p><p> As the Deputy will be aware, drugs task forces play a key role in assessing the nature of the drug problem in their areas and co-ordinating action at local level so that there is a targeted response to the drug problem in local communities.  Some &euro;29.95 million has been allocated to the drugs initiative in 2013.  The majority of this contributes to the running of community-based drugs projects supported by local and regional drugs task forces.  This includes an allocation of &euro;988,234 to Dublin North East Drugs Task Force, which has responsibility for tackling the drug problem in the south-east Fingal area.</p><p> It is a matter for each drugs task force to decide which projects to support based on agreed priorities for its area within the overall budget available to it.  The allocation to Dublin North East Drugs Task Force was determined on the basis of the community-based drugs projects it recommended for funding in 2013.</p><p> I have been in contact with Howth-Sutton Community Council.  I wrote to Mr. Sargent in January 2013 and have advised the council to submit its proposal to Dublin North East Drugs Task Force for consideration.  I have indicated in the letter that my Department will consider the proposal if it has been recommended by the task force.  At this stage, the drugs task forces have been advised of their allocations for 2013.  The funding of any additional measures is contingent upon the resources available to me for the year.</p></speech>

In other words, could there not be additional resources given that the &euro;110,000 for 2012 and which would have been spent on the old project was not spent?  I presume the Department was able to return the money to the Exchequer.  Is the bottom line that the Minister of State will not have funding if he gets the recommendation?</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the audit of the earlier project.  Does he agree that there is an ongoing need for the programme of prevention of drug and alcohol abuse, as outlined by Howth-Sutton Community Council and as strongly indicated in the detailed research which was excellently put together by Mr. Niall Waters?  Does the Minister of State accept that there is a clear need, as outlined in the paper he would have read?  Before making any final decision, will he liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children?  Those Departments, through the local schools and the youth project being run in conjunction with the relevant authorities in Swords, and the outstanding garda&iacute; in Raheny and Howth, would also be very supportive of the proposal.</p><p>  It is very interesting that the proposal includes a reference to alcohol.  When will the Government bring forward the sale of alcohol Bill?  What has the Minister of State decided on the question of having a minimum alcohol price?  Can we expect an announcement on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-07a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030700038#LL00300"><p>In my letter to Mr. Sargent in January, I indicated my stance on the proposal.  In so far as I understand the proposal, as it has been explained by the Deputy and as I have seen in the correspondence, I believe it has considerable merit on the face of it.  However, I will not pre-empt any decision we might be in a position to make once a decision is made by the drugs task force.  It is a matter in the first instance for the local drugs task force to decide to consider the proposal.  As the Deputy will appreciate, we rely very considerably on the local drugs task forces, which have local knowledge owing to their being embedded in their communities.  For many years, the value of local drugs task forces has been the local and community connection.  I rely and must rely on their expertise and sense of community priorities, as does the Department.  I want to see what the local drugs task force has to say about this in the first instance before indicating anything further, other than to say that I will consider the matter when it arises.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have an annual allocation for the drugs strategy.  The great bulk of it goes to local and regional drugs task forces.  The amount of money is finite.  I, no more than any other Minister, cannot create resources where they do not exist but I am very strongly committed to our ongoing work in the area of drugs misuse, particularly the community dimension.  I will certainly do anything I can do to enhance and assist the work of local projects through the local drugs task forces.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about alcohol.  The T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach have indicated to the House that work in respect of the proposals for a public health (alcohol) Bill has been progressing.  I have had a number of meetings with ministerial colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  There was a lengthy discussion on this issue at a meeting of the Cabinet committee on social policy a couple of weeks ago.  Work is progressing very well.  As a relatively new Minister of State, I am learning that it is not always best to specify a particular date by which something will happen because inevitably slippages occur in the management of Government business.  I am hopeful, however, that we can bring the finalised proposals for a decision to the Cabinet during March.  If this does not occur in March, it should happen at some time early in April.</p><p>  The question of a minimum alcohol price will feature prominently in the proposals and, I hope, the decisions to be made by the Government.</p></speech>

I would like a direct reply to that question.  It has been given wide coverage in newspapers.  If it is the case, where did the &euro;750,000 figure come from, especially for agricultural land?  There was speculation in the media that the figure was provided by Teagasc.  Is that the case and can the Minister give a breakdown of the figure?</p><p>  It might help if the Minister could provide some reassurance to some of his coalition partners in Fine Gael that it is not his intention to create a communist state, about which some of them seem to be alarmed.  That might be a bit over the top, even for the Minister.  It indicates, however, the serious alarm among farmers and the self-employed about the Minister's plans.  The Minister must be clear today because there has been a lot of contradictory comment from Government Deputies and Ministers on this.  Will he inform the House that he will not include productive assets for the self-employed?  There is only one way to assess people's income and that is to look at the real income.</p></speech>

It is part of the convention of collective Cabinet responsibility that I must bring proposals to that group in the first instance for their consideration.  It would be improper of me to speculate in advance of Cabinet colleagues having a chance to consider the memorandum.</p><p>  This is an important issue and the timetabling difficulties I mentioned arise because of Easter and St. Patrick's week, and the fact Ministers will be travelling.  I am travelling tomorrow myself for nine days and that means I will not be at the next Cabinet meeting, there will not be a Cabinet meeting after St. Patrick's Day and then it is Easter.  That is part of the delay at present and I regret that in advance of the Cabinet discussing the matter, I cannot share it with the D&aacute;il.  In due course, as soon as we have a decision about the memorandum, I will bring the details into the public domain and we can have a discussion consequently.  Legislation will be needed no matter form the decision takes.</p></speech>

Does the Minister stand by that statement?  If he does, can he outline how these people manipulated their incomes?  If manipulation was going on, Fianna F&aacute;il would have no problem dealing with it.  It is unacceptable, however, that the Minister is now attaching a notional income to a productive asset that people use to derive an income, often a very modest one.  The average farm income in 2011, which was a very good year, was &euro;24,000.</p></speech>

These negotiations took place against a backdrop of continuing significant difficulties in the finances of the State.</p><p>  The public service trade unions are currently considering the outcome of these negotiations.

The position as set out in the Labour Relations Commission proposals is that teachers will be expected to cover for the first day only of certified sick absences so substitution will continue to be provided for all subsequent days of certified sick absences.  It is crucial to keep in mind the context in which these negotiations take place.  The State is still in a very serious financial and budgetary situation.  Whatever information the Deputy was given in good faith by someone else, the nature of these things is that clarification is part and parcel of how the LRC proposals will affect the broad public sector.

Is he aware that there are over 2,000 families in Down Syndrome Ireland and most of their children go to either mainstream primary or second level schools?  At present, a child with Down's syndrome is put into one of two categories: the mild learning disability or moderate learning disability.  A score of 49 or less for moderate learning disability will give one the resource hours.  Many parents tell me that when they go to the assessments they hope their child will score 49 or less because they know then they will get the resource hours.  Why does a child with Down's syndrome not automatically qualify for resource hours or a special needs assistant to help him or her navigate through the mainstream school?  Why must such children fail assessments in order to have a chance of getting the resources they require?  Why is a child with Down's syndrome not rewarded for his or her achievements by providing him or her with all the necessary resources and assistance to build on and nurture these achievements?  Finally, why is a child with Down's syndrome is not afforded every opportunity to reach his or her full potential and be at his or her best?</p></speech>

Schools have provision, under the GAM, to allocate and target resources to those children most in need of those resources and also to make the best use of those resources.  Although not prescriptive, children with mild GLD will generally receive approximately 2.5 teaching hours per week under the GAM allocation.  This provision is reflective of the resource teaching support which is provided for children with mild GLD prior to the introduction of the GAM.</p><p>  Schools also have a discretion to supplement teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils with greatest need and where a child with Down's syndrome also had a diagnosis of moderate general learning disability and thus received an additional low incidence resource teaching allocation of 3.5 hours, the difference between that provided under the GAM, if the child was receiving 2.5 hours, would be one hour.  However, the difference could be less if the school was supplementing teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils.</p><p>  Can I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to complete the questions?</p></speech>

These schools and classes were designated as catering for a specific category of disability, but the report of the Special Education Review Committee, SERC, of 1993 made a wide range of recommendations on the level of resources that should be allocated to cater for children in different categories of special needs.  The SERC report still provides much of the basis which underpins the current policy and provision.</p><p>  The disability category set out in the SERC report formed the basis of resource allocations.  That report did not identify Down's syndrome as a particular disability category for the allocation of resources and consideration of the categories of disability to be catered for under the GAM based on high incidence or less severe disability was centred mainly on the category of mild general learning disability detailed in the SERC report.  I refer the Deputy then to my original reply.</p></speech>

In this day and age, that is not acceptable.  The rights of children with Down's syndrome should be stronger.  Also, as the Minister of State will be aware, the GAM is not one-to-one provision.</p><p>  I take the Minister of State's point about moderate general learning disability because most parents are reasonably happy about this, but my complaint and that of parents is that the rest of the children with Down's syndrome, particularly the ones who are &quot;good&quot;, have more potential to develop if they are given the supports and fantastic work can be done with them.  Also, we feel strongly that a child with Down's syndrome in mainstream school will regress if he or she does not get such supports.</p><p>  The Minister of State will be aware that there are great examples of good practice in the quality of services for Down's syndrome but we need to develop them further and we need to include the right.  I ask the Minister of State to prioritise this issue over the next 12 months.  It is in the programme for Government.  I accept we are in difficult times, but children with disabilities should always be given priority.</p></speech>

For months after the academic year started, students and families throughout the country were struggling to try to keep their children in college.  There were families who were waiting on the special rate of maintenance grant of over &euro;6,000 who are dependent entirely on social welfare who had to try to keep their child in accommodation and in maintenance in college while they waited, in many instances until early in the new year, to receive their grant.</p><p>  Through the freedom of information request to which I referred in the question, my party has found out that during that period the Minister met the City of Dublin VEC, the body in charge of SUSI, on one occasion only.  Today, the Minister stated that normal protocol is that he engages through his officials.  He had no problem in coming up front when he established SUSI and enlightening us all on how it would be a key initiative within the Department.  The Minister was taking political leadership of it then.  However, there was no sign - the evidence now points this out and the Minister admitted it here today as well - of him taking that political leadership in the crisis when thousands of students were not getting their grants as a result of the failure of the Minister's project.  It is most disappointing.</p><p>  I would ask the Minister to at least ensure that he does not repeat those mistakes.  Unfortunately, having listened to his earlier response on the capital assets test, the Minister is talking about a report on how grants will be assessed next year not coming before Cabinet until, perhaps, Easter.  He also referred to legislation being required to implement that and to what will happen in terms of getting grants processed properly for next year.  This is also unacceptable.</p><p>  I would ask the Minister one question.  Why, when there was such a crisis in the student grant submission system, did the Minister not take control personally and show the leadership required to get it addressed?  It was not resolved, with many students waiting until the new year to be paid.</p></speech>

The implementation group comprises officials from the Department, the chief executive officer of the CDVEC and senior SUSI personnel, and I get regular reports after they meet.  I would never attempt to chair that meeting or project-manage that group myself.</p><p>  However, 13 group meetings took place between 16 November 2011 and 24 September 2012.  In addition 19 meetings took place on a weekly basis between 15 October 2012 and 3 March 2013.  Meetings were held on a monthly basis prior to the October 2012 process.  These project-group meetings are continuing to be held on a weekly basis.  SUSI was a national agency processing in an unsatisfactory way, as I have said, and we will learn from that.  In terms of the impact on families across the country, comparing like with like - in other words where we were in terms of the processing of the 66 various bodies that processed heretofore and SUSI -  SUSI was approximately a week ahead in the relative comparisons.  The main difference was that we now had one centralised figure, whereas previously we had 66 figures.  There were difficulties for families in the past, which was one of the reasons SUSI was established.  The Deputy's fellow county-man, the president of the USI, will tell him that from his knowledge the previous situation was unsatisfactory.  Owing to the distress being caused for some families, which I openly admit, we made an additional &euro;3 million available through the HEA for the welfare officers in all the third level offices to address the kinds of hardship problems the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

When we tabled a Private Members' motion highlighting the issue, the Minister's initial reply was that he would have a conversation with SUSI on foot of this Legislature stating publicly and democratically that we had a problem.  That problem was clearly highlighted in advance of that, but it was only after it was brought to the floor of the House that the Minister started to deal with it.  We need to stop repeating this fallacy that SUSI was a week ahead or somehow comparable to what happened in the past.</p></speech>

It will undoubtedly have a very serious impact on the decisions being made by new graduates considering a career in career guidance.  This profession was built up over many years to the point where we had 700 full-time career-guidance posts.  We had guidance counsellors fully qualified and trained to provide counselling services as well as career-guidance services.  Unless the Minister reverses his approach, we will see the decimation of that profession in coming years.  I have no doubt we will see an effect in the numbers taking such third level courses.  I hope we get those figures quickly.</p><p>I urge the Minister to use those figures when available to reassess where he is going in this regard.

It is also a problem at primary and second level.  Our system is partially computerised and partially manual.  We are dependent on the individual institutions returning data to us.  In my view, this has not been satisfactory.  I propose to take another look at this in the context of reform of the third level sector but it will also need to be done in the primary and second level sectors.  For example, in response to a query to post-primary schools, the free voluntary sector, in regard to whether they operated book lending programmes, the response was poor.  In terms of the information we can get for the Deputy, we are dependent on the active co-operation of the relevant institutions.  I am not satisfied with the speed of the reply either.</p><p><br />  The Deputy's reference to the decimation of the profession of guidance counsellors is somewhat extreme.  The fact that guidance counsellors have been mainstreamed and are subject to redeployment by the principal, as distinct from their being <i>ex quota</i>, has caused disquiet among some guidance counsellors.  There has also been a reaction to the recent health document published by myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, which provides that the well-being of the school population, including the mental health of students, some of whom may ultimately be suicidal, is the concern of the entire school community and not only guidance counsellors.  This appears to be viewed by some guidance counsellors as an intrusion into their professional area.  It is our view - I strongly support the group's conclusions - that the well-being of students is of concern to everybody.  This matter was raised during Leaders' Questions this morning.</p></speech>

This is one of the highest grades given to any Department and reflects well on the overall performance of our education system.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has advised that an additional investment of up to &euro;235 million per annum across the education and health sectors would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  In the Department's view, the level of investment required could be greater.  While the Minister has done his best to date to preserve overall funding for special education, it has not been possible to identify additional resources from within the education budget to cover this cost.</p><p>  The NCSE has been asked to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special needs.  This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including prioritising access of children with special needs to an individual education plan.</p></reply>

We all recognise that children with special educational needs rely heavily on the State.  Supports appropriately provided and administered early to improve their educational experience and outcomes are vital.  I acknowledge that there is an enormous cost involved in the provision of SNA support.  However, current demand for such support is phenomenal and growing.  The proposed cap will put the service under severe pressure.  I accept that we do not have an endless supply of money but special needs children are more vulnerable than the average child.  In the past, many of these children were abandoned.  They did not receive the type of support available to others during the past number of years.  It is now recognised that with the right supports these children can flourish and become a positive part of mainstream society, which previously was not acknowledged.</p><p>  I understand full implementation of the EPSEN Act will cost the State more.  However, as has been stated many times, our top priority must be to assist those most in need.  There is no doubt but that within the education system special needs children are the most dependent on the State.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, the NCSE has been tasked with the provision of policy advice on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports required to be allocated in order to achieve as much as possible of EPSEN within the confines of the parcel of funding available in that regard.  The Government will endeavour to ensure as much as possible of it is implemented.</p><p>  The internal assessment is that the cost could be higher than the figure which I mentioned earlier.  We will do our best to implement EPSEN within current constraints.</p></speech>

While they did not play the only role in a school, they had a key role in liaising with students with particular difficulties with regard to mental health or bullying.  The Minister is absolutely correct that everyone in the school needs to play their role, and it is important we support principals and teachers and provide training for them, but taking these measures at the same time as removing &euro;32 million funding from those specifically trained does not add up or makes sense.  The Minister is taking a very wrong approach.  I ask the Minister to respond to this and explain how he can match this approach with his aim to try to improve child and adolescent mental health and deal with bullying.</p></speech>

Given the state of where we are, and what we now know with regard to the whole school environment and the health required for it, the approach must be to make it everybody's concern in the first instance.  The Deputy spoke about the guidelines for mental health promotion, and these suggest three states of intervention, namely, a whole school approach to begin with; then identifying those who might be at risk and need support; and then possibly taking them out of the ambience of the school itself to get detailed professional assistance appropriate to the condition in which they find themselves.  This skill may not necessarily rest with the guidance counsellor in the school.  This is a more integrated and holistic way of approaching it and it mobilises existing resources in a different way to the situation previously.  Having heard the presentation and listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and others I am convinced that given the situation we are in it is a better way to go rather than working back to the old system of guidance counsellors.</p></speech>

The school has a great deal of pressure at present from social problems and social issues.  The Minister's hopes to develop a more holistic approach in all schools is good and I agree if every teacher is focused in the right area, and is copped on as to how to deal with these issues, it would definitely be progressive, but it does not change the fact that needs exist now and the cuts are deeply affecting schools.  Until the Minister reaches the situation he would like to have, the schools need the support he has taken away from them, which is a cut of approximately 30%.</p></speech>

This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the SPHE curriculum, developing the whole school guidance plan, adopting the NEPS continuum of support, and building effective interagency relationships.</p><p>  With regard to guidance, the representative organisations for school principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This was a very positive and proactive response to a difficult budget decision.</p><p>  Initial findings of a recent comprehensive survey by the National Centre for Guidance in Education on schools provision for guidance suggests that even through there has been a cut in the allocation schools continue to prioritise the guidance programme and within it have increased group work and class-based activity at senior cycle.  This approach maximises the amount of time available for those pupils who need one to one support.</p></reply>

This question follows on from the previous one and is closely related to it.  Various surveys which have been published indicate a drop in guidance hours, including one by the Institute of Guidance Counsellors which indicated a 21% drop.  The Minister provided details of a survey the Department did, which showed a 25% cut in guidance hours.  The survey from the Institute of Guidance Counsellors showed a real hit as a result of the policy on one to one time, which has decreased by 50% since last year.  The Minister's previous response, in which he stated he did not think resourcing guidance counselling was the best way to approach the issue, is a sad comment on the value he puts on guidance counselling in schools.  It is something which was built up over years.  We have people in schools who are well trained, but the Minister's approach, as the figures show, is leading to a drain on these hours and people who are qualified at counselling have to go back to the classroom.  Will the Minister comment on where he sees the role of guidance counselling?  If he really values it he must reassess his policy and the position he is taking on it.</p></speech>

They have not been abolished.  Against the background of the necessity to reduce expenditure across all heads of Departments I had a very stark option to meet the targets.  One was to disimprove the pupil-teacher ratio across the entire post-primary sector, which would have had knock-on effects in terms of subject choice, and the other was to mainstream the guidance counsellors.  I took the second option for reasons which were very compelling.  I see that engaging the entire school in the process counteracts to a certain extent the impact guidance counsellors had in the past.  Does it displace them?  No it does not; it tries to rebalance the provision of this service in very difficult times against the overall reality.</p></speech>

I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year. </p></reply>

It showed that 14% of children in Ireland aged between nine and 16 felt the effects of bullying for about two months after the incident occurred, compared to the European average of about 2%.  In itself, that figure is a shocking statistic.  I acknowledge that the Minister has brought forward the action plan on bullying, which contains some good measures, and we welcomed it at the time.  A media campaign, Watch Your Space was launched recently and another, Connect with Respect, will be implemented in partnership with the Garda who will go into the schools and speak to students on the dangers of the Internet and the effects of cyber bullying.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that the group who looked at the whole area of bullying did not prioritise the introduction of new legislation.  Most EU countries that are regarded as the leaders in anti-bulllying have a background in legislation. They put the building blocks on the Statute Book and build on them.  That is an issue we need to look at again.  As part of implementation of the action plan is there any element that will continually consider the possibility of introducing legislation?</p></speech>

The last set of guidelines on bullying in the Department which we built upon and considerably modernised were drawn up in 1993.  There was no reference to homophobic bullying whatsoever in those guidelines as it was not part and parcel of the landscape in terms of recognising there were such issues around that whole agenda, with which we are now sadly very familiar.  The actions we have taken on bullying since last May are, by any measure, much more substantial than anything that has gone before.  That, combined with the mental health well-being guidelines published recently, throws a light of focus on an area that all of us in society - this is not a party partisan observation - either ignored or did not listen to carefully enough.  We have had a few tragic suicides that have caught the imagination in a very emotional way and have brought home how real the problem is.  A background note supplied to me states that bullying behaviour is a complex social issue and as the action plan on bullying highlights it can happen in many different settings.  Research shows that there is no single action which will produce significant or sustainable change.  Complementary initiatives are required which target teachers, parents, children and young people.  This is the approach we are pursuing in the action plan on bullying.  As the anti-bullying working group suggested the need for further legislation can be addressed once the actions of the action plan have been implemented.</p><p>  In summary, let us implement it.  If it throws up the need in a particular way for legislative measures, then I will bring forward those legislative measures.  It is too soon at this stage to sit down and start to design them when we have not yet seen the reaction of the action plan.</p></speech>

It is clear from OECD figures that about 73% of Irish post-primary teachers are in permanent positions compared to Denmark where the percentage is in the mid 90s.  It is estimated that about 27% of teachers are on a contract basis.  When a teacher is on a contract basis, it is a very difficult situation.  We expect teachers to deliver a high quality education yet many are demoralised and do not feel appreciated.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, of which I am a member, has returned from a recent trip to Finland where we studied the education system.  The one thing we took from that trip was the high regard in which the teaching profession was held within society.  The profession is held in higher regard than that of doctors and lawyers.  It is practically the top profession and there is much respect for it.  There is a misconception among the public that everyone in the teaching profession is in a full-time position but that is not the case.  Many of our young teachers are struggling from week to week to find work, not to mention paying bills and putting food on the table.  It is an issue that will have to be addressed by the unions, the Department and the Teaching Council.</p></speech>

The matter was brought to my attention when I was in Opposition and in my first year as Minister.  Part of the outcome of Croke Park II will move in the direction of improving that overall situation.  The problem is cute at the post-primary sector where there are subject teachers as distinct from teachers of young children.  I share the Deputy's view.  If we do not have teachers who are self-respecting in their own job and who feel they are appreciated, we will not get the best returns.  They are among the lessons that can be learned from the Finnish experience.  I hope we can move to improve the contractual arrangements and to reduce the amount of casual employment.</p></speech>

I refer to the position at primary level with regard to the temporary panel of teachers.  Teachers who have completed three years of teaching are eligible to be placed on a temporary panel but this year, the closing date for this panel was brought back from the end of February to the end of December.  As a result, a significant number of applications arrived late to the Department.  This issue affects teachers who have completed three years but who now face the prospect of missing out on that panel, in many cases through no fault of their own, on foot of the date being brought forward and their not having been made aware of the relevant circular.  I already have contacted the Department of Education and Skills on this issue but have not received a positive response.  However, I ask the Minister whether there may be a way, in respect of those teachers who made late applications, for the Department to reassess the deadline for the temporary panel, thereby giving them some certainty regarding teaching posts from next September.</p></speech>

I take the point that in some circumstances, there may be a real difficulty with regard to availability in exceptional circumstances.  However, anecdotally and from experience, serious issues still persist in schools across the country whereby teachers who are retired are getting temporary contracts and contracts.  Whatever about a day's subbing when someone rings in sick and it proves impossible to find someone else, an actual contract is a different kettle of fish.  Given the number of young people who have been graduating at primary and secondary levels in recent years, I do not accept there is a shortage of teachers in any subject choice, particularly at second level.  I believe the Minister not having taken a sufficiently hard approach on this issue has led to some retired teachers still remaining in those roles.  I suggest that a much more formal structure be set up whereby any school that takes on a teacher who already has retired for an exceptional reason must immediately notify the Department and explain the reason.  I believe that with immediate accountability on such decisions, it will deter schools from actually doing it.  It also will mean that a retired teacher who gets a call at 8 a.m. because someone has called in sick will not feel reluctant to come in.  It will avoid the scenario whereby such teachers will not come in, even in those rare situations when the school is unable to find anyone else, because they would be joining a group of people whom much public opinion is against.  This will not be an issue if there are exceptional circumstances and if the Minister has in place a proper system whereby it is accounted for.  However, I believe this issue persists and of the aforementioned 153 posts, many roles could have been taken up by newly qualified teachers instead.</p></speech>

Circular 31/2011 arose after my visit to the teaching conferences in the preceding Easter.  It was clear, given the strength of feeling, that this was a major issue in both primary and secondary levels.  If the circular is not having the intended effect, I will take on board some of the suggestions Deputy McConalogue has made and the process will be made more stringent.  I will be told, of course, that if I do make it extremely stringent, I will end up with some schools being unable to get a teacher at short notice.  However, I believe both Deputies are referring to contracts to cover maternity leave and so on and not the one-off substitution to cover someone who telephones in sick.</p></speech>

This decision means that both bodies will be co-located in one office building, they will be enabled to co-operate closely in their work to support the teaching of Irish and will be able to share back-office facilities.  The decision does not affect the statutory responsibilities of either body.  In reaching this decision, I paid particular attention to the context of my Department's support for both the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and to the Education Act 1998, the Gaeltacht Act 2012, the recommendations in the literacy and numeracy strategy and the framework for junior cycle which I published last October.</p><p>  I believe that the integration of the COGG with the NCCA will enhance the capacity of the COGG to meet its statutory functions.  The COGG will continue to advise on and support teaching through Irish.  The NCCA has a significant amount of work currently under way or about to be started on Irish language curricula at primary and post-primary level.  As the NCCA will prepare curricula for Irish for my consideration, the staff of COGG will co-operate closely with their NCCA colleagues and develop resources that will complement these curricula.  This will, I believe, enhance the quality of the supports that COGG will provide for the teaching and learning of Irish.</p></reply>

There is some concern that with the amalgamation of these two bodies, somehow the resources that have been allocated specifically to An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta may become diluted as a result of the amalgamation with the NCCA.  Can consideration be given to ensuring there is a ring-fenced budget to avoid a reduction in the amount of time delegated towards the development of the Irish language within the curriculum?  Particularly at a time when there are staffing resource constraints across all sections, it is important, given the needs and challenges facing the Irish language, to ensure that proper resourcing is given to it.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue and ensure that the separate identity and importance that is attached to developing the Irish language side of the curriculum is maintained and not reduced in any way.</p></speech>

That concern also has been expressed directly to me by other interested parties.  This measure is about sharing back-office services and not about interfering with or reducing the actual front-line work being done in promoting the Irish language and developing the curricula to bring that about.  Moreover, by achieving economies in the sharing of back-office service facilities, it pretty well ensures that the budget will be ring fenced.  As the work is largely staff driven, the salaries self-evidently are ring-fenced and the resources around them will be considered.  I will take on board the Deputy's remarks.</p></speech>

This application is being assessed at present and my officials will be in further contact with the school authority shortly.  In that connection, I do not consider a meeting, as requested, is necessary at this time.</p><p>  The school concerned also has an application with my Department for a major school project involving school refurbishment and the replacement of temporary accommodation.  As the  Deputy will be aware, the delivery of school projects in those areas where most demographic growth has been identified  will be the main focus for capital investment over the five-year plan.  In this regard, the area referred to by the Deputy has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth.  Projections indicate that pupil enrolments will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future.  It is not possible, therefore, to indicate at this point when a further project for the school in question will be progressed.</p></reply>

Despite the Minister's comment on numbers and population growth in the area, the school is faced for the first time with having to refuse the admission of 40 infants next September, which has caused many problems.  The parent body and the school staff say this increase in numbers had been anticipated.  While the Minister said he is examining the application for temporary accommodation, one of the reasons the school is struggling is the deplorable condition of the existing temporary facilities.  The fact that the school has some provision, albeit very poor, is a reason it has not been favourably looked on for a more secure form of extension and a better premises.  The premises are of a poor standard.  There is a meeting at the school tonight and parents and staff need to know the timescale of the application in front of the Minister.  If he is not in a position to meet them now, will that be revised?  When will they have an indication?  Could something be done in order that the 40 infants can be accommodated next September?</p></speech>

Courses under the programme include a significant work-based element.  Training will be provided within the context of four themes.  Three of the themes support occupational clusters where demand and vacancies exist within certain labour market sectors, while a fourth theme focuses on the specific needs of people under 25.  A tendering process was advertised by F&Aacute;S last year.  Interest in the fund was high, with F&Aacute;S receiving more than 200 applications for funding.  The agency has entered into contracts with a number of selected providers.  Under the eligibility criteria of MOMENTUM, all unemployed participants must be pre-approved by the Department of Social Protection before they can participate in the programme.  This recruitment phase is under way and more than 700 people have commenced training.</p></reply>

This is an unfortunate category of people who, because they have a partner in full-time employment, are not eligible for social welfare payments.  They can be out of work for years but they are not recognised on the live register or by the State for the purposes of rejoining the workforce.  These people are forced to live off their partners' resources.  We must recognise people who want to return to work and give them options through the programmes the State is offering.  That has not been done, and I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  Such people are important even though they do not take a payment from the State every week.  It is an unfortunate position for anybody to be in.</p></speech>

A number of training opportunities are available to anyone who wishes to avail of them through our VECs.  The social welfare supports available under the MOMENTUM programme may not be available but if people can be flexible in their approach to education, by doing courses either in the evening or online, there are opportunities available, although they may not be as attractive as the MOMENTUM offering.</p></speech>
