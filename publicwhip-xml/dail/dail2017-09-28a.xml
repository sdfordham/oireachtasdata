    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800003#A00200"><p>Approximately 11,000 teachers have qualified since 2011 and are on pay scales lower than those of their colleagues who qualified prior to that year.  Over the next 12 months, demographic pressures mean that another 5,000 teachers will enter this cohort.  If the Government led by the Fine Gael Party sticks to its commitment under the confidence-and-supply agreement to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, that number will rise even higher.  The public service pay stability agreement recently agreed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions provides that an examination of the salary scale issues for new entrants to the public sector will take place within one year of the adoption of the agreement.  As the House knows, the agreement has been roundly rejected by the INTO and the TUI and will be the subject of a ballot by members of the ASTI in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The context here is a massive flight of young teachers to Dubai and other countries that are also recruiting Irish teachers.  This is taking place against a background where we require teachers, particularly at second level but also at primary level, to be more qualified than ever before, with the attendant expense that goes with that.  What is the timescale for the examination, under the public service stability agreement, of the salary scales of new entrants to the public sector in general and to teaching in particular, where a huge number of workers are affected?</p><p>When will the talks commence on this matter?  What plans does the Government have to start this process?  What plans does it have to show newly qualified teachers - they are becoming older as the years go by - a pathway so that they can get full pay scale equality with their more senior counterparts?</p> <p> That is what we are looking for here.  There has been a bit of devilment at times on the Government side with claims that somebody with more years&rsquo; experience gets more pay.  This is not about pay but about pay scales.  These teachers are on lower pay scales.  It is having a hugely detrimental effect on morale in our schools and is massively contributing to the teacher shortage, an issue about which I have already suggested the Minister is not doing enough.  I want answers from the Minister in the clearest possible terms which he and the Government have not yet given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800004#B00200"><p>I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for raising this issue.  I can fully understand the pursuit by the teachers&rsquo; unions of this particular issue.  I sat down with the teachers&rsquo; unions through the teacher conciliation service and we negotiated, under the Lansdowne Road agreement, substantial increase for newly qualified teachers.  It represented increases of 15% and 22% under that agreement, closing 75% of the gap in the scale.  Indeed, at the higher points in the scales, the two scales have been merged.</p>  <p>  From January next year, a newly qualified teacher straight out of college will be recruited at &euro;35,600 a year.  That is competitive for a newly qualified graduate.  The issue of new entrants that the Deputy raised arises not just for education, although the largest numbers of recruits in those difficult years were in education.  It raises issues right across the entire public service.  In terms of dealing with this issue, it was on the table at the public pay talks but an agreement was negotiated, which did not include a settlement of that issue.  The &euro;900 million assigned in those pay talks were assigned on a more general basis.</p>  <p>  However, it was agreed in the pay negotiations that the issues of new entrant pay and those areas in the public service with difficulty in recruiting will be discussed through process in the agreement.  Money has not been set aside in the agreement at this point for either of these issues, nor has a deadline been set for the conclusion of such discussions.  However, this remains an issue of concern for the trade unions and the Government side.  A forum where the issues can be discussed in greater detail has been set out.  This is an indication of openness on the part of the Government to consider these issues.</p>  <p>  We have to make decisions in the context of scarce resources, however.  The Deputy knows that in education we have been able to employ over 5,000 additional teachers between last September and this September, along with 2,000 special needs assistants, SNAs.  Those investments need to be accommodated.  One is always weighing on the one side, the legitimate expectation of public service employees for more pay against the need to invest in services, particularly after a decade when it was extremely difficult to do so.  We have to balance those two levels of expectation from the public.  The public service pay agreement provides a framework within which we can do that.   It has been agreed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800004#B00300"><p>As well as being rejected by the teachers&rsquo; unions individually.</p>  <p>  The Minister failed to outline when this process will start.  He said there were no deadlines as to its conclusion but he did not say when it will start.  In a public press statement, the INTO is under the impression this will start soon.  The agreement provides it will start in 12 months.  Will the Minister say here when this process to discuss this issue will start?  Teachers are entitled to know.  They are working under sometimes difficult conditions and low morale.</p><p>Is the Minister at least prepared to concede that the Government supports the principle of equal pay scales for people, in this case teachers, who do the same job?  Does he agree with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, or does he agree with his anonymous colleagues who said that her intervention was deeply unhelpful?  The Minister must take a side.  Whose side is he on?  Is he on the side of what is just, fair and provided for in the agreement and is he prepared to set out when the process in that agreement will start?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800005#C00200"><p>The agreement is a cross-Government agreement involving the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It provides that consideration of the issue of newly-qualified pay will occur within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement, so there is a deadline.  Obviously, there will be discussions if some unions wish to move that, but an outer limit of 12 months has been set.  That is clear.</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my initial response, equality of treatment must be considered across the spectrum.  We have a responsibility for children with special needs, for young people who are seeking access to apprenticeships and for investment needs across the education system.  Every year we must provide for 15,000 additional school places - build and equip them and provide teachers and support in them.  Our treatment of everyone in the public service must be fair and equal.  They have expectations of us.  We met the teachers' unions and negotiated an agreement which met three quarters of what was sought.  It provides for an entry pay level for a newly-qualified teacher of &euro;35,600 from next January.  That is treating everybody who has a legitimate expectation of my Department in a fair and equal manner.  Indeed, similar expectations occur in housing and health and they are the subject of debates in this House all the time.  We must balance those issues and the Lansdowne Road agreement and its successor provide for that.  It is a framework within which we can make the balances and choices that we believe are fair and equal to all who have legitimate expectations of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800005#C00300"><p>There are 446 people on trolleys in our hospitals today.  In my city of Cork, there are 43 people on trolleys in wards and in the accident and emergency departments of Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Tuigeann an tAire gur inniu an 28 Mean F&oacute;mhair.  The weather is still fine and it should be a time of relatively low pressure on the system, yet we are looking at numbers on trolleys equivalent to over 40% of the record numbers.  I am sure I am not alone in having grave concern and trepidation as to what will transpire this winter as pressure intensifies.</p>  <p>  There were record numbers on waiting lists this summer, at well in excess of 600,000.  The most recent figures for August show an increase of 3,500 on public outpatient waiting lists.  For example, the number of people waiting for gynaecology appointments in the maternity hospital in Cork for over 18 months has jumped by more than 500% in the last year, numbering over 1,000 women.  The lack of full cover for 20 to 22 week scans means cases are missed, with very serious potential implications for women.  The facts are plain.  Since the Government took office and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, undertook his role the number of outpatients waiting for a hospital appointment has grown continuously.  All Fine Gael and this Government have achieved in health is to allow the crisis to escalate to a point that it has become almost normalised.</p>  <p>  Many people in hospital could return home much earlier if they were confident they would receive the supports and assistance they need.  However, they have not been available for some time.  Home help and home care packages were decimated during the crash and the current Government has entirely neglected this area.  The under-resourcing of home help has meant that not only are people fearful of returning home but it has also affected people's confidence and reduced their quality of life.  Workers are hassled, harried and under pressure, through no fault of their own, trying to manage 15-minute slot after 15-minute slot when the slot really requires half an hour.  The vast majority of older people prefer to live their lives in their own homes if possible, a desire shared by their families.  We spend &euro;490 million on the fair deal scheme.  In comparison, we spend &euro;251 million on home help hours and &euro;149 million on home care packages.  There must be a shift in policy and a new focus on what older people want.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in launched a document outlining how we would invest an additional &euro;72.65 million in this area, including in respect of 2.1 million home help hours and 2,500 home care packages.</p><p>This investment would significantly enhance the quality of life of older people, the ill and disabled persons and reduce the burden on hospitals which are positively creaking under the pressure.  Will the Government commit to ensuring the scandalous under-resourcing of care at home is addressed comprehensibly in the forthcoming budget or will it prioritise tax cuts for higher earners above the needs of an elderly woman who needs assistance to get out of bed to begin her day at home?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800006#D00200"><p>As the Deputy is well aware, the announcement on budgetary matters will be made in due course, namely, on 10 October, and no decisions will be indicated until that point.</p>  <p>  As a result of the re-investment the Government has made in the health service, the number of patients being treated across the system increased by 250,000 per annum in the past four years.  This means almost 7,000 patients are treated in hospital every day and most return home with their life prospects considerably improved as a result of their treatment.  We are, therefore, delivering a quality health service. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, problems at certain access points have been in the system for many years.  It is encouraging, however, that trolley waiting, the very issue the Deputy raises, has reduced considerably across a range of hospitals, including Beaumont, St. Vincent's, James Connolly and Mayo university hospitals.  The reductions in trolley waiting in these hospitals range from 40% to 68%.  These significant improvements show that the Government's focus on trolley waiting is having an impact.  This year, numbers waiting on trolleys across the board are lower than they were last year.  The exemplars of good practice show that the policy of focusing on trolley waiting is working.  We must continue to roll out this policy and there must be a clear focus on ensuring vulnerable people who enter hospitals through accident and emergency departments are given priority in the hospital service.  As I stated, this is happening in many hospitals.  </p>  <p>  In terms of provision for people to live in at home, we are assessing the need for a more comprehensive home care support package.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is examining this issue and consultations are under way to determine how best this can be achieved.  The Minister for Health has made increased provision for home help and home care packages.  According to a report in yesterday's newspapers, he reported a 10% increase in activity in these areas.  Investment is being made all the time to try to make the experience of our hospitals better for every patient.</p>  <p>  It is worth paying tribute to those who work in the health service and successfully treat 7,000 people every day, either as inpatients or day cases.  This is having an impact on quality of life.  While we have problems at discharge and admission, these must be resolved over time.</p>  <p>  The Minister will obviously make investment plans for the future.  We have the first investments in a new maternity hospital, a new children's hospital and a new hospital providing forensic psychiatric care.  These are real investments that will improve quality of life. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800006#D00300"><p>It is difficult to credit the statement of improvements in individual hospitals.  In reality, there are 446 people on trolleys and even ten years ago, this would have been unacceptable at a time of year when pressure on hospitals should be low.  We have reached record numbers of trolleys in winter and extremely high levels in summer and this is putting our system under incredible pressure.</p>  <p>  I will certainly pay tribute to those who work extremely hard in the health system and are under severe pressure, in particular, home helps who have to rush across cities and counties to try to do half an hour's work in ten or 15 minutes, which is utterly unacceptable. </p>  <p>  The position on the ground is that in April last, 350 people who had been allocated home help in South Lee had not received it specifically due to financial constraints on the Health Service Executive.</p><p>It was not down to any delay in processing.  This was not helped by the fact that the home help co-ordinator is doing three days per week in the area.  Many people have left the system because they have not been able to get the hours.  While a consultation may be happening on a statutory scheme or whatever it may be, there is no excuse for this underinvestment in home care.  It is a reflection on the Government's wrong priorities and the more expensive cost of home care provided through for-profit agencies compared with direct hires through the HSE.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800007#E00300"><p>The Deputy has to reflect on what the Government has provided in the past two years.  In that time, an additional &euro;1.3 billion has been invested in the health service.  It has been the greatest recipient of any resource at a time when we are now able to reinvest.  Priority has been given to health by the Government.  The Deputy must also recognise that we had a lost decade.  I will not go into the origins of that, but investments that everyone would have liked to have made were not possible.  Now, however, we are returning to a position in which we can make prudent investments.  The national children's hospital, the national maternity hospital and the national forensic psychiatric hospital are in the building pipeline and will provide increases.</p>  <p>  We are ensuring that the extra &euro;1.3 billion is spread judiciously across all demands.  Everyone recognises that there are demands, but the Deputy must also recognise that there have been genuine service improvements.  Consider hospitals such as Beaumont, St. Vincent's, Cavan, Connolly, Mayo and others, which are delivering improvements.  They are exemplars.  The Minister is determined to ensure that good practice in those hospitals is mirrored in others where there are continuing difficulties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800007#E00400"><p>I wish to raise the issue of direct provision, specifically in the context of the recent issuing of letters to single male asylum seekers who are on deportation orders telling them that they must vacate their direct provision centres within four weeks.  Many are from countries, such as, for example, Somalia and Palestine, to which Ireland cannot deport people.  Will this new policy extend to families and children on deportation orders?</p>  <p>  The direct provision system was established 17 years ago and was only meant to be an interim solution in respect of the high number of asylum seekers entering Ireland seeking the protection of the State.  It was intended to provide asylum seekers with temporary accommodation while their applications were being processed.  Now, more than 4,000 asylum seekers, of whom 1,600 are children, are in direct provision.</p>  <p>  The issuing of these letters by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of the Department of Justice and Equality has been condemned by the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, Nasc, which claims that this is actively seeking to make asylum seekers homeless and destitute.  These deportees have no entitlement to social welfare and will be unable to access homeless services.  Thus, they will have no money, homes, residency or right to work.  Invariably, they will become homeless and add to the crisis of street homelessness.</p>  <p>  The McMahon report of 2015 brought about some improvements, but more than 25% of asylum seekers are still waiting for longer than three years to have their applications for asylum processed.  There is no statutory time limit on processing applications.  This leads to a loss of autonomy and self-worth.  As the Supreme Court ruled this year, not being able to work in these circumstances goes against the constitutional.</p>  <p>  The State has a duty of care to these asylum seekers to look after them in a more humane way until they are granted asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain or exit Ireland voluntarily or are deported.  They should not be turned out onto the streets without support.  Why has this shift in policy occurred?  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has stated that no asylum seeker will be made homeless as a result of these letters.  What does that mean?  Are these letters to be ignored?  Has the RIA changed its mind and withdrawn them?  What exactly is going on?  I would be grateful for the Minister's reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800007#E00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As he outlined, we are providing temporary accommodation - bed, breakfast and board - for almost 5,000 individuals.</p><p>Every year, approximately 2,000 new applicants come and we try to provide a service for them.  The idea behind this accommodation is to provide for people who would otherwise arrive in a very vulnerable condition.  There is a limited number of such places, with very high occupancy rates, that must accommodate the 50 people a week who need accommodation and who have a call on this.  We must ensure we can, to the best of our ability, be fair and equal to all those who are making a case to the State.  There has been significant effort to improve the conditions.  The McMahon report made 173 recommendations of which 133 have been fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress.  That has brought tangible improvement in the conditions of people who are awaiting a decision.  It includes standards, availability of self-catering and so on.  </p> <p> In terms of the ban on employment, the court has yet to make an order.  On foot of that order, the Government will have to consider its implications.  A provisional ruling has been made but the final order is yet to be made.  We have made huge efforts to simplify the process through legislation in order that people are not in temporary accommodation for long periods.  It was never intended that it should be for long periods.  To facilitate people coming through, there must be some effort in respect of people who have been the subject of deportation orders to see that they would move on since their cases have been fully adjudicated under the international rules we apply and a decision made that they are not eligible for status in Ireland.  That is the position.  We will try to deal with each person in the most humane way we can.  We cannot guarantee that everyone is able to remain forever in accommodation if he or she has been unsuccessful in his or her application.  This is an effort to deal with a problem in a reasonable and fair way as best we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800008#F00200"><p>Direct provision needs to be reviewed in its entirety because it has become an institutional form of living.  Many asylum seekers have been waiting more than five years to have their asylum application processed.  That leads them to live in accommodation that is entirely unsuitable for them for prolonged periods.  They are banned from taking up work, live in a state of idleness and are confined to reception centres.  They do not have an opportunity to cook; they are eating in canteens at set hours and it has become an institutional form of life.  The right to employment is still denied to them but hopefully it will be rectified in the coming weeks.  Children living in direct provision suffer greatly just as children living in homeless situations do.  They live in fear for their personal safety even in the centres.

These centres are an offer by the State to provide full bed and board, access to utilities, welfare payments and medical facilities.  People are not obliged to accept offers and many do not take them up.  They represent the State attempting to provide for such people, instead of the 2,000 who come in going onto the streets and being vulnerable as they would be.  The State is providing an option for them to be accommodated in this way.  It is not an ideal situation.  The McMahon report, which investigated this, has been done and action has been taken to implement the recommendations it made.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of dealing with cases more quickly, the new legislation will accelerate it and we hope there will no longer be the long delays the Deputy rightly says have been a feature of this provision in the past.  </p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is a particularly compassionate and vigilant Minister, has visited these centres.

Women work outside home in fewer numbers with most getting paid less when they do.  When it comes to retirement, women now typically have 37% less to live on than men.  On 21 September the Taoiseach announced plans for a new pension strategy to be completed by the end of the year, including a five-year roadmap for pension reform.  As Minister for Social Protection, he also committed to conduct an overall pension review that was to be completed by the middle of this year.  It is now almost October and it is not known if that pension review has been completed, let alone published.</p>  <p>  Many women who got up early in the morning for years to work or look after the nation's children are now entering an insecure impoverished retirement.  They will have limited access to pensions because of low pay, poor conditions of work and having to take time out for caring responsibilities.  Women who worked on family farms and in family businesses also do not have social insurance coverage meaning they are totally reliant on their husbands in older age.  What steps will the Government take to analyse the differential impacts of pension policy for men and women?  Will it redress these glaring, flagrant inequalities among pensioners currently in receipt of benefits?</p>  <p>  Lack of access to the homemaker's scheme has led to experiences of severe inequality for an entire generation of women in the State pension system.  The homemaker's scheme only allows for the backdating of pension contributions to 1994.  What about all the women before 1994?  Let us not forget the State-enforced marriage bar, which up to 1973 meant women had no choice but to give up their public service and Civil Service jobs when they got married.  Tens of thousands of women are out in the cold and are forgotten.  They do not receive equal treatment because of a sudden unfair cut-off point of 6 April 1994.  This is simply not good enough; they deserve better.  The Taoiseach has said he plans to reward work and enterprise in the budget and yet he has claimed that pensions for these women, forcibly barred from work by the State, would be too expensive.  Indeed they should paid reparations and not a mere State pension.  It is never too late to do the right thing.</p>  <p>  Will the Government commit to backdating the homemaker's scheme to 1973, rather than this discriminatory cut-off point of 1994?  When will the Government publish the review on the differentiated impacts of pension policy?  Will this be published before any new strategy is conducted or will the Government continue its penchant for revolving-door Ministries that never seem to finish any jobs they start?</p></speech>

There is widespread under-provision in pensions and, as she rightly said, the under-provision is much more acute among women workers than among male workers.  While I do not have the figures to hand today, from memory less than half of workers had access to any pension support other than the State contributory scheme.  This has been a feature of our provision over many years.</p>  <p>  Deputy Burton is in the Chamber.  I know the previous Government took action to ensure that every employer would have to provide the option of a scheme to every worker.  Therefore there is an obligation on employers to provide such a scheme.  The State, of course, supports though tax breaks people participating in such a scheme.  The wider issues of whether there should be compulsory contribution into a scheme or whether it should be automatic enrolment with an obligation to drop out are very significant and need to be assessed in detail.  Obviously much work is required initially assessing the potential impact of them and considerable consultation on them would be required.</p>  <p>  I do not have access to when the work will be completed, but it is a very important issue which poses problems for long-term funding for all of us as we live longer and remain reliant on the State for much longer.</p><p>The State pension, which was introduced in 1953, was based on contributions by people who were at work.  That has been the model and access is done by way of averaging over one's entire life.  That has favoured people who, for example, entered late and were just in the scheme for a short period and get a full pension while others, as Deputy Catherine Martin described, who drop out for periods can have their rights diluted.  One of the issues that has been examined by the Department is whether one should move to a total contribution approach rather than using the averaging rule.  The difficulty with such a change is that there could be losers as well as winners in such a scheme.</p> <p> I understand the Department has indicated in the course of replies to parliamentary questions that the law would have to change retrospectively for homemakers and that would have a significant cost.  From recollection, more than &euro;250 million would be involved.  Again, it would have to be assessed in the context of other budgetary options that fall to be considered by the State.  This is a complex area and having a full pension review that evaluates all of those issues, and tries to decide where the allocation of responsibility falls between employers, individuals and the State, requires careful work.  I look forward to that review which has not come to Government at this point.</p></speech>

In 2012, the previous Government introduced changes to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension.  That had the effect of increasing the number of PRSI contributions required for the higher payments and women are most likely to lose out because of periods out of the workforce due to family responsibilities or having held part-time employment.</p>  <p>  Of the 36,000 people the Department of Social Protection records as being affected by the changes from June 2016, more than 62% were women.  Will the Government reverse the 2012 changes to pension contributions?  As budget 2018 approaches, I remind the Minister that women benefit less from cuts to income tax as they are more likely to find themselves in part-time and low-paid jobs and take time out from work for unpaid care responsibilities.  The priority in the upcoming budget should lie in investment in public services and any tax cuts need to be in the form of progressive taxation that will benefit women and men equally.</p></speech>

The system that prevailed before that meant that someone who perhaps had made 1,000 contributions over his or her entire life could get a 98% pension and someone who had made double those contributions over his or her life would get the same pension.  There was an effort to relate more fairly the amount of pension provided to the contribution record of the individual.  It is a contributory scheme.  To move away from that principle of relating to a reasonable degree the eligibility to the contributions would be a strange direction for policy to take.  We must try to build a system where people make contributions and employers also make contributions and we build up both the State element and the private element to give adequate pension cover.  That is the challenge we have.  I do not think we can assume that those who made a lesser contribution can automatically get the same amount as those who made a greater contribution.  That is the dilemma we face.</p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin is correct that we need to look in particular at the position of women in the workforce.  That is an issue that will have to be addressed in the wider policy but it is part of a bigger picture which will dominate discussion over many years.</p></speech>

There are many people throughout the country who get up early in the morning, as the Government likes to say.  They are currently being discommoded by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is seemingly unable to provide a predictable and reliable service.  There are many people who use rail services and also get up early in the morning.  They are being promised an all-out strike in the next few weeks.  When is the Government going to take some action on this and provide the promised improvements?  We should have an effective, predictable and reliable public transport service around the country.</p></speech>

I have had experience as the Minister responsible for this area and even the most intractable disputes can be resolved by their services.  They are very experienced and expert.</p>  <p>  The Government has a huge commitment to public transport.  We will soon see the Luas lines linked up after very significant infrastructure investment.  The ten-year investment plan is being put together and public transport will be a very significant part of that, as it was in the last plan.  In terms of support for the improvement of public transport on a day-to-day basis, we have seen a 25% increase in the subventions being made to public transport for public service obligations over the last two years.  Investment is being put in and we are seeing more and more people using public transport.</p></speech>

I have before me the response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Alan Farrell in respect of the reopening of Rush Garda station.  It states that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the efficient use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has no role in the matter.  That includes responsibility for the opening and closing of Garda stations.</p>  <p>  At today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in confirmed that the decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station and not to reopen Rush Garda station was a political one and that the Government took the decision on the criteria to reopen Stepaside.  He explained this by saying that his office did what it was asked to do.  I ask the Minister to explain the manner in which this is not a political decision and to tell us who took the decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station and not the others, particularly in light of the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na clearly did not take it.</p></speech>

The Garda was asked to undertake an analysis to identify locations for the pilot scheme.  An interim report has been given to the Government.  It recommends the opening of Stepaside and indicates that the process could be extended to other locations and that its final report would indicate the position in respect of those other locations, namely, Leighlinbridge, Donard and Rush.  I understand this reflects population trends and operational reasons as to why these areas need the additional support.  I understand the final report will come to Government shortly.</p></speech>

It was receiving budgetary support from the HSE of &euro;50,000 a year and was a key part of the strategy.

I read in a newspaper this morning that the Fine Gael Cabinet, or the Cabinet, does not believe the outcome of the Citizens' Assembly is acceptable for the party, the D&aacute;il or the people.  It appears that the Government, having decided to pursue the Citizens' Assembly process, is now rejecting it without letting the committee finish its work.  Perhaps it should elect a new people.</p></speech>

This has been a very divisive issue in Irish society.  It has been very helpful for the Citizens' Assembly to have had an opportunity go through evidence and provide a report to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas will have to make a decision on whether a proposal should be put to the people and, if so, what that proposal should be.  That is why the work of the Oireachtas committee is so important.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, we have set a tight timescale to try to provide for a referendum before the students break for the summer.  That is conditional on the Oireachtas committee being able to complete its work.  The Taoiseach has urged those involved in that committee to approach their work constructively and to try to reach a consensus with the committee.</p></speech>

That is the admissions policy that is before the House.  We have indicated that there are amendments to be made, having been agreed in principle on Committee Stage.  They have to be drafted and go through the Office of the Attorney General.  That is what is now happening.  The issue of divestment and transfer of patronage is a separate process.  As we have indicated, the agreement of all parties is required to secure that.  Under a new system that we are introducing, education and training boards will conduct local surveys of preschool parents to establish whether there is a desire for an alternative model of patronage.  Where there is such a desire, we will sit down with the existing patrons to seek to work out a live transfer to a new patron.</p></speech>

There are almost 700,000 people on inpatient or outpatient lists across the country.  The community services, including the home help service, are in tatters.  The health service is crumbling under ferocious pressure.  In addition to all that pressure, no new staff are being recruited.  The Minister told the health committee yesterday that the &euro;100 million shortfall in the health service budget would have to be found within the health service.  More than &euro;100 million is needed to recruit extra staff.  How can this be done without compromising the health service that is already in tatters?</p></speech>

As I said, in the past four years 250,000 extra people have been treated, which represents an increase of about 15% in the number of patients treated.  That is a significant number.  Almost 7,000 patients leave our hospitals every day with their quality of life improved by medical intervention.  It is not a service in a state of collapse or whatever words he used but there are pinch points where there is a demand for services, and we need to meet that demand.  In the past two years, an investment of &euro;1.3 billion has been made.  In particular, mental health has been prioritised by Government, even in the difficult years, with an additional &euro;140 million invested in those services.  There are difficulties in recruiting in the medical health service, as the Deputy is aware.  That is one that is being addressed, as well as extending the services.</p></speech>

However, a review of the prescription drugs prescribed to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowances is needed, as some of those drugs are not covered under this scheme.  One such drug is melatonin, which I am advised is very important for those children suffering from this condition.  I ask the Minister to have a review carried out to have this drug included.  On foot of a question I tabled to the Department, the HSE came back and said that it would not include it, yet I have been told by experts in the medical field and by parents that this is a drug that needs to be included.</p></speech>

My understanding is that in any such case of a drug being presented there is research undertaken, I believe by the Health Research Board, HRB, to establish the health efficacy of the drug and the price for which it should be procured if it is effective.  That results in negotiations, where it is proven effective, between the company and the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I do not know the status of this but every new drug is assessed on a fair basis to ensure it is cost effective to introduce into the health service.</p></speech>

This week, a number of women who are rape survivors who have had abortions and regretted them or who brought their children to full term wish to have a public meeting in Dublin to explain their experiences.  They did not go to universities because in previous years universities would not let them on campus.  A prominent Dublin hotel gave them a room but after a barrage of aggressive threats against the hotel, the room was not made available to them.</p><p>They then got another room in another hotel and the exact same thing happened: they were prevented from speaking in the room.

It is vital, as we come to debate an issue that has been extremely divisive in our community over many years, that people are treated with respect on all sides.  I know there are very strongly held views on all sides about this.  I know it is an issue in respect of which people find it hard at times to be restrained.  However, if we are to make mature decisions on this, the public must be given an opportunity to hear the arguments on both sides.  It is right that the House should appeal for such an approach because, otherwise, people will be branded into one area or camp or another and will not have a chance to sift through what are genuine arguments that must be reconciled in this debate.

Many people with brain injuries, which arise for many different reasons, for example, due to strokes, are waiting a huge length of time to be seen by consultants.  In the north west, there is only one consultant covering the whole area and there is a huge problem across the country in this regard.  Will the Government do something about this, have a review of the entire area and put funds into it?</p></speech>

I am only speaking about the motion, not the content of the report or anything else.  This only appeared yesterday.  There should be a debate as to whether, given the passage of time, it is appropriate for this to be debated by a committee and not the D&aacute;il first.</p>  <p>  It is three and a half years since the report of the Constitutional Convention on this aspect.  It is questionable whether the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is the appropriate committee to refer it to, given a report from the Constitutional Convention recommended a constitutional provision to realise economic, social and cultural rights and greater protection for those.  What we are dealing with is not necessarily a finance issue and it is probably more appropriate - similar to the report that came from the Citizens' Assembly, the successor to the Constitutional Convention - that we set up a separate committee or, at the very least, that the report be referred to committees that have the expertise, such as the housing committee.  The report from the convention dealt with specific areas of rights that should be enumerated in the Constitution, and it listed those - disabilities, health care, social services, housing and language were the areas it asked us to deal with.  What is being suggested here is that, rather than have us discuss which committee is, or which committees are, appropriate, we would send it to the finance committee.  That is wholly inappropriate and it is also inappropriate that we are dealing with it in such a rushed manner at this stage, given it is three and a half years since that report was laid before the House.</p></speech>

The committee we propose sending this to needs to deal with the totality of issues that have been recommended in the Constitutional Convention's eighth report.  That committee deals with finance, expenditure and reform issues and with the Department of the Taoiseach.  Given the scope of the committee, but also the scope of the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention, we feel it is the most appropriate committee to discuss this issue.</p></speech>

I will go into more detail now to illustrate how this Bill, which Deputy Cowen - who sounded more like "Minister" Cowen last night - was at such pains to defend, shows that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted.  At the conclusion of the deliberations of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, by means of a backroom deal, managed to stitch in a backdoor to water charges in the future.  What the Government, clearly with Fianna F&aacute;il's acquiescence, has done with this Bill is to try to widen the back door already before it even comes into place.</p>  <p>  I will deal first with the question of excessive usage, which is a red herring.  It was clear from the hearings of the committee that it is a red herring.  It was clear from the expert report that it is a red herring because average usage in Ireland is not high, it is low.  According to the expert commission, it is 125 l per person per day compared with 140 l per person per day in Britain where there are water charges.  We do not have widespread excessive usage of water and where it exists, it is overwhelmingly due to the fact that there are leaks.  The leaks should be fixed; not only should a first fix be free but any leaks that are there should be fixed.  It is clearly only there as a backdoor for returning to water charges in the future.</p>  <p>  The general point we made in the aftermath of the committee and its report has been confirmed in dramatic terms by the Government's Bill.  Why else include a provision in section 9 to reduce the threshold of 1.7 times the average usage above which one will pay?  There is no other explanation but that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, looking at being in government in future, wants at least the possibility of, over time, reducing the threshold and thereby increasing the number of people who would be brought into the charging net.  Anticipating that argument, Deputy Cowen said it needs a majority of the D&aacute;il and asked what we were complaining about because it is a democratic process.  Relying on the fact there will not be a majority in the D&aacute;il that is really in favour of water charges is again asking people who mobilised against water charges to trust that Fianna F&aacute;il is not for water charges.  We have the experience of Fianna F&aacute;il being for water charges and originally signing the country up for water charges.  It is incredible and the only reason it is there is to use it as a backdoor for water charges in the future.</p>  <p>  The point was made by Deputy Cowen that the only people who will be paying water charges will be water wasters.  That is not true because of the way the household average is being worked out.  It is not being worked out on the basis of the number of individuals in a house and the amount of water each individual is likely to use based on an average and multiplying it by 1.7; it is simply doing it up to four people in a house on the basis of one average.  A one-person household will have exactly the same allowance as a four-person household.  In a society where average occupancy in households is increasing because of a crisis which has led to many children being unable to leave home until they are in their 30s, an increasing number of households are made up of four adults.  There is an average household size of 2.75 but if there are four adults in a house and they use even slightly more than average - they are not water wasters - they will face charges from July 2019.  That is what Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government have signed people up for.  It was something explicitly discussed in the committee when talking about individual usage.  An individual usage figure was something Fianna F&aacute;il argued for but here we have an overall household figure.  I did the sums on it.  If we say that the average is 133 l per person, the average household allowance will be 622 l for a household.  However, four adults using an average amount each will use almost 540 l between them.  It only requires them to use less than 20% extra water per person to face charges.  It is not the 70% extra the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il suggest.</p>  <p>  I have a question.  I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  The timeframe for this is very suspicious and the fact it will not come in until July 2019 shows the reality.  The Government has the figures for consumption.  It could introduce this tomorrow.  It does not want to do so because it knows water charges are politically toxic.  In July 2019, they will still be politically toxic, there will still be mass opposition and there will still be 40% of homes not metered.  In those circumstances, I have a question as to whether the Government will seriously go for this in another year and a half.  If the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il do, they should have no fear, they will be beaten again by a movement that has experienced the fact that it can win.  That movement will beat the Government again by using the same tactics and strategies it employed previously.</p></speech>

If there are amendments, I will have to look at them.  This is a Bill which, while seeming to abolish water services and replace them with direct funding from general taxation, is also seeking to insert loopholes that will allow for their reintroduction in the future.  The legislation is a response to the massive movement of people power, a movement of which I was very proud to be part.  I was very proud - along with the local community - to play a role in stopping water meters coming into my area.  It was a movement which launched the "No way, we won't pay" demand on the streets and 56% of households refused to pay.  Others were forced to pay when they sold their homes or out of fear.  Some agreed with water charges.  This movement of people power derailed the latest attempt to commodify water and prepare for privatisation.  I have no doubt that any future attempt will be met with similar mass resistance.  This must be the third time the establishment has attempted to bring in water charges with the goal of privatising our water in the future.  The point was made last night that water is the new oil.  Large companies see they can make big profits through it.  While they are making their big profits, the system creaks because there is no investment being made to fix pipes and no attempts to deal with the issue.</p>  <p>  On section 8 and the issue of the average consumption of water, we are being asked to vote through something when we do not know what the regulator will determine to be average consumption.  Is it to be by household or by individual?  Is Fianna F&aacute;il's eye being wiped here or is it in agreement with the Government on this?  We do not know at what level the Minister will set the threshold over which there will be an excessive usage payment.  Deputy Cowen kept referring to a fine when it is actually a payment.  I ask him whether Fianna F&aacute;il's eye being wiped or whether it is, through its confidence-and-supply arrangement, in tacit agreement with the Government.  This is very different from the idea of a fine for deliberate excessive waste as was posited at the committee.  Irish Water has been given the right to charge for water usage above a level which we can only guess at this point.  How will it be implemented when we do not have mass meters in the ground?  If people are told that they have over-usage of water yet do not have a meter, how will Irish Water measure and cost that?  It does not make sense.</p>  <p>  Section 9 allows for a 1.7 multiplier to be reduced but not for five years.  This is a loophole for the future.  The threshold can be changed and lowered to bring more households into payment for water services.  It is the Government preparing to bring back water charges through the backdoor, not like the last time when it took the establishment nearly 20 years, but perhaps to bring them back over five or so years.  The five-year stipulation is a recognition of political reality.  Water charges are off the agenda for a period but the backdoor is being left open.</p><p> I want to deal with two issues which were not on the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, but were taken on board by the committee.  First is the question of having a referendum to enshrine public water services in public ownership and management as per the Bill I introduced with the support of Members of this D&aacute;il and which passed Second Stage without opposition.  While it was not in the Oireachtas committee's remit, it stated it was in favour of a referendum because such a referendum was called for in the majority of submissions received by the commission and the Oireachtas committee.  The commission on water charges also supported a referendum based on the number of submissions it received indicating that people supported a referendum on the public ownership of our water.</p> <p> The Bill passed Second Stage almost a year ago.  The current and former Ministers have both said they favour a referendum but are awaiting advice from the Attorney General as to the wording of the amendment.  A red herring has been created around the issue of group schemes and private wells.  My Bill refers specifically to the public water system.  The public water system is the public water system and does not include private schemes or private wells.  Given that a back door has been left open to attempt to commodify water to charges at some point in the future, a referendum to rule out privatisation is still a priority for the Right2Water movement and is still a priority for this D&aacute;il in reflection of the mood and demand of the people.  It is vital to copper-fasten the right to public water.</p> <p> I wish to refer to the future of Irish Water as an entity.  This is a key issue that the Government - and now it appears Fianna F&aacute;il - want to keep off the agenda.  I wish to know why this is so.  I believe this was contained in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto.  Probably one of the reasons it got the extra votes it did in the last general election was that it supported abolishing Irish Water and water charges.  Irish Water is seen as a toxic entity by the mass of the people.  It is seen as a cash cow for consultants and private companies contracted to install meters and provide other services.</p> <p> I recently met local authority workers who are working on water services under the service level agreement, SLA, with Irish Water.  These workers have many concerns about how Irish Water operates.  One concern highlighted to me related to a company which provided specialist services and could be called in to deal with a specific problem.  It had a standard charge of &euro;45.  This company is no longer used and instead another well-known private company is used, which has a charge of &euro;139 and which then subcontracts the work to the previous company anyway, allowing it to make a profit of &euro;94 per job.  This is outrageous.  It is why the people hate Irish Water and why it is so toxic.  There is no transparency.  I have also been advised of engineers who had been recruited by consultants who are paid &euro;85,000 and then they pay the engineer &euro;65,000 and pocket the &euro;20,000.  This is outrageous.  We need a body that is transparent in order that people can see what is going on.  According to these workers, the only thing Irish Water is good it is spin.  The real problems in the system are not being addressed because of a lack of funds.  Major necessary work, such as the replacement of ancient pipes is not being undertaken and repairs are carried out instead.  Fixing a leak in the system means increased water pressure which immediately leads to other leaks.</p> <p> Irish Water is pushing to be set up as a stand-alone public utility with sole responsibility for all areas of the public water system.  Today the Irish Water consultative group is meeting where the CEO will present the proposal regarding a stand-alone public utility to that group, and has already consulted with the Minister.  This raises important issues for in excess of 3,000 local authority workers operating under the service level agreement with Irish Water, which is due to be reviewed in 2021.</p> <p> It is extremely important that Deputies give careful consideration to the concerns of these workers in the coming period.  These workers are the experts and not those in Irish Water.  These workers have experience and knowledge gained over the years.  They know what is wrong, what needs to be fixed and how to do it.  They need a national water authority to ensure they get the necessary investment to get on with the job of providing high-quality public water services.  Every cent that goes into the water services should be put directly into fixing the pipes and supporting the network and not channelling money to consultants and groups without delivering properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800023#V00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the Water Services Bill 2017.  From the outset I was opposed to the Fine Gael Ervia project, including Irish Water, whose aim was always to privatise Ireland's domestic water supply.</p>  <p>  I always advocated that all the necessary capital funding for expanding water supplies and the maintenance of water systems around the country should be a core part of the annual and multi-annual capital budgets.  For about eight years I was chair of the Dublin City Council general purposes committee, which among many other matters looked after the water supply for much of the Dublin region.  I saw at first hand how the city council, which organised and provided this water, was denied resources by successive Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to carry out critical maintenance for new pipework and to expand Dublin water supply resources.  When we were trying to get the Leixlip works refurbished and developed, we had a great struggle to get funding from the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.</p>  <p>  The supplies for our capital city and the mid-Leinster region were always on a knife edge while Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael gave huge tax concessions to their big businesses and big farming backers to the tune of &euro;5.5 billion in 2014.  At yesterday's meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, we heard how this tax expenditure could be underestimated by up to &euro;15 billion.  When Dublin city is compared with other European capitals we find that Paris, for example, has a 10% reserve of water for emergencies and any kind of natural disasters.  We never had that luxury.  I place responsibility directly with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which always discriminated against urban areas and particularly against Dublin.</p>  <p>  I always promoted publicly owned regional water structures, as led in our case by Dublin City Council.  The huge waste of tens of millions of euro on the failed Irish Water project is a stark indictment of this Government and the previous Administration.  Last night Deputy Boyd Barrett recalled the huge marches through our city and the other marches throughout the country in the massive Right2Water campaign over recent years and down to the general election in 2016.  I pay tribute to the valiant men and women in my constituency who went out quietly and peacefully and stood there in silent opposition to the installation of meters.  Their courage and bravery enabled us to ensure that hopefully, water will continue to remain as a public good.</p>  <p>  It is very striking that the British Labour Party is determined to renationalise Britain's water supplies.  This is based on the outrageous profits taken by private water companies.  They have taken billions of pounds out of the system while at the same time they have failed to maintain the network or deliver the expansion and renewal of the massive UK water networks.  Of course, Irish Water posted net profit of &euro;54 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the refund of domestic water charges paid during the period from January 2015 and March 2016.  Obviously, I welcome those refunds.  It also provides the legislative framework for the introduction of the majority of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services report, which was published on 12 April.  While the report contained some welcome recommendations, it continued to make reference to excessive use and sanctions for that excessive use. </p><p>As a result of that and for other reasons, I and 47 other Deputies voted against the report, yet the cosy coalition we have at present between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael ensured the approval of the report in the House.</p> <p> I welcome that citizens who paid their domestic water charges are to receive refunds before the end of the year, which will cost the Exchequer &euro;179 million.  Yesterday, we heard in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that this vast amount of money, which never should have been charged in the first place, has diminished the amount of fiscal space the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will have in a couple of weeks' time when he announces the budget.</p> <p> I have always had concerns about the efficacy of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, because I did not feel it ever regulated the energy sector that well.  Part 2, section 6, amends section 6 of the Water Services Act 2007.  Section 53A of the Bill allows for the Commission for Energy Regulation to be renamed the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and from next week, 2 October, it will also carry out reviews on the demand for water services over a 12 month period.</p> <p> Section 53A(5) and (6) cause me great concern.  Subsection (6) states: "Where the Minister after consideration of a subsequent report furnished to him or her under section 53A amends, at any time after the expiration of the period of 5 years commencing on the coming into operation of this section, an order made under subsection 1(a) or 4(a), he or she shall calculate the threshold amount by multiplying the average rate specified in the subsequent report concerned by a multiplier not exceeding 1.7."  That means the Minister of the day could say the multiplier must be reduced at any stage as a water conservation measure.  It is a clear attempt to bring back domestic water charges through the back door.</p> <p> The Right2Water and anti-water charge campaigners always supported improved infrastructure or water conservation and their campaign was built on opposition to the establishment of a massive new quango, Irish Water, and the unnecessary metering projects which benefited Mr. Denis O'Brien and his company, and the fact that general taxation measures including income tax, motor tax and high excise were already supposed to be funding water provision around the country.  The campaign fought for the fundamental principle that as perhaps the most important public good the water network would be funded from general taxation.</p> <p> The experience in the constituency of Dublin Bay North with Irish Water is not promising.  We have a bureaucratic rigmarole of contacting two councils, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, plus contacting Irish Water in relation to every water leak or other water problem.  Council staff seem to be carrying out most of the maintenance work, as they always did.  As my colleague said, they know the system and the network and their obvious expertise for developing and planning the Dublin and Fingal water networks seems to be wasted.  Is it the case that Irish Water has developed into a sort of ESB or Gas Networks Ireland company and is just in charge of capital development while in the case of my area the two local authorities carry out the essential maintenance and renewal of the water system?  If that is Irish Water's role, surely that could be better carried out on a regional basis under the direction of those two and perhaps the other two Dublin councils?  Why is a costly and totally unnecessary quango being inserted into the water supply system, given that the parties which proposed that were devastated in the 2016 election?</p> <p> I am also concerned about sections 12 and 13, which provide for allowances for household size and medical need, respectively.  Section 12 inserts a new section 53E into the 2007 Act setting the household number that is eligible for an allowance as more than four individuals.  The household will then have a new threshold amount and it is stated that it will only be charged if the amount is exceeded.  That will be a significant issue because of the current housing, homelessness and rental crisis around the country.  We have generations of families often living in the same household because they either cannot afford to rent somewhere, cannot find somewhere to rent, have lost their home, or are unable to buy their own home.</p> <p> In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, I have met constituents who are in situations where more than ten people are living in one house.  Therefore, the provisions are of concern.  On this side of the House, we fear the provisions could be used as a Trojan Horse to maintain, and in the future reintroduce, water charges.</p> <p> It was a recommendation from the joint committee that the remit of the public water forum would be extended to include engagement with Irish Water.  We have a number of bodies now in addition to that such as the water policy advisory committee and Irish Water itself.  Again, it seems we have set up a bureaucratic quagmire instead of what should be a relatively simple delivery system.</p> <p> It was deplorable that the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, listed up to eight matters for decision by the people in a referendum in 2018 and 2019 but the promised referendum on retaining Irish Water and the water supply in public ownership was not included.  The failure of the privatisation of the water supply in the UK and many other jurisdictions should make this referendum a priority.</p> <p> I stood in the general election as a Right2Change Independent candidate and I have been opposed to domestic water charges from the outset.  I believe the very high level of property tax levied across Dublin Bay North and then transmitted by Revenue to Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council should fund household water, drainage, public lighting and all other local services.  I will conclude by again calling for the abolition of Irish Water and for dedicated resources in our capital budget programme to improve water infrastructure around the country.  The ten-year capital investment plan from 2020 should prioritise public water and public transport services.</p></speech>

We called him the enforcer.  He left a mess behind.  He is on his fat pension now in the EU and he comes back an odd time to the ploughing match and other events and tells us what he is doing for Ireland.  It is a whole unmitigated mess.  I opposed the setting up of Irish Water with might and main because there was no need for it in the first place.  I saluted the county councils throughout the country, the group water schemes, the group scheme providers and the private individuals who had wells for all the infrastructure they had.  One would swear that when Irish Water came along there was not a pipe, reservoir, stopcock or tap but we are all going to the well to draw water with buckets and barrels and herding the cows into the river.  Insulting language was used at the time to denigrate what the councils had not done.  Every county councillor was insulted, as was every council official.  I worked with many good officials in my own county.  All the pioneers of the group schemes were also insulted.  All and sundry were insulted.  A mighty instruction was given.</p>  <p>  The board was set up with former county managers who had retired on pensions and retired departmental officials on pensions.  We did not have any of the group scheme co-ordinators or the people from rural water schemes.  It was a cosy cartel.  It was manna from heaven for the serial board members and the serial organisers who organised complete chaos.  That is why there was so much resistance from the public.  I do not say I supported any of the resistance that took place whereby working people were intimidated, bullied, threatened and spat at by so-called Right2Water campaigners who bullied and threatened them in their homes while the Garda was in the middle trying to keep the peace.  There is no place for that in a modern democracy.  What happened the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in Jobstown should not have happened.  It has no place in a democracy but it is still promoted by some of the parties present.  We see tonight a group of women who had abortions, whom we met today-----</p></speech>

The Acting Chairman might give me a bit of extra time.  We need the right to protest and the right to free speech.  We need to hear all sides.</p>  <p>  In this debate, we could not hear from all sides.  We never heard anything from the private well owners who have to pick up the tab.  We are told now that the Bill makes provision for an ombudsman through a commission for regulation of utilities in respect of dispute resolution for customers.  I am glad the Government has come around to this idea, given how remarkably similar it is to what I suggested in my Private Members' Bill on this issue, the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2014.  Back then they would not hear of it and it could not be countenanced.  On Second Stage of that Bill, I explicitly made the point that I wished to see the appointment of a dedicated water ombudsman.</p>  <p>  We heard from Deputy Barry Cowen last night and he assures me that a working group is now going to be set up to ensure fairness for rural dwellers.  I welcome that effort but I hate the mention of working groups.  I know it is in the Bill.  Working groups are another quango.  They are there to do what?  The Government should just give some semblance of fair play to the people and some respect for those who own wells and what they pay and how they pay.</p>  <p>  Three years ago, the need for a completely separate and independent water services oversight officer was starkly highlighted by the then ombudsman with respect to public services.  The number of complaints to the ombudsman about public services rose by 11% to 3,500 in 2014.  When he launched his annual report in 2015, the ombudsman stated that the increase was due to the additional 200 public bodies that came within his jurisdiction for a full year for the first time in 2014, which is very telling.  Through public bodies, public service is supposed to be given to the people.  Where is the service?  These included bodies in the education sector such as the State Examinations Commission and Student Universal Support Ireland.  My concern at the time, which this Bill seems to address, was how the ombudsman's office could deal with the inevitable flood of complaints regarding Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  I have always said that the only good part of the whole situation was the ainm - Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  There is nothing else.  We need a separate ombudsman or customer dispute process so we do not completely undermine and overload the current system.  That should be glaringly obvious when 200 bodies went under the ombudsman's remit in 2014.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  It has failed miserably to control energy costs with increases in gas, electricity and everything else.  It is just another quango.  It is people on boards again, getting paid and doing nothing.  The do-nothing brigade we can call them.  Before Irish Water was set up, the CER recommended that an economic regulatory framework for public water services in Ireland should be put in place, as it was for the electricity and gas sectors, based on four principles.  The ESB model should have been considered, admired and copied because it is a good model.  The four principles were stability, predictability, sustainability and cost efficiency.</p>  <p>  I know how stable the confidence and supply arrangement is with the Government in the current situation.  We saw how the water committee dragged out its deliberations for so long.  In the end, it came up with a mended pipe done by a bad joiner with faulty fittings.  It is just waiting to rupture again the next time the pressure comes on.  There will be another burst further down the line.  That is what we are operating on.  We have seen absolutely nothing of these things with respect to Irish Water and Government policy generally as it has lurched faster and faster from one crisis to another.  That is my honest belief.  I cannot support it now and did not support it then.</p>  <p>  There is no mention in this Bill at all of the workers in the county councils who now are very concerned.  Some of them have been transferred and more are about to be transferred.  They are in limbo.  When there is a break like the one we saw up in the north east, in Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's constituency, they had not even the parts and could not get them.  The knowledge the water caretakers had of every pipe and every main going through fields and under buildings and wherever else, is all lost.  There is a lack of goodwill as well because they have been mistreated.</p>  <p>  The public now will come up to a water caretaker or water worker and say there is a leak in such-and-such a place, which is good civic duty.  They will be told they cannot do anything about it.  They are told they must ring Irish Water and log in and complain and get a complaint number.  Such farcical baloney - I have never seen the like of it in my life.  It adds two or three days of a delay.  I have elderly women and younger people with water leaks undermining their houses, in some cases for months and months.  I am not talking about a small leak but huge flows of water.  They cannot be fixed because Irish Water cannot get around to it.  Irish Water can tell a person what county he is in, what parish, what the residence number is and everything else.  It is pure crazy, nothing short of it.</p>  <p>  It has just added another layer of bureaucracy between the people who do the work and the men above who give the orders.  There are many of them there, paper pushers as I said, and there are all the county managers.  Some of them have now left the scene again, including the former Dublin county manager and the one from my county.  I do not know what they contributed and look at all the pensions they went off with.  It is disgusting.  That is why people are so angry about the water.  As I said, they have a right to be angry.  Many of those people went out, had public meetings, got together and met politicians long before my time, 50 or 60 years ago.  They did group schemes themselves and laid the pipes with their bare hands.  In recent years there was some funding for grants which was then diminished and attacked alongside the establishment of Irish Water.</p>  <p>  I want to put some figures on the record.  Funding for the 2017 grant allocations to local authorities for group water and group sewerage schemes is a drop in the ocean in comparison to the cuts imposed on the schemes over the last number of years.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, confirmed that an additional &euro;3.676 million will be paid under the 2017 rural water programme on top of the &euro;11.6 million announced in June.  While an increase of &euro;3.6 million for the coming year is of course better than a cut, we need to remember that it was a Fine Gael-led Government that slashed almost &euro;50 million from the group water scheme from 2011 to 2016.  The information provided to me in a reply to a parliamentary question shows that in 2011 the Department funded all local authorities to administer the rural water programme to the tune of &euro;70 million.  By 2016 that amount had dropped to &euro;20 million.  All the while they were spending massive millions - &euro;590 million - on a metering programme and providing all the money for offices, consultants and all the now retired county managers and public officials brought in on boards and advisory groups.  It is a pure stinking quango.</p>  <p>  That &euro;50 million was taken away from the people and now we are saying we are going to set up a working group to look after them and make sure they are cherished equally.  It is an insult and a downright attack on the rights of rural people.  I am not saying everyone affected is living in the country: they are in villages too and in towns, and there are people in the cities who have a septic tank.  We had the septic tanks then, and Phil the Enforcer.  What does the Government plan to do there?  It is a cop-out and a con job of the highest order.  It was fiver Friday; Phil Hogan dropped it down from &euro;50 to a fiver one day under pressure.  He ran with his tail between his legs and we see him fleetingly at Carlow matches and other events but he is not welcome even back in his home county of Kilkenny.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, knows that as well as I do.</p></speech>

Returning to my figures, that is an astonishing gap of almost &euro;50 million which has still not been explained by any Minister.  It has been taken out of the supports for the rural water schemes, the private well owners and private sewerage schemes.  In Tipperary alone during the same period of 2011 to 2016, there was a reduction in payments under the rural water programme from &euro;1.953 million in 2011 to &euro;718,558 in 2016.  It was halved, and now they give lip service saying they are setting up a working group.  These are the people who do the work.  They sank the pipes.  They sank the wells.  They repaired the pipes.  They monitored and they metered.  If there is leaks, they fix them.  There is no messing going on there.  Now we are setting up a working group.  The Government insults them.  It says we are going to look at the situation.  It should give them back the money and give them some bit of respect for what they did and the pioneering way they worked.  It should respect the way they look after the water schemes.  They do not go ringing up the council or the local politician if they have a burst pipe.  They get the JCB hire themselves, pay for it themselves, go down in the drains and fix the pipes, and they are well able to do it.  We should salute them.  That is a shocking indictment and a con-job in respect of this Bill.</p>  <p>  I have a reply to a recent parliamentary question.  There has been a cut of &euro;1.2 million to Tipperary alone for those schemes and services.  While the &euro;415,000 that will be given to Tipperary County Council - the whole county, not just south Tipperary - is welcome, it remains a pittance in comparison with what was taken.  We can also see from the data provided that between 2015 and 2016, the amount paid to private well operators in Tipperary was down from &euro;92,905 to &euro;71,407.  That was another &euro;20,000 knocked off.  Sure, they do not matter.  We can prune them.  They do not care.  They will not go protesting.  They will not go up to Dublin and lock Joan Burton in anything.</p><p>They are good, decent, upright and civic-minded citizens who provide the water for themselves and do not mind providing it.  They are not anarchists who do not allow free speech and prevent everyone else from doing things any way other than their own way.  There is nothing worse than liberals who cannot get their way.  They are very demanding, badgering, insulting to other people and bullying.  There is nothing worse than them.  We hear them here every day of the week.  There is nothing worse than it.</p> <p> Stark figures that have been provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government prove that over the last five years, more and more responsibility was put on the operators of the group water schemes, who got less and less support from the Department.  I do not know how the Minister of State is going to wish that away.  He cannot do so.  The people out there are not fools.  They are waiting in the long grass.  They are fixing the pipes in the trenches and the drains.  They are not going to be kicked around or booted around like some African or Indian cult, or wild Indians that can just be dismissed.  They all vote too.  They are right to vote.  They are angry.  They are right to be cross.</p> <p> This wasteful Government established Irish Water, put the fat cats in place and wasted money on consultants.  It spent &euro;590 million putting in meters.  What is the problem now?  In my constituency - I cannot speak for anywhere else - the meters that are leaking outside many houses are damaging properties and entrances.  We cannot fix them.  The council is not allowed to fix them.  When we contacted Irish Water, it told us that the company which installed the meters has gone bust.  That is some public service.  That is some answer to give people, including me and many other politicians.  There is no one to fix the meters because the company has gone bust.  The council is not allowed to fix them.  It is a real "dog in the manger" job.  The water is flowing down the road.  Where is the wastage?  Where is the monitoring of waste?  Where is the fairness in that?</p> <p> The driveways of certain households have been completely destroyed by traffic because the council has lay-bys but the water leaks cannot be fixed.  We have been told that the company that installed the meters has gone into liquidation.  The county council's plumbers, caretakers and plumbers' helpers want to fix the leaks.  They are meeting people every day of the week.  They cannot bear driving past water leaks.  Their job is to make sure we have a supply.  They are denied the right to fix the leaks to which I refer.  It would not happen in a kindergarten of children of two or three years of age.  The departmental officials, the Government and the board of Irish Water are standing over that.</p> <p> We have no investment now.  We are short &euro;179 million as a result of the farcical repayments to almost 1 million people who paid their water charges.  It is a farce that this money is going to be given back.  We are going to give it back to them because of an agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  People do not want it back.  They paid it.  I would not say they were happy to pay it.  Upright and civic-minded citizens who always pay their way wanted to pay, but now they are getting their money back.  I am aware that when we were administering a repayment scheme here before, the then Department of Social Welfare had to hire an extra 100 staff.  It wanted an extra &euro;20 million to administer the scheme.  This money will not be repaid by October or November.  People will be waiting for Santa Claus for a long time.  If he is here by April Fools' Day, he will be welcome, but that will not happen.</p> <p> It has been suggested that this will cost &euro;179 million, but I know it will be a lot more.  There is supposed to be &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million in fiscal space, to use a dreaded term, but this will be taken out of it.  People are waiting for orthodontic treatment and for all kinds of operations, including cataract operations.  There are waiting lists for this, that and the other.  Schoolchildren cannot get into the National Educational Psychological Service programme.  We cannot get home help services because of cutbacks.  This kind of farce is going on in parallel.  This place up here has become a bit of a zoo.  I say that in light of the kind of disdain with which the public is being treated.  A working group has been set up to ensure there is fair play for rural people.  The rural people have awoken.  They are awake and they know what is going on.  They are not being fooled any more.</p> <p> I have referred to the &euro;496 million that was spent on the metering programme.  It was a waste.  I said it at the time.  I brought a meter into this Chamber and displayed it to the former Minister, Deputy Hogan, or "Big Phil" as I used to call him.  We heard that all the older meters which had been installed in certain places had to be taken out.  In some places, they had only been in for six months.  We were told they were defunct.  When we asked what was defunct about them, it was explained to us that an electrical device was necessary to facilitate drive-by registers.  That could have been fitted onto the existing meters using a small ready-made application.  The old meters have been taken up and thrown into the scrap truck.  In my area, they have been brought to the scrapyard in Clonmel.  All the steel meter covers that were put down to stop the lorries that go up on the footpaths from breaking them were also sold to the scrapyards.  What went on was a scandal.  All the meters that have been in place for three or four years have batteries with a maximum life of six, seven, eight, nine or ten years.  Another big expense will be put on top of the people when they are asked to pay for replacement batteries.</p> <p> People on group schemes mind their wells and treat them with respect.  They cover them at times of frost.  They look after the wells and ensure they are repaired when they fail.  When necessary, they get in plumbers to replace pumps, sometimes at a cost of &euro;3,000.  Those people are getting a working group, which is an insulting term, to look at their problems, which could take six or eight years.  A similar point can be made about the pipe to Dublin.  Approximately 45% of the water in Dublin is going to waste.  The Government will not fix the leaks.  It wants to sabotage water from Tipperary.  It wants to take over our water like Cromwell tried to take over Clonmel.  We resisted him, but we could not resist Big Phil when he diminished our local democracy.  He destroyed it completely.</p> <p> The people are waiting.  This saga is not finished.  The pipe to Dublin is another farce.  The plan is to pump the water up so that it can leak around the streets of Dublin city.  Have we ever heard anything to beat it?  The pipeline will be bigger than I am so that people will be able to stand into it and walk down it.  Compulsory purchase orders are to be used as a bully tactic to bring this pipeline through people's land to Dublin.  I do not deny the people of Dublin water, but they should fix and mind what they have.  I am not saying the residents should do this, but I am saying they should take some responsibility.  There should be a meter on every house so that people can monitor and check their water use.  Perhaps it could be somewhere near the ESB meter or under the sink.  Water is a valuable resource and should not be wasted.</p></speech>

I am saying that meters should be readily available to people so that they can see how much water they are using, just as they can do in the case of electricity.  There could be a pay as you go system.  I have never refused to pay for water.  I paid my own water rates.  I have been told that those moneys are going to come back to me.  I will be able to have a bit of a party.  I have a new grandchild since last week.  Maybe we will have a bit of a celebration for her first birthday, although it might be her second birthday by the time we are repaid.  My time is nearly gone.  It is probable that the Chair will not give me any extra time to make up for the interruptions.</p>  <p>  The jobs of the workers in the water services sections of the county councils, who were the pioneers, are now in limbo.  Some of them were transferred and more of them do not know where they are.  They are being bullied, threatened and intimidated.  I do not hear their union saying an awful lot about this.  The foot soldiers who fix the leaks in all kinds of conditions, thereby ensuring hospitals and industries etc. have water supplies, need to be protected, supported and treated with respect and dignity.  They need to be given some certainty.  They do not need a working group.  The Government might set up another working group for the workers.  There will be plenty of working groups but no one will be doing anything.</p>  <p>  I thank the Chair for his forbearance.  I think this is a farcical situation.  I certainly will not be voting for this sham of a Bill.  I wish the Government had accepted my Bill when I proposed it on Second Stage here.  Of course it has been buried like everything else.  The confidence and supply agreement is going to gush back and forwards.  Some day it will gush up on top of the Government and drown half of its members.</p></speech>

I want to begin by saluting the Right2Water campaign and the hundreds of thousands of people across this country who marched in every county as part of that campaign.  They marched in our capital city of Dublin on many occasions.  They stood up to Irish Water and to a Government that wanted to impose huge austerity on them through water charges and they won.  I was proud to be part of that campaign.  I was proud of the people who prevented Irish Water from installing meters on their estates.  They stood up for their neighbours.  They stood on meter boxes to ensure meters would not be installed.  They stopped the attempt to install meters and force water charges on people who were already significantly affected by austerity.  Water charges were toxic, are toxic and will be toxic in the future.  I have no doubt that any future attempt to reintroduce water charges by the back door this year, in 2019 or five years down the road will be defeated again by those who are absolutely committed to ensuring they are treated properly.</p>  <p>  People should not be forced to pay water charges because they are an unfair form of double taxation, especially at a time when very wealthy people in this country are treated differently from the ordinary man and woman in the street.  During the recent years of the economic crash and the so-called "recovery" we are having at present, very wealthy people have increased their assets by more than &euro;35 billion by comparison with the assets they had at the height of the boom.  They pay absolutely no tax on that wealth.</p><p>We heard recently that this country has 850 millionaires.  I was told by a former Minister for Finance that 20,000 people are earning &euro;495,000 per annum.  We have a situation where the gap between rich and poor is continuing to widen.  This so-called recovery is exacerbating that divide and there is no doubt but that recent budgets, and the policy of this Government and the previous Government, have contributed to that and have resulted in ordinary people - social welfare recipients, PAYE workers, people on low incomes and poor people generally - being treated despicably but they treated very wealthy people with kid gloves and ensured they made huge fortunes in recent years.  I salute all those people who came out and stood up for themselves and their neighbours and defeated Irish Water, defeated the Government and defeated these water charges.<br/><br/>There should be no need for this legislation because when Members returned to this D&aacute;il after the 2016 election, 90 Deputies were committed to the abolition of Irish Water and water charges.  We should have gone ahead and done what those 90 Deputies had promised the public in that general election.  However, the Government wanted to be in a position to impose water charges, if not immediately then down the road.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il, whose manifesto stated it would abolish Irish Water and water charges, let the Government off the hook and then joined it in a situation where it is now attempting to bring in water charges by the back door.  There is no need for it and if we were a proper democracy and if this House had any respect for itself, it would have abolished water charges over 12 months ago when we came back after the last general election.<br/><br/>As a company, Irish Water is toxic.  It was toxic from day one, especially when we heard the managing director of Irish Water tell the entire country on &quot;Today with Sean O'Rourke&quot; that it spent &euro;50 million setting up the company by way of payments to consultants, and it has continued as it started.  There is no transparency in Irish Water.  It has no local offices and no local contacts.  Local people who have a problem with water or wastewater services have to telephone what is effectively a receptionist who is not able to give them any information and does not know the geography of the country.  Nobody, not even public representatives, can talk directly to somebody who knows the situation on the ground.  That is hugely frustrating for people, particularly for those who have difficulties whether it be a leak, a sewage problem or whatever.  In my experience, Irish Water has no regard for people who have to deal with it and has no regard for public representatives.<br/><br/>I believe Irish Water should be abolished and that its abolition should be provided for in this Bill.  The abolition of Irish Water is essential for the development of water and wastewater services because it is toxic and will always be toxic.  Responsibility for providing those services should be returned to local authorities, as was the case in the past, and that local authorities should be funded properly to deliver those services.  Local authorities were starved of funding over recent years and that was used as a stick with which to beat them.  We heard that they did not do this, that and the other.  How could they do anything when they were not funded by successive Governments?  Even in the good times they were not funded properly by the Government of the day.<br/><br/>I pay tribute to and thank the local authority staff who are effectively carrying out the work of Irish Water on the ground.  Only for those staff, the situation would be much worse, and people's frustration and anger would be much worse.  Unfortunately, some local authority workers have to deal with anger and frustration from people who are clients of Irish Water and who need work to be done by Irish Water.  I am aware that in Tipperary, and I am sure it is the case across the country as I have heard it from other Deputies, were it not for the local authority staff who are now under contract to Irish Water, the situation in local areas would be much more difficult.  Irish Water should be abolished and responsibility for the services provided by Irish Water returned to local authorities.<br/><br/>This Bill has no reference whatsoever to the question of a referendum to put water in public ownership.  This is something to which, supposedly, every Member of this House has agreed.  The Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services of which I was a member unanimously agreed on the question of a referendum to put water services in public ownership.  Second Stage of a Bill was passed in the House for the same purpose but that seems like years ago now.  It is certainly a long time ago and it is probably sitting on a shelf in some Department.  There is certainly no urgency about it.  It is clear from the discussions in Cabinet in the past week or ten days that a referendum on water is not on this Government's agenda.  I will table an amendment on this issue to propose a new section which will state:</p><blockquote>Within six months of the passage of this Act by the Oireachtas, the Government shall propose that the following clause be inserted in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and a referendum shall be held on the proposal: &quot;The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  The Government shall ensure in the public interest that this resource remains in public ownership and management.&quot;</blockquote><p>Accordingly, all water services currently provided by the State through Irish Water, local authorities and State agencies shall remain in public ownership in perpetuity.  Such services shall not be carried out by any privately owned company under contract to the above agencies.<br/><br/>The nub of the question is what Fianna F&aacute;il will do about a referendum.  Will it let the Fine Gael-led Government off the hook, demand that a referendum take place or join with the Government in refusing a referendum?  Every Member in this House, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Members, have agreed that a referendum should take place but a referendum will only take place if Fianna F&aacute;il states it seeks a referendum.  It has to make that decision.  Will it cave in the way it caved in on the charges at the committee?<br/><br/>I will be opposing the Bill because it is perfectly clear that its purpose is to allow for the phasing in of water charges over time, probably after the next general election.</p><p>This so-called excessive use charge is in fact a Trojan Horse and, as I said, a back door to phasing water charges back in over time, probably after the next election.</p> <p> The Bill is the outcome of bizarre developments at the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, at which Fianna F&aacute;il caved in to Fine Gael, voted against several of its own amendments and reneged on its election manifesto in respect of the abolition of Irish Water and water charges.  It is quite clear that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted on this issue, which is why I raise the question of the referendum.  Can Fianna F&aacute;il be trusted on the referendum issue?  Will we have a referendum?  Will Fianna F&aacute;il demand, through the supply-and-confidence arrangement it has with the Government, a referendum to enshrine public ownership of the water network in the Constitution?  Fianna F&aacute;il certainly needs to step up to the plate on this.  At the committee, as I said, a series of bizarre events occurred.  Fianna F&aacute;il voted against several amendments it put forward itself and, of course, all the roll-back amendments at the committee and in the report were supported by the Greens and the Labour Party.  Cynically enough, the Labour Party and the Greens, which are hardline supporters of charging households for water, having supported all the roll-back amendments, then voted against the report.</p> <p> It is important to recognise that significant gains have been made by the anti-water charge campaigners.  For example, there will be no immediate return to general water charges.  Those who did not pay will not be pursued and those who did pay will receive refunds, and that is only right.  The metering of additional existing and unrefurbished dwellings remains halted.  The anti-water charges campaign has also achieved an increase in allowances - this is in the report as well - for group water schemes.  However, this Bill is the outcome of the U-turns on the amendments at the committee.  This Bill and the committee's report make domestic water services a tradeable commodity under EU law.  Payments for excessive use to Irish Water commodifies water, and this facilitates the phasing back in of water charges over time.  As provided for in the Bill, the Government can reduce the free allowance, thus making increasing amounts of water chargeable to more and more households.  This may also be used to prevent the holding of an anti-privatisation referendum, to which I have already referred, or any attempt to do so, or to change its wording as new private suppliers of water are entitled to enter the market under EU competition law.  It is, therefore, very important that the referendum is agreed and brought forward rapidly.</p> <p> In my view, and as accepted right across the country, this excessive use charge is really a backdoor to the reintroduction of water charges.  The term "excessive use" is simply not correct.  All the evidence shows that Irish people use less water than most, if not all, other countries - certainly most: 123 l per person per day here as against 146 l in Britain.  Figures for other countries could be cited.</p> <p> There is also the question of the unmetered properties.  Thankfully, the metering has stopped; the Right2Water campaign forced it to stop.  It is now proposed to discriminate against people whose properties are metered.  They can be charged for excessive use under this Bill whereas people whose properties are not metered cannot.  The key fact in this is that the Government of the day, no matter its hue, can change the rules, reduce the multiplier, reduce the threshold for excessive use and, in this way, over time, effectively introduce water charges on a much wider scale across the community by the backdoor.</p> <p> As I said, the purpose of this Bill is quite clear: to allow the phasing in of water charges by the backdoor over time, probably after the next election.  This issue will not go away, whether it is brought forward again in one, two, five or ten years.  Water charges are toxic, and any Government that brings in these charges.  Any Opposition that allows it to do so will pay the price at the ballot box.</p></speech>

People have different positions on the matter, but neither one side nor the other can avoid the facts.  While the setting up of Irish Water was a necessary and good thing, it is failing particularly in its duty of care to the people.  While we have been sitting here, I have got a freedom of information request back from Irish Water.  It has been with Irish Water for two months but a response has just come in now.  It contains the facts of what happened when the pipes in Staleen near Donore in Drogheda, County Louth, burst last year and the year before, what Irish Water did and, more importantly, what it did not do.  It shows why we need an organisation such as Irish Water working efficiently and effectively with a proper, thought-through plan and in co-operation with all the other statutory and voluntary agencies in order to ensure we have a proper water supply in our country.  Irish Water was set up because our water supply needs proper funding, which it does not have.  Irish Water was set up because local authorities did not have the capacity or the professional engineering skills, depending on the part of the country or the county in which one lived, to supply the proper and necessary infrastructure, to design that infrastructure or to co-operate with other local authorities.  It was, therefore, a very good idea to set it up.  Irish Water was set up after due consideration by me in my capacity as a Minister of State at that time, and there are people in this Chamber who know exactly what I said and advised and what happened and what did not.</p>  <p>  We must deal with what we have; we must deal with the facts.  When the water supply failed in Staleen in 2016, Irish Water found what it called a highly unusual and very rare pipe.  Irish Water knew it was 50 years old a year before the pipe burst again, knew it was highly unusual and knew there were no spare fittings for it.  What did Irish Water do about that?  Absolutely nothing.  It had a pipe that was vulnerable, that could not be replaced and that was likely to burst again left metres deep in the ground.  What happened when it burst the second time, on Thursday, 20 July, in the evening?  For Friday, 21 July, Saturday, 22 July, Sunday, 23 July, and Monday, 24 July, there are no records that have been delivered to me of Irish Water taking any action at all or knowing anything about this.  We then find, thankfully, that at 11 a.m. on 24 July - five days into the incident - an incident management team was set up.  Irish Water is guilty of not being effective, not doing the job it was set up to do and not being aware or involved in this regard.  While up to 60,000 people were without a proper and adequate water supply, at least according to the figures Irish Water has supplied to me, nobody in the company kept a record of anything that was happening up to that time.</p><p>On 26 July, six days later, in the middle of a huge water crisis, the HSE contacted the Irish Water incident team to say that the company should have been using the available HSE emergency services.  I emphasise the latter because it means Irish Water had not contacted the HSE.  The next day, 27 July, seven days after the incident, the great and good in Irish Water were "looking at the previous incident", which had happened a year earlier, to see if there were any lessons they could learn from it.  Unfortunately, that is the damning indictment of Irish Water that I am uncovering right now.  There is a lot of other stuff in the reply.  I do not have time to read all of the information supplied now but I will do so in the future.</p> <p> What we have here is a body that was properly set up, that was given the resources it needed - or so we thought at the time - that had joined-up thinking, that would bring to the table a professionalism and a skill set at the highest level and that could deal with what it was set up to deal with, namely, to look at where supplies were vulnerable and discover how they could be maintained and improved.  If I was to give a mark out of ten or out of 100 to Irish Water in respect of its emergency planning, structure and capacity to react, I would give it zero if I was to give it a mark at all.  There are huge issues with Irish Water.  I am shocked by the information to which I refer.</p> <p> Where does this leave us?  We hear the argument, almost like theology or a religion, that there should be no charges under any circumstances.  The alternative that some people argue for is the free market.  What we need is something in between, which is what I thought we were setting up but which has not proven to be the case.  While I disagree with many previous speakers, I think Deputy Mattie McGrath was right when he talked about the way people were treated by Irish Water, the arrogance of the company in the way it went about its business, its insistence on using consultants and its lack of proper organisation.</p> <p> One of the key points I made while the company was being set up was that it needed a proper, professional communications strategy but it did not have that.  I warned Irish Water, the Department and the Minister of day, Mr. Hogan, who is now European Commissioner.  I told Mr. Hogan that it would be an unmitigated disaster in light of the way matters were proceeding.  Needless to say, I was not listened to and hubris and arrogance won out over logic and concern for ordinary people.  That is a fact.  I am on the back benches today maybe because of that or maybe not.  However, I can tell the House one thing, namely, I and others worked very hard to set up this organisation properly in order to ensure that our infrastructure was improved, that it was properly and fairly funded, that people would have a free allowance, and, in particular, that vulnerable people and those who were sick would be looked after.  If people wasted water, they would pay for it but they would have adequate water to live an ordinary life.  I believe that the volume we were talking about at the time was two bath loads for every person in a house per day, which was to be free and, after that, people would pay.  If they had medical problems or other issues, they would be dealt with honestly and sympathetically.  Instead, look at what we got.</p> <p> One of the things I argued in respect of - although, again, the hubris and arrogance won out - related to how Irish Water would function.  This goes to the heart of the argument about privatisation.  At the time, we believed Bord G&aacute;is had the capacity to bring extra skills into play because it had managed the gas network and, so, should have been able to manage a water network.  It also had a very good customer service support system and it had all the professional skills we thought were needed.  At the heart of the principle of setting up Irish Water was that it would be an absolutely stand-alone organisation, supported by Bord G&aacute;is while it was being set up, but completely separated as soon as reasonably possible, which at the time was thought to be a year or, at the very most, two years.  It would be separate, so people could see what it was, and it would be transparent and accountable.  Instead, the decision was made to incorporate it into this other group of companies called Ervia.  People might say that is a moot point but it is not; it is a key point.  The belief I had in setting it up was that if it was transparent, accountable, stand-alone and separate, everybody could see what it was, everyone would know what was going on and the people could and would trust it.  That did not happen.  One of the reasons for this was that the games that were going on were power plays between different organisations as to who would be the lead, who would be the manager and who would be the overall director or controller, and all that cant and hypocrisy.  All the while, needless to say, the people were losing confidence in the organisation.</p> <p> I always believed, and believe today, that the question of privatisation was a key issue and that Irish Water must never be privatised.  Yet, although it was agreed that would be the case in the discussions I had, it never appeared in the legislation.  The day I was handed the Bill in the Seanad, it did not contain what was promised.  Imagine that.  I know there are others who were Ministers of State and who left without necessarily wanting to go.  Was Deputy McGuinness sacked like me or did he just leave?</p></speech>

They would say, "What the hell is going on here?  What is happening?"  Eventually, in fairness, the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, insisted it would change.  However, I agree and accept that Irish Water should be totally separated from Ervia.  Then, we would never have all that rubbish about people getting extra pay because it was linked to pay in some other organisation and all the stuff that went on, which was a disgrace.  None of that would have happened.  The point now is that we have to ensure that what is left of the organisation, bad and all as it is, changes.  The legislation before us is worthwhile and important.  However, it is also important that we win back the confidence of the people, which the organisation does not have.</p>  <p>  I want to make a couple of points that relate to the setting up of the organisation.  I sat where the current Minister of State sits and, at the time, I was made a promise, which I was told would be honoured, that people in this House would have the phone numbers of their local contractor for Irish Water.  If anybody here has them, they might put up their hands because I do not have them.  Does anybody have them?  No, they do not and they will never bloody get them because those contractors do not want anyone to have them.  They do not want people to contact them or to know who they are.  In fairness, when I phone or email Irish Water, as I often do, there is a very good phone service and it will reply to me.  The situation with the contractors is very poor and is not acceptable.  There was to be an accountable manager, an individual in each county who people could ring and who would come back to them on all those issues.  That has not happened and it needs to happen now.</p>  <p>  While I want to compliment Irish Water on many of the significant things it has done in my constituency, I remain disgusted that there has been no response some six months after I wrote to it on behalf of the Dee and Glyde Fishing Development Association.  We all know inland fishermen are good, committed, community people.  The association had a proposal to improve the riverbed and the fishing capacity relating to the river, and letters have been going over and back for six months between Irish Water and an organisation called Louth County Council.  I gave a list to the Dee and Glyde Fishing Development Association of 16 emails we have written.  The association will meet again tomorrow night to see what the hell is happening with its very fine proposal to use a vacant space beside a water treatment plant in order that people might park safely there and fish.  This would obviously add to the quality of life of these very fine people.  Nobody has contacted them so they keep ringing me.  I keep writing the letters but without result.  That has to change.  I discussed with the representatives of the association what I would say in the House because I think it is important that it is said here.</p><p>There is an awful lot of work to do.  At the heart and soul of it is a lack of commitment within Irish Water to public representatives.  There is arrogance still at the heart of Irish Water.  In my view there is despair.  There are some 40 or 50 pages here about what it did and did not do and I have just picked out some of the key points such as lack of organisation, no plan, no communication, no involvement with the emergency HSE service and no corporate memory.  The pipe collapsed one year ago which was a rare, unusual and special incident.  Another bit of this pipe could not be had and Irish Water did nothing.  I know that I am repeating myself.  Irish Water did nothing but expects us to swallow all the crap it gives us.  We survived.  The Members here are all politicians like me.  We in Drogheda survived that but it was very difficult, especially for people who are vulnerable.  It was difficult on all the public representatives because we did not have proper communications.  It is exceptionally clear that there is a lack of joined up thinking between Irish Water and local authorities.  The lack of communication between Irish Water and the council, evidently lacking in the documents I have here, shows that they were asleep, were afraid to ring or were afraid to make contact.  I challenge them now to come forward and own up and to put in place a rational plan that works for the future and for Drogheda, where there is a pipe 50 years old and which could go again.  I know that Irish Water has committed to investing &euro;2.5 million for putting a new pipe in place there but all around the country, in Members' constituencies and in mine, somewhere there is an underground pipe - just like the one in Staleen - that will burst.  There is no money to fix it and there is no pipe to fix it either.  That is where we are.</p> <p> In properly funding Irish Water, which is what I was about and am still about, changes must take place within the organisation around transparency, accountability, responsibility, communication and capacity to listen.  The biggest problem that Irish Water has is that it does not want to listen and it does not want to know.</p> <p> I stand over what the Government is doing and I stand over everything I did.  I stand over everything I believe because I know that what I was saying and doing was true.  If it had happened - but it did not - then Irish Water could have been an organisation we were all proud of instead of the exact inverse and opposite.  It is, however, never too late to learn.  Other people have sat in the seat where I now sit.  I welcome the Minster of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, Deputy Damien English, who lives in the same county as Staleen where the pipe is.  His constituents get the same water supply as my constituents.  It could happen again, it could happen tomorrow and it could happen to all of us.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for his help and his communications to me during that time.  I also thank the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for his immediate and urgent responses to any requests I made at that time.</p> <p> I believe the system can and must change, but we must also face the reality and accept the ultimate, absolute truth that the water supply can only be improved if the money is there to fix it.  Relying on direct taxation as we do now is not the best way of doing it.  It is not sustainable in the long run if the people who use the most water pay the least.  This happens.  I was in Brussels last week and in a railway station I saw an advertisement that said nearly 58% of the water wasted in Belgium is wasted by some 8.9% of the people.  There is a lot of abuse and wastage.  If we tackle that waste issue, which is the Government's intention with this legislation, and if we bring people onto our side I still believe it could happen, notwithstanding those who say it is never going to happen.  It must happen but until it does happen people must accept that there have to be changes.</p> <p> I do not wish to put words into Deputy Broughan's mouth but when he spoke earlier - I will check the Official Record and I have no doubt he will also - I believe he said that water should be paid for from the property tax.  If this is what he said then he is really saying that there has to be another form of taxation other than direct taxation for water.</p> <p> If we look at those issues, if people think it is fair and if they can see why it has to be done, then I believe we can still win them over to our side.  There is no point in telling people lies or telling them it is going to be right tomorrow when it is not right today, because it will not be.  All the Deputies who are in the Chamber and those who are not might, when their pipes burst, remember what I am saying to them.</p></speech>

It is important, nevertheless, and the handling of it in recent years represents a dramatic public policy fiasco.</p>  <p>  It is also one of the few areas where there was a substantial policy debate during the last general election with the decisive result in favour of ending current policy.  The people, some more boisterous than others, engaged with politicians but the message was loud and clear: Irish Water was a fiasco.  People were told their taps would be turned down to a trickle by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, but the scare mongering did not work.  Every single claim made by Irish Water has failed.</p>  <p>  The EUROSTAT test failed as Irish Water could not and did not raise major funding for investment.  It created a national organisation dedicated to billing rather than service provision.  The previous Government&rsquo;s policy was to allow Irish Water massive commercial freedom even though it would be funded primarily by direct state subvention and would take many years to bring services to the level they themselves define as acceptable.</p>  <p>  Had Irish Water been a State agency the uncontrolled expansion of management, the bonus culture, the waste, the secrecy, the massive and rising payments for lobbying and many other practices would not have been possible.  Equally, the disdain for democratic accountability would never have been allowed.</p>  <p>  We needed to end this failed regime and move on from this issue once and for all.  Water charges have failed miserably.  In 2015 only 53% of bills were paid with annual revenue of &euro;144 million on this basis.  Some &euro;100 million was spent on the water grant.  Where else in the world could one leave a tap on all night and be rewarded with a &euro;100 conservation grant?  It did not add up and I often wonder how many people claimed the grant who did not pay any charges at all.  The charge hit those least able to pay and was deeply regressive.  Abolishing the last unfair water charging regime was a key Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  We engaged, we debated and we gave value for our vote.  We represented the voters in making sure that water charges would be resigned to the scrap heap.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to making tangible and sustained improvements to our health services.  I believe genuinely that the Sl&aacute;intecare report now provides a framework and a direction of travel to do this.  We have a level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report that is unprecedented in the House.  I am determined to harness this consensus by working with colleagues across the political spectrum and all other stakeholders to move forward on this very important agenda.</p>  <p>  The Government has already approved the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  That happened at its last meeting before the summer recess.  The office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It will be led by a senior executive with a strong track record in implementing reform.  Work is under way between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that we are positioned to attract candidates of this high calibre for one of the largest public service reform processes ever undertaken in this State.  It is essential, therefore, that we get this recruitment process right.</p>  <p>  In parallel, work is under way in my Department to develop a detailed response to the report for consideration by the Government in December.  The Deputy will remember that the report itself talks about the delivery by the programme office of a draft implementation plan by the end of the year.  This plan will seek to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years.  It will consider the issues that arise in designing such a programme, including key actions, deliverables, costings, timelines and key performance indicators.  It was acknowledged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that more detailed consideration of these issues was required and it is important that this work is undertaken now.  My Department will involve professionals with significant experience of developing implementation arrangements for major change projects.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that there will be significant challenges to overcome to effect deep and systemic change in our health care system, but we have no choice and must begin the change process now.  It is one of the Government's key priorities.  The focus now must be on ensuring that the implementation phase is properly designed and that a clear implementation plan is developed as quickly as possible.  As I said, I expect to have the implementation plan by the end of the year.</p></speech>

Given the broad cross-party consensus, it is something into which we can all buy.  In that context, there were a number of issues which were the subject of protracted debate in the committee which prepared the report.  One key recommendation as a result was the elimination of private care in public hospitals.  There was a great deal of debate on that issue.  Concerns were also expressed, however, that there could be unintended consequences.  With that in mind, the committee acknowledged that it would be complex to remove private care from public hospitals and stated that there was a need to set up a process to analyse the impact it could have on services recruitment, as well as other unintended consequences.  How far along is the Minister in establishing an independent impact analysis of the separation of public and private care, in particular with reference to the difficulty of recruiting and retaining consultants and other unintended consequences?  It is a key area which must be addressed very quickly.  It is a fundamental part of the overall Sl&aacute;intecare report's recommendations.</p></speech>

As a member of the committee which published the report, he will be more familiar even than me with the debates which took place.  The call for an impact study by the committee was sensible.  We all want to get to a position where we can decouple the public from the private; certainly, I do.  It is ethically questionable that we have a situation in the Irish health service today where emergency departments are crowded, there is a shortage of beds and public waiting lists are long while private practice carries on unabated and, sometimes, unchecked within public hospitals.  None of us feel that is fair.  The issue is exactly as the Deputy suggests.  What would be the consequences of doing that, what road should we travel and how are these things to be disentangled?  That is likely to take a number of years to determine, which is why the best thing to do is establish the independent impact study to provide a full appraisal of all of the facts.  I spoke about this at the Health Management Institute of Ireland conference this week and expect to be in a position to announce details of the impact study in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It provides the Minister with a platform and opportunity to tell the House all of the good news he has on recruitment and, specifically, retention measures for staff.  My understanding is that we are losing consultants and other health care professionals as fast as they are coming in due to the poor quality of the working environment.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800031#DD01600"><p>There is a degree of chicken and egg in this case.  The Deputy referred to the poor quality work environment but to improve that we need more people to work in the public health service.  I appeal to people, in particular our young graduates from nursing and medical school, to work with us and to give the Irish health service a chance as we enter a period of reinvestment.</p>  <p>  The staffing environment of the HSE is dynamic and subject to significant service demands.  When a position is vacated, work may be covered through a variety of measures, such as redeployment, restructuring or reallocation.  It may also be necessary for duties to be covered by agency staff or through overtime arrangements.  The HSE does not operate a vacancy rate, as the question terms it, but rather records a staff turnover rate.  The HSE estimates that the adjusted turnover rate for 2016 was 5.7%.  This means that, each year and at any one time, people will be moving in and out of about one in 20 posts across the health service.  This can be for a range of reasons.  People may simply move to a new location while remaining within the HSE.  Other reasons include retirement, resignation or taking up other types of leave such as maternity leave.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, there are difficulties in filling consultant posts in certain specialties and locations.  Approximately 200 such posts may be vacant at any one time.  However, most of these are filled on a locum or agency basis to ensure continued service delivery.  The figures at the end of July 2017 show that there were more consultants employed at that point than at the same time last year.  They also show that the number of consultants in the service has increased by more than 700 in the past decade.  The number of non-consultant hospital doctors has also increased year on year.  I note also that there were over 36,000 nursing and midwifery staff members in employment at end July 2017.  This is an increase of more than 700 in the past 12 months against a backdrop, as the Deputy rightly points out, of intense global competition.  Under the agreement reached with the nursing unions earlier this year, the HSE has developed a funded workforce plan for an additional 1,224 nursing and midwifery posts in 2017.</p><p>One element of this workforce plan is that of agency conversion.  I am supportive of the efforts being made in converting agency staff into permanent posts.</p> <p> The Public Service Pay Commission did not find that the rate of staff turnover in the health sector gave cause for concern generally.  However, it did identify problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups, including nursing, which are internationally in demand.  The commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties and is committed to reporting on several health sector grades in 2018.</p> <p> I welcome the fact the health sector unions voted in favour of the public sector deal in the knowledge that this body of work will take place at Public Service Pay Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800032#EE00200"><p>If pay were the only issue, it would be sorted by now.  However, it is not.  Poor working environment is also an issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister is right that it is a chicken and egg question.  We do need people to come and work in our health service.  I note the Minister issued an appeal to graduates.  I would appeal to him to make their workplace more appealing and, thereby, encourage more of them to work in our health services.  We will not be in a position to implement the maternity strategy or any of the other documents that sit gathering dust on shelves in the Department of Health unless we have the staff to so do.  Recording vacancy rates is important because it will identify where we have staffing deficits.  While talking about staff turnover and where those staff might be going, the evidence is that staff are leaving the health service to work in the private sector or abroad.  We also know that we have a problem with consultants who are practising but are not on the specialist register.  I have not seen any proposal to address this.  This issue will get worse because a situation will arise whereby they will drift into a legal entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration unless something is done to ensure they are converted.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give the figures on the conversion of agency staff to directly employed staff?  If he could give that information in hours it might be helpful.</p></speech>

We are moving ahead with the plans to relocate one of our stand-alone maternity hospitals to an adult acute hospital site.  We will be publishing an implementation strategy for the national maternity strategy in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  My message to young graduates is simple.  They will have more colleagues working alongside them in their hospitals this year than last year.  If they work with us, they will have more people working alongside them next year than this year.  We are back reinvesting.  Health Ministers in years gone by could not offer young graduates a full-time permanent contract if they worked in the health service.  This is now happening.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is not all about pay.  The recruitment and retention process which will be undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission, in consultation with the unions, will not just be about pay either.  Some of our nurses are coming back to the country, a fact we need to acknowledge.  I saw it when I went to a recruitment fair in the HSE.  I saw it recently when we took on 17 new nurses in Cork University Hospital to re-open critical care beds.  Six of those nurses were Irish who had been working in the UK but decided to come back.  The independent group set up to monitor the nursing pay agreement will publish its next report shortly, which I will lay before this House.</p></speech>

However, they are staying six months and then they are going on elsewhere.  This has been said to me on more than one occasion by nurses' representatives because that is what they see in their workplace.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that there will be a nursing commission.  We need a commission along the lines of the previous one to address this issue.</p>  <p>  I do not believe the Minister and the Government are doing enough to retain staff.  A clear message needs to be sent to the staff that their work is valued.  The feeling on the ground is that their work is not.  There are people working in our health service who are under extreme pressure.  They will tell the Minister that they are haemorrhaging staff left, right and centre.  We do not make it any easier for them.  It is taking months for staff to get full-time permanent contracts.</p></speech>

It was taking much longer previously, but it is still taking months to get a permanent contract.  They need to be issued as a matter of course.  If that involves devolving the authority to do so down to the level of hospital management, then that should be done.  The centralised recruitment process is not working.</p></speech>

I also signed a section 10 direction to the HSE.  The last time such a direction was signed by a health Minister was when Mary Harney brought about the policy of co-location.  It is the strongest instrument available to a Minister.  In this case, it delegates the sanction for the employment of nurses directly to directors of nursing, many of whom will be members of the nursing unions, such is the priority we are attaching to this.</p>  <p>  I am not suggesting we have enough nurses, midwives or doctors working in health service.  However, the facts matter.  There are more nurses working in the health service this year than last year.  I hope there will be more next year than this year.  There are more doctors working in the health service this year than last year.  I accept there are significant recruitment and retention challenges, not just in this country but globally.  One can ask how Britain is managing to recruit and retain nurses in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  There are many challenges with a mobile workforce.  We want them to stay in this country.  We have a new public sector deal, which has been accepted by unions.  We also have new career opportunities such as advanced nurse practitioners, the new community nursing scheme and the task force on skills mix to check how many individual nurses we need in each ward to ensure they are safely tasked.  There are several measures under way that will aid the recruitment and retention process in order that we will continue to see more nurses and doctors working in the health service.</p></speech>

Among its key responsibilities is the establishment and maintenance of a register of approved centres.  The Act also provides that the inspector of mental health services visit, inspect and report on every approved centre at least once every year.  Details of these inspection reports, including compliance issues, are available on the commission&rsquo;s website.  While the commission has the authority to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are provided, the enforcement powers of the commission only apply in the case of approved centres.</p>  <p>  As regards the regulation of community-based services by the commission, the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 examined this issue in detail in its 2015 report.  The expert group recommended that a proportionate and risk-based system of inspection should be developed by the commission.  This would include a phased introduction of registration and inspection of all community mental health teams.  In addition, all high, medium and low support hostels, crisis-respite houses, other residential services, day hospitals and day centres would also be subject to inspection and enforcement by the commission.</p>  <p>  The expert group also suggested that to enhance the standard of care provided in approved centres, the revised legislation should provide for the Mental Health Commission to make standards in respect of all mental health services and to inspect against those standards.  The standards would be made by way of regulations and the regulations would be underpinned by way of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 based on the recommendations of the expert group review of the Act are being progressed.  The Government approved plans to proceed with the general scheme of a Bill.  Officials are working on the heads of the amending Bill that will legislate for the recommendations of the review, including those relating to the proposed registration and inspection of community mental health services.</p>  <p>  My Department and I accept the importance of advancing this work as quickly as possible.  We acknowledge it is taking longer than stakeholders in this area would like.  That said, it is a comprehensive legislative undertaking, which must also now take account of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, enacted after completion of the expert group report.  I expect the text of the general scheme of a Bill to be significantly advanced by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The review group is now three years out of date.  As the Minister stated himself, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is beginning to become obsolete, which is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Over 90% of all people receiving supports received them in non-approved centres.  Only 10% of centres are actually approved and inspected.  The next Leas Cross will happen in people&rsquo;s homes because no inspections are being carried out and there is no risk that anyone will be caught.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has reiterated its call on the Government to give it powers to regulate community-based services with the increasing number of patients accommodated in those.  We had the policy of closing down the old Victorian hospitals, which was right, but adequate community supports are not being put in place.  No one is inspecting those supports being put in place.  There needs to be increased supports.  The Mental Health Commission is seeking regulatory powers and should be given to it.</p></speech>

I would like us to get to a position on enforcement.  The commission has the powers to inspect and visit those facilities if it wishes.  I met the Mental Health Commission last week and discussed this issue at length with it.  I am anxious to get this legislation in place.  It is a comprehensive piece of work.</p><p>There is a great deal of legislation before the Houses, such as a couple of amendment Bills put forward by the Deputy and Senator Joan Freeman's Bill.  There is much legislative work being undertaken and competing for time in the Department at present.  However, I am as anxious as the Deputy to get to this stage because I wish to see it regulated, with the powers of enforcement in place, to ensure we can guarantee safety and quality in the services we are providing.</p></speech>

Effectively, that is an attempt to force the Government's hand to bring forward the comprehensive Bill that is required to reform the Mental Health Act in light of modern human rights changes in that area.  Mr. John Saunders, chairman of the Mental Health Commission, said: "These community residences have become too large by accommodating too many people, creating a number of mini institutions... These residences are not regulated and yet they provide care to a large number of vulnerable people with mental illnesses."  The Minister of State must be aware of the comments of the Mental Health Commission.  These stem from the recent publication of a report on Roscommon mental health services.  The external review found that mental health services in the county were marked by control, negativity and a culture of blame.  The author of the report said that some senior staff normalised bad behaviour while others perpetuated it.  The evidence is available.  I have no doubt that what happened in Roscommon is happening in other parts of the country.  This issue will become worse and will perpetuate itself unless proper investigations and assessments are made in these areas.</p></speech>

My reference to the Deputy's legislation is by way of information.  There are a number of different, conflicting elements in trying to progress legislation as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the Roscommon situation.  I have discussed it with numerous people, including the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, who has a keen interest in it, and other Members from the area.  I will visit Roscommon next Monday to meet some of the people there, to hear about what is happening, to see what went wrong there and to ensure that the recommendations are fulfilled.  I appreciate the concern that this could be replicated in other parts of the country.  That concern is real and I share it.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State enlighten us on what is happening with Linn Dara?  Will the facility be fully staffed and opened in full?</p></reply>

There are currently 60 child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, beds operational nationally.  This is up from 48 in early summer and will increase further once Linn Dara resumes its full capacity of 22.  There are currently 20 operational beds in both Cork and in Galway, eight in Fairview and 12 in Linn Dara.</p>  <p>  In June last, due to staffing difficulties, some beds in Linn Dara could not take new admissions.  This, unfortunately, left Linn Dara with just half of its 22 bed complement operational.  For those discharged for clinical reasons, the HSE provided dedicated follow-on supports from the community-based CAMHS service, where deemed necessary.  The executive has also made available the CAMHS day service, as appropriate in individual cases, to enhance supports for young people and their families.  The operational difficulties that faced Linn Dara recently arose from problems in recruiting and retaining mental health professionals.  Staffing cover had to be augmented in recent times through methods such as staff working additional hours, overtime and engaging agency staff.  Funding availability is not the issue in this case. </p>  <p>  A phased opening of the closed beds in Linn Dara is planned for the week beginning 30 October, with a graduated increase in bed capacity.  The HSE aims to be back at the full capacity of 22 beds by mid-November.  This is similar to the approach taken when the unit increased bed capacity originally.  The HSE is required to provide advance notification to the Mental Health Commission of its reopening plan.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been exploring every option to resume normal operational levels and to maximise the use of Linn Dara in the future.  The executive has intensified its efforts on recruitment, and a number of staff have been identified to join the service.  The Deputy may rest assured that all efforts will continue to be made to address ongoing service difficulties at Linn Dara, with a view to reopening beds as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The problem is that the limits are very tight.  As in the earlier discussion about staffing and pay, everybody acknowledges that it is difficult to recruit and retain nurses in this country.  It is even more difficult to recruit and retain psychiatric nurses.  That is not because they have an aversion to working in institutions, hospitals and clinics in Ireland but because their pay and conditions, stress levels and the pressure on them are wicked.  They prefer to emigrate.  We are haemorrhaging nurses as a result.  Of the 17 nurses needed to staff Linn Dara so the beds can be reopened and be operational how many have been recruited?  I accept that the Minister of State is doing his best.  He says that every effort is being made and I do not doubt his sincerity, but one arm of the Government is saying it is doing its best to keep the service going while another arm, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is boasting about the new pay deal, which does not restore pay equality to nurses.  That is restricting the ability of the service to recruit in the manner it requires.  There are two different forces competing in tandem and that is wrecking fundamental and essential services such as the mental health services.</p></speech>

I met with the Psychiatric Nurses Association last week and listened to the challenges its members face.  I will continue that engagement.  I also addressed the conference of the mental health nurses this week.  I am familiar with the struggles and challenges facing them and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I are determined to continue to try to deal with them as best we can.  Hopefully, Linn Dara should be back at full capacity by mid-November.  I will welcome any efforts by the Deputy to ensure that happens and to hold us to account for that in the meantime.</p></speech>

On the "Morning Ireland" programme today, the Ombudsman for Children said the Government will be called to the UN to account for the lack of services for children.  Linn Dara is a facility for adolescents with mental health issues.  Between June and August last, six young people committed suicide in the area between Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot where Linn Dara is located.  Tragically and shockingly, most of them were young women.  I am not saying all of them would have gone automatically to Linn Dara.  One has to be suicidal to get into that facility.  However, there are needs for mental health treatment which become apparent much earlier that are not caught by the system.</p>  <p>  The Government is being called to the UN so it can be told that it is failing young people and children.  That is happening.  Many issues affecting young people are not being caught early enough and the services are not available 24-7 so they can access them.  It is a tragic situation, and it will get worse.  The next generation is being reared through the austerity years and has seen special needs education at schools cut for eight or ten years.  There are also those who are living in homeless accommodation, not to mention those who are coming out of direct provision and from homeless services back into so-called normal living.  How will their mental health be dealt with in a system that is creaking and already failing?  The consequences are not just tragic, but criminal.  The UN will have to point this out to the Government when the Government is called before it.  Telling me that there are five nurses out of 11 does not tick the boxes for the reopening of all the beds required in Linn Dara.  It requires 11 nurses, not five.</p></speech>

However, I am assuring the Deputy that this is not an issue with funding but with the recruitment and retention of nurses.  There are improvements coming in that area.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern for the well-being and mental health of young people and I want to have the best system and a system we can be proud of.  Much good work is taking place and a great deal of money is going into it.  I want to ensure we are getting value for the money and that the services are being provided where they are needed.  Appropriate referrals is another issue, where people are left on inappropriate lists, are inappropriately referred and so forth.  There are many challenges within the system that go far beyond the issue of funding.  As I have said previously, the job would be very easy if it was just a matter of funding.  There are challenges which we are seeking to fix and I hope we can make improvements on them over time.</p></speech>

I am seeking specific information.  In December 2016, the Saolta University Healthcare Group wrote to the Minister seeking approval to carry out an options appraisal in respect of a new hospital.  The Minister waited five months before, thankfully, giving it permission to do so.  It is almost October 2017 and I ask specifically whether the options appraisal has commenced.  If so, when did it start, when is the completion date and who is carrying it out?</p></reply>

She is correct that in May I gave my approval to the Saolta University Healthcare Group to conduct an options appraisal in respect of the future acute hospital needs in Galway.  The structure of the hospital groups is such that my approval is not required for such an analysis to be carried out.  It is the responsibility of the hospital groups to carry out analyses of their needs.  The whole idea of establishing these groups was to avoid having everything being done centrally and to have the Saolta group and all other hospital groups examine their needs.  Nonetheless, I assured the Saolta group that any funding costs it incurred would be met and that continues to be the position.</p>  <p>  As part of the appraisal, the Saolta group is undertaking a medium-term planning project to assess the population health needs for University Hospital Galway's catchment to inform existing and future service needs.  I am informed by the group that this process will be completed by mid-2018.  I would welcome its completion as soon as possible, as would Deputy Connolly, because any further investment in Saolta hospitals will have to be considered by the Health Service Executive based on the strategic priorities put forward by the Saolta University Healthcare Group.  For this reason, we need to hear from the group what are its priority projects for further investment.</p>  <p>  In the interim, I have requested the Saolta group to provide a short-term plan for the University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park sites to maximise the effective use of both hospital sites to meet the demand for care.  The Deputy indicated to me previously that more could be done, even on a short-term basis, on the Merlin Park site. </p>  <p>  The Deputy clearly does not want me to speak about a number of other investments made in the Galway area.  However, a new 75-bed ward block was recently completed at University Hospital Galway and a new acute mental health department is expected to be operational by the end of 2017.  Planning is also under way for a new emergency department at University Hospital Galway.  I instinctively share the Deputy's view that the Saolta group needs to revert with its appraisal of its future options.  We have given it approval to complete this task and its work is under way.  I am informed the work will be completed by the middle of 2018.  The appraisal will inform us of what further investments we can and must make in Galway.</p></speech>

I also appreciate that he did not sidetrack from my question.  I asked him not to do so because of the urgency involved.  The Minister's party colleague in the Galway West constituency clarified through a question to the Minister that the hospital finds itself in the wrong position and unable to cope.</p>  <p>  Today, I attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts attended by representatives of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  I read some of the authority's reports on University Hospital Galway, one of which states, "The infrastructure and the design of the Paediatric Ward was outdated and as such had the potential to impact on effective infection control."  The accident and emergency department has reached crisis point, while two theatres have been closed at Merlin Park Hospital as a result of a leak in a roof, an issue I will raise later in the Topical Issues debate.  I could go on.  The Government clearly has a role in this matter given the substantial capital outlay involved in building a new hospital.  There are 150 acres available on the Merlin Park site.  Higgledy-piggledy development is no longer acceptable because it was this approach that caused the crisis in University Hospital Galway.  We want proper planning in Merlin Park rather than piecemeal development.</p></speech>

When people want responsibility to be devolved to the regions rather than exercised centrally, they must seize this responsibility.  I have given the Saolta hospital group approval for the appraisal, if it ever needed it, and an assurance that the Department will meet the funding costs required to carry out a proper detailed appraisal.  It will not only consider what projects need to be done immediately - some must be done and others have already been done - but will make a proper assessment of the planning and development of health services in Galway, which is a vibrant city and large county.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge some of the progress that has been made by front-line staff and management in University Hospital Galway in recent times.  The hospital is a pilot site for the national patient flow improvement programme and patient experience times have improved.  For example, compliance with patient experience times for all patients of less than 24 hours in the emergency department increased from 93% to 98%.  For those patients aged 75 years or older, compliance increased from 75% to 85% within the same period.  That is not something to write home or get excited about but it shows that targeted investment in pilot projects is leading to improvements. </p>  <p>  The new 75-bed ward block has been opened and 30 additional beds opened in early 2016 as part of the winter beds initiative.  A new clinical research facility has been delivered, the maternity unit has been upgraded and a cystic fibrosis outpatient department was completed in 2014.  I agree that a master plan is required and look forward to receiving it.</p></speech>

While a 75-bed unit was provided, the closure of two wards meant the hospital did not receive a single extra bed.  The new mental health facility has been delayed and will not open until the end of the year.  It also has implications for car parking at the site.  There are 40 patients on trolleys in University Hospital Galway, where the number of beds has been reduced from 812 in January 2006 to 655 at present.  We have a major crisis.</p><p>The Minister referred to good planning.  There has never been good planning regarding the regional hospital in Galway.  It has been forced <font color="#2F2F2F">&oacute; gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im go g&eacute;arch&eacute;im - from crisis to crisis - and has never had the luxury of long-term planning, nor the support of any Government.  With the exception of today, every time I have asked a question since my election almost two years ago, I have been given a list of positive developments that will make a congested site more congested.  Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that by mid-2018 we will have some answer with regard to planning for a new hospital on the 150 acres available at the Merlin Park site?</font></p></speech>

I would welcome the paper as soon as the Saolta group has completed it.  The paper will indicate to the Government, Oireachtas and HSE how the group would like to develop its services.  It is not for me to tell it how it should develop its services.  What is the point in having a group and people in positions to manage the service if I try to micro-manage services?  I have given the group the go-ahead in terms of funding to produce an options appraisal.  If that plan is delivered to me, I assure the Deputy that the Government and I, as Minister, will support proper planned development of health services in Galway.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  As the Deputy will be aware, the original emergency department at University Hospital Galway was constructed in the 1950s and upgraded in the late 1990s.  The department accommodates more than 62,000 attendances per annum and sees 130 patients on a weekend and approximately 270 patients every day during the working week.  We need proper planning in this area.  The position in Galway is a microcosm of the broader challenges we face in terms of proper, long-term planning.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800034#GG01200"><p>I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  We discussed this matter yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the importance of respite service provision for the families of children and adults with disabilities, including the impact the absence of respite service provision can have on other parts of the health service and the well-being of families.  As Deputies are aware, the provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in recent years.  More children and adults are now seeking access to respite and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact, as they, along with the rest of the population, thankfully live longer lives.  A Programme for Partnership Government recognises the need for respite services to be developed further and the Minister of State and I are committed to ensuring this happens.</p>  <p>  A number of factors impact on respite capacity.  A significant number of respite beds are regularly utilised to allow unplanned emergency admissions, leading to a decline in the number of available respite nights against planned activity.  As I indicated to members of the joint committee yesterday, one of my greatest concerns in respect of disability services is the large increase in the number of emergency admissions and the need to address this issue adequately.  The regulatory and policy context has also changed the manner in which residential and respite services is provided, as agencies must, correctly, comply with regulatory standards.</p><p>As a result, capacity has generally decreased with the requirement for personal and appropriate spaces.  Beds can no longer be used for respite where residents go home at weekends or for holidays.  This is an example of how additional beds are not available when they would have been previously.  It is not a criticism, only the reality.  Implementation of the national policy on congregated settings is also reducing available capacity.<br/><br/>In the HSE's social care operational plan for 2017, some 6,320 people with disabilities are expected to avail of centre-based respite services, totalling 182,506 overnights.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it is planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family.  It is also planned that a further 41,100 day-only respite sessions will be accessed by people with disabilities.  Furthermore, the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements, and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.  This marks a significant change in the way that respite services are delivered.<br/><br/>The most recent available data from the HSE indicate that 81,836 overnight respite sessions were accessed in the first six months of this year compared with 90,861 in the first six months of last year.  The number of day-only respite sessions accessed for the same period in 2016 was 22,351 compared with 22,051 in 2017.  The HSE is also developing an eHealth case management system, which will facilitate the tracking of all residential and home support-emergency respite services across all HSE divisions.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The HSE social care division has also committed to developing home sharing as a person-centred and community-inclusive type of support for people with disabilities involving the development of an implementation plan in 2017.  This will address the priority recommendations of the national expert group report on home sharing published in 2016.  It will be led by the national designated disability lead in this area.<br/><br/>The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.</p></speech>

I raised the case of Jacob Dooley, whose mother and father were in a desperate situation.  As often happens in such circumstances, they had to turn to the media just to get some movement on their son's case.</p>  <p>  I asked specifically about the number of hours provided compared with the number of hours requested.  My clear understanding is that the latter far outstrips the former.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, cited the figure of 182,506 overnights as representing some sort of progress, but we see the truth in our clinics and here.  People have protested outside Leinster House about the unmet need on more than one occasion.  Has anything been done to quantify it and, if so, will the Minister share the figures with us?  I believe that there is a large amount of unmet need.</p></speech>

In fact, she is entirely correct.  There is not a Deputy on this side of the House or the other who is unaware of the fact that there is unmet need.  To be honest, developing a policy to address it will be challenging.  The Deputy will be fair enough to acknowledge that this is not just a resourcing issue.  Also involved is the availability of beds, for example, where places that used to provide X number of beds can now only provide Y number due to regulatory standards.  Previously, a respite bed could be used at the weekend for someone who was normally there during the week, but that cannot be done now.</p>  <p>    The social care division of the HSE has committed to developing a number of proposals, including home sharing as a person-centred and community-inclusive type of support for people with disabilities, which will involve the development of an implementation plan.  This will address the priority recommendations of the national expert group report on home sharing published and will be led by the national designated disability lead in this area.  This could be a good thing, given that home sharing that is in compliance with new national standards will be developed.</p>  <p>  We also need to examine the number of emergency residential placements.  This year has seen an increase of 185.  It is a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and me in the context of budget 2018 because it has a knock-on effect on the availability of respite for children and young adults.  This is a challenging issue and the Minister of State is prioritising it.  We will continue to do what we can.</p></speech>

Home sharing relates to a situation whereby - this goes along with the decongregation agenda - one can safely and appropriately enable a number of people with disabilities to share a space within the community.  If I did not explain that clearly, I am happy to do so now.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct, and there is no point in beating around the bush.  There is no centrally maintained list of people awaiting these services.  It is not that I have an answer that I am simply not providing the Deputy.  This is done on a community health organisation, CHO, level.  As with our waiting list conversations, we must find a way of seeing the full range of needs.  The HSE is working on better co-ordination of the existing residential base through the establishment of a residential executive management committee in each CHO and the development of an eHealth case management system that will facilitate better and more effective management and tracking of all residential and home support-emergency respite services across all CHOs and for each funded service provider.  We do not want each CHO to be a silo.  This system will provide a detailed inventory and a bed registry map of current service capacity, which will help us to match capacity to demand.  I will be happy to share further information on this with Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>

Home care services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is currently no means testing.  The HSE-funded home help service is delivered predominantly by HSE staff or, in a minority of cases, private and not-for-profit providers.  Home care provided as part of the home care package scheme is delivered by HSE home help staff or by arrangements with not-for-profit and private providers who have been selected through a tender process as approved providers.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting care in the community for older people so that they can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  We propose to establish a statutory home care scheme along with a system of regulation for home care services.  On 6 July, the Minister and I announced the opening of a public consultation in this regard.  I urge all of those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.</p>  <p>  The consultation is an important step in informing the development of a statutory scheme for home care, which will introduce clear rules on what services individuals are eligible for and how decisions are made on allocating services.  The new scheme will ensure that home care services operate in a consistent and fair manner for those who need them and help to improve access in an affordable and sustainable way.  It is also envisaged that a common system of regulation will be introduced for all providers, be they public, not-for-profit or private.</p></reply>

Everyone has had experience at some level, be it through family or friends, of someone who has had a stroke or suffered from dementia going into hospital only to return home with all of the problems that go with that.  It is difficult to obtain the support and home help hours that are required.</p>  <p>  Back when people in my community were much younger, many of my neighbours got extra hours of work providing home help.  They got a few bob from the health board to help someone have a shower, clean up, get the pension, buy food, etc.  This and the previous Government have cut 1.5 million hours from that system and driven everything towards the private operators.  That is why, when I turn on the radio, I hear ads about how wonderful Home Instead Senior Care is; it is all being privatised.</p><p>The proliferation of advertisements relating to the treatment of our old people and those suffering from strokes and dementia is shocking.  It is something we pay for through the public purse.  We would not do it to cancer patients.  There are advertisements for VHI and BUPA but we do not have advertisements on television telling people to come to us if they suffer from cancer and that we care about the victims of that disease.  The State is giving up on the people who need to be kept at home.  Their distress is palpable because they are either being left waiting in hospital for home care or are at home not getting adequate care.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  We all acknowledge that there is unmet demand in the home care system.  There are 10.5 million home help hours in the system this year.  We are spending &euro;373 million on it.  We would love to double it in the morning if that was possible.  However, it cannot be done overnight.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to try to increase that budget.  I cannot announce the budget here; I am not in a position to do so.</p>  <p>  The argument about private versus public is a slightly different issue introduced by the Deputy.  Health care has been provided on a public and private basis in all areas, whether it is in acute care or nursing home care where about 80% of our people are being cared for in private nursing homes.  There is no intent on the part of the Department or the Government to privatise home care and the provision of home help hours.  In the vast majority of cases, such care is provided by HSE staff.  Where possible, it is always done by the HSE.  Where we have a shortfall and have to rely on private interests rather than let people go without, we will use the private services.  We do not look down our nose at any particular service or consider one to be better than the other.  We want to have a statutory regulatory scheme.  The consultation is out at the moment to ensure that both public and private services are regulated in full.</p></speech>

I dispute that contention and would like to see the figures that support it.  Our experience is that more and more people are being treated as though there was an inheritance tax on their health when they get old because they have to seek private care providers to look after them and to come in and fill in the hours that are not available from the home help service.  Some of my neighbours who deliver home help are told to go in and - in 15 minutes - clean up, get the messages, wash a person, get him or her out of bed, provide breakfast and then get out again.  We cannot treat human beings in that way.  Pressure is increasing for those who need care to go to the private operators.  They are advertising enthusiastically and non-stop in respect of their services because the public service is letting people down.  I am not eulogising the previous home help service but, by and large, it was far superior to what is available to people now.  At least it was available to them and they did not have to root into their pensions, etc., and suffer a selective inheritance tax on their health.</p></speech>

In the not-for-profit and directly-employed home care arena, we would get that hour for approximately &euro;17 so what is pushing up the price is the private home care providers.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is right: people in global multinational corporations can afford to pay for prime-time advertising space on radio and television because they are getting money from the State and making a massive profit.  Prior to being elected, I represented home helps.  We concluded a deal on their hours in order to put a bit of a floor on it and ensure that they had some continuity.  This is not being utilised to the greatest possible extent.  There are home helps directly employed and working for the not-for-profit organisations who cannot access additional hours.  We could remove the barrier on those organisations providing extra hours where clients might have a few bob to supplement it themselves.  The Government put a stop to that and I would like to see it come back and for more emphasis to be put on directly employed and not-for-profit home care.  I will put it to the Minister of State in terms he might understand - it is the best value for money for the public purse.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800036#JJ01500"><p>I was just checking.</p>  <p>  I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy MacSharry and Deputy O'Callaghan for their questions on waiting times at Sligo University Hospital and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that waiting times are often unacceptably long and I am conscious of the burden this can place on patients and their families.  Reducing waiting times for those on the list longest is one of our key priorities.  Consequently, &euro;20 million - rising to &euro;55 million in 2018 - was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in budget 2017.  In order to reduce the number of those waiting longest, I asked the HSE to develop waiting list action plans for 2017 in the areas of inpatient-day cases, scoliosis and outpatient services.  The inpatient-day case action plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity and insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding.  Since early February, almost 24,000 patients have come off the inpatient-day case waiting list, 84,000 have come off the outpatient waiting list and 249 children have received necessary scoliosis procedures.</p>  <p>  In the context of Sligo University Hospital, I acknowledge the point Deputy MacSharry makes about too many patients waiting too long for outpatient appointments.  I will highlight some progress being made as a result of the investment that has been made.  Out of a total of 11,833 people on the outpatient waiting list at Sligo University Hospital, 567 - 4.7% of the overall number - have been waiting over 18 months.  On inpatient cases, 3,412 people are waiting and 228 patients have been waiting over 18 months, which is 6% of the total list.  Not everybody is waiting a long period of time and I want to highlight that many people are being seen much more quickly.</p>  <p>  There are still too many people waiting too long.  We saw in last month's NTPF figures that there is beginning to be a reduction in the length of time relating to and the total number of people on our inpatient-day case waiting list.  We hope and expect to see progress on our outpatient waiting list.  We have now developed a new strategy for the design of integrated outpatient services.  This strategy seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by restructuring referral pathways and utilising technology to improve service delivery.  I have also asked the HSE to put in place capacity to ensure the validation accuracy of our outpatient waiting list which is something many of us come across in our constituency clinics.</p>  <p>  On the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, which is the subject of Deputy O'Callaghan's question, I opened a new theatre there in July which will enable over 1,000 additional cataract procedures to be carried out this year and to have no waiting lists for cataract procedures at the hospital by the end of 2018, and no waiting lists for cataract procedures within the hospital group by the end of 2019.  On outpatient appointments, when I visited the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, those with whom I spoke highlighted their view, which I share, that the primary care eye service review, which was published in the past number of months, provides a way forward whereby a number of these procedures and a number of outpatient appointments will actually take place in primary care.  This is something I hope to be able to act on in the context of the HSE service plan for 2018 and the Estimates discussions in which I am currently engaged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800036#JJ01600"><p>This target has not been met once in the past two years.  While the Minister has correctly said that the number is 567, the response he gave, which was prepared by someone in the HSE, is a celebration of all that is not happening.  The number increased from 73 in February to 123 in March to 182 in April to 297 in May to 353 in June to 437 in July and to 567, as the Minister rightly said, at the end of August.  That is an almost eightfold increase in six months.  Despite the great many people who are being seen and the great work those in the hospital are doing, the 18-month target has been an abject failure.  Instead of a reduction, there has been an eightfold increase.  There are specialties in particular that stick out.  In neurology, there were 28 people waiting 18 months ago and in February and now there are 192.  In the context of ear, nose and throat procedures, there was one person waiting six months ago and there are now 224.</p><p>The trend is not just upwards, it is out of control and accelerating, and we are doing nothing about it.  What is the Minister going to do?  He mentioned the NTPF.  Are we going to expand the restoration of the latter to address outpatient procedures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800037#KK00200"><p>Yes, I am considering that.  We need to be very careful in doing that because with certain specialties, outsourcing one outpatient procedure may adequately address the patient's needs but others might require the patient to go back into the public system for an inpatient or day-case procedure.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks I met representatives of the NTPF and asked them to look at what role, if any, they can play in respect of outpatient procedures.  I hope to be able to progress some of that in the context of the funding that will become available to the HSE in 2018.  The number of people in Sligo waiting more than 18 months is a small percentage of the overall list.  However, that is no consolation for the people on the list.  Some 4.7% of people waiting for outpatient procedures have been waiting for more than 18 months.  I accept that is too long.  Demand continues to grow.  More outpatient procedures are being done in the health service, but we also have a growing and ageing population requiring more medical care.</p>  <p>  The referral pathway is the approach for this.  As the Deputy knows, as part of our negotiations on the GP contract, we are investigating if things we do in acute hospital settings could be done in primary care which will free up more capacity.  That will not work for everything but will provide more capacity.  I will take on board the points the Deputy has made about Sligo University Hospital as we develop and frame our NTPF and waiting list plans for 2018.</p></speech>

He should do that as a matter of urgency.  The trend is accelerating.  We must have an answer to the question.  Is it a question of resources or of management?  What is the problem in Sligo?  A sixfold increase, regardless of the percentage of the overall total, is completely unacceptable in a six-month period.  I appeal to the Minister to address the House on this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

As the Deputy did, I wish to thank the people working in the hospital for the number of people they are treating and for the fact that it compares very favourably with another hospitals.  I will revert to the Deputy directly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800037#KK00500"><p>The situation in Sligo may be significant, but there is also a very serious issue in respect of the outpatient waiting list at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in my constituency.  At the end of August, a total of 2,486 patients were waiting for outpatient appointments at the hospital.  As Deputy MacSharry noted, the Taoiseach - who formerly served as Minister for Health - gave an assurance that there would be a time when no one would be waiting 18 months for an outpatient consultation.  That objective was achieved in respect of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in December 2015, but matters seem to have gone completely out of control since then.  One would have expected that having solved the problem on one occasion, we could have kept that solution in place.</p>  <p>  At present, many people are waiting for these operations to be performed.  As the Minister knows, it is crucial that sight operations are performed early.  The conditions are avoidable and reversible if treated early.  However, these 2,486 people are dependent on the Minister to provide a solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800037#KK00600"><p>The Deputy makes a fair point.  We have the makings of a solution in respect of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital that is twofold in nature.  The first part relates to providing additional capacity in the hospital, which we did.  I was in there in July to open its new cataract theatre.  That will result in 1,000 additional cataract procedures being carried out this year, meaning there will be no waiting list for such procedures at the hospital by the end of next year.  That is not a target set by me, as Minister.  Rather it is the target the hospital is publicly professing and confident of reaching.  That will provide additional capacity for the people working in the hospital to address the outpatient list, which is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Clinicians remind me that considerably more eye and ear work could be carried out in the community.  A number of clinicians at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital were involved in the primary care eye review, which have rise to a number of proposals to move services out of acute hospitals and into primary care.  I hope and expect it can act on that in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800037#KK00700"><p>Yesterday, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and I met representatives of the national Council for the Blind in Ireland to discuss its pre-budget submission.  We also had a broader chat with them about the number of people, not just at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital but throughout the hospital system, who are on ophthalmology waiting lists.  They brought to my attention that up to 75% of sight loss is avoidable if treated early.  We need to consider other proposals.  It is not fair for us simply to state that the people who are on the waiting list now will have to wait until the end of 2018 or 2019.  There is no assurance that will happen.  The Minister needs to consider innovative proposals, perhaps using the NTPF, as mentioned by Deputy MacSharry.  Something needs to be done.</p>  <p>  I recognise that eye procedures can be done very quickly and often outside hospitals.  It is not satisfactory for people who are waiting on a list to be told we will have a solution in a year or so; they need a solution now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-28a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092800037#KK00800"><p>I am sure the Deputy would not wish to misrepresent me because that is certainly not what I said.  I said that as a result of investing in and opening the new theatre at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, an additional 1,150 cataract procedures will be performed there by the end of the year.  This means that 1,150 people will have the gift of their sight restored, which is obviously a great relief to them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct on the broader point.  When it comes to eyes and ophthalmology, many of the procedures are simple procedures that can be done quite quickly.  That is why we are targeting the resources of the NTPF at cataract procedures.  In addition to the NTPF continuing to do that, I also want to see a much quicker migration of some of these services to primary care, which makes sense from a cost point of view and much more importantly from the patient's point of view.  I will come back to the Oireachtas shortly with proposals in that regard.</p></speech>

In the interim, while such facilities are being developed, several other options are being considered by the HSE locally.</p>  <p>  In accordance with national policy set out in A Vision for Change, community-based teams have been established to provide outreach and outpatient services across the local community health-care organisation area.  Two teams, covering Galway city and the Connemara region, are currently located within the adult acute mental health unit in University Hospital Galway, and they provide outpatient services.  Outreach clinics are also provided in rural locations within their sectors. </p>  <p>  Also, in accordance with the national policy, community mental health teams can be co-located with other services in primary care centres in their catchment areas.  In Galway city, there is a primary care facility planned for Shantalla in the medium to long term.  It is expected that the community mental health team for mental health services in the city will be based there.  While primary care centres continue to be rolled out across the community health care organisation, CHO, area, an appropriate site to house community mental health teams in the west of the county has not yet been identified.  While the development of these primary care centres is being progressed, several other options for the location of outpatient services and community mental health teams continue to be explored by the executive.</p>  <p>  Decisions on such matters by the HSE may involve negotiations and commercial sensitivity and are a matter for the executive to conclude so as to achieve the best outcome possible.  I will ask that the HSE locally update the Deputy when it is in a position to do so.</p></speech>

I am disappointed.  I asked a very specific question on a specific site in Dangan in Galway.  If the local official is able to say on radio yesterday that it is gone, surely the Minister of State knows.  I ask him to give me an update on whether that site is gone and is no longer viable.</p>  <p>  The bigger point is that an integral part of A Vision for Change, originally for 2006 to 2016 and now reviewed, is the community mental health team.  In Galway city, Connemara and the islands - with approximately 100,000 people - we do not have a single community mental health team base out in the community.  That is extraordinary.  Galway will become the European Capital of Culture in 2020.  It has two third level institutions and three hospitals, two private, but no community mental health team base.  How can the Minister of State stand over that?  I know he will say it comes back to the HSE.</p><p>What role does the Government have in ensuring that HSE west carries out its duty and will the Government provide sufficient funding for it to do that?</p></speech>

As she will appreciate, I will not get involved in site-specific negotiations and issues such as that because it is not my role or function as a Minister of State.  That is the role of the executive.  I will travel to Galway on Monday and I will visit a number of sites.  It is something I can raise with the HSE.  From the reply, it seems to be a question of the medium to long term.  It does not seem to be something that will be addressed in the short term.  I can pursue further information from the HSE if Deputy Connolly wishes but that is the information I have been given and that is all I am in a position to confirm here today.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State might not be able to answer a question on a specific site but I am disappointed that the HSE has not clarified that in view of the fact that I took the trouble of tabling a question prior to this and have raised the matter again today.  Can the Government stand over the fact that there is not one community mental health team in Galway city or the west of the county?

This includes the recruitment of people to fill an additional 22 psychologist posts and 114 assistant psychology posts.  The posts were advertised recently.  A cross-divisional working group, including the mental health division, is working to ensure standardised delivery of service, setting out and communicating the arrangements for care pathways and reporting of metrics.  Each community health care organisation, CHO, has been requested to submit a short-term action plan to address waiting lists in priority areas as part of the service improvement initiative.</p>  <p>  Other developments in this area include: the counselling in primary care service for adults over 18 years of age who are medical cardholders; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society through campaigns like the Let's Talk and The Little Things Campaign; implementing the suicide prevention strategy, Connecting for Life; the ongoing reduction of child and adolescent mental health services waiting lists for those waiting over 12 months; the development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care, including early intervention at primary-care level; and the opening of new Jigsaw youth mental health services, bringing the total number of services to date in the country to 13.</p></speech>

The statistics show that of the 8,000 on the waiting list, almost 6,000 are children, with in the region of 2,000 waiting for more than a year for primary care psychological services.  That was at the end of June 2017.  It is fair to say that figures like those are clear evidence that there is a crisis in the provision of mental health services for children in the community.  The fact is that almost one in three children is waiting for an appointment for more than one year.  It is simply unacceptable that children have to wait for that length of time to get their first appointment just to assess where they are at or what supports they need.</p>  <p>  Vulnerable children and teenagers need the service and there is an obligation to provide it.  We know there are significant regional variations across the country depending on where one is.  There is effectively an Eircode lottery.  In County Wexford, 230 young people have been waiting for more than a year.  Cork has 456 young people in the same category and Galway has 208.  There are similar lists across the country.  Could the Minister of State address some of those key points?</p></speech>

The waiting lists and the numbers behind them are an issue of intrigue for me.  I am not quite like the Taoiseach who has a complete fascination with statistics but, at the same time, there is more to the figures when one looks at them.  The more I have looked at them since I have come into this role the more I am aware of the myriad factors that underlie the numbers and why people are waiting so long.  For example, a detailed examination has shown that the most prevalent reason for the number of people waiting over 12 months is the lack of client availability.  In other words, people are not turning up for their appointments.  That is not me disavowing my responsibility, as I accept there are issues with recruitment and there are teams that do not have a full complement, but we also have a major issue with referrals.  People present to their GPs or at other locations and are inappropriately referred to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in many cases.  When that happens, they are left on a list because they are not seen as a priority and CAMHS will continue to deal with priority cases.</p>  <p>  What I would like to see is, first, a more appropriate referral system.  There must be a clear care pathway outlined in each and every CHO.  I would like to see one person made responsible in every CHO for that pathway so that when somebody rings up with a mental health query, he or she will be referred appropriately and seen at a more appropriate level than everybody being just sent up the list and left on the CAMHS waiting list.  When one asks the CAMHS teams about the people who are waiting for over a year one finds they are a low priority but the names are left on the list and add to the statistics.  We have a number of challenges to deal with in this area, including the gathering of metrics.</p></speech>

There does need to be a type of one-stop shop for a first appointment so that a person can be put onto the correct list.  Children are waiting ages for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, only to be told they should have been on the CAMHS list.  Likewise, children are waiting for ages on the CAMHS list only to be told they need to be somewhere else.  I am aware of a parent who is terrified that their child will be diagnosed with autism because they are getting the supports they need within CAMHS but if the child is diagnosed with autism, they will be ripped off the list and put onto another list in respect of which the supports are not available.  We need a child-centred approach whereby children are given first assessments and are at least put onto the right list and then given the appropriate supports.  Currently, we have different lists and nobody is talking to anyone else and children wait sometimes for up to three years for a first appointment, which is simply unacceptable.</p></speech>

I accept there are issues and challenges but there are also many management issues to be addressed.  One of the initiatives I wish to drive through, which I have discussed with the Department, is what I call the front-door system whereby there is one point of contact for everybody who has a mental health issue who is seeking help.  When a person dials the number, he or she is appropriately referred.  At the moment, if a person wakes up and is feeling a bit low, it is not clear who to ring - ALONE, Aware, Jigsaw, primary care, the emergency department or the GP.</p>  <p>  Deputy Browne referred to the number of children on various lists.  A GP could refer a child to CAMHS, Jigsaw or NEPS.  Children can be on several waiting lists.  We need a point of responsibility within each CHO to take responsibility for the care pathway.  I want to meet with such a person when he or she is appointed in order to ensure we have a national streamlined, coherent plan.  Some of the people included on the waiting lists are waiting for one day.  They could have rung yesterday seeking an appointment.  I am reasonably assured, for the most part, that everybody who needs an urgent appointment gets one.  That is what most practitioners on the ground tell me.</p></speech>

It is one the Deputy has consistently raised with me in this House and I know he has taken an active interest in it.  The HSE is actively implementing the action plan it developed to ensure that no child will be waiting over four months by the end of the year for such surgery and is focussed on maximising all available capacity both internally within the health service and externally to achieve this target.</p>  <p>  Additional nurses are now in post in Crumlin and Temple Street.  An additional consultant orthopaedic surgeon commenced in Crumlin earlier this month.  In 2017, up to the end of August, 202 scoliosis procedures were carried out in the two children's hospitals.  That compares with 142 in those hospitals in the same period last year, representing a 42% increase in surgeries between the two hospitals in one year.  Since February 2017, patients are also being transferred for treatment to the Mater, Cappagh and Stanmore in the UK.  To date, 23 surgeries have been completed in those hospitals.</p>  <p>  The HSE has completed an international tender for paediatric spinal fusion procedures and three hospitals were successful in their applications.</p><p>These hospitals will initiate patient reviews immediately with a view to commencing treatment in October for patients whose families take up the offer of having procedures carried out in overseas hospitals.  I know that will not work for everybody but it is another option to try to provide as many avenues as possible for treatment for children who urgently need their surgery.</p> <p> The HSE is also developing a forecasting model to predict, on a weekly and monthly basis, the number of patients expected to receive surgery by the end of the year.  This will assist it further in monitoring the progress made in achieving the target.  The overall number of patients waiting for scoliosis procedures has been reducing this year and progress continues in delivering on the HSE's four-month target to the end of 2017 in a planned, safe and sustainable manner.  I really hope that once we get through this very difficult backlog, next year we will be able to ensure a sustainable situation whereby we can meet the four-month target in this country without having to outsource any procedures.</p></speech>

I raised it with the Minister's predecessor, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  I have raised it with Deputy Harris on a number of occasions since he took responsibility for the Department of Health.  Few cases that come across my desk are more heart wrenching than those relating to the shocking waiting times for children and young people for surgery for scoliosis.  We hear the horror stories of children's lungs and hearts being slowly crushed while they wait.  We hear about children who can no longer retain their food because their stomachs have been squeezed so badly as a result of their condition.  These stories were read into the record of the D&aacute;il in late 2016 by my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, following a meeting I facilitated with the Scoliosis Advocacy Network, which campaigns on behalf of the children involved.</p>  <p>  Following the very damning television programme on RTE, which highlighted the long waiting time for young people with scoliosis, the Minister promised earlier this year that a target of a four-month waiting period for treatment of scoliosis would be met by the end of 2017.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, described the target as an absolute priority.  Finally, we began to see meaningful action, although in 2014, 2015 and 2016 the resources were not provided and the scoliosis waiting lists were allowed to grow far too long.  However, the problem remains.  The number of children at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin and Children's University Hospital Temple Street waiting longer than four months for surgery has grown by 17%.  In March, there were 134 children waiting for longer than four months for spinal fusion or surgery at the two hospitals.  By last month, that number had increased to 145.  The figures from the HSE show this.</p></speech>

He is right that this is a very important issue.  When I became Minister for Health, there was a brand new theatre at Crumlin hospital in which procedures could be performed but that was closed.  It is open now.  Nurses have been hired and a new consultant orthopaedic surgeon is working there.  There were 312 children waiting for such scoliosis procedures on 9 February and 247 on 22 September.  We have got to continue to drive that down.  We are putting additional resources in place.  We have hired the extra surgeon and will hire more surgeons in 2018 in order that we might get that theatre open for at least five days a week.  I want to see that happen.</p>  <p>  We are going to use every tool available.  That is why some children who can have their procedures carried out in the Mater or Cappagh - older children often are being transferred there.  Some children have very successfully had their surgery carried out in Stanmore in the UK and have reported positive results.  In my time as Minister for Health, I have not seen the HSE make such a proactive and determined effort - as well they should because it is far too high a waiting list - to get this down.  They are working extraordinarily hard and we will resource them every step of the way to get there.</p></speech>

Why can we not cater for more of these children by expanding capacity in the Crumlin theatre and opening it for at least five days?  My understanding is that it is only open on three days each week at present.  Why can we not extend that to five days?  We have the surgeons - I think five have been appointed - and we have the nursing staff.  Due to their condition, not all of the children can travel abroad although I am glad that some can go abroad to get treatment.  Also, referral between the Mater and Crumlin can sometimes break down.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the Crumlin theatre's capacity from three days to five.  I accept that progress has been made, and the advocacy group accepts that.  More must be done.</p></speech>

The advocacy group has done Trojan work in highlighting this area of shame in the context of how the situation was allowed to develop.  I would like to see the theatre open five days a week.  I am assured by the Children's hospital group that this would require more consultants being recruited so, realistically, it will be 2018.  Let us work to get there and, in the meantime, let us do everything we can.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that some children cannot go abroad.  I understand there are 68 children and young people whose cases are classified as medically complex.  I am informed that, as of 25 September, 61 of these patients require treatment prior to the end of the year.  There is capacity for 32 of those procedures to be carried out in Crumlin and there will be a treatment plan put in place for the remaining patients, I am told, within the next two weeks.  We will continue to do everything we possibly can in the Department and in the HSE, not just to drive down the list once and for all but to ensure that once we get to an appropriate target, we keep it there.  Four months is the clinically appropriate target.  We must make sure that we can provide the capacity in this country without ever needing to send children abroad.  This year, we have got to do everything we possibly can to get the list down.</p></speech>

I fully acknowledge, as all Deputies would, the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled.  Maintaining scheduled care access is a key priority for hospitals, and balancing this with emergency demand is challenging.  However, all efforts are made to limit cancellations, particularly for clinically urgent procedures.</p><p>Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of reasons.  The classifications for cancellation of elective surgery include the following: patient had procedure externally; already had procedure in-house; cancelled by a consultant; cancelled by a patient or guardian; cancelled because of no bed; correction of clerical error; no theatre time available; patient did not attend; patient has undergone emergency admission; and patient unfit for procedure.  Based on data provided by the NTPF, approximately 3,400 elective procedures are cancelled per month on average.  However, this must be seen in context of the reasons I have just listed, which can be complex, and an average of 53,000 admissions to acute hospitals on a day-case and inpatient basis per month.</p><p>The NTPF national inpatient-day case planned procedure waiting list management protocol<b>, </b>published in early 2017, sets out the national protocols for the management of waiting lists including the scheduling of patient treatment.  Under this protocol, and in line with best practice, patients should not be scheduled for treatment more than six weeks in advance.  On this basis, the HSE has advised that patients will not have been scheduled, as yet, for treatment in November and December.  I am happy to come back to the Deputy when we have the relevant data.  Also, data on cancellations are reported to the NTPF after cancellation and therefore are not available in advance.</p><p>The HSE continues to work with hospitals to improve the management of emergency care demand and planning of elective procedures to minimise the impact on patients, as well as the number of sessions lost through cancellations or non-attendance.  As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Health has commenced a health service capacity review, the findings of which are due to be published before the end of the year and which will inform future capacity developments.  We need to arrive at a place where there is a decoupling between the beds needed for elective care and those needed for emergency care.</p></reply>

My question concerns a number of examples of which I am aware, whereby someone was given an appointment for six weeks' time and then the appointment was cancelled the following week.  This is not an emergency process.  It is not about capacity or urgent demand in a hospital in a particular week.  It is scheduled postponement which I see as taking place on a systemic basis.  As we enter the winter period, my fear is that the HSE is trying to scale down its operations in our tertiary hospitals to the detriment of people who are trying to get treatment for which they have been waiting many months and, often, many years.  As the Minister and the Taoiseach have repeated this week, we have the biggest budget for health care ever in the history of the State.  If appointments are being postponed a week after they have been scheduled, it shows complete management dysfunction and a total disintegration of our hospital system.  I fear the winter ahead because we are going to see massive systemic cancellations across our hospital system to the detriment of many patients who had hoped to have treatment.</p></speech>

As already stated, I am informed that the NTPF can only report cancellations after the fact.  Nor should patients be scheduled for treatment more than six weeks in advance.  If there is an issue in that regard, I would be more than happy to look into it if the Deputy can provide me with the information.</p>  <p>  In the context of the coming of winter and ensuring that we continue to drive down the number of people on waiting lists, 2,100 fewer people were waiting for hospital procedures or operations last month than was the case the month before.  We need to build on that month on month.  We continue to utilise the NTPF so that procedures will continue to be performed at a time when our emergency departments are extraordinarily busy.</p></speech>
