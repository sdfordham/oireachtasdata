We recognise that the Government has finally committed to a pathway to deal with this process.  It is a matter for the Minister to consider also the recommendations of the commission on issues and difficulties with recruitment and retention of staff, particularly in the health service, health consultants and the Air Corps.  When does the Minister expect the commission to conclude its work?  When will he be able to make recommendations to the Cabinet on foot of that, notwithstanding the issues relating to prudence over the associated economic cost?  Now that the cost has been established, will the process be put in place?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I look forward to working with him during what I am sure will be a very exciting period in the run-up to many things in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provided that an examination of remaining salary scale issues in respect of those recruited after January 2011 at entry grades would be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement.  Additionally, as the Deputy is aware, the Government accepted an amendment to section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, that within three months of the passing of the Act, I would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan to deal with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.  This was a significant body of work delivered through the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, which collected, collated and examined the data, and provided detailed point-in-time costs associated with the measure.</p>  <p>  I submitted a report to the Oireachtas on 16 March.  It showed that there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with more than 60,500 new entrants hired, representing 19% of the public service.  This includes more than 16,000 teachers, nearly 5,000 special needs assistants and almost 10,000 nurses.</p>  <p>  Graduates entering the public service today do so on a competitive salary.  For example, a teacher recruited in 2018 will start on just under &euro;36,000.  This will rise under the current public service stability agreement to nearly &euro;38,000 by 2020.  Across the labour market as a whole, the average starting salary for graduates is &euro;28,554, with 40% earning less than &euro;25,000.</p>  <p>  Discussions on this issue with public service trade unions and representative associations commenced in October, with a further meeting on 27 April.  Further engagement is being arranged for early June as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.</p></speech>

I apologise for my voice this morning.  Before the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, or anybody else starts tweeting, I wish to point out I have a sore throat.  I ask the Minister to bear with me.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his answer.  Notwithstanding the catastrophic scandal involving the HSE, CervicalCheck and the Department of Health, it was refreshing to hear some of the victims of that scandal speak highly about the nursing and other front-line staff in their dealings with them in very trying circumstances in recent times.</p>  <p>  I raised this issue with the Minister last week during Questions on Promised Legislation.  We are into the first year of the pay deal to which the Minister referred.  There is an understanding on the part of the INMO, for example, that the recommendations of the pay commission on difficulties with recruitment and retention in its field would be adopted by Government and would kick in during the second year of the three-year deal.  I am led to believe that has been clarified in correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Will the Minister confirm that is the case?  Will he confirm that nurses, midwives, hospital consultants and personnel in the Air Corps, as part of the recommendations of the pay commission in response to the challenge that has been placed upon them, will be making recommendations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that Government will have a responsibility under the pay agreement signed and agreed last year for implementation in year two of the three-year deal?</p></speech>

The agreement makes clear that the responsibilities that are upon me are to set up the public service pay commission, which was set up before the agreement - I did that - and to support the pay commission in submitting a report to Government during the second quarter.  I understand it will report towards the end of June and then into early July.  The subsequent Government response will be the subject of negotiation between the Government and representative bodies.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy asks me to commit that a particular issue be dealt with in advance of engagement on the matter, all of the other bodies with concerns or needs over the pay agreement will ask why I am not prioritising them.  I am happy to commit to the terms of the public service stability agreement negotiation being implemented by me.</p><p>Work is under way on pay equality, an issue on which I have answered the Deputy.  We are dealing with the demands for so-called pay equality by those in the representative bodies, while parallel work is under way by the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment within the health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700004#B00200"><p>I acknowledge the ongoing negotiations on the inequality issue and the Government's commitment to resolving it.  I accept that there is a pathway for it to be carried through.  However, the pay commission was charged with an initial and primary responsibility which was related to recruitment and retention issues and the associated difficulties in the health service.  There is an acknowledgement on the part of the Government that this is its job of work.  There was a further acknowledgment in the Minister's reply that he would look at the recommendations that emanated from it and enter into discussions on them in good faith thereafter.  That is merely what we are seeking at this juncture.  We acknowledge, of course, the constraints and the fiscal rules which have to be adhered to.  As we said during the negotiations which led to the confidence and supply arrangement, however, it is imperative that the commission be provided with the terms of reference to which we have alluded, namely, that there are issues surrounding recruitment and retention.  The Government must acknowledge the need for a pathway to deal with these issues, notwithstanding the difficulties which may emerge by virtue of the difference of opinion on the agreement in place, as I have outlined, for the INMO.</p></speech>

We have an agreement that is laid out in text and the Government and I are honouring everything laid out in it.  Work is under way on the issue of new entrant pay and I have updated the House on some key points in that regard.  The Public Service Pay Commission is engaged on the issue in the context of recruitment and retention within the health service.  I will deal with all of the issues that emerge from both processes when they are complete.  However, I emphasise to the House that we cannot say, on the one hand, that we need to ensure the public finances are managed in a stable way and that we must not repeat the mistakes of the past, while telling ourselves, on the other, that we can meet every individual demand.  We will not be able to meet the needs of every group with which we are engaging.  We have a public service pay agreement for three years and it is in year one.  We are committed to engaging with everyone in good faith, but if we are saying we need to keep the public finances stable and ensure we can afford to meet the commitments we have made, we have to understand there are responsibilities which come with that.  I am committed to discharging those responsibilities, as I am sure the Deputy is too.</p></speech>

Following this programme for Government commitment and in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of budget measures on household living standards, my Department has undertaken initial work in the area of social impact assessment.  The social impact assessment framework is defined as an evidence-based methodology which attempts to assess the impact of policy on households' financial positions.  The objective of the framework is to broaden the scope of current practice to take account not only of tax and social welfare measures but also of how changes in public expenditure policy can impact on household outcomes and living standards.  By doing so it may in the future be possible to compare the distributional impact of changes to various types of public service spending and the implications for household outcomes.</p>  <p>  Following the announcement on budget day in October 2017, alongside the publication of the paper Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, a pilot programme of equality budgeting for the 2018 budgetary cycle is under way, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework.  For this first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of policy areas have been selected, including making childcare more affordable to reduce barriers to women's participation in the labour market and increasing female participation in apprenticeships.  Associated objectives and indicators were published in the Revised Estimates Volume last December and progress towards achieving these targets has been reported in the public service performance report for 2017 which we published just last month.</p></speech>

Those in our society with disabilities have for far too long fallen behind in the budgetary process and must now be placed at the centre of any future budget.  In its discussion on disability proofing of budgets, the Irish Wheelchair Association has asked that 10% of all new builds be wheelchair accessible, not just visitable.  What mechanisms is the Government putting in place to ensure future budgets will safeguard equal access to housing for those with disabilities?</p></speech>

As to how we are seeking to advance the broad equality budgeting agenda, my Department is engaging with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Women's Council of Ireland, both of which have broadly supported the initiative we have under way.  I am attempting to establish an equality budgeting steering group which will consist of stakeholders and policy experts to look at how we can advance the initiative.  What is crucial for me is identifying particular policy areas which are appropriate to deepen equality budgeting and track them in the way we have tracked many other indicators for many years.</p></speech>

Technical guidance document M - on access and use - of the building regulations 2010 stipulates that all new builds must guarantee circulation within dwellings for disabled persons.  Will the Government ensure compliance with the regulations within the private housing market and, if not, why not?  What provisions can it put in place to ensure compliance to safeguard access to housing for disabled persons?  The regulations do not apply to buildings constructed prior to 1992 and that has clear implications for those with disabilities and their access to housing.  When the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was contacted to provide information on the proportion of buildings built prior to 1992 within the housing market and compliance with the regulations, none could be provided for us.  Given the importance of these data in any disability proofing of future budgets, how can the Government ensure adequate fact-finding mechanisms are in place to ensure equality proofing will be a process which will deliver rather than deceive?  Will the Minister provide the resources in order that we can actually disability-proof budgets?</p></speech>

I have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on this area in two successive budgets.  The issues of detail the Deputy raises are, however, matters for the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I will contact him to see if I can get answers to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

However, it is a ten-year programme based on projections such as, for example, a 4% annual growth rate from 2022 to 2027.  The Government seeks the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council annually on projections for budgetary measures made by the Department of Finance.  Was similar advice sought from the same body on these projections and investment over a ten-year period?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700005#C00200"><p>The figure the Deputy mentioned is not correct.  For the latter half of the plan, the assumption underpinning the national development plan is 2% growth per year.  We deliberately reduced our growth forecast for the second half of the ten-year plan in recognition of the fact that it was more difficult to forecast that far ahead into the future in view of the many risks, of which the Deputy is aware.</p><p>Regarding engagement with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the council assesses macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts published by the Department of Finance twice a year - in the stability programme update and the budget.  While the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not required to consult the IFAC on the national development plan, the council stated in its fiscal assessment report of November 2017:</p><blockquote>Public investment levels are expected to ramp up quite rapidly again, rising to levels that are among the highest in the EU under current plans ... Across all measures, this would be higher than present levels for countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK as well as for the EU and euro area aggregates.  Importantly, this is possible while still complying with the fiscal rules in later years.</blockquote><p>It went on to state:</p><blockquote>A commitment to stick to a specified level of public investment as a share of GNI* would be a sensible basis for fiscal policy over the medium term.  If adhered to, this approach could help to prevent forced cuts to public investment in downturns and excessive expansions in investment during booms.</blockquote><p>We consult the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council when we are required to do so and it has offered a broad understanding of what we are seeking to do with the increase in investment levels in the economy.  It is good to hear this being welcomed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

That amounts to a total of 4%.  The Minister is saying the council was not specifically asked or consulted prior to publication of the national development plan.  What provision was made for potential Brexit implications?  Do the projections take cognisance of the reports on Brexit of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Department of Finance or even the Copenhagen report on Brexit?</p></speech>

I will make two points in that regard.  The best response we can put in place to the period of uncertainty the economy could enter if the Brexit process becomes even more difficult is to increase capital investment across the period.  That is what we are doing.  We are seeking to increase capital investment next year by one quarter above the current position at the precise point the United Kingdom will be leaving the European Union.  That is the appropriate response to something that will pose challenges for the economy.  On the question of its affordability, the plan was affordable on the basis of growth figures for next year that have since been increased again on the assumption that it is possible for the United Kingdom and the European Union to reach a transitional agreement.  The plan is affordable and is the type of response we should have when an open economy is entering a period of uncertainty.</p></speech>

He says increasing capital expenditure by 25% will be sufficient to meet the demands of the plan over ten years.  That is fine.  I would have no problem with that if it were the case that the various bodies that produced these reports and the severe sectoral implications outlined in the Copehagen report, for example, could be referred to in the plan to ensure there is a safety net in place to guarantee the commitments made by the Government with regard to capital expenditure.  That expenditure is badly needed and I accept the Minister's commitment to it in the face of Brexit, but there must be more openness and greater transparency on such reports which are very informative and, in some cases, alarming.  There must be reference points associated with the national development plan to ensure the commitment to it, notwithstanding the effects a hard Brexit would have on the economy.</p></speech>

They lay out how we believe the plan is affordable.  With regard to having a safety net, the best response in entering a period in which the economy could face further uncertainty is to make use of the levers we can fully influence.  Increasing investment in higher and further education and public transport and increasing housing supply are things we have to do, but they are even more necessary if an open economy is facing a period of heightened uncertainty.  All of the related economic assumptions were laid out when we published Project Ireland 2040.  The implementation board that will oversee the plan has now met and engaged on how we will be able to prioritise projects and make them happen.  Furthermore, we will soon have a meeting of a construction sector working group to examine how we can make use of all of the resources available in the economy to deliver projects in a phased and affordable manner.</p></speech>

The new reform framework focuses on supporting sustainable, continuous progress across the public service.  Our Public Service 2020 has three priority pillars: delivering for the public, innovating for our future and developing people and organisations.  There are<b></b>18 actions which include new initiatives and actions focused on building on reforms already in place.  We are also moving the focus of reform to achieving outcomes that will have a positive impact on the public.  With this goal in mind, my Department has established a reform evaluation unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform, as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.</p><p>A strengthened model of governance is being put in place to oversee implementation of the actions in Our Public Service 2020 with the establishment of a new public service leadership board.  The board includes Secretary General-CEO level participation drawn from the Civil Service and a broad range of public service organisations.</p><p>In the Civil Service the next phase of implementation of renewal will aim to deepen and embed renewal and also consolidate and implement current programmes.  Other priority actions for 2018 include work to strengthen policy making; improve the delivery of shared whole-of-government projects; and support the development of a national data infrastructure.</p><p>The Government continues to pursue a legislative agenda in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, is working on the Public Sector Standards Bill and the Data Sharing and Governance Bill.</p><p>My Department is also leading on Ireland's open data initiative, which is a key part of the public service reform agenda.  We want to be a leader in open data and create an environment in which the economic, social and democratic benefits of open data are recognised and realised.</p></reply>

That is vital.  It is a very useful exercise and one we all support in terms of promoting positive reform.  In the section of the report dealing with local authority funding for housing from the Department, it is stated that &euro;387.7 million was provided.  In addition, &euro;98.3 million was provided through the local property tax.  It is stated self-funding was used by local authorities to support the delivery of housing problems.  What has been delivered despite all the expenditure?  I suggest there was very little.</p>  <p>  As noted, the purpose of the public service performance exercise was to determine how we can improve the effectiveness of the delivery of services.  As far as I can see, no progress has been made in this area.  While the reviews and practices continue aplenty, there is nothing happening on the ground.  That is the problem.  It is blatantly obvious in housing in that we are not getting housing delivered in Tipperary or anywhere else.</p></speech>

We are increasing resources for local authorities to ensure public housing commitments can be delivered upon.  We expect local authorities to deliver on housing targets with the resources that have been made available to them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to Tipperary, which he knows far better than I do.  If I look to progress made in Dublin, I note that only yesterday we were able to confirm that the first phase of the long-promised project at O'Devaney Gardens, a huge public housing project, will be under way very soon.  I have seen many such examples throughout the country.  It is an essential element of how we have to respond to all the considerable housing challenges we face.</p></speech>

It is giving plenty of money and there have been plenty of reviews, but nothing is being delivered.  While the reviews and practices continue aplenty in the Department, nothing seems to change.  There are poor outcomes.  That is what I said.  I did not say the Government was not giving the money.  The houses are not being built.  The authorities are saying they are not getting the money.  The Minister met our county manager, Mr. Joe McGrath, recently and I hope he asked about this.  Eleven houses were built in Tipperary in five and a half years.  It beggars belief so far into the housing crisis.  We were able to build hundreds of houses back in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  What has gone wrong?  There have been reviews and reports, reports and reviews, consultants and tenders moving the whole thing around.  At least Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, goes out on the ground and demands to see what has been done.  He questions the Office of Public Works, OPW, on value for money.  It is all money and nothing being delivered.  There has been review after review.  The Government keeps throwing the same thing at the problem and does not seem to learn.  No wonder we have crises in health and every other area.  The Government is inept at running Departments.</p></speech>

Mr. Lemass was in power at the time.  Mr. Whitaker, the Secretary General of the Department for which the Minister is now responsible, led that.  We are now in a similar moment in history in that we need to change our entire economic model from an unsustainable one to a sustainable one.  The climate and energy plan we have to present to the European Union under the Paris climate agreement is surely the chance to do what Mr. Whitaker did in the report he wrote in the 1950s.  This is the opportunity to think that big and differently and change everything.  What are the plans of the Government?  What is the role of the Minister's Department in this new climate and energy plan that we have to present to the European Union by the end of the year?</p></reply>

When it comes to climate change, this means ensuring we respond in the best way to climate transition in our country.</p>  <p>  EU countries have agreed on a 2030 framework for climate and energy, including new EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the period 2021 to 2030.  These targets will be underpinned by a new regulation on the governance of the energy union.  This regulation will provide for the creation of integrated national energy and climate plans by each member state.  The regulation is the subject of an ongoing trilogue process between the Commission, Council and Parliament which is expected to conclude later this year.  Until this point, the targets, policy objectives and timelines are subject to revision.</p>  <p>  The development of Ireland's national energy and climate plan is, in the first instance, a responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  My Department is working closely with the Department of that Minister, Deputy Naughten, through the structures that have been established to co-ordinate Government activity on climate change.  There is a high-level steering committee on climate action, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and a technical research and modelling group that provides expert advice and support.  My Department is represented on both.</p>  <p>  Preparation of the plan is at an early stage but its development will be facilitated by the work under way to complete the national mitigation plan and the recently published national development plan.  The latter, in particular, represents a step change in Government commitment to climate change, with &euro;21.8 billion in funding directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society.  This capital investment will lead to a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p></speech>

They are not ambitious enough and we have not grasped the opportunity that exists.  The plans do not reflect the ability and willingness of the Irish to make the leap to a cleaner, sustainable economy.  At a meeting of the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport yesterday, Transport Infrastructure Ireland made a presentation.  It is still doing the exact same thing it was doing, namely, trying to tackle Dublin's congestion problems by building a wider ring of motorways around the city.</p>  <p>  In the area of forestry, we should be thinking really big.  We should be thinking about a massive, native rainforest that would be a store for carbon and part of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It would create 30,000 jobs.  The Minister should be thinking about an area of 20,000 ha.</p>  <p>  On our sea area, we should be going back to Europe saying we will listen to E. O. Wilson, the great biologist, and set aside half our waters for conservation, protection and research on what is happening in the North Atlantic as everything changes.  That would be accepted in Europe as reflecting the scale of ambition, leadership and vision required.</p>  <p>  It is time to shift our thinking to see this as a bold project where we can lead rather than one in which we are trying to resist change, which is what I sense happening.</p></speech>

I want the Irish people and Government to play a role in responding.  The Deputy can always point, very legitimately, to areas in which we could make improvements and operate differently, but alongside that, let us recognise what is contained in Ireland 2040, the national development plan.  There is a commitment to retrofitting 45,000 homes each year and delivering energy upgrades to all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings.  At least half a million electric vehicles are to be introduced by 2030.  The plan also refers to transitioning to a low-emission urban public bus fleet, with no diesel buses being purchased from 1 July.  From 2030 onwards, fossil fuel cars will not be allowed to be sold in Ireland.</p><p>From 2045 no national car test, NCT, certificates will be issued for these cars.  I am in the final stages of agreeing with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, a new climate action fund to be established that will have an allocation of &euro;500,000.  Maybe the particular matters referred to by the Deputy could be funded through this plan.  That is in addition to the very comprehensive public transport plan contained in Project Ireland 2040.</p></speech>

Its representatives conceded we do not have the resources for that bus network and most of our best engineers are stuck doing outer urban and inter-urban motorways, adding to the congestion problem rather than addressing this major problem that we have to introduce cycling facilities and buses in our cities.  Nothing is happening in that regard and the budget fell 40% in the past year.  That is the reality.  Similarly, if we are serious about electric vehicles, let us start on our car park outside and put in 20 or 50 charging points.  Let us do the same in every supermarket and public car park to show we are for real.</p>  <p>  We have all these plans but the reality is our emissions are rising in every sector at speed.  The Taoiseach recognised that we are climate laggards but it is not the people who are climate laggards; it is our administrative system.  We need to change the political and administrative system here to live up to the promise that exists for the Irish people in this transition.</p></speech>

If there is an issue with staffing and engineers in particular not being available to do the work, as the Deputy mentioned, I will engage with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on that.  I have made the capital funding available to try to make these projects a reality.  I know we will not be able to respond to climate change obligations if we continue to organise transport like we do in Ireland currently.  I am working very hard to provide the additional funding to ensure that agenda can be delivered.</p></speech>

Our parliamentary budget office has carried out an overview of PPPs in Ireland, asking that we address the pretty opaque nature and the lack of transparency in the whole area of PPPs.  There is a difficulty in measuring true value for money down to the 2040s or 2060s.  The overview made some specific proposals on water contracts and the multi-annual budget.</p></reply>

My Department has published two separate sets of financial data.  This can be accessed on the <i>www.ppp.gov.ie</i>website.  The first set of data provides an update on the existing financial commitments table.  This table contains detailed information on all PPP projects for which contracts have been signed and which are either operational or in construction.  Information is broken out by individual project on the type of PPP model being used, the operational date of the project, the capital contractual value of the project, the total unitary payments made to the end of 2017, the projected future unitary payments for each project, other PPP-related costs, the total cost of each project and the year of final payment of the project.  All told, it is a considerable amount of information.</p><p>The Deputy should note that the published data is intended to provide indicative information on PPP projects based on information provided to my Department by the relevant responsible Departments or agencies.  The central PPP policy unit in my Department endeavours to ensure that the information is as accurate as possible but any queries on the details of specific projects should be confirmed directly with the State authorities responsible for those projects.</p><p>The estimated expenditure on PPP unitary payments will amount to approximately &euro;1.2 billion up to 2021.  This represents 4% of the total.  With regard to water, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  This includes taking on responsibility for the water-related PPPs from the local authorities.</p></speech>

I do not know if his Department has done that yet.  He mentioned a central expenditure evaluation unit and that clearly has a key role along with the National Development Finance Agency in evaluating PPPs.  There still seems to be an opaque nature when we look at the multi-annual capital framework and the spending of each Department.  We still need clarification on how PPPs are performing, particularly with respect to water supply and drainage.  This relates to the way money is drawn down and the way projects move forward.  We have the major River Shannon water supply project, the Ringsend project and so on.  There is much work to be done in treatment, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, has done much work in the area.  There are also flood relief schemes and so on.  It seems hard to disaggregate the PPP structure despite major criticism.  We had the Comptroller and Auditor General report of 2011, when the Government took power, which is very critical.  The Economic and Social Research Institute has been equally critical over the years.</p></speech>

In the past too much information was not made available relating to PPPs under the auspices of the claim of commercial sensitivity.  We can get a better balance and there is much information we can share that does not undermine the ability of the State to get good value while respecting the contractual obligations that we have to people involved with delivering projects.  I have believed this since I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and it is one of the reasons we published the data.  As a Member of the House, the Deputy is entitled to know as much as we can make available to him on certain projects.</p>  <p>  I have the report on PPPs and I anticipate publishing it soon.  With respect to water, Irish Water has now been brought fully on to the balance sheet of the Exchequer so virtually all the capital projects it is involved with are no longer classed as PPPs.</p></speech>

The point made about commercial sensitivity and so on reminds me of the spurious reasons that were given.  We are spending the people's money and it is a mortgage for the people.  I note some projects going to the 2060s.</p>  <p>  There is the 10% figure in the investment policy framework and the rule relating to the capital budgets of each Department.  It is important this is kept.  We need to carry out major capital investment projects in water, housing, education and health across the country.  In many Departments the Government is constrained because of an ever growing unitary payment bill relating to existing PPPs.  There has been much criticism both here and in the UK, as the leader of the Opposition in the UK has said there will be no more public finance initiatives there because of the performance of Carillion and various others.  Is it time, given that we can expect a reasonable surplus over this calendar year, to go back to funding the major kinds of works being carried out by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, and other Ministers ourselves?</p></speech>

Many of those projects are of a scale where a PPP model is not appropriate and they can only be funded by the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  On whether we are squeezing out other capital commitments because of the value of unitary payments to which we are committed, it is fair to say that the value of unitary commitments which are coming up is significant.  It is now an average of &euro;410 million per annum between 2024 and 2035.  However, at this point it is not squeezing out other capital investment because it forms part of the Ireland 2040 plan.  We are increasing capital investment by a quarter next year alone, and my attitude towards future projects is clear, namely, that we should decide PPPs on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  We should bear in mind that, regarding the unitary payments that I touched on, in many cases they pay for the maintenance of projects that are built.  We should decide if PPPs are appropriate on the basis of the project rather than any broader policy.</p></speech>

The two counties are centrally located and are haemorrhaging jobs.  Huge numbers are commuting to Dublin from both counties daily.  In Laois alone, 11,500 of a very modest workforce commute from the county, which is ideally located.  I am keen to hear if the Minister has any plans.</p></reply>

It was a Government decision in 2011 that the programme be cancelled in light of the budgetary and staffing outlook at that time.  Up to that date, about a third of the target numbers, more than 3,400 posts, were decentralised.  The proportion of civil servants working outside Dublin is now just over 50%.  There are no plans at the present time to introduce a further programme of decentralisation.</p></reply>

For example, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was in seven different locations in Portlaoise, although it is now in fewer places.  There is no doubt that there was chaos for some years and that it was not planned properly.  I do not want, however, the Government to use that as an excuse not to decentralise other parts of the public service.  In Offaly, there is part of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance.  Laois has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  IDA Ireland jobs have been slow to come to Laois and Offaly.  Only four jobs were created by IDA Ireland in Laois last year, but there is an opportunity in this area.  We are told that IDA Ireland cannot get companies to move beyond the M50 and that it is difficult to get them into the midlands.  Dublin cannot cope with the rapid growth it is undergoing.  This is an opportunity to examine this issue and look to sections of other Departments that could be decentralised.</p></speech>

There was an announcement regarding Longford and regarding Cavan prior to that.  IDA Ireland is very much committed to trying to increase employment and attract foreign direct investment to areas throughout the country, particularly in such areas as financial services and the kinds of jobs announced in Longford and Cavan.</p>  <p>  My focus on decentralisation is on growing employment in offices which are decentralised.  Any further decisions to be made will be in the context of Ireland 2040, where we integrate decisions into a proper planning framework for the country.  At this time, I have no plans to decentralise any further offices from Dublin.</p></speech>

The capital is under huge pressure in areas such as water, housing and transport.  Housing is beyond the reach of most low and middle-income civil servants.  There are opportunities to relocate.  Even if the Minister will not relocate additional Departments, there are further opportunities within the Departments which have been decentralised and which have been welcomed and embraced by people in the midlands, especially in Laois and Offaly.</p>  <p>  For example, someone ought to look at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  While it may not relate strictly to decentralisation, every little thing in planning must be rubber-stamped in the Custom House, even for applications regarding the porches of houses or the kinds of covers that may be put over the tops of house windows.  Some of that work needs to be decentralised to local government.  That is one area in which we could move civil servants out of central government and back into city halls.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan has pointed to the progress which has been made in the local authorities in Limerick which play a role in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Shared services functions for the country are now run from particular local authorities.  Approximately half of all of our civil servants are based in regional locations.  While we have made progress in moving existing employment outside Dublin, my focus is on increasing employment in offices which have located in all counties.  The wage agreement which is in place over the next three years creates the ability to hire more civil and public servants in offices that we have established.</p></speech>

Primary legislation is required for this change to be implemented. The Office of the Attorney General has been requested to prioritise the drafting of the necessary legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for a Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight believe more spending and more resources are required in the area of health.  Is this something that concerns the Minister?  Will we have Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection?</p></reply>

My Department is in regular contact with all Departments and offices to ensure expenditure is being managed within the overall budgetary parameters. The draw-down of funds from the Exchequer is reported every month in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance. </p><p>As set out in the most recent publication, total gross voted expenditure at end of April was &euro;19.216 billion.  This was &euro;74 million, or 0.4%, below profile.  Gross voted current expenditure, at &euro;18 billion, was 1.1% ahead of profile.  Timing issues related to child benefit and Garda pension payments, profiled for payment at the start of May but brought forward to April, accounted for a significant portion of the variance.  As outlined in the April report, it arose as the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer, TARGET, system was closed on 1 May due to it being a European public holiday.  The timing issues will reverse in May.  Health expenditure, at &euro;5.15 billion, was 1.4% above profile.  Gross voted capital expenditure, at &euro;1.1 billion, was 19% below profile but up &euro;190 million, or 20%, versus April 2017.  The key driver was that capital expenditure in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was running at &euro;158 million behind profile.  This was largely due to a delay in drawing down payments for Irish Water.  It is anticipated that the draw-downs will be completed in the coming months, bringing expenditure back into line with profile</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, sound public finances are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth.  This requires that overall expenditure be managed effectively.  To support this goal, my Department has been engaging with a range of Departments on year two of the spending review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.</p></speech>

I asked him yesterday about the summer economic statement, but we did not have time to discuss it.  Will we have the statement at the end of June in order that the committees of the House will be able to have a proper chance to have an input into the budget?</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned expenditure on housing as being below profile and that the delay in the draw-down for Irish Water was one of the reasons for it.  That is a matter of grave concern.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight had a lengthy discussion on the health budget, which seemed to be at least &euro;800 million short of the resources required, based on an analysis by civic society groups such as Social Justice Ireland.  We are all aware of the enormous pressures within the health service.  The Secretary General of the Department of Health told me at one of the meetings that health spending would always be rationed.  That was his approach, which is interesting, given the deficiencies in the Department of Health.  I could also mention other Departments.  Will there be any Supplementary Estimate to cover the cost of implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, to achieve what we have committed to achieving?</p></speech>

It is a key priority for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I will certainly work with him to make available what is needed for implementation of the convention next year.</p>  <p>  When the Secretary General referred to rationing, the point he was making - correctly - was that every single Department had a budget for the year.  On the calls for further resources for the health service, we have to recognise that the total allocation for the Department of Health this year is &euro;14.9 billion, an increase of 3.6% from last year.  It was a very significant increase on what was already a very large budget.</p></speech>

The problem in the health service is that acute waiting lists are growing.  Yesterday the leader of the Labour Party spoke  about the waiting lists for cataract operations.  There is a litany of such problems.  I am sure the Minister sees constituents about the matter of early intervention and assessments, as I do.  There may well be a huge gap in that area also.  Is the reality that we will have to have Supplementary Estimates in the areas of health, disability services, justice and social protection, among others?  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have any process under way wherein it is looking at the formulation of budgets, starting in 2019, to ensure all line Ministers will have enough resources to do the jobs we want them to do?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me whether I was contacted about the allocation of additional resources.  I am - all of the time.  Every Minister wants to do his or her best for citizens to whom they have a responsibility.  It is my job to try to meet those needs out of the resources available to us.  I will work with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to meet needs in the disability sector.  It is an issue on which I have worked with him in the past when he looked for my support in making funds available to promote assisted decision-making.  I made funding available in budget 2018 and have tried to meet the requests he has made to support requirements in the disability sector.</p></speech>

He will also be aware that this is the laboratory that carries out very important work on behalf of the State to analyse and process forensically evidence to be used in criminal prosecutions.

The works included site services, site preparation, security, flood control and building foundations.  The main contract will follow.</p>  <p>  Due to recent changes in international forensic laboratory standards, it was necessary to add further information to the main contract tender documents.</p>  <p>  Forensic Science Ireland and the Office of Public Works, OPW, are currently examining the issues involved, which relate primarily to laboratory interior finishes and mechanical and electrical specification requirements.  That examination has been completed and the OPW is now reviewing and amending the tender documents.  The OPW intends to re-issue a complete set of documents to the contractors by the end of quarter 2, 2018.

I do not know whether he has had an opportunity to visit the Forensic Science Laboratory.  If not, I recommend he does so.  I had the benefit of visiting it in 2016.  The laboratory plays a vital role in analysing and processing all the evidence that is to be used in criminal prosecutions.  Unfortunately, however, the facilities are completely inappropriate.  The laboratory is based in an old office block at the back of Garda Headquarters.  The staff have to work in extremely cramped conditions and it is a completely inappropriate place for evidence to be forensically examined.  It is not just me who is stating that.  Dr. Sheila Willis, the director of Forensic Science Ireland, stated that the current facility is unsuitable for modern science practices and that it is vital that the construction of a new laboratory starts as soon as possible.  I am conscious of what the Minister of State has said, but it raises more concerns.  From what he said, it appears that the main contract has not yet been signed and that we are in the process of reviewing tender documents.  The question I asked was specific.  When will construction work commence?  I would appreciate an answer to that question.</p></speech>

Our Department will be working closely with all the people involved to ensure that we deliver on this project in the later part of 2018.</p></speech>

We have all been aware of that.  I am also aware that recent changes in international forensic laboratory standards have meant it was necessary to add further information to the main contract.  Nonetheless, I regret to say there has been considerable delay in the commencement of this process.  A legitimate explanation does not appear to have been provided as to the reason that is so.  If we are taking criminal justice seriously in this country it is essential that we have up-to-date, advanced, modern capabilities to examine evidence.  Every criminal prosecution that relies on forensic evidence must have that evidence analysed in a laboratory.  We know the laboratory is due to be located in Backweston, in Celbridge.  That was announced a number of years ago but I am disappointed that we do not have a definite indication as to when it will start and when the main works will commence.</p></speech>

Public procurement is governed by EU legislation and national rules and guidelines.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  When carrying out procurement procedures, contracting authorities have discretion to exclude tenderers from competing in a public procurement competition for reasons set out in Regulation 57 of SI 284 of 2016 &ndash; European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016.  This includes poor past performance where the tenderer has shown significant or persistent deficiencies in a prior public contract which led to termination, damages or other comparable sanctions.</p>  <p>  The public procurement system operates at its optimum where the evidence presented to demonstrate compliance is independently verified.  Otherwise, the contracting authority must rely on its own expertise and, in some cases, investigative powers to establish a tenderer&rsquo;s bona fides.  This can lead to inconsistencies in the administration of tender competitions.</p>  <p>  The tax clearance system operated by the Revenue Commissioners is an example of the type of independently verified compliance mechanism that has operated successfully in ensuring that those who do not meet their tax obligations are excluded from the award of public contracts.  Determining compliance with certain other legal requirements may require the input of the relevant enforcement body such as the Health and Safety Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission and Building Control, to name but three.</p>  <p>  When making a submission a tenderer must consider whether any of the exclusion grounds listed in the procurement documents apply to them.  Should any of the grounds apply, they must advise the contracting authority accordingly.  Before a tenderer is excluded regarding certain breaches, they may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must arrive at a decision based on evidence rather than hearsay or dissatisfaction and should take the principle of proportionality into account in its deliberations.</p>  <p>  The monitoring of public works contracts is also important to ensure that contractors continue to meet their legal and contractual obligations during the performance of the contract.  A consistent contract management regime is critical and clearly defined milestones should be set down for evaluation purposes.</p></reply>

For example, I remind the Minister of State about Western Building Systems and the company that built 31 schools.  A report into fire safety issues resulting from substandard building in an audit of five schools initially, which we were supposed to have had by now, revealed they were found to be fire safety defective.  A report was to be prepared on all the other schools built by Western Building Systems, but I do not believe it has been produced, even though it was promised we would have it by now.  I do not know if this has come into the public domain yet but Western Building Systems built a college of further education in Whitehall as long as ten years ago that is lying empty as we speak while homeless families are being accommodated in police stations.</p></speech>

Is he aware that the Loreto school in Wexford is fully completed?  The teachers have moved in their equipment and materials but they have been forced to leave again because the Minister of State's Department does not seem to have any mechanism for allowing the schools to enter the premises, for which the State is paying, but where the company, which is the contractor, has collapsed.  We are given to understand that the four schools and one education centre involved in that contract in Wicklow, Carlow, Wexford and Meath will face delays of at least another year.</p><p>This is when the State has been paying top dollar.

It is outrageous to think that a company that was involved in windmill construction - I am sure there was a Government subsidy there somewhere along the line -  is back in business.  I know of four small companies affected and the amount involved ranges from &euro;60,000 to &euro;37,000.  These are small operators and the loss of this amount of money will put them out of business.  I am sure this company has got much Government financing.  It is paying about 3% of the euro.  I think &euro;20 million is owed nationally and we now discover it is back in business.  It is outrageous that these people can put a company into liquidation, grab as many payments as possible from State subsidies and put small companies out of business.  This is not just one company but this is happening on a regular basis.  It is wrong and there should be a law to stop it.</p></speech>

To make a general point on school buildings and similar matters, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, have answered questions here before on a recent collapse.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the Department of Education and Skills are working on this.  It affects my constituency as well.  They are trying to work through this with agencies like education and training bodies across the country.  It is not something that can be unravelled easily.</p>  <p>  To get back to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, I already referenced the EU rules that are there.  There are mandatory exclusion rules and I can provide a copy of them to the Deputy.  There are also discretionary rules where previous performance can be used.  As I said earlier, it has to be proven.  That has to be worked out by the contracting authority.  In this case, the contracting authority who be whoever commissioned the development of the school.  The Office of Government Procurement does not run and operate individual contracts, as Deputy Boyd Barrett will appreciate.  We set out the policies in which each of the contracting authorities have to operate within and their Accounting Officers are then held accountable to the Oireachtas via the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are procedures within the statutory instruments that are in place for those exclusions and if people believe that unsatisfactory work has been done, then the contracting authority can move to have those people excluded from future rounds.</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement and the Minister of State should be putting pressure on the relevant Departments to ensure this happens.  I mention Western Building Systems, which built a school in Whitehall that I understand has been sitting empty for perhaps a decade because it is structurally unsound.  We then discovered that five of the schools it built were fire defective.  We are then told there will be a report into the other 30 schools it built.  That report was promised in September to be out in six months but it is not out.  All of this suggests to me that there is not a seriousness about getting to the bottom of why companies in receipt of public money are doing substandard work.  We are not bothered to look into it and we are not excluding them from further public contracts.</p>  <p>  I mentioned bogus self employment.  We hear the advertisements at the moment, and it is good the Government is raising the issue, but there have been widespread examples of contractors doing work for the State where they were found to have been, as in the case of Rhatigans, engaged in bogus self employment.</p></speech>

In the case Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to, and without getting into the detail, it may well be an education and training body or the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a procedure available but as well as that, we have to go through a process.  That process can often involve court action being taken against the contracting authority and-or the State.  It is not something we can enter into lightly.  We have to have proof and we have to follow a process, and I think the Deputy would appreciate and respect that.  There are safeguards already in place.  Maybe there is a problem of awareness around the processes and safeguards that are there and if so, we can do more about making sure people are aware of them.</p></speech>

The evidence base included a macroeconomic analysis, an assessment of progress to date on the 2015 plan, departmental submissions, a public consultation process, an infrastructure capacity and demand analysis and an analysis of the resourcing available for increased investment.  In addition to this, a review of public private partnerships, PPPs, was undertaken by the public investment management assessment unit of the International Monetary Fund.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, that while I am responsible for setting the overall allocations across Government Departments and for monitoring monthly expenditure, decisions on which capital projects are prioritised within these allocations are matters for Ministers and have to be taken in the context of the national development plan.</p></speech>

With the publication of the National Development Plan 2006, this evidence-based approach was diminished.  The NDP which the Minister's Government has published displays the same deficiencies.  The Irish Planning Institute stated that Project 2040 choices send mixed messages about evidence-based planning with its president stating that good planning is evidence based.  Does the Minister believe the Government's planning is sufficiently evidence based and is it good enough that a plan committing &euro;116 billion lacks sufficient planning?</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath has raised the issue in the House, as well as with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the European Commission.  All Deputies are aware of the burden of soaring insurance costs on businesses and people generally.  Many have seen insurance costs rise by between 40% and 60% over the past several years.  There is considerable evidence in recent months of business closures as a consequence of excessive insurance rises.  For young drivers in particular, there are many examples of people being unable to afford the premiums charged, thereby discommoding their daily lives.  Despite the pressure, there has been very little Government action to deal with this issue.  While the Government says it is committed and published bucketloads of reports, it has failed to stop insurance price hikes for businesses and for consumers around the country.</p>  <p>  It is not just Fianna F&aacute;il saying this.  The National Competitiveness Council figures show that Irish insurance price inflation is significantly above that of the eurozone average, thereby adding to the competitiveness burden faced by businesses and the burden in people's daily lives.  The key factor in this burden is the lack of competition in the Irish market.  This morning, we learned from David Murphy of RT&Eacute; that the European Commission has acted and launched a preliminary investigation as to whether or not foreign companies are being barred from entering the Irish market.  David Murphy's report quotes the experience of Zenith Insurance which pulled out of the Irish market in 2016.  In a statement it cited "the lack of engagement with us by Irish industry bodies, which we believe creates a market disadvantage for us and our partners."  Less competition means higher prices for Irish insurance consumers.  Higher insurance premiums cost jobs and hurt people across the country.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that this preliminary investigation is under way and how far it has progressed?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that insurance costs are too high in Ireland?  What is the Government actually doing to encourage more companies to enter the Irish market?</p>  <p>  The insurance industry body in Ireland, Insurance Ireland, promotes access to a service called Integrated Information Data Service, IIDS, a shared members' database that, by arrangement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, allows its users to confirm the accuracy of penalty point information.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm all insurance companies and all prospective insurance companies have access to that information, regardless of whether they are members of Insurance Ireland not?</p></speech>

Members will recall that on 4 July 2017, it carried out an unannounced inspection at the premises of companies active in the motor insurance industry in the State.  The basis for this inspection was a concern by the Commission that the companies involved may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU anti-trust rules which prohibit cartels, restrictive business practices and-or abuse of a dominant market position.  The House will understand neither I nor the Minister for Finance are in a position to make any comment on an ongoing investigation by the European Commission.  Any investigation undertaken by the Commission is done independently and I have no insight into the development of any such exercise.</p>  <p>  Separately, the CCPC has been undertaking an investigation into potential price signalling in the private motor insurance sector.  The CPCC is the statutory independent body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU competition law in the State.  Again, it is not appropriate for me to comment on an independent live investigation.  Having said that, the State has taken action where it can to date.  The cost of insurance working group's reports on the cost of motor insurance, employer liability and public liability insurance have made several recommendations which are relevant to the issue of supporting a level playing field to ensure a competitive marketplace, which is what we all want.  We are committed to implementing the recommendations of both of those reports.  Much of that has taken place and has had an impact on the motor insurance market in particular.</p>  <p>  There is still more work to be done, however.  The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring an insurance market attractive to new entrants, based on a level playing field, and having a competitive environment in order consumers and businesses benefit.  We will take appropriate action to ensure that is the case.  It is not appropriate for me today to comment on independent investigations, which are ongoing.</p></speech>

That is precisely one of the issues, namely, they are independent of the Government.  It took two outside agencies to intervene to do something.  The Government has talked and published reports while businesses and consumers face significantly excessive increases in their insurance costs.  The figures show that, compared to our EU competitors, our insurance costs are considerably above the EU average.  Once again, it is another burden on the cost of doing business in Ireland.</p>  <p>  High insurance costs are hurting jobs, businesses and families.  We need action.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm when the action points in the report on the cost of employer liability and public liability insurance will be completed?  When will the Government implement all the recommendations in the report on the cost of motor insurance?  Will the Government actually do something to address the burden being faced by insurance holders rather than just talking about it?</p></speech>

That is why it has a live investigation under way.  That is the way it should be.  If there are concerns about appropriate levels of competition, an independent investigation must happen, separate from the political system or the Government, in a robust manner, which is what is happening now.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the cost of insurance working group include enhancing the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to include regular reviews of the book of quantum and greater detail, establishing the Personal Injuries Commission, which is reviewing personal injuries claims internationally with a view to benchmarking these, improving the personal injuries litigation framework, including through the existing provisions regarding notification of claims, and provisions to penalise fraudulent activity.  There are significant recommendations on the back of good work which has been done by the Government.  We are acting in implementing those recommendations which is what exactly we should be doing.</p></speech>

The Government has repeatedly pledged in the wake of the CervicalCheck scandal that this would be forthcoming.  The Taoiseach said there would be a package of supports available to the women affected and to their families.  He also said last week that pending court cases would be dealt with through mediation.</p>  <p>  However, we understand that more cases are to be lodged this week.  During yesterday's sitting of the Committee of Public Accounts, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan, Cian O&rsquo;Carroll, spoke of two women who do not have time on their hands and have difficulty accessing their own medical records.</p><p>In an incident last Friday he described how, when the legal representatives made arrangements to collect documents that they were assured would be available at the CervicalCheck headquarters in Limerick, they were told on arrival that the documentation would not be made available and they were escorted off the premises.  This was done in the presence of the programme manager for CervicalCheck, Mr. John Gleeson.  That is hardly in keeping with the approach outlined by Government, is it?  Stephen Teap told the Committee of Public Accounts that no support services were provided to him or his children at this point.  Again, this is out of step with what has been promised by Government.</p> <p> It would seem that what has come from Government is more about being seen to take action and get control of the situation rather than delivering substantive action.  What the Government needs to do is take control of this issue.  Those in government are not commentators.  They are in charge and they need to act like it.  The cervical cancer audit, which has been available since 2014, still has not been published despite assurances given last week that it would.  Information in respect of the US laboratory detection rates that was promised to the Joint Committee on Health two weeks ago still has not been published.  Why the delay?  Why the wait?  Is Government not lifting the telephone and demanding that these records be put into the public domain?  Will the Government do that?  Will the Government ensure that it is published today?  This is not a new request.  This documentation has been promised.</p> <p> I want to return to the issue I raised yesterday because it was not answered by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  It relates to when the then Minister for Health, and now Taoiseach, promised to introduce mandatory disclosure, but he decided not to proceed on the advice of the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan.  It was the wrong advice and the wrong decision.  The chief medical officer was informed of the CervicalCheck scandal around the same time as this advice was given to the Taoiseach.  A reasonable question is whether that advice and the information provided at the time to the then Minister for Health was informed as a result of the CervicalCheck scandal or indeed any other scandal.  Will the Government publish that advice today?  Will the Government publish the advice that the then Minister for Health got at the time as well as the advice the Government got to ensure that, late last year, it withdrew from the legislation that was going through these Houses the provisions for mandatory disclosure?</p></speech>

We have a scoping inquiry under way that will report initially in the first week of June and it will be finalised by the end of June.  It will be followed by a statutory inquiry.</p>  <p>  There is no question that any information or files are going to be hidden from anyone.  As Vicky Phelan said yesterday, what is needed is full accountability and that is what is going to be delivered.  What we are doing as a Government is trying to ensure that the information we put into the public domain now is fully accurate and complete.  That is why we want to ensure Dr. Scally can get on with the work he needs to do while respecting the fact that the committees have important work to do as well.  The work they have done in recent weeks has been most valuable.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty referred to supports for victims of this scandal.  I have met Stephen Teap and spoken to him on several occasions.  It was Stephen Teap's contribution and what he was looking for in terms of support that influenced the way in which the package was shaped and how we would tailor support for individuals and their families with medical cards, out-of-pocket expenses and others supports and counselling that may be needed.  It is by listening to people like Vicky Phelan, Stephen Teap and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na that the Government has tried to respond as comprehensively as it can to provide tailor-made individual packages for families and individuals who need them from the HSE.  Not only that, we are appointing people within the HSE who appoint people to talk to families and individuals to ensure we get the supportive packages right.  That is a significant and important delivery for the Government to follow through on for victims and their families.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty referred to accountability.  We are already seeing, and we will continue to see, an insistence that no one is excluded from full scrutiny regardless of what offices people hold or who they are.  The way in which we can do that most comprehensively is to let Dr. Scally get on with the work that he needs to do and the follow-on inquiry that will come afterwards.</p></speech>

Stephen Teap was before the committee.  No support has been provided to him since then.  We had the announcement.  We had the press release but the follow-up has been wanting, to say the least, and that is not acceptable.  This needs to be about the victims - the women and their families.  Assurances from the T&aacute;naiste that the Government is appointing people within the HSE to liaise with them one week on are simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste about information that does not represent a new request but that has already been promised.  Are we going to see the cervical cancer audit of 2014 published?  Are we going to see the documentation relating to the detection rates of the US laboratories published, as promised to the Joint Committee on Health two weeks ago?  Will the Government publish the advice provided to the Taoiseach in respect of his U-turn on mandatory non-disclosure in 2016 as well as the advice provided in 2017 that encouraged the Government to withdraw the provision from the legislation that was passing through the House?</p>  <p>  This is my final point.  After eight days of searching for documentation, two individuals who do not have time on their hands were given assurances that the documentation would be in Limerick.  Then, they were told that the documentation would not be provided to them and they were escorted off the facility.  This is not the compassionate approach those of us in the House want to see in dealing with victims of this scandal.  The T&aacute;naiste should not tolerate it.  The Government needs to take a hold and get a grip on this situation.</p></speech>

We are prioritising victims first.  That is why we will seek for packages to be put in place for people in a very supportive environment and in a proactive way coming from the HSE as opposed to expecting victims or families to have to seek those packages.</p>  <p>  For what it is worth, both Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan spent time last night with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, after their powerful testimony at the committee hearing.  The Minister sought to ensure from our perspective that we fully understand what is needed by victims and their families in order that we can follow through in a comprehensive way.  No victims should be treated in a way that adds any further to the trauma they have witnessed and the challenges that they continue to have to face, especially in the cases of the women who have cancer.  I can assure Deputy Doherty of that.</p>  <p>  If any commitments were made to make files or documentation available to committees, then that information will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in saying to the population that women's lives matter indeed and that this referendum is not about a licence to kill, as has been indicated by posters, women being murderers, or the wholescale slaughter of babies with disability?</p><p>It is about an emotive, sensitive and deeply personal issue related to women's health.  In that context, women need to be given the right to make decisions about their lives.  The results of a poll published today in <i>The Irish Times </i>were very interesting.  They showed that when asked whether they would like the eighth amendment to be repealed, 44% of respondents answered &quot;Yes&quot;.  However, when asked whether they believed the law in Ireland needed to be changed to recognise a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, 62% of respondents answered &quot;Yes&quot;.  The confusion has been caused by imagery that is deliberately misleading and false and messaging that is untruthful and makes a mockery of women's lives and the deeply divisive and difficult choices they must often make. <br/><br/>We want to move away from the legacy of the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes in Tuam and elsewhere, the shaming and stigmatising of women and the wholesale export and outsourcing of women's healthcare to Britain and elsewhere when they face a crisis pregnancy.  We need to endorse the view expressed by Irish people in large numbers that this is about a woman's right to decide.  We must provide this clarity in a highly divisive debate in which the issue has been framed in terms of murder and manslaughter and the killing of babies, which is not the case.Later today I will be joined in Buswells Hotel by women who will give testimony about having an abortion for many and various reasons.  They include not having a home - as a former Minister with responsibility for housing, the T&aacute;naiste will be well aware of the number of women and children who are homeless; in an abusive relationship, as we know from the statistics for domestic violence and sexual abuse; do not having a decent job; and face the possibility of losing a job.  There are as many reasons as there are women. <br/><br/>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to join me in condemning any attempt to portray women as murderers or paint the referendum as being about a licence to kill people with disabilities or babies.  I ask him to join me in clarifying the position for the public.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach stated earlier in the week, with some notable exceptions, the referendum campaign has, by and large, been respectful.  Given that this is such a divisive and difficult issue for many, people have engaged in considered discussion of it in their homes.  I have spoken to many people in their homes about the issue and they want facts.  We should try to look at the facts, rather than the posters.  We must recognise that in any campaign as emotive and divisive as this one, one gets people who are desperate to win an argument and who may present the facts in a very emotive manner.  I respect both sides in the referendum campaign.</p>  <p>  I passionately believe and hope the people will vote "Yes" next week because doing so would be a reflection of reality.  Abortion is a reality in Ireland and the truth is that the law that applies to abortion for Irish women is British abortion law.  Every year thousands of women are given a piece of paper with an address indicating where they should go, as long as it not here, thanks very much.  I am not willing to stand over that any more, which is the reason I am advocating a "Yes" vote. </p>  <p>  I could make many emotive arguments around rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have met many women who had to face these challenges and they chose to speak to me because of this debate.  Over time, my perspective on this issue changed on the basis of facts, as opposed to posters, conversations and listening to horror stories that we continue to allow as an unintended consequence of a change made to the Constitution in the 1980s.  I do not believe people expected what subsequently transpired.  The truth is that abortion is a reality in Ireland and women are making choices without support from the health system and doctors that is appropriate at a time of real vulnerability.  If the people give the Oireachtas permission, we must change the current position. </p>  <p>  I reassure the many people who are still undecided, those who recognise a change is needed but are a little concerned that it may go too far, that if they vote "Yes", there are many Members of the Oireachtas who will ensure the change we will make in legislation, if given the opportunity to do so, will respect and protect women in a much more comprehensive way than we have been able to do to date.  In doing so, we will also recognise the responsibility of the State towards providing protections for the unborn.  What the Government is proposing to do, with the support of many other Members, will strike the right balance if we are given the opportunity to do so through a "Yes" vote.  We will not be able to do anything if the people vote "No" because it will mean a freezing of time.  We will be stuck with all of the dilemmas we face today and turn a blind eye to many of them if we do not choose to change.</p></speech>

While I also recognise that a divisive debate is taking place, I want the T&aacute;naiste to join me in stating the use of misleading information and ugly imagery and the claim that what is proposed is a licence to kill are confusing people.  If they are asked whether they want to give women the right to decide for themselves, 62% answer "Yes".  This is important because whatever the T&aacute;naiste or I think, the question people are being asked is whether they believe women should decide on this societal issue.  In the event that the referendum is won and people vote "Yes", we will have to deal with ancillary issues such as making contraception free and having non-ethos, objective and factually based sex education in schools.  These are issues that matter for women and if the referendum does not pass, we will continue to condemn women to leave the country and younger women will be condemned to take a pill alone at home and endure a great deal of pain without the medical supervision of their doctors.  There is a chill factor attached to the eighth amendment because it criminalises women and their doctors.  The T&aacute;naiste should not believe for one moment that this chill factor does not hang over the entire population, including partners and families.  While I appreciate his remarks, we must clarify that the referendum is not about a licence to kill.</p></speech>

For that reason, from my experience, the focus of the "Yes" campaign has been on trying to provide people with facts, ensuring doctors are listened to and addressing the challenge the country faces in this matter.  Nobody is pro-abortion.  What we are trying to do is reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and, insofar as possible, the need for conversations on the termination of pregnancy.  A number of initiatives were launched yesterday to reinforce this message, including on education and making contraception free and easy to access.  The country is also having a conversation on how Ireland should deal with circumstances in which a decision is made to terminate a pregnancy.  For example, what protocols and processes will be in place and how can we wrap the health system around such decisions in a way that is supportive and offers alternatives and facts?  We will insist on time being taken for full consideration of all of the issues surrounding a decision of the magnitude of terminating a pregnancy.  As I stated, if the country gives the Houses an opportunity to legislate on these issues, we can put in place a much more compassionate and appropriate legal structure than the one in place because of the restrictions in the Constitution.</p></speech>

Immediately after votes here in the D&aacute;il today, I will return to Ballydehob in west Cork for a public meeting to save the local post office, run efficiently by Ms Bridie Roycroft.  This woman is one of many postmasters and mistresses who received letters recently telling them of losses in their future income and offering them a chance to engage in a get-out redundancy.  Bridie has come out to the public fighting and is a model for other postmasters and mistresses throughout this country as she has decided to ask her community does it want a post office.  From what I have heard, she has got, and will tonight get, overwhelming support in Ballydehob as people plead with Bridie to keep the service open to the community.  Ever since she started the public battle, many have cancelled getting payments through direct debit and are now going back to Ballydehob post office for their payments as they knew it was a case of use it or lose it.</p>  <p>  Tonight's public meeting will again demonstrate to all how this village needs its post office, and the meeting will be replicated throughout the country in the coming weeks.  What do I say to the people of Ballydehob and beyond tonight who will attend?  Do I tell them the truth, that Fine Gael Governments, both this and the previous one, have failed as of yet to put new life into the post offices?  Over two years ago, the Government promised rural proofing and there was no delivery, as there is now a 15 km limit placed between post offices in rural communities.  Two years ago, they promised to look into community banking for post offices - no delivery.  Two years ago, they promised to look into the facilitation of motor tax payments through post offices - no delivery.  Two years ago, in the programme for Government, they promised that post offices would be a one-stop shop for Government services - no delivery.  Many more promises were made but as of yet there has been no delivery on the ground.  While Government TDs may lament throughout the country about post office closures in their communities, it is all crocodile tears as they have failed to date to sit down as a Government collectively and honestly looking at saving rural post offices.</p>  <p>  Redundancy packages are not a way of solving problems.  Communities must come out and save their own post offices but if the Government - this being almost the same Government since 2011 - fails to energise post offices by channelling new services through the door, it has failed these post offices and rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ballydehob, like other rural towns, cannot afford to lose its post office.  The Mizen peninsula, where Ballydehob sits, has seen two banks it had closed by the previous Government, leaving no day-to-day bank service within 40 km for many.  They have seen Garda stations closed by the previous Government.  Local pubs, shops and businesses have closed in the past few years.  Cuts to schools' capitation grants have seen our schools struggle for funds.  The closed school bus rule has generated more difficulties for parents in rural communities.  The Government cut home help service hours for our elderly and yesterday's report on our cataract service proves the Government let elderly people going blind wait five years for cataract operations in west Cork.  This is appalling, as the focus by Government was on how could it force cuts on rural Ireland rather than on how it could work with rural Ireland to rebuild and thrive.  What can I say to the people of Ballydehob tonight or to other communities in west Cork who have been let down by successive Governments and who are sick of empty promises to save their post offices?</p></speech>

They do work, they work hard but they need their post office, and so do the people of Schull and Goleen, and through west Cork.  Look at Ballineen post office, with the worry of closure hanging over the community for months as the Government stands idly by and lets it happen.</p>  <p>  I call on the T&aacute;naiste today to stand up before the people of this country and say that enough is enough and the Government will co-operate with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to speed up saving the post office network.  The Government must get the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to sit down immediately to work with Deputy Naughten to have motor tax paid through the post offices.  This will help rural communities.  The Government must start putting rural community banking into post offices, cut out the 15 km rule between post offices and apply that in the cities where there is a proper transport service for people who can travel.  They must ensure that the post office will be a one-stop shop for all Government services.  This will let the people of Ballydehob and beyond see the Government TDs are not crying crocodile tears for the post office service.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary that a body of its significance still feels it has to remind the Government to take this.  The report states, "Publicly owned sites now have a central role in addressing the housing crisis and starting the transition to a new system of active land management and urban development."  It is extraordinary that there is not a programme in place to build actively on State owned lands already.  We are five years into a housing crisis.

Effectively, the report endorses what the Government has been doing, particularly with regard to Ireland 2040 and medium-term planning to make sure we see the next phases of residential development in Ireland happening on the basis of proper and good planning as opposed to being driven by individual developers on the basis of what sites they can access and so on.  We have undertaken an audit of all available public land for housing throughout the country.  Every local authority has been asked to report comprehensively on it.  I remember it clearly during my time in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We are now putting pressure on to make sure we maximise the potential of those, whether it is social housing, social housing and private combined, a public private partnership or affordable housing schemes.

These families are then referred to Garda stations for child protection reasons.  We can all agree it is a completely unacceptable situation.  It is another example of the failure of the Minister with responsibility for housing to get to grips with the problem.

There is no reason for people to spend a night in Garda accommodation.  There is no reason for it whatsoever.  There are a lot of service providers and &euro;120 million was spent this year directly on homelessness services.  People are placed in emergency accommodation.  Sometimes people present as homeless late at night and the services are not there and they end up in Garda stations.  There is no need for it.  In the stories that were reported in the media at the weekend, people said they knew they were going to be homeless.  They would not need to go to a Garda station.  The services are there.  A lot of people are moving through emergency accommodation and placed in homes.  Last year, the number was 4,700.  There has been a lot of movement.  The numbers are still far too high.  We all accept that.  It is untrue to say that the numbers presenting have been increasing in Dublin.  They have been decreasing.  Overall the figures nationally are still far too high.  We are dealing with that but it is not true to say there has been an increase in presentations in March and April.</p></speech>

A judicial review there ruled that civil servants had no power, in this case to approve a planning application, but the expectation is that it is likely to have consequences for other significant administrative decisions.  It is clear the Westminster Government is consumed by Brexit.  There seems to be little progress in restoring an Executive in Northern Ireland.  Is there any initiative under way by Government to facilitate the restoration of power-sharing and an Executive in Northern Ireland or are we going to face a situation where there is simply no effective authority to implement normal administrative procedures in the North of the island?</p></speech>

In the past week, there have been some positive developments in Northern Ireland with regard to the launch of a public consultation process around legacy which is something we have been waiting for quite some time.  It is hugely important to many families in Northern Ireland.</p><p>What we got from a court decision this week is a reminder that the <i>status quo </i>is not okay in Northern Ireland in terms of normal basic decisions that impact on people's lives and livelihoods.  In this case it was a decision that said a civil servant was not empowered to make the decision he or she did on a planning application for an incinerator.  There are a lot of other decisions stacking up now.  There are hundreds which need political input.  They need a Minister in a devolved government to make a decision.  Those decisions are not being made.</p><p>I am speaking to the Secretary of State of Northern Ireland to ensure she can take a practical approach to making important decisions.  We want to do it in an appropriate structure.  Ultimately, we continue to talk to parties to try to find a way forward to return Northern Ireland to the devolved governance it should have.  In the absence of that, we are drifting in a way that is very concerning for many decisions that need to be taken in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

St. Mary's CBS primary school in Carrick-on-Suir is an excellent school with excellent staff and principal, Denis Cotter.  In February of last year, the school got DEIS 1 status and was delighted.  Last September, after enrolments, the school was one short.  It had 132 students but it needed 133 to retain its staff.  Its DEIS status allowed it to have classes with fewer than 25 students, which was wonderful for the school.  Lo and behold in September, a few months after it lost its staff, the direct provision centre, which had been closed, reopened and the school now has six pupils enrolled from that centre.  They are very welcome.  The school educates them and does a very good job, but now the school is way over the threshold and is losing a staff member.  Will the Minister for Education and Skills intervene?  As a result of the intricacies of the categories and numbers, it is a numbers game and if a school does not fit into a category, it is in trouble.  It is reprehensible.  The school needs to retain its staff to deal with the extra pupils it got in addition to those it already had.</p></speech>

There is an appeal process which is independently run.  With such a scheme there is no ministerial discretion to deviate from it.  It is provided and administered equitably across every school that applies.  There is an appeal mechanism.  I will check the position of the school the Deputy referred to but that is the situation.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is meeting British Prime Minister Theresa May today on the sidelines of the EU summit in Bulgaria.

A report commissioned in 2002 stated that a key responsibility for Government was to ensure that people with disability can move around freely to the best of their ability.  A major component of this is the adequate provision of an integrated accessible public transport system.  To my horror, I find out that a number of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes are not wheelchair accessible.  I watched a tourist recently trying to struggle onto a bus and, while I give full marks to the Bus &Eacute;ireann staff who were excellent, it was appalling to see.  A number of routes around the country are not accessible for people with disabilities.  I implore the T&aacute;naiste, as deputy head of Government, to take this matter in hand and ensure that Bus &Eacute;ireann gets the budget to deal with this without delay.</p></speech>

The reality is that capitation grants were cut from &euro;200 per child to &euro;170 by the former Government, a cut of 15%.  As a result, most primary schools are relying on fundraising by parents to make up the shortfall in funding.  I know this at first hand as I am on a board of management and I know the difficulties we have in trying to make up the shortfall by fundraising.  This is putting huge pressure on parents and schools.  When will this Government restore the capitation grant and properly fund our primary schools?</p></speech>

In the first two budgets we gave priority to areas such as special education, the provision of SNAs, the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio and support for disadvantaged schools and we have to make decisions within the available resources to prioritise the areas where we feel the greatest pressure is.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700021#W00200"><p>The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a tragedy.  I used to have a lot of sympathy for Israel, the people of which suffered terrible oppression during the Second World War.  I have wondered how a previous generation could have stood idly by and let it happen.  It was very difficult for the Israeli people to establish the state of Israel and their battle for nationhood was strung with grief, but the Israeli people who were once oppressed have become the oppressors.  When the conflict between Israel and Palestine was explained to me in detail and I began to read about events and how the people of Palestine were being treated, it became clear that we had to reach a resolution of the conflict and the Palestinian refugee crisis.  I do not want to be told in one or two decades' time that we stood idly by and watched as a people were banished off the face of the earth.</p>  <p>  In recent years there has been a focus on the war in Syria and the resultant refugee crisis.  However, the Palestinian refugee crisis is one of the longest lasting episodes of forced migration in modern history.  Millions of Palestinians have been exiled from homes and lands that their families inhabited for generations.  They are stateless.  Many still suffer the penury and insecurity that are the legacy of their dispossession.  Human rights violations, including house demolitions, land confiscations, forced displacement, restriction of movement and violence against civilians, occur on a regular basis.  According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, almost one third of registered Palestinian refugees, comprising more than 1.5 million individuals, live in 58 recognised Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, including east Jerusalem.  The remaining two thirds live in or close to cities and towns in host countries, on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, often in the environs of official camps.  The Gaza Strip is home to approximately 1.9 million people, 1.3 million of whom are refugees.  Over 500,000 people live in the eight recognised Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, which have population densities which are among the highest in the world.  Approximately 70% of Gaza's 1.9 million people rely on humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  The land, air and sea blockade imposed by Israel following the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2017 which is exacerbated by Egypt keeping its border with Gaza largely sealed continues to have a devastating effect as access to markets and people's movements to or from the Gaza Strip remain severely restricted.  A report published in September 2015 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on assistance to the Palestinian people warned that the Gaza Strip could become uninhabitable by 2020 if the economic trends in being at the time persisted.</p><p>According to Human Rights Watch, Israel's restriction on the delivery of construction materials to Gaza and lack of funding have impeded reconstruction of the 17,800 housing units severely damaged or destroyed during Israel's 2014 military operation in Gaza.  Approximately 29,000 who lost their homes remain displaced.  Conditions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are far below an acceptable standard of living.  Decades of conflict and denial of human rights take their toll, as people struggle to make ends meet.  However, while it is abundantly clear that more needs to be done to help the Palestinians and improve basic living conditions what is also required is the complete halt to rocket attacks and random knife attacks by Hamas and other Islamic military groups and the cessation of all military strikes by Israel.  That is a necessary precondition to functioning negotiations and trying to establish a peace process.  The refugees and the Palestinian people need us to stand up for them at this time.  We need a two-state solution in that part of the world and it needs to happen now.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the dreadful mass killings of Palestinian protestors and the Government has rightly repudiated the Israeli Government actions.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach claims that to expel the Israeli ambassador is against the principle and imperative of dialogue but that is not true.  Recently, the Government expelled a Russian diplomat, not for any alleged wrongdoing in this State but in solidarity with the British Government.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should stop finding excuses for not taking positive action that gives meaningful expression to the rejection by the Irish people of the treatment of the people of Palestine.  There is no excuse for the Government not formally recognising the state of Palestine as agreed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  If the Irish do not stand by the Palestinians, who will?  Who will stand by those people if we do not?  If we, as a former colony, still occupied in part by a government we do not want, and with our history of freedom struggle and freedom fighters and our peace process, do not uphold the rights of the Palestinians then who will?  Their land is being slowly stolen from them.  Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live on Palestinian land in violation of UN resolutions.  Their water rights are taken.  They live in poverty and disadvantage with no rights of movement.  The Government&rsquo;s stance is a cop-out.  Sinn F&eacute;in is asking the Government to demand that the international community upholds international law.</p>  <p>  I visited the Middle East region five times in recent years.  I have spoken to Israeli leaders and citizens and Palestinian leaders and citizens.  I have been in the Gaza Strip, Gaza city and the West Bank.  I have been in the refugee camps and spoken to children released after years in prison.  I have spoken to their parents.  I walked along the separation wall that cuts Palestinian families off from their lands.  Palestinian academics and others have organised a recent series of protests to mark 70 years of Nakba.  They took as their example the non-violent campaigns of Martin Luther King and Gandhi.  The protests in Gaza were the Palestinian equivalent of the march to Selma, a peaceful mass protest at injustice ignored for 70 years.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s options are clear.  It can talk a lot but do nothing.  It can expel the Israeli ambassador.  It can stop ignoring the democratic will of the D&aacute;il and recognise the state of Palestine, as it recognised the state of Israel, and stand up for peace in the Middle East by standing by the Palestinians.</p></speech>

A total of 58 people were killed in one day and 2,800 were wounded, including 228 children and a man in a wheelchair, on the pretext that they were trying to invade Israel.  Most of the killings were done by Israeli snipers who were located 300 m from the border.</p>  <p>  I was part of a parliamentary delegation that visited Jordan about four years ago.  We visited the camps that had developed following the Syrian conflict.  The first camp which we went to is just outside Amman and it is there since 1948.  Three generations of Palestinians have been born into it.  We then went to the 1967 camp which is half way between Amman and the Syrian border.  That was one of the most depressing places I have ever seen.  People live in makeshift houses with no sanitation or running water, and they have been there since 1967.  The other camp for Palestinian refugees who were run out of Syria was located on the Syrian border.  There were tens of thousands of them.  The world looks on and allows that to happen.  Nothing has been done to alleviate the pain of generations of Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  Another sad fact is that a third generation of Palestinian people who have been born in Jordan are stateless.  They are not accepted as Jordanian citizens and one of the consequences of that is that they are not facilitated with third level education.</p>  <p>  Approximately five or six years ago prior to the election in Israel Mr. Netanyahu decided to bomb Palestine.  A total of 2,200 people were killed in Gaza by indiscriminate bombing from the air and attacks on the ground by Israeli forces.  Again, the powerful nations in the world did absolutely nothing to help the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  Gaza is denied necessary hospital facilities coming from Egypt.  Saudi Arabia is in cahoots with the Israeli Government and what it is doing at the moment.  The powerful in the world order are doing absolutely nothing to try to alleviate the suffering and pain.</p>  <p>  The Government has let down the Palestinian people consistently over the years.  It let them down because it had the opportunity to recognise the state of Palestine that would give recognition and a state to people who are deserving of it.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, to use his power within the Government to ensure recognition of the Palestinian state is forthcoming and also to convey to the Israeli ambassador that he is not wanted in this country.</p></speech>

It was grotesquely triumphalist on a day that 60 people were murdered in Gaza.  Those 60 people were unarmed and included eight children.  One child was only eight months old.  It was ultimately depressing to see 60 people murdered.  That quantifies the level of desperation experienced by ordinary Palestinian people at their situation.  Occupation affects the mind and body and makes one desperate but the will of the Palestinian people will not be mown down by Israeli bullets.</p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Israeli ambassador a few days ago.  He said he was shocked and dismayed.</p><p>These are weasel words.  This Government does not have the bottle to say what is required to the Israeli ambassador.  People want to know what it will take for the Israeli ambassador to be told to pack his bags.  Will it take 100, 1,000 or 10,000 Palestinian deaths?  Where will the line in the sand be drawn?  Israel is not a normal state.  It is an apartheid and racist state.  It was built on blood and it also survives on blood.</p> <p> The Irish Government can do something about this situation.  Sometimes these debates can be quite abstract in terms of what we can do but there are a number of practical steps that the Government can take.  Since 2012, the Irish Government has bought &euro;5.6 million worth of Israeli armaments, including &euro;1.2 million worth of Israeli drones.  Most people would be shocked to hear that the Irish Government is buying arms from Israel while the Israeli army is killing thousands of Palestinians.  That is one practical measure the Government can take.  It can stop purchasing military hardware for the Irish Army from Israel.  The other thing the Government can do is support the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 proposed by Senator Frances Black.  It is a very sound Bill which would end Irish trade with and support for illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that he will look at that Bill again in June but I urge the Government to support it.  These are two practical actions the Government can take although I am not sure it will do so.  We will have to wait and see.</p> <p> In 1987, this country was the first in the world to ban all goods from apartheid South Africa.  It can be done if the will is there.  People are horrified to see what has happened and what will continue to happen.  As a country we have shown amazing support for and solidarity with the Palestinians and the least we can do now is to tell the Israeli ambassador to get the hell out of here because he is not welcome.  If the Government does not do that and if it keeps buying arms from Israel, then it is complicit in this murder and mayhem.  Our support is always with the Palestinian people and never with the Zionists because they are murdering bastards.  That is what they are - murdering bastards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700023#Y00200"><p>I repeat the condemnation of Israel's brutal and murderous policy against unarmed protesters in Gaza.  It is an outrage that should be met not just with outrage but with action.  The moving of the US embassy to Jerusalem is a green light for the Israeli state's policy of Zionist expansion and colonisation.  Israel claims that it is defending its borders from terrorism but these borders were established by military occupation in 1967 and are not agreed borders.</p><p>I support the concept of an Israeli state, given the history of discrimination, pogroms and the horrors of the Holocaust for the Jewish people.  This must be a state with agreed borders, however, and not those determined by military might.  It must be a state that treats all of its citizens, Jews and non-Jews, equally.  It must recognise the rights of Palestinians driven from their homes and lands in the Nakba of 1947-1948.  It must also offer the right to return or full compensation, end the siege of Gaza and enter into meaningful talks.</p><p>The <i>status quo</i>cannot be accepted but that is what is happening.  The problem is not just with the US and President Trump.  The EU wrings its hands but is Israel's main trading partner.  One third of all Israeli exports go to the EU.  A boycott of settlement goods is not sufficient because it will affect only 2% of Israeli exports.  We need boycotts, divestments and sanctions on all Israeli goods and services.  The arms trade must be ended.  Since 2005, we have bought &euro;16.6 million worth of ammunition, drones and other military equipment from Israel.  This is dwarfed by EU states which bought &euro;9.5 billion of Israeli arms and so-called battle tested military equipment between 2005 and 2009.  This equipment was developed and then tested on Palestinians.  That is what the term &quot;battle tested&quot; means.</p><p>Ireland must lead the way, not just with words but with actions.  We should recall our ambassador to Israel and expel the Israeli ambassador.  We must support the passage of the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 which was put forward by Senator Frances Black.  We must immediately end all military co-operation and trade in arms, military components and so on, commence a programme of boycott, divestment and sanctions to force Israel to abide by UN resolutions, formally recognise the state of Palestine, and enter into real and meaningful talks for a two-state peace process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700023#Y00300"><p>President Trump tweeted on Monday last that it was a "great day for Israel".  The Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, declared several times that "we will remember this day".  Indeed we will, but not for the crass and inappropriate moving of the American embassy to Jerusalem.  As Israeli and American dignitaries openly celebrated the transfer of the US embassy as a "step towards peace", dozens of Palestinians were being gunned down by Israeli snipers just 40 km away.  Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital on 6 December 2017 and the moving of the US embassy have reignited tensions within Palestine and Israel.  The Israeli occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem since 1967 has never been recognised by the international community.  The consensus has always been that the city's status must be negotiated between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>  <p>  Monday's death toll brings the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza to well over 100 in seven weeks of protests against the continued decimation of their country.  One of the key points that may arise from the events of this week, as others have said, is that the US action may indeed mark a watershed in Palestinian-Israeli history.  It may mark the end of the proposal for a two-state solution.  A two-state solution is clearly not viable and will not provide a solution to the intense suffering of the people of Palestine.  Effectively, there is a single territory which encompasses about 13 million people, including both Jewish and Arab Israeli citizens and around 6.5 million Palestinians, in the occupied territories and Gaza.  This is an area that is roughly the size of Leinster and half of Munster, at 11,000 to 12,000 square miles.  Everyone who wants a peaceful, secure and happy future for all of those 13 million people must call for full civil and political rights for the citizens of all of those countries.  The ambition of this House should be to do everything possible to bring about full civil and political rights for all of the people who live in Palestine and Israel.  That is the only way forward.  As others have said, any kind of apartheid type solution is an anathema that cannot and will not stand the test of time.</p></speech>

It is only right and proper that this Parliament expresses its total and utter condemnation of one of the most violent periods in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East which has resulted in the death of 58 Palestinians and the injuring of thousands more.  The severely disproportionate response of Israel to a legitimate protest is quite simply appalling.</p>  <p>  In 2016 I took the opportunity to visit some of the affected areas, including Hebron, Jerusalem and along the Jordan Valley.  While there I witnessed at first hand the total disparity between the quality of life of Palestinians and Israelis.  I saw farm land with walls built right through it.  On one side was rich, arable, good quality agricultural land while on the other side was barrenness.  The vast majority of land, at approximately 93%, was under Israeli control.  One of the biggest issues in the region is the lack of water.  Palestinians, on average, only have access to between 20 and 30 litres of water per day which is 70 litres less than what is recommended by the World Health Organization.  I also saw forced relocation and the appalling treatment of Palestinians in prison.</p>  <p>  People ask why the Palestinians are protesting.  They are protesting because of illegal borders and infringements on their property and human rights. </p><p>One of the most basic human rights is the right to water.  In recent years tens of thousands of people took to the streets of this country to protest about water charges.  We should not question why people are protesting when they are not even getting access to quality water.  By any measure, the Israeli response was totally and utterly indefensible.  It was a blatant massacre of defenceless civilians.  Questions should be asked of a country that acts in this manner, flouts international law and continues to ignore UN resolutions.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has always respected and celebrated the establishment and progress of the state of Israel.  We have never questioned the right of the Israeli people to exercise their right to self-determination and self-defence.  However, this should not be done at the expense of the Palestinians.  As a party, we will continue to speak up on behalf of the Palestinian people.  We will use our voice on the international stage to advance a resolution.  As previous speakers said, it is quite hard at this stage of the game to see how a two-state solution can be achieved.</p> <p> This week marks the 70th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel which is referred to by Palestinians as "Nakba", which means "catastrophe".  For them, the anniversary marks a time when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians left or were forced to flee their homes.  On Monday, 14 May, the United States followed through on the decision it made in December 2017 to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not support this hugely controversial decision.  How can the United States continue to see itself as an honest broker in this conflict which has been ongoing for decades?  While recent years have seen a focus on the Syrian war and refugee crisis, the Palestinian refugee crisis is one of the longest lasting cases of forced migration in modern history.  The recent massacre highlights more than ever the need for an urgent international intervention.  We can no longer sit by and hope the conflict will be resolved.  We need a greater international intervention.  It is apparent on a daily basis that Palestinians are suffering significant infringements of their human rights.  Following the escalation of violence and tension in recent months, the United Nations, the European Union and other international bodies must accelerate their efforts to find an equitable solution.  We need to know what came from the meeting that took place after the T&aacute;naiste summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Government needs to live up to its "commitment to recognise the State of Palestine", as set out in the programme for Government.  That needs to happen now to show the people of Palestine who are living in unbearable conditions in their homeland that people in the international community are supportive of them.</p></speech>

Last Monday, 14 May, was the single deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied territories in over four years.  The Great March of Return protests took place on the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, the expulsion - perhaps it might be better explained as ethnic cleansing - of over 750,000 Palestinians, or two thirds of the indigenous Arab population, from their homes by Israeli forces between 1947 and 1949.  On Monday 60 unarmed Palestinians were shot dead and over 2,000 wounded.  In the previous six weeks another 45 unarmed Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli state forces.  The slaughter of unarmed Palestinian protesters carried out by Israel on Monday as part of its response to the Great March of Return in the past six weeks was cold blooded murder.  As we all know, it was the very same as the shoot to kill policy implemented by British state forces in the Six Counties in previous years.  The conduct of the Israeli state forces can rightly be compared to the outrageous and despicable campaign of murder and mayhem visited on this country by the infamous Black and Tans.</p>  <p>  In the face of seven decades of consistent failure by the international community to enforce the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, Palestinian civil society has taken it upon itself to assert its UN-mandated right of return.  Unarmed protesters who are seeking to do this are being met with Israeli sniper bullets.  Nothing has been done to punish Israel for the slaughter of over 100 unarmed Palestinians in the past two months.  Instead, the United States has moved its embassy to Jerusalem and blocked UN Security Council resolutions condemning the killings, while the European Union has continued to reward Israel with increased co-operation.  The entire situation is utterly shameful and sickening.  The massacre of unarmed protesters while the world, including the European Union and the Government, stands idly by is utterly shameful.  The protestors are simply demanding their rights under international law.  They include the right to return, as set down in UN Resolution 194; the right not to be the subject of the collective punishment of an entire population, as is happening with the 11-year siege of Gaza; and the right not to have their lands illegally annexed for Israeli settlement expansions.</p>  <p>  While it is all very fine for the Government to call in the Israeli ambassador, talk is cheap and action is needed.  We need to expel the Israeli ambassador and his staff.  We need to recall the Irish ambassador from Tel Aviv, just as South Africa has recalled its ambassador.  Ireland must end the bilateral arms trade with Israel.  It should call for an international military embargo on the state of Israel on the basis that it is murdering vast numbers of Palestinians in cold blood.  Ireland must call for the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement on the basis that Israel is in clear breach of the human rights clause in the agreement.  Furthermore, the 11-year siege of Gaza must be lifted.  We must commence an extensive boycott of Israeli goods and services.  In 2014 both Houses of the Oireachtas unanimously called for the formal recognition of the state of Palestine.  The Government must formally recognise it immediately.  I commend all of the organisations, including the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, that are supporting the Palestinian people.  I commend all of the people from Ireland who have visited the Palestinian territories in support of the cause.  My own daughter has just returned from such a visit.  She and her companions were blackguarded at the airport.  They were held and interrogated for six hours.  Some in the group were refused entry.  It is time the international community, including the Government, stood up to Israel and supported the rights of the Palestinian people.</p></speech>

The violence has resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians and left thousands of others injured.  Frankly, it is appalling.  The number of deaths shows that there is a need for an urgent international intervention.  As other Deputies said, this week marks the 70th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel which is referred to by Palestinians as the "Nakba", which means "catastrophe".  The decision of the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was ill judged.  All of these factors have resulted in a significant increase in the level of deadly violence and tension in the region.</p><p>The decision of the US to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has resulted in a significant increase in deadly violence and tension in the region.  We have the US President and the Israeli Prime Minister telling us it is a great day for them and for the world - extraordinary statements from people who clearly have blood on their hands.  The United States, once the great brokers of peace in this conflict, have now only exacerbated it.  Now the difficulty is that they cannot be negotiators of peace.</p> <p> The disproportionate use of force by Israeli forces is only serving to compound the situation.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the calls for an independent investigation into those incidents.  At this juncture, peace seems to be an aspiration that is unlikely to be fulfilled.  The situation is becoming increasingly untenable.  It is therefore imperative that the Irish Government, the EU and the international community redouble their efforts to restart this peace process.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always respected and celebrated the establishment and progress of the state of Israel.  We have never questioned the right of the Israeli people to exercise their right to self-determination and self-defence.  However, coupled with this our party has long advocated and supported a two-state solution in the Middle East, although I acknowledge that it may be difficult to achieve given the crossroads we are at.  When in government, Fianna F&aacute;il led Ireland to be the first EU member state to declare that the solution to the conflict in the Middle East had to be based on a fully sovereign state of Palestine, independent and coexisting with Israel.  My party is deeply frustrated about the lack of progress in advancing peace talks, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands, which are illegal under international law, and the deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation in Gaza and the West Bank.  This simply cannot be allowed to continue.</p> <p> Ireland has a long interest in the challenges in the Middle East and we have always acted out of the experience of our own troubled history and out of our overriding respect for and belief in human rights for all people across the world.  Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade have consistently spoken in favour of a peaceful, equitable and lasting settlement in the Middle East.  We have to be deeply concerned about the plight of men, women and children.  Children have been brutally killed.  It is in everybody's interests to try to bring this terrible conflict to an end.</p> <p> While recent years have seen a focus on the Syrian war and refugee crisis, the Palestinian refugee crisis is one of the biggest lasting cases of forced migration in modern history.  Today there are millions of Palestinians living in exile from homes and lands their families had inhabited for generations.  They are without a state.  Many still suffer the legacy of their dispossession, destitution and insecurity.  Human rights violations including house demolitions, land confiscation, forced displacement, restrictions of movement and violence against civilians occur on a regular basis.  Approximately 70% of Gaza's 1.9 million people rely on humanitarian assistance.  The blockade on land, air and sea imposed by Israel following the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007, which is exacerbated by Egypt keeping its own border with Gaza largely sealed, continues to have a devastating effect as access to markets and people's movement to and from the Gaza Strip remain severely restricted.  This is a deep crisis and I urge the Government to do everything it can to try to stop this terrible violence, which is causing outrage and devastation to the Palestinian people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700025#AA00200"><p>I want to reflect on an interview I watched on &quot;Prime Time&quot; during the week, when David McCullagh interview the former Israeli MP, Dr. Einat Wilf, about the use of force by the Israeli defence forces.  It was an extraordinary engagement.  She was asked if she felt their response was proportionate, to which she replied: &quot;I assume you would have been more pleased if more Jews had been killed in the process.&quot;  Rightly, David McCullagh took exception to this.  He further pressed Dr. Wilf as to whether the IDF was justified in slaughtering the Palestinians, to which she responded:</p><blockquote>The Israeli public and the defence forces defending it will not allow people to breach its borders.  These are not unarmed protesters.  There is no question of proportion in defending our borders.</blockquote><p>She also spoke about the internationally agreed 1967 borders and Israel's retreat to them, which it has not done to date.  In concluding, she disputed facts as to whether what the media have seen in the form of dead children were even real and called half of those who were massacred terrorists.  I could hardly believe what I was hearing or the narrative that was being spouted.  Unfortunately, it has been quite typical of the views of the Israeli establishment and Government for some time now.  They are putting forward arguments that are scarcely credible to any of the world although perhaps they are credible to a proportion of their own audience.  They have become apologists for the complete disregard for the human lives of Palestinians and view them as a problem rather than a people.</p><p>Internationally, their track record has been one of disregarding international norms.  In the 1980s alone, 82 amendments were passed in the UN relating to Israel, the majority of which have been ignored.  In the last decade, the situation has become demonstrably worse.  Last December, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution declaring the status of Israel's capital null and void, supporting an international consensus.  That consensus has clearly been breached by the United States in a move that is problematic and provocative.  The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, announced that the US would move its embassy to Jerusalem.  She claimed that no vote in the UN would make any difference and stated that the US was by far the greatest contributor to the UN, warning that the US might cut funding to the UN.  This is an unfortunate reflection of the distance the United States has travelled; it is now very clearly a partisan actor in this conflict.  Monday's move was rightly globally condemned.  It displays a complete disregard of international law.  We see this contempt reflected in Monday's statement, when the US and Israel claimed it to be a historic day while merely 70 km away the IDF was busy massacring Palestinian people, using live rounds with a policy of shoot to kill.</p><p>I also want to raise the issue of recognition.  This is entirely within the gift of the Government.  It could be delivered tomorrow if the Government wished.  It is in the programme for Government.  The Irish Government and Parliament are committed to it.  I believe the vast majority of the Irish public favours it.  Page 144 of the programme for Government states that we will continue to play a role in advancing a stronger role for the EU in the Middle East peace process, having regard to the stalled nature of the process at present, and that we will honour our commitment to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict.  Certainly in the last few days, the Government has put a great deal of emphasis on those last nine words.  Most people would read them as putting such a commitment in context.  They would read them as suggesting that Ireland favours a two-state solution and a recognition would be viewed in that context, without prejudice to a peace process and with a desire for such a process.</p><p>Since 2014 and the votes in both Houses, Government statements have been cautious and delaying, yet ultimately accepting the desirability of recognition in principle.  I am concerned, however, that some of the statements made more recently indicate that the Government may be moving further away from recognition of Palestine, which would be quite shameful.  On Tuesday, the Taoiseach said the programme for Government commits the Government to recognising Palestine as part of a two-state peace solution and that, while we stand over that Government commitment, we do not yet have a peaceful solution.  That is an absurd position.  What does it mean?  What will the Government require?  It is clear that the peace process is moribund.  The programme for Government commitment recognises that.  What does the Government require before it will move?  It can hardly require a fully fledged peace process in which the Israeli Government clearly has no interest. </p><p>Ultimately, making the recognition of Palestine conditional on a fully functioning peace process is in the interests of one side alone, namely, the State of Israel.  I hope that is not the case and that recognition will happen.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will bring Irish pressure to bear as much as possible to end the blockade and the slaughter, as well as the casual disregard for the lives of Palestinians.</p></speech>

I sometimes wonder do debates such as this mean anything to anybody.  One hopes that somebody somewhere is listening.</p>  <p>  This week 58 demonstrators were killed in Gaza doing nothing other than demonstrating, while 2,800 were injured, of which 228 were children.  The response of us as a nation and the Government is to condemn it.  A few weeks ago, a former Russian spy and his daughter were suspected of being poisoned by agents of the Russian Government.  Following on from the response from the US and many other European countries, we expelled a Russian diplomat from its embassy in Dublin.  I do not understand how one can compare the proportionality of our response to the suspected involvement of a government in the poisoning of a former spy to the shooting dead of 58 demonstrators in Gaza.  Ireland is a small nation but, sometimes, a small nation can take a big stand.</p>  <p>  The people in Gaza were demonstrating because there are over 2 million people living on a tiny strip of land without proper water supplies, sanitation, electricity and hope.  No wonder they are demonstrating.  What other option have they?  Without the prospect of a future, subversive groups within the Gaza Strip will come to the fore.  That will just lead to a further cycle of violence and despair.</p>  <p>  As a country, we need to reflect and ask what would be the response of the Government if 58 innocent Israelis were shot dead this week or 2,800 innocent Israeli demonstrators were injured, including women and children.  It would be completely different.  We are guilty of inaction.  We support the two-state solution.  We claim to support and recognise the state of Palestine.  I certainly do.  Yet, we stand idly by when atrocities, such as what happened this week, occur.  By standing idly by, we are as a nation, a Government and a Parliament guilty by association.</p></speech>

I was not surprised at all, however.  I have seen how the Israeli State treats and views the Palestinians.  I have seen how, over the years, it has sought to colonise, conquer and extinguish the Palestinian people.  I visited refugee camps in Palestine and saw the official and unofficial settler policy.  I saw how people were moved out of their own homes and how villages were made uninhabitable to ensure the Palestinians were unable to harvest their own land and forced to leave due to starvation.  I saw the settler roads on which no Palestinian was allowed drive.  I saw ghost towns struggling to survive.  I saw Israeli troops menacing Palestinians and others who took the Palestinian side.  I saw the huge concrete walls, 40 ft in height, built around Palestinian towns to ensure those who service the land in them could not get to it.  I saw the buffer zone and the confiscation of water tables which meant that the survival of towns in Palestine was near impossible.  I saw the queues of farmers trying to get their crops to market being forced to sit out in the sun for hours while their crops rotted away.  Once rotten and no use to the market, the farmers were then let through the checkpoints.</p>  <p>  I spoke to Palestinian fishermen in the territory of Gaza who come under regular gun attack when they try to fish, even within the boundaries set by Israel.  I spoke with those who lost limbs because of the attacks by Israeli gunboats which regularly interfere with their attempts to land fish in Gaza.  I saw the destruction brought on Gaza by attacks, even before Operation Cast Lead, in what is the equivalent of an open mass prison.  I saw the failed water, roads, hospitals and educational infrastructure.  I am proud of my meagre attempts to break the siege of Gaza.  I am proud I was among those who were on the last boat to dock and last to leave Gaza Port in November 2008.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade challenged us that our call for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador was no more than an empty gesture and would serve no purpose.  It is not an empty gesture.  It is the same call of the Palestinians.  It would not be empty if it were followed by a series of other measures which the State can take.  Other Members spoke about the recognition of the Palestinian state.  All the Taoiseach has to say in this Chamber are five words.  Can one imagine the lift that would give to the Palestinian people if Ireland, a country which was colonised and brutalised over centuries, was willing to stand up for their rights?  It could be followed up by a demand by Ireland that the EU review its preferential treatment agreement with Israel and that trade cannot happen while Israel abuses the human rights of the Palestinian people.  It could be followed up by boycotting the purchase of Israeli weapons and the end of dual-use goods sales between Ireland and Israel.  It could be followed up by the immediate end to settler goods being brought into and sold in Ireland.  It could involve the disinvestment of any Irish companies from any Israeli companies or properties.  There could be no State contracts for companies which invest in or trade with Israel.  As others have said, we should consider ending our participation in the Eurovision and the European football championship while Israel is still involved. These events legitimise the attacks perpetuated by Israel last week and before.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade not look at empty gestures but a whole series of gestures which will send out the message that we are willing to stand up for the rights of small nations and those under attack by other nations, as well as the dehumanising of the Palestinian people and the ending of their human rights by the Israelis?  I urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to look at the example we gave when we were to the fore in ending the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p><p>As a small nation we can set the lead.  We should not wait until some other country in the EU takes a stance.  We should be out front setting the standard for others to follow rather than crawlers coming behind all the others.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The committee has met many delegations from Israel and Palestine, including those from civil society, academics, religious leaders and political leaders.  The one thing that came across on every occasion was the overwhelming desire of Palestinians and Israelis to be able to live in peace as well as the need for compromise.</p><p>When we look back to the past and the Oslo Accords, we can see the potential for peace, but those initiatives came to nothing except assassinations and intifada.  The Geneva accord and the initiatives in 2003 and 2009 illustrate the comprehensive solution that could have been brought into being.  There was mutual recognition of both nations, the right to an independent state on both sides, and an almost complete Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders.  There was recognition of a Jewish Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and an Arab Jerusalem as the capital for Palestine.  There was significant support.  In Palestine, support was 49%, and in Israel, support was 52% for that agreement.  There was considerable opposition too.  Despite this, there are non-governmental organisations on the Israeli and Palestinian sides which continue to work in an atmosphere with the belief that they can bring about some kind of compromise.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the NGOs, especially in Israel and Palestine, working on human rights and justice.  I was at the launch of a book on their work recently entitled <i>Defending Hope</i>.  Those involved speak about the great difficulties under which they are working together to try to find a just peace.</p><p>We know that the roots of this come from imperialism, first the Ottoman empire and then the British empire, which gave away the homes of the Palestinians.  We know the emotional, religious and cultural attachment of the Jewish people as well.  The question is whether conflict was inevitable.  Once 1948 came and 750,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes and villages, there was always going to be conflict.  We saw the movement of Palestinians.  It did not stop then and it is not going to stop today.  Having been there, I know there is no doubt about the devastating and disastrous consequences of continued settlement building.  It makes life virtually impossible for Palestinians and it is certainly erodes their dignity as people.</p><p>Let us consider the wall.  The Palestinians start queuing from the middle of the night, from 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.  They are herded like cattle.  They cross over into Israel to work in and contribute to the Israeli economy.  Then they start the journey back in the evening.  Journeys that used to take ten or 15 minutes now take over an hour.  Things like that make life so very difficult.  Palestinians remember how they used to be able to visit their relatives and friends in Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv.  Israelis talk about how they used to bring their families into Gaza to the beaches and the markets there.</p><p>What always strikes me is the great resilience of the Palestinian people in cities like Ramallah and Nablus.  They go to school and college.  They are getting on with life and with their businesses in the midst of all of it.</p><p>I have serious criticisms of both governments because both governments have let down all their people.  I have criticisms of the UN.  We see the whole dysfunction of the UN Security Council and the use of the veto by America.  Representations should be made to the Americans on this.  We do not have an ambassador here but there is certainly one in the UK.</p><p>Israel has a right to protect its borders but the force we have seen is totally and utterly over the top.  The role of the EU has been as ineffective as the role of the UN.  The support for a two-state solution is like a facade.  At the same time, it is like the EU is appeasing its conscience by giving funding to Palestine.  It buys from and sells arms to the Israeli arms industry, which is bombing the buildings that EU funding is constructing.  Israel must be made accountable for its violations of international law and human rights.  Palestine also needs elections.  A serious error was made when Israel did not recognise the results of the last election.  Hamas representatives were elected but that was a democratic process and it needed a peaceful transition to power.  So much of what we are seeing today could have been avoided.</p><p>There is also a need for honesty with the whole business of the two-state solution.  How can it be viable?  It is like suggesting putting two counties from Leinster with two counties from Munster, one from Connacht and one from Ulster and calling it a state.  There has to be honesty.  Perhaps the honesty can come about from discussing a one-state solution whereby the Palestine people would have exactly the same rights as those in Israel, including the same rights to services, infrastructure, education and healthcare.</p><p>A Palestinian academic made a point.  He said the West Bank is an open prison but that Gaza is like a high-security prison.  We know the statistics and the number of people who are living there.  Some 1.7 million or 1.8 million people are living an area the size of County Dublin.  The fishing industry is a source of food and the source of livelihood for these people but it is constantly being pushed back in again.</p><p>Two other groups always get lost in this kind of discussion.  The first is the Bedouin and their right to the kind of life they live.  The second group is made up of the residents in the Golan Heights.  They are frequently forgotten about in all of this.</p><p>We have to start somewhere.  What is happening now has pushed everything back.  We know there are families and communities in Gaza who are grieving horribly.  I came across a line from a Michael Longley poem I used to discuss in school called <i>Ceasefire</i>:</p><blockquote>I get down on my knees and do what must be done<br /><br />And kiss Achilles' hand, the killer of my son.</blockquote><p>Something has to be done now.  It is time to get back to the table to talk, listen, compromise and reach a consensus.  We have the example of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

Let me state in the most unequivocal manner that what we witnessed on our television screens from the Gaza Strip last Monday was state-sponsored murder involving the massacre of 60 Palestinian adults and children.  It was a crime against humanity.  The almost simultaneous images coming out of Jerusalem last Monday juxtaposed to those coming from the Israeli-imposed border with the Gaza Strip can only be described as gut-wrenching.</p>  <p>  It has to be put on record that the current United States President has grossly enflamed this decades-long interface.  The decision to relocate the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is a grave mistake.  It has been condemned, rightly, by countries throughout Europe and the world.  President Trump has embarked on yet another ill-considered solo run that has directly contributed to the death and slaughter of innocent Palestinian citizens.  By carrying out this act, President Trump has provided the rogue state of Israel with a licence to kill.  He has the blood of innocent Palestinian children, women and men on his hands.  Faith and trust in peace-making efforts have now been set back, it is to be hoped not irreparably.  Confidence has been utterly shattered.  The present US regime has now passed the point of no return and will never again be viewed as capable of performing as an honest broker in this conflict.  It has to its shame taken one side over another.  In this instance, that is a fundamental error.</p>  <p>  The behaviour of the state of Israel with the deployment of snipers along the Israeli-imposed Gaza Strip limits must be condemned at the highest levels of all decent thinking nations and international bodies.  The use of live fire against unarmed civilians needs to be called for what it is: indiscriminate murder.  I reiterate, the Israeli state is conducting a campaign of murder against the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government needs to take a strong line on this, far stronger than heretofore.  The contemptible comments by an Israeli spokesperson calling for Ireland to move its embassy to Jerusalem as well showed the Israeli regime up for what it is: an uncompassionate and murderous state that has no respect for, and places no worth on, Palestinian lives.  The Irish Government should expel the Israeli ambassador with no ifs, no buts and no maybes.  The excuse of keeping lines of communication open does not hold water.  Israel has no intention of negotiating a lasting peace.  It has been brazenly emboldened by the United States and will do whatever it likes at this time.</p><p>Palestinian lives simply do not come into consideration.</p> <p> As with apartheid South Africa, Israel needs to be isolated by the world community and forced into treating the Palestinian people with respect and on an equal basis because it is crystal clear it will not do so voluntarily.</p> <p> I send my sincere condolences to the families of the 60 people slaughtered on Monday.  I demand a cessation of the use of so-called live bullet rounds by Israel in such circumstances in the future.  I reaffirm that Sinn F&eacute;in stands four-square behind the long-suffering people of Palestine in their struggle for basic human rights, including the right to live and prosper in peace on their own lands.</p></speech>

They have passionately articulated the shock and concern of the people at these events.  The Government fully shares these sentiments.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, listened carefully to the views expressed and ideas proposed.  They will be taken into account fully in his work and that of his Department on the issue.</p>  <p>  The Government has made it clear that the events we have seen in Gaza, specifically the massive use of live ammunition without a clear, real and immediate threat to life, are unacceptable, must cease and be investigated.  The T&aacute;naiste set out clearly the restrictions in international law on the use of deadly force and that they have not been followed.  I will repeat only his summary of these aspects of the issue.  Like all states, Israel is entitled to defend itself and its borders, but it is not entitled to do what it has been doing this week and in recent weeks in Gaza.  These points have been made clearly and strongly in successive public statements made on behalf of the Government in the D&aacute;il and directly by the T&aacute;naiste when he summoned the Israeli ambassador on Tuesday.  </p>  <p>  Many Deputies, perhaps reflecting the anger and frustration we have all heard from constituents, called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador or the recall of the Irish ambassador from Israel to signal our anger at these events.  The T&aacute;naiste explained carefully in his remarks on Tuesday the reason this would not be a fruitful or appropriate response.  Ireland's foreign policy has always been built on dialogue and engagement, however slow and frustrating they may be.  Expelling the Israeli ambassador would command the headlines for a few days and we would feel good about ourselves, but it would permanently marginalise Ireland's voice on these issues in places that matter.  We are seeking to persuade people in Europe, Israel and elsewhere of our point of view.  I am not sure if Ireland has ever expelled an ambassador on the basis of differences with his or her government.  That is not the correct approach to take. </p>  <p>  The question of recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine has also been raised.  The position on this matter remains unchanged.  The Government is committed to recognition of Palestine as part of an overall peace settlement, as has been the policy of successive Governments.  The T&aacute;naiste has stated on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il his view that the moment for recognition of Palestine by Ireland has not yet arrived.  Recognition must be a symbolic act and could, in the right circumstances, also be an important one.  However, as a symbol, the impact and timing of recognition are everything as it will not change anything on the ground.  This is an issue for the Government of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has consistently stressed on behalf of the Government Ireland's support for calls for an independent and transparent investigation of recent events in Gaza and the circumstances of such large-scale use of deadly force.  Ireland this week co-sponsored a request for a special session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva to consider these events.  It is expected that such a meeting may be held on Friday.  At this session Ireland will support any appropriately worded motion to establish such an inquiry. </p></speech>

They all relate to the removal from the Bill of references to the relevant committee structure.  </p><p>On amendments Nos. 1 and 2, the proposed changes to the Long Title relate purely to changes made on Committee Stage insofar as the relevant committee structure was concerned.  They delete elements of the Long Title that concern this structure, the purpose being that the Long Title will be fully consistent with its provisions.  Amendments Nos. 66 to 72, inclusive, 74, 79, 80, 96, 98, 101, 103 and 104 all achieve the same purpose of deleting what might be described as superfluous references to the relevant committees across ten sections of the Bill.  There is, therefore, some tidying up to be done and amendment No. 66 does this in respect of section 26(1) by deleting a leftover reference to a relevant committee.  Amendment No. 67 addresses a punctuation issue.</p><p>Amendment No. 68 deletes a drafting construction referring to a relevant committee inserted for the purposes of section 9, which is also superfluous.  Amendment No. 69 removes a hang-over reference to &quot;relevant committee&quot; in section 27.  Section 27(3), as passed by the select committee, provided for an interpretation in terms of the relevant committees of certain references.  With the removal of the relevant committee structure, such interpretation has no meaning and amendment No. 70 simply deletes subsection (3), as is necessary.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 are further drafting amendments, in this case taken together, to make sense of section 28(1) in order that it is clear that the records to be kept include records relating to the recommendations of the commission as those of a relevant committee will not exist under the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 74 is a drafting amendment relating to the removal from the Bill of the word &quot;committee&quot; and inserts the term &quot;Commission&quot; in its stead.  Again, the amendment is essential to achieve consistency across the drafting. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 79 and 80 are also drafting amendments.  Amendments Nos. 96, 98 and 101 are further drafting amendments that propose deletions from the Bill.  Amendment No. 103 removes the reference to &quot;relevant committee&quot; from section 55, while amendment No. 104 makes a similar correction in respect of section 58.</p><p>Having regard to the meat and veg of the Bill, so to speak, to which we will come later this afternoon, I put it to Members opposite that at this stage we are merely acknowledging issues that were considered and passed on Committee Stage.  My contention is that these are merely drafting amendments to ensure consistency and that we have a workable legislation.<br/><br/>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ross.</p></speech>

One way of looking at that may be that it is a reflection of the fact the Bill is, as I have said, a vanity project of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

The purpose of those amendments was to remove from the commission the overly complex structure of committees that had been put into it by the Minister.</p>  <p>  In considering all amendments to the legislation, in particular this group of amendments, we should take into account what is the purpose of this legislation.  One cannot consider the amendments without considering the purpose of the legislation.  The purpose of the legislation is to establish a commission, an advisory body that will provide advice to the Government on individuals who should be appointed or nominated as judges.  It is important to note it is not a regulatory body.  It is an advisory body.  As it is an advisory body, it requires expertise.  The reason it requires expertise is because in Ireland, as in virtually every country in the world, one can only be appointed as a judge if one is a lawyer.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, may object to that.  Maybe his next proposal is to insist that judges cannot be lawyers and we should only have other individuals appointed as judges.  However, at present, the law is that one can only be made a judge in Ireland if one is either a practising barrister or a practising solicitor.  Therefore, the whole purpose of the legislation is to try to ensure that there is a group of expert individuals who can give advice to the Government as to who is a suitable person for nomination for appointment to the office of judge.  As a result of that, it requires expertise.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, when one looks at the commission that is being proposed by the Government, for some reason the objective of the Government is to ensure that the advisory body contains a majority of persons who do not have expertise.  On numerous occasions, I have asked the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan and Ross, and other Deputies, can they identify what is the public benefit or purpose in having an advisory body which has a majority of persons who do not have expertise in the area of who are suitable persons to be appointed to judicial office.  If this were a regulatory body I would understand perfectly why it would be appropriate and necessary to have a majority of persons who did not come from what the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan and Ross, refer to as the legal side of the house but this is not a regulatory authority.  The reason one has a lay majority in a regulatory authority is because one wants to instill public confidence that the regulatory authority will not be making decisions based on the fact that they are members of the same group.  Here it is completely different.  It is an advisory body.  One wants persons who have expertise to advise the Government in respect of who are the best persons to be appointed to the position of judge in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ross, had a good point - regrettably, he is like a broken clock in being right only once or twice a day.  His good point related to the mischief.  I agreed with him on this.  The problem the legislation needed to resolve was that in the past individuals had been appointed to judicial office because they had a political association.  Deputy Ross overstates that problem but he is right in stating that occurred.  I stated that occurred.  The reason I brought forward legislation, and I thought the reason the Minister, Deputy Ross brought forward legislation, was for the purpose of dealing with that mischief.</p>  <p>  Where that mischief occurs is in the Cabinet.  It is the problem with the political decision-making in Cabinet.  The problem, that was identified and is correct, is that too broad a number of individuals were being recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to the Government.  The solution to that problem is not to attack the advisory board.  The solution is to cut down on the numbers of persons who can be recommended to Cabinet.  Instead, however, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has gone off on a completely irrelevant and unexplained tangent.  Instead of concentrating on the mischief, which is politicians appointing persons because of their political connection, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has got another target in his sight, namely, to attack the Judiciary.  Nowhere has the Minister, Deputy Ross, ever explained what is the purpose behind that particular targeting.  What is clear is that the legislation and the amendments, which are being put forward in many cases by the Government, will not deal with the problem.</p>  <p>  In fact, they will set up an advisory body, a commission, that has as its sole objective that there must be a majority of lay persons on it.  This is disrespectful to the Judiciary which is not uncommon from this Government.  I do not recall a Government that has ever been so disrespectful to the Judiciary.  The purpose of their contentions is to suggest that judges and lawyers are all the same and in it together when, in fact, a judge is a former lawyer.  Judges are independent of the legal profession.  It is disrespectful to the Judiciary and wrong to suggest that judges and lawyers are the same cabal.  It is completely incorrect.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality is correct in stating that the amendments in this grouping are technical amendments which all arise from the deletion of the committee structure on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I will be supporting the amendments.  They are mainly drafting amendments.  They make sense.</p>  <p>  It was beneficial to the Government that the committee made changes on Committee Stage.  In fact, the amendments that were made on Committee Stage improved the Bill and the Ministers should recognise that.</p></speech>

In general, as I outlined previously, my party's position on the final vote remains in open consideration but as regards each set of amendments and each individual amendment, we will evaluate them on the basis of their merits.</p>  <p>  We will be supporting this first group of amendments, which are largely technical.  It mainly relates to providing, in a drafting sense, for a tidying up after decisions taken at committee to move from a position of separate committees being responsible for the appointment of judges to different courts to a position where the commission in general would be responsible for the appointment to those courts.  The Minister was, with that approach of the different committees, trying to facilitate the participation of the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court.  Broadly speaking, I believe we were moving towards a consensus to resolving that issue on Committee Stage.  The comments of the Attorney General may have thrown a spanner into the consensus that was emerging.</p><p>I nonetheless believe there was a general agreement about how it might be resolved.  Perhaps the commission could be expanded such as is anticipated here or it could be done on the basis of <i>ex officio</i>members.  That would facilitate the bringing on of the presence of those two courts.  It makes sense to bring those two on.  I am anxious to preserve the lay majority.  It was the right decision to move to a more comprehensive single body and that the commission would be responsible for appointments.  A number of amendments that were discussed on Committee Stage came from a submission from Dr. Patrick O'Brien from Oxford who made a number of points, some of which were taken on board.  He made the point that the judicial appointments commission committee structure described in what was then section 11 and section 13 appears to be over-engineered having regard to the comparatively small number of appointments that are to be made to the Irish courts each year.  He said it might be more economical and might lead to more consistency if the practice of constituting a slightly different committee for each appointment were replaced with a provision permitting the president of each court or their nominee to take part in the deliberations of the judicial appointments commission when they are considering candidates for that court.  It is not quite what is anticipated by the Minister but nonetheless the same principle applies that the presidents of those courts should be in a position to participate.  If all appointments come through the commission, there will be more consistency and there would be an understanding by the commission of the different needs and requirements in each of the appointments as well as the common attributes that would exist.  In regard to those particular amendments, we will support them.<br/><br/>I will respond to what Deputy O'Callaghan said about the lay majority.  It is something we firmly believe in.  It is not a particularly radical proposal to have lay participation and a lay majority.  While the Judiciary has served us substantially very well in the State there is an issue with regard to the transparency of the appointment of judges.  Fianna F&aacute;il has its own reasons for adopting the position it has adopted.  There is history in that regard.  It seems very clear to me that the Judiciary does not represent society as a whole.  We will move further on into amendments which reflect upon how the lay appointments will be appointed and how we can ensure we have lay members on many public boards and that they are not necessarily reflective of society as a whole.  We will move on to how we can improve it and how we can change the backgrounds of those lay members to ensure they are reflective of society as a whole.  Our Judiciary does not reflect Irish society.  The objective of several of the amendments that I and others have tabled is to ensure the judicial appointments commission tries to ensure we move to a position where the Judiciary is more reflective of society as whole.  With regard to the lay majority, I do not believe it is entirely possible to achieve that objective and to move to that position if we have a judicial majority reproducing the same dynamic and being reflective of the reality that exists.  That is the reason for the ideal that there would be people from organisations dealing with victims, people in rape crisis situations, young offenders, immigrant communities and a wide variety of experiences.  It is important that it is part of the commission and that it makes up a majority of the commission.  There should be significant representation there from the Judiciary, including all of the heads of the courts, namely, the Presidents of District Court and the Circuit Court.  That is the dynamic that will best result in a process that is independent and transparent, which is what we all aspire to.  It will ensure we have a Judiciary that reflects Irish society and that consequently the decisions it makes take account of the differing experiences of Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I will be here 100% of the time next week.  I did not think this business would happen this evening.</p>  <p>  We spent five sessions over many hours deliberating in committee.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, might not think we were genuine but there was no bias against one side or the other.  I agree 100% that reform of how we appoint judges is really important.  It is crucial we do that.  I am 100% in favour of reform of the way we appoint judges.  I am sure the Minister read the Official Report of the proceedings of the committee.  Before the Minister, Deputy Ross, went into government he said political paws had to be taken off how we appoint judges.  What was presented to us in committee was not doing that.  We were doing anything but taking the political paws off it and, in some way, even increasing them.  I disagreed with that and I have said so.  The way we have done it in the past is not good.  I agree that it does not reflect society as much as it should.  We all accept that one needs a certain amount of ability to do the job.  We all know a such-and-such a judge was appointed by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party and that should not be the case.  We are all conscious of the fact that it is what transpired.  We are in favour of changing it.  I am not hung up on a lay majority either.  Who are the lay people that will be in the majority?  We argued a lot about that at the committee.  If they are from the political stable or the Civil Service, then I would be just as comfortable with the legal crowd picking them.  Our amendment No. 7 was ruled out of order because it was deemed it would result in a cost on the Exchequer but it is not true.  I put two judges on to sit in the District Court and the Circuit Court and we all agree the District Court judge and the Circuit Court judge should be on it.  They are getting paid by the State already.  They will not get a salary from the commission.  I took off a lay person who would get a salary.  The result of my measure would be to save the State money.  The Government had 13 members but I put forward 14 members.  I had two extra judges who would not get a salary from the commission and I took off a lay person who would have been getting a salary.  How can the Government or the powers that be deem that to be the case?  I am not saying it is the Minister's fault.  I do not know where the decision comes from.  I do not understand this process.  </p></speech>

I still do not understand how the system works.  It is not true to say my amendment would result in a cost to the Exchequer.  I strongly disagree with that.  I have appealed to the Ceann Comhairle and he said if my amendment does not come up until next week he will look at it again and that is fair enough.</p>  <p>  I am inclined to support Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 11.  That amendment would not incur a cost to the Exchequer.  My amendment provides for seven judicial members and seven lay members and the 14 would pick their own chairman.  The committee was determined to come up with something that was better than what we had.  We wanted to take the political paws out of the equation a bit more.  </p>  <p>  The Judiciary, in its preliminary submission to the Department on the legislation, said that radical improvement is required with regard to judicial appointments and not a tinkering around the edges of the current process.  They acknowledge that we need to do things better.</p><p>I cannot help feeling that the fact that the amendments tabled by me and Deputy Clare Daly were thrown out means that we are being thrown back into having to bring the Attorney General back into the equation.  That is where Fianna F&aacute;il is going to be driven.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not support it as there will be no lay majority, but perhaps it is a done deal.  I do not know what goes on behind the scenes between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.</p></speech>

At the committee we all agreed that there was no logic to the Attorney General being involved in both processes.  The Attorney General has more control and authority in the second process.  As a member of the Cabinet at the time when the three names are presented for one to be selected, he or she has huge influence.  That is fair, but where is the logic in him or her being involved in both decisions?  It does not stack up.  Because of the tinkering with the amendments, we are being driven back to having to get the Attorney General back on both sides again.  Give us a break.  We are trying to do it right and want to reform how we appoint judges in Ireland.  If one looks at all of the current judges, one can see how many came from private schools and all of the political connections to one party or another.  It is a joke.  People want to see things being done differently.  We agree 100%, but we need a little common sense.</p></speech>

The judicial appointments process is in need of radical reform.  We, as legislators, have a job to do which we take very seriously.  Bringing forward legislation requires a hell of a lot of work in our offices at all stages.  It should be done in the interests of the common good, not political expediency.  I take no pleasure in saying the manner in which the Bill is being handled and the presence of the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, show that this is a politically expedient measure, which is not a good way to produce legislation.</p>  <p>  There is irony in the fact that the Government has probably created records in the history of the State in the political appointment of judges.  About a year ago we were reminded that appointments would only take place over the dead body of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, but here he is, despite the fact that so many have been made in the meantime.  Clearly, there is not enough work to be done in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, even though there is a lot to be done in respect of Dublin Airport in my constituency.  I wish somebody was doing it.</p>  <p>  We have put in a huge amount of work into the Bill and agree that there is a need for radical reform.  However, a couple of things really get my back up.  First, the intervention of the Attorney General after Committee Stage was a disgrace and I have no problem in saying so.  The committee had put in hours of work.  I had the misfortune to sit in at a different committee this morning and, given the way that committee conducted its business, the Government should be incredibly grateful for the hard work and diligence of Opposition members of the justice committee which are without parallel in this D&aacute;il.  The Attorney General said we had made a dog's dinner of the Bill, but if he had listened to a fraction of the arguments that had been made in the committee's deliberations, he would have known precisely that the Bill had been a mess from the start.</p></speech>

We all agreed in our own way that we wanted the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court to be involved and on Committee Stage grappled with the different ways of doing this.  The amendments in this group are a tidying-up exercise to deal with leftover references to the relevant committees - the Government's original way of getting the two boys in without making the committee too unwieldy.  However, in the spirit of the deliberations, we put back in the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court, while also respecting the wishes of the committee to keep the Attorney General out because it would have given him two bites at the cherry and meant too much political influence.</p>  <p>  The Government has tabled an amendment to increase the size of the committee to 17 to bring back the Attorney General, with the two Presidents.  On the other hand, our amendments have been ruled out of order.  If our amendments which seek to have a 14-person committee, including the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court, were to be passed, we would save the Exchequer money, in comparison to the Government's option of having a 17-person committee, as the Minister is proposing today.  I do not accept that our amendments should have been ruled out and agree with the points made by Deputy Wallace.  Whether there is a lay majority is not the most decisive issue for us.  The debate was always about removing political interference from the process.  I also believe the manner in which we are handling this issue is an insult to the Judiciary and that it will go down very poorly in the history books.</p>  <p>  The incredibly speedy manner in which the legislation has come back from the committee for Report Stage is a little odd, given the complexity of the issues raised as a result of the changes made in full engagement by the committee.  As every vacancy in the next ten years has probably been filled, there is no urgency.  The Department of Justice and Equality was charged with the responsibility of dealing with many other urgent items of legislation.  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill was a priority for the Department, the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, who met us and senior officials this time last year to discuss advancing it through all Stages before the summer in order to provide for mandatory inquests in cases of maternal death.  The Minister and the Taoiseach assured me that the Department would bring forward the legislation in February and March, but it is now May and it is not even listed.  We are again heading towards summer without it, which is why a lot of people have come to the conclusion that we talk a lot here but do not deliver.  We have a responsibility to call Departments to account, but in doing this in the interests of political expediency we are not treating the legislation with the seriousness it merits.  It is indecent, very wrong and regrettable.</p></speech>

They knuckled down and produced amendments.  They are genuinely interested in reform of the Judiciary.  That is what Committee Stage is for and it did take a long time to complete.  I have no quarrel with this because of the thorough and forensic way in which they addressed the Bill.  I might not agree with all of their amendments, but I accept, as I am sure they do, that it will be the D&aacute;il which will give its verdict on what has come back from the committee when the amendments are voted on.  If Deputy Clare Daly believes there has been a reluctance to accept her good work, she should not do so.  She did tremendous work, as did Deputy Wallace and all other members of the committee.</p></speech>

It is also important that Deputy O'Callaghan realise Ministers are not totally and utterly confined to their portfolios.  I was elected on a platform, as was the Deputy and he is entitled and duty bound to speak about the issues about which he was elected to speak.  The fact that he has landed the justice and equality portfolio does not exclude him from speaking about other issues.  I hope he does not regard it as a compulsory muzzle on what he has to say because he says it with great eloquence.  However, he speaks with equal eloquence when he speaks in the Four Courts.  In what we are discussing he is representing not only the people of his constituency but also the voice of the Law Library.  That should be acknowledged by us every time he speaks about this issue, but he does have a vested interest in promoting the interests of the Law Library.  I acknowledge, of course, that he is capable of separating that vested interest when he comes into this House, but it should be pointed out that his opposition to the Bill is probably related to his experiences in the Law Library which are very valuable.  However, they bring him from a certain perspective in addressing this issue.</p></speech>

We are all united on one issue, namely, that the prime objective of the Bill is to remove the rotten practice of politicians appointing friends, cronies and political loyalists to the Bench.  The Deputy is correct in stating the Bill he produced also included this objective.  One of the problems with the JAAB was that there were three lay people on it, which was often cited as justification for its independence and impartiality, but the three lay people were always nominated by the Government or the Minister of the day.  I do not propose to name anybody.  If memory serves me correctly - I think it does - of the three appointees to the last board under Fianna F&aacute;il, one was a former candidate for Fianna F&aacute;il in the European Parliament elections, while another was a gentleman who had been director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That puts into perspective the respect with which Fianna F&aacute;il treated the particular body.  This practise had to end.  The Bill may be imperfect, but it will end that practise.  </p>  <p>  We can go on debating until the cows come home who is going to be on the commission of selection, but following enactment of the Bill what we will have which Deputy O'Callaghan from the Law Library cannot stomach is a lay majority.  Having a lay majority is imperative because we do not want to see political patronage and insiders replaced solely by judges and legal insiders.  It is all very well to say we need to end political patronage and be united in that regard, but to say we have to have a judicial majority - we know that the judges do not want lay people to be on the board-----</p></speech>

I would prefer to have a smaller commission than what is being proposed, but that is not going to happen.  The great virtue of the Bill is that there will be a huge independent input into the choice of judges.  Let no one say there will be no judicial influence because the representative of every court will be on it.  They will have massive influence, more than I would like, but I acknowledge the importance of having them there to have a major input because they have expertise in the area.  They should not, however, have the final decision because that will lay open the charge that we are just replacing one group with another.  When the Bill is passed, political interference will be no more.  That will be a great and radical achievement.</p></speech>

I have tabled 69 amendments to the Bill, the vast majority of which seek to return the Bill to its original state, as initiated, because of difficulties we encountered when reflecting on the amendments made on Committee Stage.  Some of the amendments made were inconsistent with Government policy, while others were unworkable from a practical point of view, which I believe is accepted.  Some were unacceptable from a legal perspective and also a constitutional standpoint.  I have proposed a number of key ministerial amendments, some of which we are debating, on which I hope to receive the support of the majority in the House, acknowledging that due to the configuration of the Parliament the Government is in a minority.  I appeal to Members to ensure that, ultimately, we will have legislation that is consistent with the Constitution, legally robust and responds to the need for reform of the appointments system in accordance with a number of items of legislation, not all of which came from this side of the House, introduced in the past few years in response to the need to modernise a vital component of the democratic system.</p>  <p>  It is important that we reverse the decision to remove the two court Presidents from the new process.  I think there is agreement across the House that there is a role for the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court, with the Presidents of the other courts, in the process.  The removal of the Attorney General was a mistake.  It is important that in the next few days in debate we acknowledge the role and functions of the Attorney General and provide a role for him or her in the process.  Other aspects that were clearly unconstitutional are also being addressed, for example, the imposition of an explanation requirement on the Government subsequent to making some appointments.  I look forward to the amendments being considered carefully.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work done by the committee.  It did a lot of work, as acknowledged by the Government, including the Minister, Deputy Ross.  It is important that we do not lose sight of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700033#JJ00100"><p>Although the Minister, Deputy Ross, has been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 37 years, his comments displayed an extraordinary lack of political maturity.  I fully recognise that a Minister is entitled to speak on other topics, in a way that I as a spokesperson for justice and equality am also entitled to speak on other areas.  I was pointing out, however, that it is extraordinary that a Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is prepared to sit through all of the Report Stage amendments.  I have no objection to the Minister, Deputy Ross, speaking on Second Stage when he did, or coming in at the end to give his speech when the Bill is passed or defeated.  To have him sitting here for all of the Bill amendments while we have a crisis in our transport system is simply alarming.  It underlines once again what this Bill is.  It is a vanity project for the Minister, Deputy Ross.</p>  <p>  The Minister also criticised me.  He gave me the credit of stating that I am a representative of Dublin Bay South, which is my constituency.  He said that I stand here and speak as part of a vested interest on behalf of the Law Library.  I will not apologise to a former stockbroker for the fact that I am a barrister.  I am very proud to be a barrister.  When I come to the House, I speak on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il and on behalf of my constituents in Dublin Bay South.  I do not speak on behalf of anybody else.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, and I have no objection when it comes to the involvement the Law Library should have in the judicial appointments commission.  The Minister's proposed legislation says that there should be one person nominated to the commission by the Bar Council.  I agree with that.  The Minister is also trying to put a second barrister onto the commission by including the Attorney General.  The Minister wants two barristers on the commission and I only wanted one.  The Minister needs to get his statistics correct.</p>  <p>  As well as launching an extraordinary attack on the Judiciary by stating that their appointments are rotten, he then went on to make an even more extraordinary attack on the lay members of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  Now the villains are the politicians who appoint judges, the judges on JAAB who advise on the recommendation of judges, and the lay people who are JAAB.  We must realise that there is only one solution to this problem.  Let the Minister, Deputy Ross, pick every judge in the country.</p></speech>

The whole thing is unbelievable.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has acknowledged that because what we did on Committee Stage was inconsistent with Government policy, the Government is trying to bring us back to where we were before Committee Stage.

He has now come up with hare-brained arguments around unconstitutionality that were never made on Committee Stage.  The Minister has said that he is reinstating the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court, but he is wrong about that because it was everyone of us who argued for the presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court to be members of this commission.  In the original Bill the Government left them out and now we have this convoluted committee to try to get them in through the back door.  That was the Government's mess, which it is now trying to reinstate.  Members in this House tried to do this on Committee Stage in a better way, so the Minister's assertion and the argument about unconstitutionality are absolute nonsense.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has said there would be a lay majority on the commission.  He said that whatever happens from now on, it would be a lay majority, independent of political interference.  This is nonsense.  In fact, the Government's amendments to reinstate the Attorney General to the commission enshrine political interference and bring it back to the commission and to the final selection stage, because the final stage of judicial appointments will continue to rest with the Government.  The idea that this proposed legislation will break the link between political appointments and that it will herald in a new dawn is utter nonsense.  A lay person can be just as much a political appointee as a judge or can have political views.  We are trying to reform the whole system and the manner in which this has been handled, and some of the commentary so far, has been disgraceful and an abuse of an important function.</p></speech>

As far as they go, the amendments are relatively sound and reflect they fact that on Committee Stage there was a general consensus on the direction in which the Bill would move.  It is my analysis, while one would never think it, that Fianna F&aacute;il has essentially conceded the principle of much of this argument.  The comments of the Attorney General about the Bill, however, were ill-informed and very inappropriate because of the context in which they were made and the manner and type of language used.  His comments were ill-informed because they separated out the text of the Bill, as it existed at that time, without considering the discussion that had happened on the Bill and what the discussion clearly pointed to, namely, consensus in favour of a lay majority, consensus about finding a way to return the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court on to the commission, and consensus on the need to ensure the lay nominations for the commission and those who come from the public appointments system are more radically reflective of Irish society and bring in a greater breadth of experience.  With regard to criteria that must be reached by the lay majority nominations, there is no question of these lay members being mugs.  There is a very lengthy list of criteria and expertise expected.  The lay members of the commission would be eminently qualified and capable.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that this is radical legislation.  We are all agreed on the need for independent and transparent judicial appointments.  This is not a particularly radical proposal.  If we want to be radical in dealing with this, then we also need to consider other reforms of the Judiciary, including sentencing guidelines.  I have made this point a number of times and the Ministers will be aware of this.  I firmly believe that both pieces of legislation need to be considered as a package to reform the Judiciary properly.</p></speech>

It is important that we have a constructive debate on the merits of the amendments.  I acknowledge the good work by all members of the committee on many aspects of the Bill.  I believe that everyone is agreed that on Committee Stage we were left with a document that was far from perfect.  The purpose of the various Stages of debate is to improve on issues, if we can.  I hope that over the next few weeks we can reintroduce the spirit of constructive engagement that we had on Committee Stage for a number of weeks, oftentimes outside of the spotlight of the media, and that we can work in the way we need to ensure we can have improved legislation.  Although it might seem strange, given the last hour's debate, it is my firm belief that there is not much between us.  We can go through the more than 100 amendments to see how best we can reform the system in the way that life in 2018 deserves, and that we can modernise the manner in which judges are appointed.  Ultimately, under the Constitution, this will be a matter for the Government.  We are not changing the Constitution and we are not advocating a change to the Constitution.

I had misread the grouping.  As I reflected in my contribution on the previous grouping, it is vital that the Judiciary reflects greater diversity because that would benefit those who appear before it, be they complainants or accused.  The amendment would not change the fact that everyone appointed to the Judiciary should be adequately skilled, qualified and experienced, which is important.  Rather, it would adjust the Bill slightly so that the commission would have regard to the diversity principle as outlined.  On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, spoke in opposition to this idea on the basis that it would be too restrictive.  As I pointed out then, there exists the objective of the Judiciary reflecting the diversity of the population as a whole.  This amendment would make that a firmer principle, subject to the merit principle.</p><p>I was not properly prepared, as I misread the grouping, so I might contribute again in a moment.</p></speech>

The rest are concerned with tidying up, providing rules around the Irish language and so on.  I support amendment No. 3, which is similar to the proposal that Sinn F&eacute;in tabled on Committee Stage of a merit or diversity principle.  Under the amendment, when the commission is proposing a list of people for appointment, at least one of them should be someone who furthers at least one of the objectives of the diversity principle, mainly, that the membership of the Judiciary should be gender equal and reflect the diversity of the population as a whole.  This is a good idea.  I foresee practical difficulties with an absolute obligation that at least one of the names should further the objectives of the diversity principle, but we need to discuss this proposal further.</p>  <p>  A Law Library submission on the gender pay gap in the barrister profession in 2017 pointed out that only 38% of the total Law Library membership was female.  Worse still, the attrition rate among female barristers was much higher than it was among men, with only 16% of the inner Bar - senior counsel - being women.  While it is not a requirement to hold a senior counsel position to become a judge, let us face the fact that, with such an attrition rate, it is likely that a good deal fewer than the 38% of barristers who are female will succeed in getting the full ten years of practice that are necessary to be appointed to the District Court or Circuit Court or the 12 years that are necessary to be appointed to a superior court.  We need to factor these issues into our discussion.  Granted, solicitors can also seek appointment as judges, but their success rates to date have been much slimmer.  Only eight solicitors have been appointed to the superior courts since 2002, with none appointed to the Supreme Court.  Of the eight, none is female.  This problem needs to be addressed.  I appreciate the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment's intention of trying to do so.  If we do not include such measures, the problem will not be addressed.</p>  <p>  If the amendment were to pass, would it lead to more women becoming barristers and more solicitors putting themselves forward for judicial appointment?  One would hope so, but I imagine that it would be difficult in the first few years.  That said, we should not resist the idea, particularly if it is put up to the Law Library to encourage more women to become barristers and more solicitors, including female solicitors, to apply for the role of judges.  This positive principle sets the bar for the Law Library in encouraging diversity.  Diversity is necessary and important if we are to have fair and impartial judgments and if judges are to reflect life's diversity when people appear before them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700034#KK00400"><p>We all agree on how important it is that the objective behind this legislation should be to try to ensure that the best people are nominated for appointment as judges.  Consider the legislation that I introduced and the Bill that is before the House.  Section 7 of the latter refers to the fact that people should be selected based on merit.  Regarding Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment, I have no objection to inserting a specific principle called the &quot;Merit Principle&quot;.</p><p>I also agree that we should make efforts to ensure that there is greater diversity on the Bench.  As Deputy Clare Daly stated, however, that requires more diversity in the legal profession.  One can only become a judge if one is a lawyer.  That makes sense.  It is required to have expertise to be a judge.  Sometimes people believe it is just about making a decision based on a judge's preference for these facts over those facts, but lawyers are appointed to be judges because judges need to have expertise in the law.  They must understand the Constitution, statute law and the rules of evidence.  In this anti-expertise world, it is sometimes presented as though anyone could do the job.  In many respects, being appointed as a judge is like being appointed as a consultant oncologist, in that one would need to be a doctor and have expertise first.  We must recognise that the merit principle is necessary.</p><p>I have a slight concern about the diversity principle.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the importance of ensuring diversity, but the diversity principle in Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is unambiguous and has two requirements:</p><blockquote>(a) the objective that membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, and<br /><br />(b) the objective that the membership of the judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.</blockquote><p>There are two parts to this principle, not one.  Subsection (3), however, places an unambiguous requirement that at least one of the three people who are going to be recommended by the commission must be a person whose appointment would further the objectives of the diversity principle.  In my reading, the principle would not necessarily be complied with if the commission simply recommended a woman, as a woman only complies with half of the diversity principle.  I would be interested in the Minister's comments on this point.  We should note that section 7 of the Bill contains a set of requirements:</p><blockquote>(a) the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, and<br /><br />(b) the objective that the membership of the judiciary should, to the extent feasible and practicable, reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.</blockquote><p>The Ministers may not be aware - I hope that the Minister, Deputy Ross, does not object to the fact that I have some knowledge in this area - that trying to attract top lawyers, highly qualified lawyers and lawyers who would make good judges into applying for the Judiciary is difficult at the moment.  If we are to ensure that the high standard of the Judiciary continues, we must make it more attractive if we are to get better people to apply.</p><p>The other amendments in this grouping relate to a matter on which my amendment was accepted on Committee Stage.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for his generous comments about the contributions of all members of the committee.  My amendment was on the necessity of ensuring proficiency in the Irish language among the Judiciary.</p><p>I tabled it not because I love the Irish language, which I do, but rather because it is important to recognise that people in this country have a constitutional right to have their case heard through Irish if that is feasible.  It will not be possible in all circumstances.  There have been attempts to have criminal trials heard in Irish, some of which attempts have failed.  We must recognise that people should have an entitlement to have their cases heard through Irish if that is feasible and we should try to facilitate people in that regard.  That right would be watered down by amendment No. 5 tabled by the Minister.  One must also consider amendment No. 102 in that regard because it proposes that in order to ensure proficiency in the Irish language among the Judiciary that "The Commission shall consult with the Courts Service for the purpose of keeping under review the needs of the users of the courts with respect to proceedings being conducted in the Irish language".</p> <p> It is important to recognise that not everyone who applies to be a judge must be proficient in the Irish language and very few applicants will be.  There must be, however, a sufficient number of judges on the High Court, appeal courts and, in particular, the Circuit and District Courts who are able to hear cases through Irish.  I note the Minister's amendment but I would like to know the purpose behind it and whether in some respect it waters down the clear wish of members on Committee Stage in accepting the amendment now contained in section 7(2)(c).  It is important that we recognise that entitlement of people to have their case heard through Irish and we should try to facilitate that.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Callaghan has mischaracterised the amendment, which contains several qualifications.  Section 7(2)(a) addresses the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women and 7(2)(b) provides that the membership of the Judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.</p>  <p>  As regards expertise, it is probably true that there is greater hostility and there are issues in terms of the attitudes people have towards expertise in society as a whole, but that is not necessarily a feature of this debate.  No Member is suggesting that any of the lay members of the commission would not be experts and the amendment does not suggest that any appointee to the Judiciary would be anything less than expert.  Anyone to be considered for appointment under the diversity principle would also have to satisfy the merit principle.  All persons considered for appointment would have to reach a certain minimum standard.</p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy O'Callaghan that one would have to satisfy both subsection (2)(a) and (2)(b) because the wording of the amendment is that "under this Act shall include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the Diversity Principle".  That is not the same as having to satisfy both those subsections.  The amendment provides that the appointment of at least one of the candidates would be in furtherance of the objectives of the diversity principle, that is, either (2)(a) or (2)(b), which is quite a low threshold.  For example, if the majority of the Judiciary were male, as is the case, at least one of the candidates would have to be female.  That would very clearly be in furtherance of the diversity principle.  Numerous other examples could be given.  It is not an unreasonable expectation and would be very easily satisfied.  There is no obligation to appoint a candidate who satisfies the provisions.  Rather, the requirement would be that the appointment of at least one of the eminently qualified people would in furtherance of the objective of diversity but the decision on appointment would be for the commission.  It is not a particularly radical provision but it is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-17a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018051700035#LL00300"><p>Amendment No. 3 proposes to insert a new section in place of section 7.  The amendment is identical to an amendment discussed at some length on Committee Stage and ultimately withdrawn by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to facilitate other amendments to section 7.  I acknowledge that the Deputy flagged that he would resubmit the amendment on Report Stage but in so doing he has failed to take into account a change made to section 7 on Committee Stage by an amendment that introduced the objective of Irish language proficiency.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I was not amenable to accepting the amendment and I reiterate that now.</p>  <p>  Subsection (1) of the proposed replacement section 7 states that "No person shall be recommended, under this Act, for appointment to judicial office unless they are of sufficient merit to discharge with distinction the responsibilities of the office to which they are appointed (the &ldquo;Merit Principle&rdquo;)."  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section has the effect of benchmarking the merit-based recommendation against the objectives of having an equality of men and women in the membership of the Judiciary and diversity among that membership.  The objectives are denoted by reference to a diversity principle.  Subsection (3) stipulates that "a list of persons recommended for appointment to judicial office under this Act shall include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the Diversity Principle".  I am not at all sure that the Bill should require the commission to select in such a specific manner.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the points made by Deputy O'Callaghan on the issue.  He made a lot of sense on the merit principle.  Deputies are aware that there are several elements to how the Bill addresses the issue of population diversity and gender equality.  Under section 7, subject to decisions being based on merit, the concerns in regard to gender balance and diversity in the membership of the Judiciary are very clearly brought to the fore by way of a requirement that regard must be had to them for the function of selecting and recommending persons for appointment.  Gender equality and diversity feature elsewhere in the Bill, such as sections 12(5) and 50(5).  Section 12(7) provides that one area where knowledge and experience is to be to the fore in the selection of lay members is with respect to "human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity amongst members of society".  Under the review process provided for in section 53 the procedures committee must monitor and review the implementation of the Act including, in particular, the diversity among candidates for appointment.  It must report its findings to the commission which, in turn will report to the Minister with recommendations.  I am satisfied that the Bill addresses this issue adequately as well as that which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire intends to achieve through the amendment, and I am not inclined to support it.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss amendment No. 4 and other amendments in this grouping which are in my name.  Amendment No. 4 is a drafting amendment.  As regards amendment No. 5, section 7 was amended on Committee Stage such that, in addition to the objectives that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women and reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, a third objective now provides that there shall be proficiency in the Irish language among judges, subject to the fundamental requirement that merit be the basis for any decision to recommend a person for appointment to office.  Under section 7, regard shall be had to those three objectives.</p>  <p>  Section 50, which was section 55 of the Bill as published, was also amended on Committee Stage.  It regards the procedures committee and its role and function.  There ought to be more consistency in section 50(5)(f) with the language of the objective of gender equality in 50(5)(c) and that on the objective of population diversity in 50(5)(d).  For that reason, I have tabled amendments Nos. 5 and 100 and related them to a new subsection, the subject of amendment No. 102, which I am sure Deputy Clare Daly will welcome.  Similarly, amendment No. 100 provides that, in the context of the statement to be prepared by the procedures committee, section 50(5)(f) will prescribe that a matter to which the committee shall have regard will be the written statement to be provided under section 50(7).</p></speech>
