Their work is truly heroic; it is the personification of true Christian values.  Their simple objective is to relieve the hardship endured by homeless people.  However, their work gives crucial insights into the failure of the various housing strategies and interventions to date to resolve the crisis.  They are at the coalface and they see the daily realities of this failure in the context of the number of people turning up for breakfast, lunch and food parcels and, in particular, the extraordinary number of children in emergency accommodation who also attend the centre.</p><p>Their story at the coalface is one of a scandal that is becoming worse, especially for the children.</p> <p> Some years back the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People was told that the emergency accommodation crisis for children would be solved.  I will give the Taoiseach an insight.  In 2013, there were 2,747 children attending for lunch.  In 2016, there were 8,353 children.  This is a 76% increase and a shocking indictment.  They are extremely worried about the overall well-being of these children who are forced to attend the centre and the debilitating and damaging impact that emergency accommodation environment has on the children's development.  It is heart-rending and the State is failing these children right now.  Total presentations at the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People are close to 400,000 a year to avail of the various services.  The costs are about &euro;3.5 million.  The State's contribution is &euro;450,000, which is embarrassing relative to the scale of the crisis and the response of this centre to it.  Ministers have visited the centre and the Taoiseach has visited the centre, and yet there was a social worker who retired in 2012 and that person has never been replaced.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has acknowledged the urgent need for a child welfare officer, particularly for child protection issues, but nothing has happened in this regard, and there have been a number of other demands and requests made.</p> <p> The key point is that there is an enormous disconnect between the reality at the coalface, as evidenced by the daily work at the centre, and the official rhetoric about strategies and interventions.  Housing policies are not impacting on this daily reality, which is getting worse.  It is a fact that we are not building enough council houses.  There is some ideological opposition across the system to that.  It is appalling.  Houses are not being built quickly enough and the emergency accommodation crisis is getting worse for children.  This should be our overall priority.</p> <p> I want the Taoiseach to recognise and acknowledge this reality and to work with the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People to attend to its immediate needs in recognising the reality of the emergency crisis for children and work to provide the officers the centre requires and the assistance the children require.  This reality is not going anywhere soon.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the interventions to date have not made any dent on this appalling indictment of State policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200004#B00200"><p>This is part of the challenge we face as a society and as a Government in delivering and providing services for people in a various categories who have real problems in this regard.  I have been down to visit Brother Kevin at the centre on a number of occasions.  He is an extraordinary man and he has been doing this work for years.  Obviously, the numbers who turn up at his centre speak for themselves.</p>  <p>  It is not all without inactivity.  The Government has allocated serious resources for tackling homelessness in the budget for this year, with &euro;100 million being spent on homeless services.  This is not an insignificant figure.  In addition, the overall housing budget for this year is &euro;1.3 billion.  Deputy Martin and I have discussed this before and the issue is how quickly the necessary houses can be built.  The Minister has set out targets for not having people in emergency accommodation and targets for providing accommodation for people who are homeless and sleeping rough or who are in hostels at various locations in Dublin.  Some of the projects have been extraordinarily successful.  In 2016, there were 3,052 households that exited homelessness, which is the highest level ever.  The ambition is very high this year.  Deputy Martin spoke of building houses, and work is under way on advancing 650 rapid-build homes in 2017.  There will be another 500 units in 2018.  O'Devaney Gardens is up the road from Brother Kevin's centre.  That site has lain there for years but work is now under way.</p><p>There are places like George's Place in D&uacute;n Laoghaire with 12 homes, St. Aidan's off Brookfield Road with 71 homes, Poppintree in Ballymun with 22, Cherry Orchard in Ballyfermot with 24, and so on.  Construction is under way in quite a lot of places.  I agree it is by no means perfect and there are always gaps in the level of services that are provided.  These issues are being addressed constantly, as Deputy Martin is well aware.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has a special unit which meets regularly.  It has provided incentives, opportunities and shortcuts for private enterprise to be able to build houses on public property and for local authorities to provide houses.  The development of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme has made an important contribution, as has the provision of homes and services for those who have particular difficulties.</p> <p> The Dublin Region Homeless Executive confirmed a minimum of 142 people on its last count at the end of the year.  Developments have taken place to provide beds in what are very good hostels.  I have looked at a number of those.  Brother Kevin does an extraordinary job.  This is part of the enormous range of challenges the Government is trying to meet.  We must have the engine that can drive our economy to provide these services, be it chiropody or dental or whatever, down in those centres.  Deputy Martin may shake his head.  It is not as perfect as one would wish but these matters are receiving real priority, not just from the HSE but from the different agencies to try to provide in the best and most effective way possible for many of these people.  Part of that is putting &euro;100 million on the table for services and &euro;1.3 billion this year for housing for the homeless, social housing and so on.</p></speech>

The hotel money is an appalling waste.  The Capuchin centre gets &euro;450,000 and the Taoiseach is talking about &euro;100 million for children in emergency accommodation.  I will give the Taoiseach the figures again.  In 2013, 4,747 children attended for meals at that centre.  At the end of last year, 8,353 had attended.  That says it all.  There is a terrible disconnect between the official rhetoric and the reality.</p>  <p>  The census figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, give the truth as well.  A total of 2% of all houses and apartments occupied nationwide at the moment are new, built between 2011 and last year.  Some 11,572 new houses were built in Dublin during that time.  The Taoiseach knows the big difference between the CSO figures and those of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in terms of actual new builds.  In no way is the response commensurate with the scale of the crisis.</p>  <p>  One lesson that I took away from the Capuchin centre, which they wanted me to bring back to Leinster House, was the enormous psychological impact on the children in terms of the stigma of homelessness and the lack of any stable, permanent anchor in their lives.  No officers have been appointed.  The very least the Taoiseach should do is recognise the reality for those children and give additional supports and officers to the centre.</p></speech>

Every local authority has at its disposal finance and services to provide in the best way possible for those children, and there are some with very particular difficulties, as the Deputy is well aware.  The Government has made the decision to provide &euro;5.3 billion to deliver social housing between now and 2021.  The Deputy says there is a disconnect between that figure and the reality of what is happening on the ground.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing have told every single local authority: "There is your money.  Show me your sites.  Build your houses.  Here are the incentives."  Years ago, local authorities were very active in building houses.  They range now between approved housing bodies and local authorities.  The money is on the table.  The housing assistance payment this year will accommodate 15,000 households and will help to keep people in their homes.</p><p>Last year, nearly 18,500 housing supports were provided from a housing budget provision of &euro;935 million.  It was spent in full for that very purpose &ndash; to keep people in their homes.  This included nearly 5,300 homes that were built or purchased and 12,000 housing assistance payment tenancies.<br/><br/>Part 3 of the Minister's programme is the plan to build 25,000 units per annum, on average, by 2021.</p></speech>

They called a halt to the Government's plans and privatisation agenda and the Taoiseach did not like it one bit.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il cobbled together a deal that seeks to subvert the will of the people and their democratically expressed wishes on the future of our water services.  The Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services was on the verge of agreeing a report that would have comprehensively addressed the demands for which so many people have protested and marched in recent years.  However, the Taoiseach was not having that.  The Taoiseach could not listen and accept the will of the people.  The Taoiseach still clings to the hope that he will finally have his way.</p>  <p>  The antics of the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to save the Government's rejected water policy have been truly a sight to behold.  The political choreography was set.  Senior counsel came to the committee and delivered legal advice that completely contradicted the legal advice offered only one week before.  Conveniently, the legal advice delivered yesterday was in line with the Government's needs.  It tore through the agreed position of the committee and gave the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il a way out.  Yesterday, it was confirmed, for once and all, that the Government's confidence and supply agreement is in reality an agreement for connivance and cute-hoorism.</p></speech>

The cute-hoorism is, as ever, provided by Fianna F&aacute;il, which has flip-flopped once again.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members have used their political strength not to be constructive, as they proclaim, but to face down and thwart the will of the people.  In a most spectacular U-turn, Fianna F&aacute;il has shown once again that it cannot be trusted.</p></speech>

What they call the centre ground is in really the insiders and the political classes.  It is those who believe that power and authority are their entitlement.</p>  <p>  In this report, Fine Gael has its levy for excess use.  This is a way of keeping the back door open for the return of charges.</p></speech>

The answer is the majority.  I am glad that, in respect of this matter, a report has been agreed and that the Oireachtas can now proceed to deal with the legislation to give effect to that, which will provide an opportunity for people who have excessive usage to conserve water.  It will also ensure that people will pay a penalty for excessive usage.</p></speech>

I came into the D&aacute;il in 2011 and brought in with me, probably for the first time, dozens of families and individuals, including children, who were facing housing emergencies at that time.  I warned the Taoiseach that his policy of moving away from direct council housing construction towards reliance on the private sector would generate a crisis.  Today, again, there are approximately 25 households, individuals, families and children in the Visitors Gallery.  They are just the tip of a very dire and desperate iceberg of misery, anxiety, insecurity and suffering because of the abject and total failure of the Government's policies on housing and homelessness.</p>  <p>  I want the Taoiseach to look those people in the eye and tell them that his housing policies are working.  Tell Sinead and her three year old daughter, who was told a few weeks ago to go 12 km into town with her children to a hostel where there are active drug users.  She then had to fight to get into a hotel and last week was taken into hospital with stress because she is still homeless.  Tell James and his family - a mother and their five children - who have been homeless for the past six months, whose daughter has special needs and who are being pushed from one hotel or emergency accommodation to another.  Tell Richard, who is recovering from addiction and who is only offered hostels where drug use is rampant despite letters from his doctors about his mental health issues.  Tell Peter, who is drug free but who is in emergency accommodation with active drug users, whose mental health is seriously at stake and who was recently hospitalised.  Tell Carrie, who has been homeless for a year and is forced to share a room with three people who are smoking heroin.  Tell Tom, who has been homeless for five years and who had to lodge court papers against South Dublin County Council because it took him off the housing list and took away his time.  Tell Amanda and her two children, Sarah and Eamon and their four children, Samantha and her three children, all of whom had HAP tenancies - the Government's great solution and the centrepiece of its housing policy - and who are all now being evicted by landlords who want to pull out of the HAP arrangements.</p></speech>

The very reasons the Deputy outlined for the people who are faced with this situation are the result of an economy that collapsed and a construction sector that vanished.  This Government and that which preceded it have set about rectifying matters.  We have done a lot of things in terms of having an engine to drive the economy.  The people who are going into the 38 houses that are being completed in September of this year in Belcamp have the same stories.  The people who are going to occupy the 24 houses in Cherry Orchard in July of this year have the same stories.</p><p>The people who are going into the 30 houses on Mourne Road in Drimnagh in June of this year have the same stories.  The people who are going into the 39 houses in St. Helena's in Finglas have the same stories.  I could give the Deputy their names and their details also.  I feel sorry for those in the situation the Deputy has described.  I do not know about the situation whereby a housing officer or an individual in a local council would send somebody ten or 12 miles away, as the Deputy has described.  He mentioned that particular case before.</p> <p> There are lists of houses that are currently under construction and for which taxpayers' money has been put up.  Money has been given to local authorities to get on with building.  Quite recently, &euro;200 million was allocated by this House in order to obtain access to sites so houses could be built for people such as those the Deputy describes.  Nobody wants to see the situation continue.  This Government is working very actively on this.  That is why there is a senior Ministry for housing and a special unit in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  That is why an unprecedented amount of money has been provided to all local authorities to buy, renovate or build houses.  We will not have this solved until the people the Deputy mentions and those who come after them, or those who find themselves in particular difficulties, are housed in proper accommodation.  That is the intention and ambition of the Government.</p></speech>

This is not about the collapse in 2008; it is about a policy decision the Taoiseach's Government made in 2011 at which time he said the new policy represents a fundamental reconfiguration of the landscape of housing support in Ireland.  The statement went into detail.  The Government was to stop building council housing and rely on leasing arrangements with the private sector.  That is the root of the problem.  It has been a disastrous failure.  The plan of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has not broken from that.  It has, in fact, expanded that misguided, disastrously-failing policy, which is resulting in people in HAP tenancies &ndash; the centrepiece of the Taoiseach's strategy &ndash; now being evicted from the supposedly secure social housing the Taoiseach said the policy would provide for them.  There is ridiculous box-ticking with the objective of getting everybody out of hotels by July.  Does the Taoiseach know where they go?  They go onto the street or into hubs in town that are full of addiction and drug use.  The strategy is failing disastrously and the Taoiseach will not admit it.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach do what Mr. Edmund Honohan advocated and start a compulsory purchase programme to buy empty properties and buildings to house the people in these circumstances?  Will he order NAMA to immediately stop selling off land and property-----</p></speech>

Once they are closed, it will leave these rural towns without any form of banking facility at all.</p>  <p>  Ulster Bank claims the restructuring of its services is required to meet the ongoing cost challenges of RBS, yet this is a flawed rationale.  Ulster Bank had a recorded profit of &euro;280 million in 2016 and paid a dividend of &euro;1.5 billion to RBS.</p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that the banks are not interested in addressing the needs of communities.  They will always be driven by profit margins, but while private sector banks restructure their businesses and move online, communities still need banking services to survive.  How does the Taoiseach expect rural communities to restructure with them?  They cannot, and rural communities will suffer as a result.</p>  <p>  Banking services are vital to the survival of towns.  Reports and studies have shown the consequences of banks retreating from rural communities, not only for customers but also for small business, which Fine Gael loves so much.  In the UK, lending to SMEs has reduced by 64%, and the reduction is as much as 104% where the town has no bank left.  A town received on average &pound;1.6 million less in lending the year after a closure.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will reply to me that Ulster Bank is not an Irish institution and the Government cannot intervene.  I have already got that from the Minister for Finance.  Let me remind the Taoiseach of the consequences facing rural Ireland because the Government refuses to intervene: an ongoing transport crisis, including the latest Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute, Garda station closures, post office closures, delays in rolling out broadband, continued emigration, and banking closures.</p>  <p>  While the Government may not be able to intervene in the latest bank closures, there are issues it can influence.  In rural Ireland, we have a network of community banks called credit unions.  The Government continues to hide behind the regulator who is doing nothing to facilitate them to develop in a way that can assist their communities and meet the needs of rural towns, for example, funding social housing projects or providing a range of banking services.  It is as if, like Ulster Bank, the Government does not care about the needs of rural communities and the Government's policies reflect that in prioritising private sector banks over credit unions.</p>  <p>  As well as Ulster Bank's announcement last week, we heard from An Post, in last night's "Prime Time", that it has identified 265 post offices as non-viable.  No doubt we will see plans crystalising over the coming months seeking to close these too.  Interestingly, McKinsey was consultants to both Ulster Bank and An Post and was the author of their strategies for nationwide closures.  No wonder these strategies look so alike.</p>  <p>  It is over two years since the Kerr report on the future of the post office network was published.  What implementation have we seen by the Government?  None.  The Government has merely allowed the crisis to deepen.  The Taoiseach can avoid taking any responsibility for Ulster Bank and the communities that are being devastated by the bank, but he cannot wring his hands and claim no responsibility for the destruction of the post office network and the continued stifling of credit unions.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle has not referred to the very substantial rural development programme that has been published by Government across all Departments which includes a direction for the provision of 135,000 jobs, out of 200,000 to be created over the next number of years in areas outside the greater Dublin region, including the Deputy's area.</p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle is clear on his remarks about the post offices.  The Deputy might like to know that between 2004 and 2010 there were 345 post offices closed.  He did not refer to any of those at all.  In the past five years, there have been 37 post offices closed.  No post office will stay open unless people use it.</p>  <p>  The Government has made a decision that there should be basic banking facilities made available in post offices, and we are working on that.</p></speech>

Two reports on credit unions were produced.  The Government has implemented them and is fully supportive of the credit unions all over the country.  It is not true for the Deputy to say that the Government has no interest in rural Ireland - far from it.  In fact, many of the major policies of this Government are focused directly on giving opportunity and incentive to rural Ireland, not least the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding the roll-out of national broadband.  The review of the capital programme for the next number of years, which will provide opportunities for infrastructure throughout all parts of the country, including the Deputy's area, is under way.  As a result, I do not accept at all his suggestion that the Government has reneged or is reneging on its commitment to rural Ireland.  Every single regional sector has shown a growth in employment.</p> <p> In respect of the Deputy's opening remarks about the way people do their business now, he should appreciate - as I am sure he does - that &euro;14,000, I think, is now spent online every minute by people doing their business.  The way people do their business has changed and it will not go back to the way it was.  I cannot speak for Ulster Bank, but we do support the credit unions and the opportunity to provide basic banking facilities in post offices and to give them whatever services can be given.  Post offices will not survive unless they are used by people.  They cannot be locked away if everything is dealt with online.  If they are social centres, which they are, and very important for communication, they must have a range of services that people will use and want to use because that is the lifeblood of business as well.</p></speech>

Three months after its announcement, we face the possible closure of 265 post offices, reduced bus services and the scuppering of the national broadband plan by the Taoiseach's Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  How does this reflect on the Government's action plan?  It shows that no action is taking place.  People cannot use post offices if the latter cannot provide services.  That is the bottom line.  Two years on from publication, the Kerr report has not been implemented.  All the Government does is open up more consultations.  Nothing actually happens, and that is the problem.  The Government needs to take action.  I have met the Registrar of Credit Unions.  The Registry of Credit Unions gives the perception of being helpful but it does nothing except place obstacles in the paths of the credit unions.  The Taoiseach's Government can change that policy and engage with and direct the registrar to be a facilitator of the credit unions providing services, not a blockage in their path.  The Government can take action but, unfortunately, is not doing so.  It can take action to strengthen the post office network and the credit unions and allow them to facilitate and help people and business in rural areas but it is too slow in dragging out the roll-out of these plans.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that since last July nobody has got any water bills.  Is that correct?  I do not think they will get any in the future either.  That is just a little observation when all the outrage and rhetoric is made.  There was a reason for that.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government said funding would be increased for home care packages and home help every year.  A research project was carried out, I think by the Health Research Board, HRB, on the overall situation pertaining to resources for home care packages, home help and nursing homes.  There was some suggestion that a means test would be introduced for home care.  Will the Government fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a uniform home care service in order that all recipients can receive quality support seven days a week, where possible?  That is in the programme for Government.  Is that a real commitment?  Could the Minister indicate the follow-up in terms of the HRB report?  One of the biggest challenges facing us, thankfully, is that people are living longer in Ireland than did any previous generation but that will require far greater end-stage-of-life interventions, in particular in the form of home care packages, home help and nursing homes.  The fiscal side of the House has never quite come to terms with that demographic reality and there is a need for some intervention in that regard to try to marry the two.</p></speech>

We have a commitment in the programme for Government to increase funding for home care packages and home help hours this year and it is our intention to continue that in future budgets.  The Deputy is correct that there is a need for a statutory scheme for the delivery of home care.  Deputy O'Dea tabled a Bill on the issue a number of months ago.  We now have a process in place.  The HRB report published yesterday is the first step in that process, whereby we look at what other countries are doing in terms of putting such a scheme on a statutory basis.  That will be followed by a consultation scheme, which will be launched in May by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  One would hope that the HRB report and the consultation scheme will pave the way for the introduction of such a scheme.</p></speech>

On 29 April, the Taoiseach will go to the European Council meeting and the guidelines for the negotiations with Britain on Brexit will be agreed.  We have already raised with the Taoiseach our deep concern about the guidelines, particularly Article 11 which is weak, vague and certainly insufficient.  It does not provide the negotiating platform necessary to protect the interests of Ireland North and South.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that time has not been made available for a debate in advance of the Taoiseach's attendance at that meeting.  I asked him before about his willingness to accept an amendment to Article 11 and to argue for that.  That is what I believe he should be doing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has formulated a motion in the wording that we believe is necessary to provide us with the kind of protection that the Government, or whoever is Taoiseach, will need to seek in respect of Ireland.  Is the Taoiseach willing to accept a proposition for such an amendment to Article 11 to strengthen our position and his position as our negotiator?</p></speech>

The fact that Members of this House will not have pre-statements before the Council meeting, which has been standard practice, is an affront.  The Taoiseach talks about democracy but this is an affront to democracy.  Those statements need to take place on Thursday.  Yesterday I presented the Taoiseach with a letter from Deputy Gerry Adams which included our motion.</p>  <p>  We have now seen the European Council's draft guidelines, so it is clear to us that whatever initiatives were involved from the Irish Government they have failed.  The Taoiseach has failed to secure a veto or the position of this D&aacute;il which is to have a special, designated status within the EU for the North of Ireland.  It is of the utmost importance that we should have that discussion so that the Taoiseach is better informed before he goes to that Council meeting about the views of this Parliament in terms of the negotiating stance he has to take.</p>  <p>  Will  the Taoiseach confirm that we will have pre-European Council statements, as we have had for every single European Council meeting heretofore?  We all agree that this is the most important such meeting the Taoiseach will have attended during his time as Taoiseach.</p></speech>

It is a meeting of 27 countries who happen to be members of the European Council.  I am not going to be petty about this.  If the House wants to have a discussion on the pre-April 29 situation I am quite happy to do that.  I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Doherty, however, because the priorities we have set as a Government for Northern Ireland are all included in the letter from the British Prime Minister.  They are specifically referred to in the paper from the European Parliament and are also referred to individually in the paper from the European Council's President, Mr. Tusk.</p>  <p>  There are a number of meetings taking place over the next week to ten days.  We have submitted some further wording in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, what it means and how important that is to the priorities we have already set out.  It is a matter for the House or the Business Committee and I am sure the Chief Whip will oblige.  If they want to have statements before the meeting of the 27 member states, I do not mind.</p>  <p>  Deputies have been pretty well briefed on this matter and there is absolutely no shortage of material.  We are very different from the Gibraltar case, when Deputy Doherty talks about vetoes.</p></speech>

I think they are the absolute norm and this is a particularly important meeting of the Council.  We discuss this matter virtually every day during Leaders' Questions and we have had very good interactions in respect of preparing the ground for these matters.  However, I have always been of the view that getting the right start for this country is critical and, as I indicated yesterday, I am concerned.</p>  <p>  I want to ask about legislation.  We have had much discussion in recent times about oversight and accountability in policing in Ireland, but the Taoiseach will recall that we have had an equally long set of discussions in respect of accountability in the context of the administration of justice in our courts.  We have long been promised a judicial council Bill.  In fact, if I recall, heads of the Bill were published as far back as 2009.  We still have not got that legislation.  I am aware that there is parallel legislation on the appointment of judges which is before the justice committee.  We still have not seen the heads of that Bill.  We have a scheme from Government and we have proposals from the Fianna F&aacute;il party on that Bill that still have to emerge from that committee but, parallel to that, where does the judicial council Bill stand?  I presume it is going to be separate legislation.</p></speech>

Is there any possibility that we can hurry it up through the various Stages?  I know there is an amendment to that Bill that aims to stop bogus pregnancy advice clinics operating.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware of it, but we have an extraordinary situation where these unregulated clinics remain unregulated as long as they give misinformation and tell lies.  They are sometimes abusive towards very vulnerable women who are facing crisis pregnancies and often use the most objectionable methods to frighten women into not taking the option of having an abortion.  Despite that, these clinics remain unregulated, whereas those clinics which give factual, proper health information are regulated under the 1995 Act.  Some of these clinics were inadvertently funded by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  We recently saw the exposure of yet another clinic giving bogus information to women in crisis and stressful situations.</p></speech>

Deputy Howlin has done some very important work on this.  I suggest that the most appropriate way is for us to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists and we to make it very clear that if women want to ensure they get accurate advice, they should go to counsellors and psychotherapists who are licensed and registered.  That work is already under way.  We have had public consultation.

It is also stated that the biggest ever allocation for health was provided in budget 2017.</p><p>However, in the South/South West hospital group, funding is being sucked dry by County Cork.  Kerry is being left subservient to Cork.  If this is allowed to continue, University Hospital Kerry will be left as a glorified community hospital because all operations will be taking place in Cork.</p> <p> A number of months ago, I presented the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, with a programme whereby cataract operations could be undertaken in County Kerry.  This plan was agreed with the South/South West hospital group but there has been no movement on the plan to date.  Last week, I again reported the case of a man who will go blind under the Minister's watch in County Kerry.  That is not right.  It should not be allowed to happen.</p></speech>

He seems to be doing a large amount in terms of leadership.</p>  <p>  Other Members have welcomed the long-awaited decision on Orkambi.  Page 64 of the programme for Government deals with this matter and the Government's use of European initiatives for breakthrough drugs such as Orkambi and others.  I will not get back into the quite intemperate contributions from all Members of the House in their frustration over the considerable period they were waiting for this decision to come.  We welcome it now and we commend all involved in bringing it about, such as Jillian McNulty, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, the company itself and others.</p>  <p>  However, there is a major problem with the process here.  We must look to the European example, such as the early access programme in Germany and France where these breakthrough drugs can be made available immediately while the health technology assessments, HTAs, are being carried out and while the matter is being considered.  In comparison, our process is very obscure and lengthy.  It goes to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, which seems to take about a year.  It then goes to a drugs committee in the HSE which has a complete budgetary focus.  Nobody knows who is on that committee.  At present, there are 31 drugs lost between the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the drugs committee.  People's only recourse is Joe Duffy's radio show-----</p></speech>

That will provide them with the best emotional support in the challenge that they face.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank young Aisling, who I met at the protest in Sligo.

I am sure the Taoiseach is very aware of the seriousness of the potential closures of post offices.  It is an issue of concern that has been brought to his attention by all citizens of this country.  I am aware a protest took place outside his constituency office so I am sure he is acutely aware of it.  He has made the point that he has an interest in rural Ireland.  If he has an interest in rural Ireland I ask him to protect our post office network, which is vital.  The postmasters' union has one simple question, namely, what this Government is doing to protect the future of post offices.</p></speech>

In terms of what is happening in reality, however, and I have been asking the Taoiseach this question for four months, he is allowing the collapse of the post office service, which might suit the Government.</p></speech>

Nine priority actions and 23 recommendations are identified in the Kerr report.  It is a classic case of the Government fiddling while Rome burns.  In my constituency of Wicklow, two post offices are now closed pending the outcome of this review.  We know about the issue of the electronic fund transfer.  That is a key issue and one of the main recommendations from the Kerr report and without it being fully implemented and put in place, there will still be an issue in terms of people opting to have their social welfare payment sent to a bank as opposed to a post office.  If the Taoiseach is serious about this issue, and I have to take him and his Government at their word that they are serious about protecting our rural post offices and post offices across the State, he would first end the confusion between the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and act to implement all the recommendations and priority actions in the Kerr report.

Two post offices in my area closed quite recently.  Both were advertised and consultations took place but nobody wanted to take on the job.  It is hard to direct that people would do this.  What are we doing about this?  On television the other night, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment referred to the national roll out of broadband, which will allow post offices to have access to broadband.  We are also actively encouraging people to have their social welfare payments paid at post offices, which is their choice.  We support the introduction and roll-out by An Post of the e-payment account.  An Post has announced its intention to launch a new payment account from its own resources.  It is not seeking Government support for that.  We support the model of community banking and this is being processed by the Department of Finance along with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  We established the feasibility of offering a motor tax service and other social services in post offices.  This is being finalised with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but will ultimately require An Post to engage in delivery.</p> <p> I mentioned the report brought forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, regarding hub post offices.  Four of those will be rolled out as part of a pilot scheme.  We will support the establishment of a post office network renewal process based on the An Post plan over five years.

My question about promised legislation concerns a group of people who cannot avail of public transport.  I refer to those with severe disabilities who are on low incomes.  A commitment was made by the Government to provide for a scheme to make individual payments as a contribution towards transport costs for these people.  The Government has a role to play in helping these individuals, who are socially isolated and have difficulty accessing so many different types of services.  What is the progress in respect of this matter?</p></speech>

I raised this issue with the Taoiseach several months ago when I asked him to include Louth in the rent pressure zones.  It appears that the Taoiseach has not acted on that.  I also made him aware that there were over 4,000 people on the housing list in County Louth, that there is a chronic shortage of private rental accommodation and that the little accommodation that is there is either unaffordable to most or landlords will not accept the housing assistance payment.  Perhaps the Taoiseach does not give a damn about it.  If this is not the case, will he give a commitment here today to include County Louth in the rent pressure zones given that it has the highest increase in rents and will he give a date as to when he will do that?</p></speech>

Obviously, it has major implications.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs set out the views of the Cabinet and Government on the report yesterday.  The Government is conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the questions of redress in advance of any conclusions that will be reached by the commission.  In addition, the redress scheme that was there was complex to administer and often difficult for applicants.  The Comptroller and Auditor reported recently on the 2002 residential institutions redress scheme and highlighted the cost to the State, the diminution in the value of the offers made by the congregations, the need for evaluations and lessons learned.  The focus will now be on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in the mother and baby homes with a view to offering very meaningful supports that will be of genuine and practical value to them.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will consult with representatives further about this.  We want to do this in a way whereby the State will help and support these people - through the provision of appropriate services - in respect of this aspect of their lives.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is working with Tusla to support the provision of information to assist former residents who may wish to establish when they resided in a mother and baby home.  This might involve very painstaking work on a matter that is obviously very personal for some people who want to find out where their mother was or who she was.  Dr. James Gallen from Dublin City University has been asked to assist in the design of a model of transitional justice as a means of giving voice to former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.  The Minister will carry out a scoping review of the commission's existing terms of reference to see if amending them would enhance the existing work and help to resolve related questions.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Taoiseach, precisely, about the urgency of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, environment and climate action.  The reason I believe this is urgent is because the Taoiseach has said that he does not interfere in industrial relations but we have an ongoing dispute, which is a national crisis, in our public transport.  It is now in its 20th day and as we speak, the parties are in the Workplace Relations Commission meeting.  I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact, as already outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett in the D&aacute;il last week, that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, now has &euro;100 million extra from VAT that it had not calculated for and was not expecting.  A figure in the region of &euro;18 million or &euro;19 million could sort out the deficit in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that this money is lying there and if it could possibly be used to save the company?  When the issue was raised of the &euro;17 million that could be saved by paying Bus &Eacute;ireann the equal amount of social welfare subsidy for free travel as is paid to the private operator, I noted that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, responded by stating this was like comparing the price of free travel with the price of subsidising Coca-Cola.  This indicates to me the utter class snobbery driving this Government.  The Government - and especially Ministers such as Deputy Varadkar who were born and bred with a silver spoon in their mouths - does not understand ordinary working-class people and the needs of the poorer and more vulnerable people in the State for free public transport and for public transport that works and delivers for the most marginalised.  Nor does it understand the needs of the bus workers and their families who have now been without wages for three weeks.</p></speech>

I want to know if the Government has discussed the very long-running saga of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  The Harbours Act, brought forward by the Government, suggests that the harbour company will be transferred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  This has still not happened although most other harbour companies have been transferred to their local authorities.  This is because a harbour company quango and its very highly paid executives have frustrated the process by refusing to co-operate with the local authority in a due diligence examination of its financial situation.  A risk assessment arising out of the due diligence process has identified a whole series of very serious financial risks.  The company is refusing to give the information coming out of the risk assessment on those financial risks to the local authorities, to public representatives or to anybody on the grounds of commercial secrecy.  This saga has gone on and on and yet we have had crazy plans for cruise ship berths costing millions of euro.  We have a beautiful amenity which is just sitting there and rotting while the harbour company quango plays games with the local authority.  Will the Cabinet committee discuss this and will it ensure that the Harbours Act is acted upon so this quango is dissolved and we can have real accountability over this critical piece of infrastructure?</p></speech>

Talks at the Workplace Relations Commission collapsed yesterday.  Following that, the unions and management referred a number of issues to the Labour Court for non-binding arbitration.  The Labour Court heard the issues from yesterday and the talks have resumed this morning.  It is clear, however, from the emerging speculation around the possible outline deal that any agreement that might emerge could see significant job losses within Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It would seem that this would also seriously undermine Bus &Eacute;ireann's ability to provide an essential public transport service to communities and towns right across the State.  The Government's refusal to engage constructively in the dispute has contributed significantly to the duration and impact on the travelling public.  The financial crisis in Bus &Eacute;ireann has been exacerbated because of the refusal of the key stakeholders, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority and the Minister, Deputy Ross, to protect an essential public service.  Rural Ireland has been brought to a complete standstill.  Local businesses are being starved of customers because many people are unable to get to town centres and retail areas.  The Government's stance reflects the lack of priority given to rural Ireland.  What is the Taoiseach and his Government doing to bring this strike to an end?  What is he doing to ensure the financial crisis within Bus &Eacute;ireann is addressed?</p></speech>

While the transport portfolio has been held by various high-profile Ministers over the last six years, the Government's only strategy is to try to get through the latest crisis.  There is no sense that there is a policy on what level or quality of public transport services should be available or what the State subvention levels should be.  Each of the public transport companies is being defined by what it can do without going bankrupt, rather than working to implement an overall vision for access and quality.  If we had that policy framework in place, we may have never seen this Bus &Eacute;ireann strike.  The workers have gone through an awful lot of sacrifices and have lost a lot over the last four weeks.  Belatedly, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has said he will convene a forum and that the free travel scheme and the public service obligation will be applied differently.  It is past time for the Government and the Minister to produce a formal statement of Government objectives and resources with regard to public transport provision in Ireland.  The overriding feeling of people on the ground is that had this dispute been in Dublin, it would have been resolved a long time ago.  We need to be very careful that we are not going down the road of a low-wage public sector economy.  That would be detrimental overall to society and to the value of public sector interventions.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable that this company is so distant from Government, although the Government owns it 100%, that the Government cannot have a vision of what public transport in Ireland should look like and how Bus &Eacute;ireann will fit in to that vision.  Most people are aghast at the complete lack of involvement from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  He has emerged occasionally to say that he has no involvement in the dispute and cannot have any involvement.  The Taoiseach knows that in various disputes over time, Ministers have been involved in trying to assist matters especially when the actual viability of the company was at stake.</p><p>May I ask the Taoiseach about the attitude of the Government in terms of public transport?  Will there be a clear statement of what bus transport in Ireland should look like and how it should be constructed?  Are we just to presume that it is to be a matter for the market to determine?  Will the Government accept the view put forward by the Labour Party?  When we were in Government together, we agreed on having minimum standards of decency for workers and that there would be a negotiated fixed floor below which bus drivers could not fall so that public and private would be on a level playing field.</p></speech>

I disagree with her comments about him.  Ministers are well in tune with the many sections of society that make contact with them daily.  This case is before the Labour Court.  I hope that will result in an early solution which will bring about a return to work for the drivers and members of Bus &Eacute;ireann, and that members of the travelling public have the service restored to them as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  For Deputy Boyd Barrett's information, the committee does not deal with individual issues such as those he mentioned in respect of the harbour company in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is an issue that has been going on for quite some time.  I am not sure of the responsibility here in respect of the independence of these companies.  I will inquire for the Deputy as to whether the issue that is causing the problem can be resolved or expedited.  It is a magnificent facility and has been for so many years.  There is always room for potential for the future.  I know the Deputy is interested in that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the question of the Labour Court.  It is not for me to comment on the court's independent way of, we hope, bringing about a resolution.  Things are not at a standstill in rural Ireland.  I pass through large swathes of it every week.  The Government is expanding the public bus service in rural Ireland by increasing the amount of public service obligation money pumped in there and increasing funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann and to the rural transport programme as well.  Bus &Eacute;ireann got a 21% increase in its PSO funding in 2016.  Total funding for both PSO and rural transport will amount to approximately &euro;277 million this year, which is a substantial amount and a &euro;28 million increase on last year.  Will the Government subsidise the Expressway routes?  No.  They are commercial services operating in competition with other commercial services.  As with any other commercial operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann cannot receive taxpayer funding for those services.  Taxpayer support is available for public service obligation services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann receives taxpayer funding for those socially necessary but financially unviable services that form part of its legally contracted PSO network with the National Transport Authority.  I am sure Deputy Brady understands that.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Social Protection have instructed officials in respect of the free travel arrangements to which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred.  I hope that will take effect immediately.  There was mention of transport policy.  Obviously, there are competitive forces at work in the private sector providing transport to many locations throughout the country.  The National Transport Authority has a very robust, expanding rural transport scheme.  In respect of this particular problem which caused the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute, namely, the Expressway service, where Bus &Eacute;ireann is in competition with private enterprise on motorway routes, if its buses have to come off the motorway and go through towns and villages, it causes a delay for passengers who want to get from point A to point B.  The National Transport Authority has said that any changes brought about as a result of a settlement of this dispute can be taken up by the National Transport Authority in servicing areas that might not be serviced in future and by Bus &Eacute;ireann but that is a matter-----</p></speech>

We got positive news yesterday on the provision of Orkambi and Kalydeco for sufferers of cystic fibrosis, CF.  It comes during the national awareness week for cystic fibrosis.  I commend Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, all the families and their supporters for their persistence in campaigning for this issue over a considerable period.  However, the crisis around CF therapies is also evidence of the wider crisis in our health service.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Tom Keane, former director of the State's cancer control programme, said that if any other country had the kind of problems found in the Irish health service, the Government would not survive.  He described the health service as being close to total systems failure and called for the delivery of health care to change before there is what he described as a profoundly negative impact on people dependent on the public system.</p>  <p>  The Towards 2026 report argues for greater accountability, clarity on funding, better leadership and stronger political support.  The Government has failed dismally on all of these fronts.  This week, we learned that there are 82 unfilled posts across community mental health services that cater for children and adolescents with severe mental health disorders, including suicidal youngsters.  This is a damning indictment of the Government.  What measures will it take to address this matter urgently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200019#R02500"><p>I also pay tribute to Cystic Fibrosis Ireland on an extraordinary and very fair campaign by Philip Watt and his team.  I also pay particular tribute to Jillian McNulty, who very bravely led the campaign for Orkambi.  There are lessons to be learned.  I wonder if the Cabinet committee has considered the broader question of how we deal with orphan drugs.  That is the term given to drugs used for rare diseases.  In respect of conditions and diseases that are particular to the Irish DNA and are more prevalent here than in other areas, there is a need for a more effective approach from the Government to the approval of drugs.</p>  <p>  In the earlier phase of this campaign, there was no engagement going on if the truth be told.  That is what worried me more than anything.  There was then an attempt to undermine the quality of Orkambi as a drug.</p><p>I raised the matter with the Taoiseach several times on Leaders' Questions.  Despite all the leaks to the various newspapers, it took six weeks to two months to get acknowledgement that Orkambi is a valid game-changer in terms of its impact on people with cystic fibrosis of a particular mutation.  That has concerned me somewhat and it speaks to a lack of an overall policy.</p> <p> I am unsure whether Fine Gael has a policy on health anymore.  Compulsory health insurance was dropped.  The damage of the Reilly and Varadkar years has been left in place.  One of the core issues that emerged from that period was the degree to which there was direct interference with transparent and honest service planning within the HSE.  Repeatedly, Ministers have required the HSE to promise a level of service for which the required funding has not been provided.  Will the Taoiseach provide an assurance that no member of Government has interfered with the wording of this year's service plan to cover up a mismatch between promises and funding?  Can the Taoiseach explain why we have had repeated failure to implement funding for mental health services?  The Government's existence rests on having promised this funding.  The Government has not delivered in terms of mental health funding as promised this year.</p></speech>

I hope it will be a pathfinder for similar issues as they arise, especially for discrete groups of people who suffer terribly despite the fact that breakthrough medicines are available.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach address the status of a Government commitment, that is, free GP care for those under 12 years?  I am sure this matter was discussed at the Cabinet sub-committee.  The Taoiseach will remember that this was announced in October 2015 for budget 2016.  It was announced 18 months ago when we were in government together.  A total of &euro;10 million was allocated in last year's budget to provide GP visits for children aged between six and 12 years.  Where is this provision?  When will we see it fully rolled out?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200020#S00400"><p>Before the Christmas recess, I brought to the attention of the Taoiseach the very distressing case of a young child aged nine years who has scoliosis.  Not only does she have scoliosis, she also has severe intellectual disabilities.  I received some letters from the Taoiseach's office and from the Minister for Health, who spoke to me personally.  He reassured me that, at the outside, by now the child would have received the urgently-needed operation.  As the Taoiseach can imagine, the child's mother is in touch with the hospital all the time but she and her daughter have simply been told to wait and wait.  The operation now seems to have been put back well back into the next couple of months.  We were sure it would have been performed by now.  I have not raised the matter with the Taoiseach again since then.</p>  <p>  I cannot understand a system that keeps a child of nine years with a well-diagnosed condition and exceptional other difficulties and issues waiting. Notwithstanding all the funding that was provided to renew the operating theatre at the hospital in Crumlin during our period in government &ndash; a matter on which we all strongly agreed and which we supported &ndash; it seems that the hospital is now down to performing one operation per week.  That is unbelievable.  Will the Taoiseach give us an update on what is happening?  Children are in pain and their families are experiencing some level of desperation.</p></speech>

We have discussed previously the opening of a theatre which was paid for by the taxpayer for some years but which has not been opened.  On the previous occasion on which this was raised, my understanding was that the appropriate and qualified personnel would be there to commence performing operations.  Let us find out.  I will come back to Deputy Burton on that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised the question of health policy.  It has always been accepted that Orkambi is a game-changer in the sense of improving the quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis.  The problem lay with the price being demanded by the company involved.  This is one of the most expensive drugs ever in the history of the State.  The pharmacoeconomics group met the company.  As Deputies are aware, a change has taken place whereby the group makes a recommendation on whether a given cost is valid.  The Minister proceeded to make contact with other Ministers in other countries where similar problems have arisen.  In any event, I am pleased the matter has been resolved.  It was never a case of not recognising that Orkambi is a valid drug for improving the quality of life for patients.  Cost was the issue.  The earlier exchange was on looking at the process.  This is not confined to Ireland.  If this is the first case in Europe of having a portfolio of drugs that provide certainty and stability for patients, then that is probably the way to go.  It may well reduce the cost over a five or ten-year period.  While Orkambi and Kalydeco will cost a substantial amount of money over ten years, they give that certainty and emotional support for patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.</p>  <p>  I agree with the various speakers that cystic fibrosis patients have an exceptional commitment to dealing with their particular challenges.  I am pleased that in recent years we have had public expenditure in cystic fibrosis units at various locations throughout the country.  The improvement in the air quality in these centres - the air is changed so many times every hour - adds greatly to their comfort and ability to go to the next day and so on.  In that sense I am pleased this matter has been resolved.  I hope the Minister for Health will now be able to move on to other drugs companies and discuss portfolios of drugs for particular categories of patients who need them.</p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin spoke to me before about the mental health situation.  I know he is concerned about it.  I will give the Deputy an update from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on where we stand, what money is being spent and on what it is being spent in order that we can see whether we can progress that matter.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brady referred to Professor Keane.  Obviously, he did his job with the cancer centres of excellence.  That was a difficult issue for many hospitals.  I disagree with Deputy Brady's suggestion that there is anything like a total systems failure.  The vast majority of people who have gone through the public health system have nothing but credit and praise to offer in respect of those who work in the system.  In many cases, staff are working under pressure.  A total of &euro;14.6 billion has been allocated for 2017 - up &euro;1 billion on last year.  We can see how issues can intervene in that in the light of the Orkambi and Kalydeco question.</p></speech>

That is why we have had pressure in emergency departments.  In the context of Wexford General Hospital, for example, the layout of the new emergency department has greatly eased the pressure that used to apply there.  That is what we need at many other locations as well and that is part of the plan for the capital expenditure programme.  The Minister has visited various hospitals throughout the country.  There are particular pressures in some.  The filling of posts is another issue.

The framework is available on the website of the office for emergency planning in the Department of Defence and is currently being updated.</p>  <p>  When a co-ordinated national level emergency response is required, the lead Department will request the office of emergency planning to convene a meeting of the national emergency co-ordination group.  The national emergency co-ordination centre is activated and staff from the office of emergency planning provide support to the lead Department in chairing the national emergency co-ordination group. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have a lead Department responsibility.  However, if the nature of the emergency warranted a special Government meeting, my Department, with my agreement and at the request of the lead Department and the national emergency co-ordination group, would call such a meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, officials of my Department attend national emergency co-ordination committee meetings in support of the lead Department and I am briefed as required as the emergency progresses.  Also, a representative of the Government information service attends such meetings and provides support as required for the provision of information to the media.</p>  <p>  As the question relates to emergencies, I am sure the House will wish to join me in expressing our appreciation of the work and commitment of Ireland's emergency services.  This was shown most recently in the loss of Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116 and I wish to express my sincere sympathy to the families of Dara Fitzpatrick and Mark Duffy, and also to the families of Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith, who are still missing.  I also thank all the members of the emergency services and indeed all those who have been taking part in the search for Paul and Ciar&aacute;n and those who have been supporting them.  The local community in general and the people of Blacksod have shown absolutely phenomenal support during these difficult days.  Last weekend, there was an extraordinary turnout from all over the country, not just the local region, with every kind of facility searching the thousand square miles in the hope that one or both of the bodies could be recovered.  We hope and pray that they will be found soon.</p></reply>

There has been extraordinary public support and anguish empathising with the bereaved.  These are people who have selflessly given their lives in this instance to support communities.  I am reminded of that every time I cross Wexford Bridge to go home and see the flag at the RNLI station permanently at half-mast until those bodies are recovered.</p>  <p>  With regard to emergency planning, in the past we talked about what might constitute an emergency, such as a nuclear explosion at a British nuclear plant and how that would impact on us.  I do not want to get the Taoiseach into trouble, as I know a former Minister of State got into a lot of bother answering a question like this about iodine pills many years ago.  I believe we need to think beyond just those sorts of incidents.  Please God there will not be an explosion or mishap in a nuclear institution in Britain, but we have to plan for that.</p>  <p>  A much more likely attack is a possible terrorist attack.  We would be foolish to think that we are immune from that in this jurisdiction.  I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors some people in this country and so on.  We need to up our game in this area.  I believe it is a good thing that part of the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will look at whether we need a bespoke security agency bringing together the best of military intelligence with Garda intelligence.</p>  <p>  The cybersecurity area is where we are probably most prone to attack.  It could cripple us.  Over the years, all of our Departments have been subject to cyber attacks, some of which did not go into the public domain.  It could have been absolutely crippling if, for example, the Department of Social Protection was shut down by a cyber attack.  It would be hugely disabling for us.  With regard to preparing for eventualities now in a completely changed environment in which even a football team on the way to a football match is not immune to attack, does the Taoiseach think we need to up our own game?  I ask for his own thoughts on the need now perhaps to have a bespoke security agency separate from normal policing, which would in a way free An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be the community police force it was initially envisaged to be, and on the need to up our game to prepare ourselves for the real challenges that exist.</p></speech>

The way these are structured depends on the emergency.  If it is infectious animal diseases, feedstuff contamination or food safety, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would obviously take the lead.  Tsunami warnings, communication services, ICT, cyber attacks or energy are led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Nuclear accidents will move under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as well.  Hazardous materials, radioactive contamination, environmental pollution, severe weather flooding response, coastal erosion, water supplies, fire, landslide response, building collapse, accidental explosions-----</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point, for instance, in respect of cyber attacks.  We now have such an enormous investment in digitisation in so many companies throughout the country.  This is an issue that needs to be looked at.  By coincidence, I have called a security meeting for tomorrow, arising from the incident in Sweden and the incident involving the football team, Borussia Dortmund.  These are things that we cannot be distant from.  We are a non-aligned, non-aggressive country, and though the threat is always present, it is not at a high level in Ireland and we try to keep it that way.</p></speech>

Other areas like aviation security and terrorist activities are issues that are led by the lead Department, but as Deputy Howlin will know, Government will respond immediately in the unlikely event, we hope, of any of these things happening.  I take the Deputy's central point that perhaps the Oireachtas should have the opportunity to reflect on these things.  In respect of the central issue, once the commission is set up by the T&aacute;naiste for a detailed analysis of the future of both policing and security, it is something on which we should reflect and for which we should make arrangements.</p></speech>

Is it appropriate that we would have our own prime ministerial command centre to deal with any emergency that might arise and to bring in the particular expertise we need?  Bluntly, it is not my experience that one would go through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  There are experts in every Department, right down to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, although I do not know what issue would affect it - maybe the collapse of a national monument.  We certainly do not have that skill set available in every single Department and it seems unnecessary to have it available.  What is needed for a country of our size is one set of crisis managers who can take command under the auspices of the Taoiseach and regardless of whether it is an agricultural issue, a food issue or a nuclear issue, bring in whatever expertise is needed to assist in the management of that.  Is there a view that a COBRA-style office might at least be discussed?</p></speech>

In particular, as Deputy Howlin said, we remember the crew of Rescue 116, Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciaran Smith and their heroic contribution to life saving in this country.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that our current national arrangements for emergency management have effectively been left unchanged since they were first introduced by Deputy O'Dea a decade ago.  Even though the scale and nature of potential emergencies has evolved dramatically since then, all structures are the same and there is no legislation concerning co-ordination of a State response to a major emergency.  Ireland is one of the only countries in the world without any form of statute legislation concerning the structure for responding to national emergencies, such as widespread flooding or a public health disaster.  It is the consistent model internationally that the prime minister's office takes the lead responsibility.  I believe it is time for us to review our structures and implement appropriate legislation.</p>  <p>  I met recently with the professional representatives of our Defence Forces, the Army in particular.  It was shocking to listen to some of the revelations.  For example, in Kilworth Camp, so low is the strength, the requisite number of corporals are not available to facilitate live fire tactical training, so they cannot do the training.  The Air Corps is essentially a nine-to-five operation and is not in a position to do 24-7 operations.  I understand there were fundamental changes in the bomb disposal unit and the exit of very experienced bomb disposal personnel.  I agree with Deputy Howlin in regard to our state of readiness in the context of a terrorist attack.  We are far too complacent, as a country, in regard to that threat and we should do far more to prepare our responses.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have been in decline and numbers are below strength.  Is it not time to have a proper review of structures to ensure we have the capacity to respond to these potential emergencies?</p></speech>

The Office of Emergency Planning, which is in the Department of Defence, co-ordinates the response to an emergency and it promotes best practice in emergency planning.  The Government task force on emergency planning is comprised of representatives of all Departments and relevant agencies and it meets regularly to discuss emergency planning and management.  The framework for major emergency management lists various types of emergencies, some of which I read out to Deputy Howlin.</p>  <p>  The Office of Emergency Planning has prepared a draft document entitled, Strategic Emergency Management - National Structures and Framework.  That is due to come to Government very shortly and we will publish it before the summer so people can reflect on the very issue that Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Howlin rightly raise.  When an emergency occurs that requires a national level response, the current guidelines for co-ordinating a national level emergency crisis response, which are publicly available on the Office of Emergency Planning website, set out the steps that are taken to manage it.  In a national emergency, the lead Department convenes the national emergency co-ordination committee.  The paper that is to be presented will provide a forum to discuss these central questions.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware of the vigilance of the Garda and the intelligence units in monitoring a small number of individuals who do not have this country's interests at heart.  That is a very precise and confidential matter.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin raised the question of the Air Corps.  There are cadets in training and a cadet recruitment campaign is underway.  Four personnel will complete air traffic control training between May and September this year and the Air Corps is currently inducting a further air traffic control course.  NCO vacancies in the Air Corps will be filled from the recently-launched NCO promotion competition.  Deputy Martin is aware that when somebody qualifies through the Air Corps, they are on contract for 12 years before they have the opportunity to leave, so it is not a question of training people and they then leave for private enterprise as soon as they are trained.  There is a period of contract which they give back to the State in respect of the training they receive.</p>  <p>  I would be happy to associate with the party leaders in regard to the central question raised by Deputy Howlin.</p></speech>

Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.  All provisions of the Agreement must be respected, including the fundamental provisions on citizenship and identity.</p>  <p>  Under Irish citizenship law, the vast majority of people born on the island of Ireland, including those born in Northern Ireland, are entitled to Irish citizenship.  The Good Friday Agreement further provides that the people of Northern Ireland have the right to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, and that the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship would not in any way be affected by any future change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  It is important to state this provision is and will remain unaffected by the UK decision to leave the European Union.  Persons who are citizens of Ireland, and therefore also EU citizens, will retain their right to EU citizenship after Brexit and the entitlements that flow from this under EU law.</p>  <p>  In the forthcoming EU-UK negotiations, the Government will work to ensure that the continuing EU citizenship of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland can be sustained in a way that is consistent with their unique situation.  In this regard, we should be clear that the UK Government also has a major role and responsibility in upholding the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, regardless of the United Kingdom's status within the European Union.  The Government has made this point to the UK Government on a number of occasions and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland's interests can be effectively represented as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations that are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on the formation of the Executive as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations, which are of major significance.</p></speech>

We would or should all agree that anyone born in Dungannon, Belfast or Newry is as Irish as anyone born in Swords, Malahide or Skerries and that their rights need to be protected.  On foot of that, their right to EU citizenship needs to be protected.  I welcome the Minister's response but I have a concern over the manner in which the British Government has approached this subject.  Warm words and reassurances from the London Government really are not enough and certainly do not give solace to most people in the North considering the manner in which they have been treated so far.  Will the Minister enlighten me further, following his discussions with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, on whether the British have confirmed absolutely that the rights of Irish citizens will be extended to include the right to EU citizenship after Brexit and that anyone born in Northern Ireland after whatever agreement comes into place between Britain and the European Union will have a right to EU citizenship by extension?  Under the Good Friday Agreement, they have a right to Irish citizenship.</p></speech>

In the case of Northern Ireland, this is further underpinned by the right to identify and be accepted as Irish or British, or both.  This is one of the major pillars or priorities for the UK withdrawal.  When we list our priorities and speak about the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, we noted that a pillar of that uniqueness is the fact that all citizens living in Northern Ireland are entitled to Irish citizenship and, therefore, EU citizenship.</p></speech>

We want respect for the Good Friday Agreement to form part of the Brexit agreement.  The British Government will have to buy into this, as will the European Union.  I seek that after 2020, for argument's sake, people born in Belfast or elsewhere in the North who rightly claim the right to Irish citizenship will be conferred automatically with EU rights and EU citizenship.  Is it the case that that specific arrangement will require the agreement of the European Union and Britain as part of the Brexit discussions and whatever agreement emerges from the negotiations over the next two years?  Will the Minister now confirm completely that this will be the case and that the citizenship rights underwritten by the Good Friday Agreement will be protected by the co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Irish Government?</p></speech>

We have been engaging extensively with all EU member states and institutions on this priority.  There is a very good understanding among our EU partners of the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and, indeed, the peace process to the people of the island of Ireland.  This is reflected in the inclusion of a specific reference to Ireland's priorities in the European Council draft negotiating guidelines and the Brexit resolution adopted by the European Parliament recently.  The extensive and diplomatic engagement of recent months has been effective in this regard.  This, of course, will continue.  I would be very happy to keep the Deputy fully briefed and the House fully informed.  The circumstances on the island of Ireland are most definitely unique and will need to be factored into the final negotiation detail.</p></speech>

On Saturday, an international verification commission received information from Basque civil society representatives on eight weapons dumps that contained all ETA's remaining weapons.  This comes six years after ETA declared an end to its armed struggle.  There are still considerable and unresolved issues.  To find a resolution to outstanding issues, the Spanish and French Governments need to enter formal dialogue that will lead to negotiation.  Given Ireland's own successful approach, will the Minister formally raise this issue with the Spanish and French Governments?</p></reply>

The Government welcomed the declaration by ETA of October 2011 that the organisation had decided on "a definitive cession of its armed activity".  I issued a statement last Saturday welcoming the decision of ETA to decommission its weapons.</p><p>I stated that this was a significant and welcome step towards the disbandment of a terrorist organisation that has inflicted great suffering on the people in two fellow EU member states, France and Spain.</p> <p> I repeat here that democracy and dialogue are the only legitimate means of resolving conflict.  We must also never forget the victims of terrorism; those who have died and those for whom pain and suffering still endure.</p> <p> We will, of course, continue to support peace and stability but further steps which might be taken are not primarily matters for the Irish Government.  I assure the House that we will keep a close eye on the situation in the Basque region and in France and Spain, as well as on the consequences in respect of that peace process.</p></speech>

The Archbishop of Bologna, Monsignor Matteo Zuppi, and the Rev. Harold Good from the North of Ireland witnessed ETA's decommissioning.  Will the Minister join me in commending them on their work and all the work of those volunteers who facilitated this process?</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, up until now the Spanish Government has dramatically refused to recognise the international verification commission and has stated its opposition to any involvement by third-party mediators.  In a bizarre twist, instead of working towards a peace process, the Spanish Government went out of its way to place obstacles in front of ETA giving up its weapons.  In December, five members of Basque civil society, who were aiding the peace process and dealing with the issue of decommissioning, were arrested by French police after a request from the Spanish Government.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated he welcomed this significant peace initiative.  Does the Government see any leadership role in this peace building for the Spanish and French Governments in order to build a fair, comprehensive and irreversible peace in the Basque country and will the Minister join me in calling for an end to the repressive policy and punishment and dispersal of more than 300 Basque prisoners in jails hundreds of kilometres away from the homes?</p></speech>

While I agree with the Deputy that there are circumstances in which the experience of our own peace process on the island of Ireland can provide insight and perspective, obviously the Deputy will agree with me that each conflict situation has its own specific characteristics and its own requirements.  There is no universal or easily transferable formula to be drawn down.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy.  Indeed, I note the statements over the weekend of my counterpart, the French Foreign Minister, as well as statements of the Spanish Government.  We will, of course, continue to offer support for peace and stability but any particular further steps which might be taken are not matters primarily for the Irish Government.</p></speech>

Does the Minister see a leadership or important interventionist role for the Irish Government in this matter?  Will the Irish Government appeal to the Spanish and French Governments to demonstrate a more positive approach in their response to these developments, and as I said, for the Spanish Government to adopt a different approach to those Basque politically motivated prisoners?  I again ask whether the Minister sees a positive intervention role for Ireland.  Many Irish politicians have tried to lend their weight to bringing about a process and up until now, the Spanish Government has been reluctant to get involved in this initiative.  On the back of the positive developments at the weekend, is there not something more the Government could be doing?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is urging the Irish Government to take an interventionist role in this, that certainly would not be the intention of the Irish Government.  We will continue to support the peace process.  We will continue to encourage all and any efforts aimed at securing peace and stability in the region but it is certainly not for us to pronounce on what a fellow EU government should or should not do in these circumstances.  However, I acknowledge the work of those individuals who have been referenced by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Some of these fora were developed in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and some of them were established more recently or have evolved and developed over the years to reflect the close relationship between these islands.  They all will be used to the full, not least given the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.</p><p>These channels include the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and a formal process established in 2012 involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a joint work programme managed at official level by the heads of all Departments in both Dublin and London.</p><p>At political level, there are ongoing and frequent contacts across all policy areas.  In addition to regular meetings the Taoiseach and I would have with our counterparts, Government colleagues meeting their UK counterparts recently have included the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>In terms of our diplomatic resources, our embassy in London is and will remain our largest bilateral embassy in the world.  In fact, given the UK exit from the European Union and with a view towards helping to strengthen bilateral links in a post-Brexit context, two additional diplomatic officers have been assigned to the embassy in London.  We also have a consulate general in Edinburgh, for which I approved an additional diplomat in 2015, while the footprint of our trade, tourism and investment agencies in Britain is and will continue to be significant.</p><p>Regarding formal structures, the next summit of the British-Irish Council, BIC, is scheduled to take place in Northern Ireland in June of this year, with the previous meeting having taken place in Cardiff in November last.  BIC meetings such as these provide Ireland with valuable opportunities to engage with devolved Administrations in the UK, while there are 12 specific work sectors being addressed at ministerial and official level all year round.  The summit meetings since the UK referendum have also included specific sessions on Brexit, in doing so, reflecting a capacity for flexibility in issues being discussed at them.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In terms of individual devolved Administrations, I point to the fact that the Irish Government has taken particular care to maintain close contacts with the Scottish and Welsh Governments, with the First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, visiting Dublin in November 2016 and the Taoiseach meeting the Welsh First Minister, Mr. Carwyn Jones, in Cardiff last month.</p><p>The formal structures also include the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which comes within the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and whose function is to bring together the British and Irish Governments to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.</p><p>The conference has traditionally focused on issues of mutual concern relating to Northern Ireland where its remit is non-devolved matters, that is, those which are reserved to the British Government and Westminster rather than the Northern Ireland Executive and assembly.  As the scope of non-devolved matters in Northern Ireland has become quite narrow over recent years, there has been no business need for the conference to meet at political level.  However, its secretariat &ndash; made up of Irish and British civil servants - continues to be an important day-to-day channel of contact between both Governments and the Irish officials assigned to the secretariat constitute the Irish Government presence in Belfast.</p><p>Parliamentary links are also vitally important and will be more crucial than ever once the UK departs from the EU.  I myself will be delivering an address at the next plenary meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, to be held in Kilkenny in May 2017.  This Assembly and its committees meet regularly to examine areas of shared importance across the member jurisdictions - Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and what are known as the Crown dependencies - and this includes Brexit.  I am also heartened by the regular interaction between other parliamentary committees, which is to be welcomed and encouraged as the withdrawal process continues.</p><p>Overall, as Deputies can see from what I have set out, there are extensive arrangements for dialogue with Britain - including ones which offer flexibility in terms of management and policy focus.  We will, of course, keep matters under review, including as the details of the UK's new relationship with the EU emerge in the period ahead.</p></speech>

That is why I and my party fundamentally believe that a new Irish-British agreement dealing with matters other than the peace settlement will be required.  I do not believe that the mechanisms under the Good Friday Agreement are sufficient.  It is clear that with Brexit, it is not business as usual and we cannot go on with this idea that it is.  A new British-Irish agreement would be a way of strengthening the links between our countries, in particular, consolidating the links North and South.</p>  <p>  From the Minister's answer, the sum total of our response appears to have been the appointment of two additional diplomats in London.  That is simply not sufficient.</p><p>It shows a lack of vision and a lack of desire to prioritise the relationship between the two countries and consolidate the Good Friday Agreement.  We need more than this.  We need more than a British-Irish Council and a British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We need a desire on the part of this Government to stand up for its citizens.</p></speech>

I again make it quite clear that the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union and the negotiations that are about to commence must take full account of and show the fullest of respect to all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  On the basis of our intensive political and diplomatic engagement over the past year, we have received very heartening support from our EU partners in this regard and are now about to pursue these through the formal negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  We have not been in negotiations with the United Kingdom; we have had discussions.  Now we will be in a position to engage through the European Union in the context of the formal negotiations.  We will not sell the Good Friday Agreement short.  We will not engage in any renegotiation of the Good Friday Agreement in response to the British policy of Brexit.  The legal and political obligations of both the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain unchanged, and this will continue-----</p></speech>

The mechanisms in place under the Good Friday Agreement have not been utilised over the past five, six or seven years to their full potential and we need to consider adding to them.  The most recent summit of the British-Irish Council was held in Cardiff in November 2016.  The next one will take place in the North of Ireland in June 2017.  It is too loose.  We need to consider strengthening these ties post-Brexit but plan for it now.  This is not part of the Brexit negotiations.  It is a matter of seeking to underpin the Good Friday Agreement and moving on further from it in consideration of what is a potential reality of a future reunification of this country and this island.  We cannot just stand still.  This Government and the previous one have approached the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in a very lackadaisical, <i>laissez-faire</i>way.  Has Government given any consideration to the establishment of new formal structures for dialogue between Ireland and Britain, and the North and the South?</p></speech>

His situation was not good then: he was holding up but clearly desperate.  Three months have since passed, another three court adjournments have taken place and, reportedly, his health has taken a significant turn for the worse.  He is reportedly in a wheelchair, has been without consciousness and is possibly suffering from a very serious skin disease being spread in the prison hospital.  What actions is the Irish Government taking to ensure that his health is being taken care of and that he is released as soon as possible?</p></reply>

I have spoken with the Egyptian ambassador and have conveyed through her my deepest condolences and those of the Irish Government to the victims and their families.</p>  <p>  The consular case referred to by the Deputy continues to be an absolute priority for the Government, and very substantial resources and time are being devoted to it.  The case has seen more high level political engagement, more investment of person-hours, more consultation with third parties worldwide and more consular visits and court hearing observation missions undertaken than in any other case to which the Irish Government has ever responded.  This is in light of the unique circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the citizen concerned was a minor at the time of his arrest.</p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly and consistently called on the Egyptian authorities to allow this citizen to return to his family and his home in Ireland.  We have supported legal petitions for this man to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140, we have appealed for him to be considered for release under the Egyptian President's so-called youth amnesty scheme and we have stressed in all contacts the humanitarian dimensions of the case as grounds under which we believe he should be released.  The Taoiseach, as the House is aware, has in recent days renewed the Government's appeal to the Egyptian President to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay, stressing in particular the humanitarian dimensions of the case.  This is the Government's objective, and we are working day-in, day-out to seek that outcome.</p>  <p>  I repeated this position when I met my Egyptian counterpart, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shoukry, again last month.  In recent days, I have also spoken at length with the EU High Representative, Ms Mogherini, about the case and availed of the opportunity of my meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, who is also a former Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, to enlist his assistance in trying to persuade the Egyptian authorities to release our citizen.</p>  <p>  The court case in which this person is accused is now moving forward, and recent hearings have been more substantive with shorter periods between court sittings.  At the most recent hearing, on 5 April, 11 more witnesses were called and cross-examined and gave evidence.  This is important because the Egyptian authorities have consistently said that President el-Sisi and his Government cannot intervene in a case that is before the courts and that the President will only intervene when the trial has ended.</p>  <p>  It is also noteworthy that at that most recent hearing the lawyers representing our Irish citizen made a request for his release on health grounds and the presiding judge undertook to examine the matter.  The same judge has previously ordered on a number of occasions that there should be medical evaluations of this man's health.  The next hearing of the case is scheduled to take place on 26 April.  Officials from the Irish Embassy will again be in court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing of the case to date.</p>  <p>  For my part, I will continue to work urgently at political level to maintain pressure on the Egyptian Government to release our citizen and allow him to return to his home and his family at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

The latest technical file produced for the Egyptian court would seem to confirm the fact that there is no evidence against him of anything other than protesting.  The problem is that nothing that has been done so far, including the parliamentary delegation of which I was a part, has worked in releasing our citizen home.  What more does the Government intend to do?  Was the European External Action Service in attendance at the most recent court case?  If not, why not?  Are there countries that continue to block the attendance of the EEAS, and is the Government making particular efforts to discuss with those Governments the withdrawal of any such block?</p>  <p>  The other issue is that it is all very well for el-Sisi to tell us that he will not release Mr. Halawa until the court case is over, but the court case can go on indefinitely and each court appearance that passes seems to have a bad impact on Ibrahim's spirit, understandably, because the case just seems to stretch indefinitely into the future.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of my EU colleagues on this issue and, as I said in my initial reply, on the previous occasion, which was last week, I spoke directly to EU High Representative Mogherini on the matter.</p>  <p>  This case continues to receive the attention of the Government at the highest level, having regard to the fact that the Taoiseach has again been in direct contact with President el-Sisi of Egypt about the case, as indeed he has on numerous occasions.  He met the Egyptian President face to face twice to discuss the case and he has spoken to him by telephone on a number of occasions.  He has also has communicated with him in writing on several occasions.  In all of those contacts, the Taoiseach has underlined our concerns about the continuing detention of this young man who has been in prison for three and a half years without having been convicted of any offence and who is part of a group trial that has been adjourned on many occasions.  Our key focus continues to be acting in the best interests of the citizen.  We are working to have him released by the Egyptian authorities and we look forward to that happening.</p></speech>

That is first and foremost what the question is about.  I appreciate the fact that a doctor was sent to examine him but then we have to use the evidence of the visit to put extra pressure on the Egyptian authorities and, if possible, to use the evidence in the court case to say that he should be released.  We must demand that there is EEAS presence at the next court case and we must also demand, loudly, that he is released.  There is no chance of Ibrahim getting a fair trial with 493 other defendants and so the only avenue is to exert every possible political pressure on the Egyptian authorities, which means leveraging EU authority and weight, because it is clear that Irish weight on its own is not sufficient.  Is the Minister willing to meet again with the Halawa family to discuss other possible options to increase the pressure on the Egyptian authorities?</p></speech>

I am, however, very concerned at persistent reports that the citizen in question is not taking food and may be pursuing a hunger strike.  I stress that such a course of action should not be pursued as it will only be damaging to his well-being, health and cause.  He should look after his health by eating properly and co-operating with medical tests and investigations that are from time to time arranged on his behalf.  Reports about his health are a matter of the utmost concern for both my Government colleagues and me.  In the light of those concerns we took the unprecedented step last month of making arrangements for an Irish doctor to be nominated by the chief medical officer to visit him in prison to make an assessment of his health and the matter is the subject of ongoing attention.</p></speech>

A Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as outlined by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  The motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to those bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter with Prime Minister May, including at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, emphasising the Government's continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  In our discussions, I have advised him that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the atrocities that occurred in Dublin and Monaghan.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and the House.  I emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.  The Secretary of State acknowledged the importance the Government and the D&aacute;il attach to these cases and indicated that the British Government is open to considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.  The Government is actively pursuing this matter with the British Government, urging it to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.</p></reply>

In December, the Taoiseach assured us that he would pursue all possible avenues.  As the Minister indicated, the three motions were conveyed to the British Government but nothing has been progressed in terms of the Irish request for an independent, international review of all the relevant documentation.  The Barron report went a certain distance, as did the McEntee report, despite the absence of all the documentation.  The reasons for the latter are, first, that the British Government did not co-operate in handing over documents - it is still not co-operating - and, second, no Irish Government has pursued this matter with the full vigour required.  How close is the Minister to finding a formula that would allow the undisclosed documents to be made available to an international judge or similar person?</p></speech>

It is a matter of regret to me that we have not made greater progress on this long-outstanding issue.  I assure the Deputy that officials of the respective Governments are exploring possible ways forward that would be mutually acceptable.  Exploratory discussions are under way and we will continue to actively engage with the British Government in order to seek a satisfactory response.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of appalling cases from the Troubles in respect of which truth and justice have been secured only after decade-long campaigns by victims, families, survivors, civil society and Government.  The Dublin-Monaghan campaign is now one of the longest such campaigns and that must make us all the more determined to continue to pursue the full truth, however long it takes.  I assure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the House that we are fully committed to doing that, as reflected in the programme for Government and our consistent action and engagement on the issue.</p></speech>

My question is what about its obligations to the truth and justice for the victims and their families.  Advising and being concerned have not brought the Justice for the Forgotten group any closer to justice.  If the British Parliament had passed three motions calling on the Irish Government to release certain documents, I do not know whether the British Parliament would be waiting 43 years for their release.  I ask that between now and 17 May the necessary vigour that is required for an international judge to be appointed be applied or even for the process to begin to suggest names that might be acceptable to both Governments and Justice for the Forgotten.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the group, Justice for the Forgotten, because they would have been forgotten but for their persistent efforts.</p></speech>

I have had an opportunity to meet with representatives of that group on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage in discussions in Belfast with the Secretary of State and the political parties to ensure that we can achieve progress, not only on this case but also in regard to a number of other cases.  We need to achieve progress on them in order that the new institutions can be established in Northern Ireland in such a way as to meet the needs of victims and survivors.  They can also support the broader societal need for healing and reconciliation.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the anniversary on 17 May and I assure her that I will raise the issue once again with the Secretary of State in advance of the forthcoming anniversary.  I will have an opportunity to report to the House, including Deputy O'Sullivan, on the progress on this issue, which I accept is long overdue.  </p></speech>

Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall integrity of the settlement are not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  All provisions of the agreement must be respected, including those relating to human rights.</p>  <p>  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, including through the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, is separate and distinct to the European Union.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the ECHR.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I welcome the clarification in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on withdrawal from the EU where it states specifically that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In the context of British Government proposals, not connected with Brexit, to repeal the UK Human Rights Act and to introduce a domestic bill of rights, the Government has consistently emphasised to the British Government the importance of fully meeting its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I would note that while a domestic bill of rights can complement incorporation of the convention, it does not replace it.  The British Government has indicated that it is not currently pursuing a repeal of its Human Rights Act.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  On 13 February, I convened a sectoral dialogue on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the agreement.  This was a valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, including the importance of upholding the Good Friday Agreement chapter on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as an integral part of the agreement as a whole; the value of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement, in mitigating some of the potential impacts of Brexit for Northern Ireland; and the value of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement.  This would also support the provision in the agreement on equivalence of rights on the island.  Each of these themes demonstrates that human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 14 February, I held a bilateral meeting in Dublin with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  I reminded him of the unique circumstances that pertain to Northern Ireland, given the political and constitutional settlement of the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I noted to the Secretary of State the range of issues raised in the aforementioned sectoral dialogue on the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I emphasised to the Secretary of State the duty on both Governments to ensure the integrity of the agreement in this and all other aspects, whatever the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union might be.</p>  <p>  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be fully protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

I am glad he referred to paragraph 10 of the Good Friday Agreement's section on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity.  The specific provision provides for a joint committee of representatives of the two human rights commissions, North and South, as a forum for consideration of human rights issues on the island of Ireland.  The joint committee will consider, among other matters, the possibility of establishing a charter open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of fundamental rights for everyone living on the island.</p>  <p>  That was a positive measure in the Good Friday Agreement and we can now see how important it was to have it there.  What consideration is being given at present to putting in place such a structure to ensure that we will have this safeguard measure on an all-island basis?</p></speech>

That said, the charter provides an important and effective common reference on rights across the island of Ireland, as it does across the EU as a whole.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer again to the White Paper on legislating for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  The British Government expressly indicated that the provisions of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Northern Ireland will not be applied as part of British law after the UK leaves the EU.  This may require that a consideration may be given to alternative means of ensuring the coherence of rights frameworks across the island of Ireland.  This was a key theme of the sectoral dialogue in Maynooth and I am pleased that the Deputy's party was represented at that conference.  The value of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland, as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement, would also support the provision in the agreement on the matter of equivalence of rights across the island. </p>  <p>  My priority at all times is to ensure that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are respected, not only here but also in the context of the UK-EU negotiations.  It is an issue that forms part of the current talks in Northern Ireland that will hopefully result in a successful restoration of the power-sharing Executive and its institutions.  We will continue to be proactive in working to mitigate all aspects of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU across the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

I presume that a bill of rights would be essential if we were to have the all-Ireland charter that is necessary post Brexit.  Is the Minister concerned that in the new arrangements and architecture that will arise, there will be an interregnum whereby these safeguarding and human rights measures will not be in place?  We must ensure there is no such interregnum or lacuna.</p><p>Obviously, a difficult situation would emerge if the new structures were not in place at the time Brexit actually happens.</p></speech>

I assure him, and the House, that human rights provisions comprise a very important pillar of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is essential, therefore, that human rights protections and frameworks in the Good Friday Agreement are not, in any way, adversely impacted upon or disturbed by any changes that might take place due to the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  In that regard I need to stress that the UK has confirmed that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, which is at the core of the human rights pillar of the Good Friday Agreement.  Essentially, while the legal obligations provided for under the Agreement in respect of human rights remain unchanged, the UK's departure from the Union changes the context in which those obligations operate.  There will need to be an element of work undertaken to ensure that nothing adversely affects the human rights guarantees in the Good Friday Agreement and that the confidence and trust of all sides of the community in Northern Ireland is not in any way adversely impacted upon.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to raise this issue.  I have raised it across a number of ministerial meetings that I had with both the current Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, and his predecessors and on occasion with other ministers.  My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, has also raised this issue.  As far as I am concerned it is absolutely essential that the human rights protections as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement be fully honoured, maintained and sustained into the future.</p></speech>

Of course there was the Brexit spike, to which the Minister has referred in some replies.  His own Department has been very efficient and kind in response to queries I have raised, and I am sure, in response to other Deputies as well.  There is growing concern that, as the website of the Passport Office states, processing times are a guideline only and not a guarantee.  We have case after case of families being very distressed as their time for departure for a holiday fast approaches and no passport is delivered.</p></reply>

A total of almost 750,000 applications was received in 2016.  This was an increase of more than 9% over 2015.  Between 1 January and 31 March this year, over 250,000 applications were received, which represented an increase of 26% over the same period last year.  There are a number of factors behind these increases.  The decision by the UK to leave the European Union has undoubtedly had an impact but so too has an expanding population and an increase in outbound travel in recent years.  The passport service's stated aim is to process passport renewal applications within 15 working days of receipt, provided that the documentation is in order.  Applicants are advised that the turnaround time will vary depending on factors such as seasonal demand.  Turnaround times for each category of applicant are updated every week on the passport service website.  Despite the high volumes, the target turnaround time of 15 working days was met in almost 90% of cases last year and it is just over the target - by one day - in recent weeks.  First-time applications are subject to longer turnaround times due to the extra verifications involved to protect the integrity of this important document.  The current turnaround time for first-time applications is 24 working days.  In all cases, as a matter of best practice, applicants are advised to allow at least six weeks for the processing of a passport and to use the passport express service only if they have no immediate travel plans. </p><p>The exceptional level of demand is likely be sustained into the summer months and we have worked hard to put in place a number of measures, including additional staffing resources, to mitigate the impact.  A total of 230 temporary clerical officers has been assigned to the Passport Office to assist with the processing of passport applications and to respond to customer queries.  The great majority of these officers are already in place. </p><p>I launched a new online passport application service for adults renewing their passports on 30 March last.  This new service will greatly assist in managing increased volumes of applications in the months and years ahead and in meeting target turnaround times.  It allows citizens to renew their passport books and cards online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from wherever they are in the world.  The service removes the requirement to have a form witnessed and is a fast, secure and convenient way to renew a passport.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The target turnaround time is ten working days plus postage time.  I urge all Deputies to encourage all eligible applicants to use this channel.</p><p>I also ask Deputies to continue to help promote good practice in communications with constituents.  As I mentioned, as a matter of best practice and to avoid unnecessary stress, applicants should allow six weeks for a passport application.  Applicants should always check the validity of their passport before booking travel.  If travel is already booked, it is very important that applicants carefully consult the passport service website and use the correct channel.  The website has a free renewal reminder service for passport holders and I also strongly encourage people to avail of this service which is available through my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p><p>I fully appreciate the pressures the current exceptionally high levels of demand are putting on travel plans.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff and other resources in order that the impact on turnaround times for applicants and on customer service is minimised.</p></speech>

As I have said, I am grateful for the fact that the Department has been able to help out in such cases.</p>  <p>  On additional resources, are all 230 staff members now in place?  The Minister said that some of them are still being recruited.  The Minister has said that there is going to be a passport reform programme - which includes the online application which was launched just a few days ago - but it includes a ten-working day turnaround when even the 15-working day turnaround does not seem to be working.  There are also complaints from constituents saying that access to the Passport Office itself also needs reform.  Our constituents often turn to us as Deputies because they are simply unable to reach the office by telephone or e-mail.  The lack of contact obviously adds to the stress.  I note that in the UK it seems to take just about three weeks to get a passport in a country of 65 million people.  In Germany it takes four to six weeks.  We need further reforms.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what the Deputy has said in respect of those working there.  I too wish to acknowledge the efficiency and dedication of everybody associated with, and working in, the Passport Office.  There are challenges, however, because we are dealing with unprecedented numbers.</p>  <p>  I appeal to Deputies to continue to help promote good practice in their communications with constituents in order to avoid unnecessary stress.  My advice continues to be that applicants should allow six weeks for a passport application.  Applicants should also check the validity of their passport before booking travel.  If travel is already booked, it is very important that applicants carefully consult the passport service website and use the correct channel.  The website has a free renewal reminder service for passport holders and I strongly encourage people to avail of this service, which is available through our own website.

I assure Deputy Broughan and other Deputies that I will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff and other resources in order to ensure that we give the best possible service to our citizens in the matter of their applications.</p></speech>

Many thousands of applications were made in 2015 and 2016.  Does the Department have any idea how many people worldwide have an Irish passport?  What are the eligibility levels?  I remember asking the former Deputy Gilmore, when he was Minister, the very same question and he could not give me an answer.  Does the Department actually know?</p></speech>

I again acknowledge the challenges for the Passport Office in dealing with unprecedented numbers of applications.  Over 733,000 passports were issued last year for Irish citizens.  I encourage Irish citizens to check the expiry dates on their passports and to bear in mind that many countries require incoming visitors to hold passports which are valid for at least six months.  That can be a challenge.  While acknowledging the challenges and pressures in this area, I assure the House that the programme of passport reform will ensure that we will have one of the finest and most efficient online passport services in the world.  I am anxious to ensure that the impact on turnaround times for applicants and would-be travellers will be minimised.</p></speech>

This case has seen more high-level political engagement, time investment, consultation with third parties, consular visits and court hearing observation missions than any other in which the Irish Government has been involved.  This is in light of the exceptional circumstances of the case, as referred to by Deputy Connolly, and, in particular, the youth of our citizen at the time of his arrest, his ongoing detention, the fact that his trial has not been concluded and that there has been no conviction recorded.</p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly and consistently called on the Egyptian authorities to release our citizen and return him to his home and his family in Dublin.  We have supported petitions for this man to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140.  We have appealed for him to be considered for release under the youth amnesty scheme of Egyptian President el-Sisi.  There has been contact with the Egyptian authorities by myself, the Taoiseach, other Government Ministers and a parliamentary delegation to ensure that every effort is made for the release and return of the Irish citizen without delay.  That is my aim and that of the Government.  We are working on a daily basis to secure that outcome.  I repeated this position when I met my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, a number of weeks ago.  In recent days, I have raised the issue again with EU High Representative Mogherini and with the Secretary General of the Arab League, who is also a former Egyptian Foreign Minister.</p>  <p>  The court hearings have been closely monitored.  On all occasions that the case has been called in court, there has been a representative of the Government present.  On the most recent occasion, there was a request for Mr. Halawa's release on health grounds and the presiding judge undertook to examine the matter.  That is currently under consideration.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, Ibrahim Halawa was 17 when arrested and had just completed his leaving certificate.  He has spent the final two years of his teens and the first two years of adulthood in dreadful conditions.  He is now on hunger strike.  Things have moved to a new level and the situation has become particularly acute.</p>  <p>  In his reply to a previous question, the Minister mentioned that an Irish doctor has been sent in.  The Minister might clarify the position in that regard.  I did not catch whether the doctor had gone in already or if he is to go in.  What was the result of the visit?</p>  <p>  Is it correct that the Minister has clarified that the judge is considering whether Ibrahim Halawa will be released on health grounds?  Has his case started?  He is 21 years of age and his case has been adjourned 21 times.  Great inconsistency has been shown by the Egyptian Government in the context of the release of 203 young people whose cases are also pending.</p></speech>

It will not assist in any way.  The Irish citizen's health, as indicated in reports, is a matter of utmost concern for both myself and the Government.  In light of our concerns, we took the unprecedented step of making arrangements for a medical visit.  While his findings are confidential, I can confirm that the Irish doctor recommended further specialist assessment.  The doctor shared his assessment and recommendations with the prison authorities, who have a clear responsibility to ensure this man's welfare while he is in the Egyptian prison system.</p>  <p>  The Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs have consistently underlined our concerns in this regard in all of our contacts with the Egyptian authorities.  We have made it clear that we expect the Egyptian authorities to fulfil their responsibilities regarding the health, welfare and well-being of the Irish citizen.  The Irish Embassy in Cairo continues to actively engage and follow up on these matters.</p></speech>

I simply do not accept that.  The matter was raised previously in 2001 and 2003.  It was put to the then Minister for Defence, Michael Smith, who confirmed in 2003 that security services had been contacted and that in such an event in Ireland, we would clearly require the assistance of external forces.  I will ask the Minister again.  Is there or has there been an arrangement of any character with the RAF to intervene in regard to civilian aircraft in Irish controlled airspace?</p></speech>

I can confirm for the benefit of the House that no agreement has been entered into by the State to grant any permission to the RAF, or indeed the military aircraft of any other state, to shoot down planes of any type under any circumstances over Ireland.</p></speech>

I did not ask him if there was an agreement.  There are specific arrangements to be made if there is an agreement.  If the Minister is saying there is no such arrangement, be it involuntary, informal or whatever way the Minister wants to put it, has he commissioned an investigation into the sources who are talking to media outlets, allegedly at a high level inside the Irish Defence Forces, with a very serious level of detail in these matters?  Has he commissioned an investigation into where they have got their arrangement?  Has he sought a review of the answers of his predecessor, the former Minister for Defence, Michael Smith, who seemed to indicate and verify some of these matters?  These are highly serious issues in a country that proclaims to be neutral and if the Minister is denying that any such issue or arrangement exists at all, how does he see Ireland defending itself, as it were, in these scenarios since we well know that the current capacity of the Defence Forces would be incapable of withstanding such a situation?  These are situations which have far-reaching effects for Irish citizens and our neutrality.  We have to be open and honest about it and, frankly, the Minister in his answers is choosing to dodge the question he is being asked.</p></speech>

Both Governments are agreed on the imperative of continued devolved power sharing Government for Northern Ireland, which is at the core of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The Secretary of State confirmed in his statement to the House of Commons on 28 March that the British Government does not want to see a return to direct rule in Northern Ireland.  I welcome this confirmation and I reiterate today in this House, as I have to the Secretary of State, that this Government does not support the suspension of the institutions and the return of direct rule in Northern Ireland.  It is important to note that there is no statutory provision at Westminster for the suspension of the institutions, following its removal, which at the time was supported by the Irish Government, as part of the St. Andrews Agreement, more than ten years ago.  The political process in Northern Ireland is founded on the institutions, principles, procedures and practices of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Assembly and the Executive, and it is imperative that both Governments and all the parties work in support of this framework.</p><p>In this context I am representing the Government in the intensive talks in Belfast.  These talks have two objectives.  First, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Second, to address the implementation of the outstanding issues from previous agreements.  These discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from the talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the setting up of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.</p><p>Overall, encouraging progress is being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved after the Easter holidays, including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However, with resolve and determination from all the parties involved in the process, and with the support and encouragement of the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.</p><p>As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably.  I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement, which will provide for a stable power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Does the Minister see any value in another election other than that there would be a certain amount of head counting?  I believe that the issues which are outstanding are capable of resolution.  This Friday we will attend the anniversary of the Belfast Agreement.  Most commentators are saying that there appears to be relatively little energy or appetite on the part of either of the two major parties, the Democratic Unionist Party but particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, to make the institutions work, a rather fatalistic approach that it is okay to return to direct rule but that the preference is for further elections.  I have no real idea other than head counting what another election might produce.  Has the Minister spoken to each of the parties about that?  Does he have a sense of what they believe a further election might achieve?  Talking to ordinary people from the North who are not particularly political I found that they are completely confused.  When we see how life has transformed in the North in terms of peace and security, historically, it seems to be an enormous mistake to run the risk of losing all the progress that has been made.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what she said and I wish to assure her and other Deputies that, as part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the matter of the discussions over recent weeks, I will continue to emphasise strongly the critical importance of forming a new Executive in Northern Ireland so the interests of the people of Northern Ireland can be effectively represented.</p><p>There is an added urgency and a greater level of importance on this occasion having regard to the commencement of the negotiations on the proposed withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  I very much hope that agreement between the parties will be reached on the formation of the Executive as soon as possible so that this Executive can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the negotiations.  As the formal talks pause for Easter, I encourage everybody to maintain informal contacts over the Easter period and to reflect on what can be achieved if in the weeks ahead the Executive is to be established that operates in a sustainable and effective way.</p></speech>

Last week, I met in excess of 15 heads of business corporations in Northern Ireland.  I share the concern that has been raised by Deputy Burton but I remain convinced that all the parties are willing to play their part in reaching an agreement which will provide for a stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government is co-guarantor of the Agreement and the peace process and will continue to play its part.  While there will be no formal engagement over the next few days, I appeal for a level of informal engagement between the parties to ensure that when the talks resume after the Easter period, there will be a willingness on the part of everyone involved to ensure the setting up of an Executive and a functioning Assembly at the earliest opportunity for many reasons, including the reasons evidenced by Deputy Burton in respect of budgets, jobs and economic development in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

It has taken a new departure with Donald Trump at the helm and his decision last week to drop 50 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian airbase.  We know the US media responded by saying things like "I think Donald Trump became President of the United States last night".  People described it as doing the right thing and the missile strikes were described as "beautiful".  Odds-on that Donald Trump will escalate such military action and, one presumes, use Shannon Airport to further his aims.  Is it not time that we had a review of such an appalling blight on our supposedly neutral stance?</p></reply>

These arrangements are governed by strict conditions, including that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights concerned do not form part of military exercises or operations.</p>  <p>  These conditions apply equally to military aircraft from all countries seeking to land in Shannon.  The US, as with all other states, is required to provide my Department with confirmation in writing that the aircraft proposing to land in Shannon complies with the strict conditions set out above.  Arrangements for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft are kept under ongoing review.  In line with this, my Department ensures detailed and robust procedures are in place to ensure all relevant parties are fully aware of the requirements relating to applicants and applications for permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State.</p></speech>

The Minister might consider that recent US air strikes have claimed the lives of 200 civilians in Iraq.  Dozens were killed in separate strikes supposedly aimed at ISIS.  Women and children were killed in Yemen.  The US has launched more air strikes in Yemen in March 2017 than in all of last year, not to mention the Saudi crimes in that area.  Ireland has facilitated all of these campaigns by allowing the US military on its route to those areas to land in Shannon Airport.  Not only that, we know there has been an expansion of the areas of active hostilities, as the US calls them, in Somalia and so on.  We know that drone strikes, which had reached a record under Obama at one every 4.5 days, have now reached a rate of one every 1.8 days under President Trump.  We are facilitating this and the time for review is long overdue.</p></speech>

God knows what the motive was.  While we could not believe any US President in our memory if he told us the time of day, given that President Trump is such a reckless loose cannon, how in God's name can the Minister tell us that it is okay to let military planes through and that there are no arms or ammunition because the US says so?  Would the Minister consider searching these planes so that we can assure the international community that under no circumstances are we allowing arms or ammunition through on military planes?  As we said before, these planes are not travelling halfway around the world to play golf.</p></speech>

Indeed bilateral relations between friendly nations are founded on mutual trust.  Both parties have an interest in maintaining that trust.  Details provided by diplomatic missions, including confirmation that aircraft are unarmed and carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, are therefore accepted in good faith as being accurate.</p>  <p>  Deputy Daly will be aware from previous encounters inside and outside this House that arrangements for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft are kept under ongoing review.  In line with this, as I have stated, my Department ensures that detailed and robust procedures are in place to ensure that all relevant parties are fully aware of the requirements relating to applications for permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly this State.  Ministers are answerable to this D&aacute;il and respond to numerous parliamentary questions on landings, overflights and military aircraft in Irish airspace.  Arrangements at Shannon Airport were the subject of a specific inquiry by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, of which Deputy Wallace was a member.  I met the committee prior to its completion of its report.  The committee also heard evidence from the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Secretary General of my Department.</p></speech>

Will he tell us what he thinks all those aircraft are doing?  Moving these aircraft from one corner of the globe to the other is not an inexpensive task.  They are landing in Ireland roughly twice a day.  What does the Minister think they are doing seeing as they are not involved in any military activity whatsoever, even though they are military aircraft?  I would remind the Minister that the US website Politico carried an article last week with the headline "Like Middle East Wars? You're Gonna Love President Trump".  That is what we have here.  We see ships assembling around North Korea, a ratcheting up of the situation in Iran, Somalia becoming involved, the situation in Yemen and so on and Ireland sitting in the middle of it.  It is long past a review.  We have been asking these questions for six years and getting non-answers but the world situation is deteriorating and Ireland is in the middle of it.</p></speech>

Lest there be any doubt, let me say that I was horrified at the apparent chemical attack in Syria last week.  The attack was barbaric and my thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families.  I condemn, unreservedly, the attack and those responsible.  The attack further underlines the need for accountability and a genuine political transition in Syria.  This is an international priority for Ireland and is an issue that continues to be raised in the context of EU foreign ministers' meetings, the latest of which took place in Luxembourg last week where I attended and participated.  I assure the House that Ireland does not sit in the middle of these issues.</p></speech>

There are hundreds of service users and their families requiring the services of Sunbeam House Services throughout Wicklow but particularly in facilities in Bray, Wicklow and Arklow.  Needless to say, any organisation providing such services needs to be fully transparent and provide a service that has the full confidence of the service users, their families, the front-line staff and the State agencies that act on behalf of the taxpayer who fund these services.</p>  <p>  Recent and routine HIQA inspections have found failings in the operations at Sunbeam House Services which, along with family and staff complaints, have led to a recent assurance review by the HSE that again has found failings in the operations of Sunbeam House Services.  The report refers to 284 separate complaints being registered against Sunbeam House Services between January 2013 and September 2016.  Concerned family members have been in contact with me since July 2016 about their serious complaints and concerns.  I have attempted to get answers to very serious allegations including the mistreatment of service users and serious failings in management at Sunbeam House Services.  I have been attempting to do this without increasing further the anxiety to the family members of service users and to the service users of other Wicklow based organisations that may be involved in a proposed merger with Sunbeam House Services.  Information supplied to me by concerned families suggests that long-serving social workers and a senior medical doctor involved with Sunbeam House Services have serious concerns about the procedures, care services and management at Sunbeam.</p>  <p>  The removal of the assurance report from the HSE website has convinced me that I needed to bring these issues directly to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and for a publicly accountable response on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am also concerned about the apparent lack of a protected disclosures policy at Sunbeam House Services.  Given the responsibility of care given to any organisation providing services to adults with intellectual disabilities, the absence of such a policy is, quite simply, disgraceful.  The families need to know if protected disclosures have been made to the HSE or to Sunbeam House Services, the number and gravity of such disclosures and the response to such disclosures, including reporting to the Garda where required.</p>  <p>  Transparency and accountability in the provision of care services should be front and centre in every organisation providing such services to the most vulnerable members of our community.  I am shocked about what is contained in the reports and how the reports have been removed from the website.  From my contact with some families I know they have been very reluctant to go public because of a deep seated fear that their loved ones' level of service may be affected.  The fact that family members of service users are living in fear is enough of a disgrace to warrant a serious, rapid and public response from the HSE and from the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200032#EE00600"><p>I wish to thank Deputy Casey sincerely for raising this important issue.  I know it is of great concern to the families affected, many of whom I have had an opportunity to meet, correspond and talk with - as the Deputy has.</p>  <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating that the Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people who are in the care of the health service, and I appreciate that the Deputy has outlined this also as his ongoing priority.  This includes those people who avail of services provided by voluntary organisations such as the service provider in question.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from his work in Wicklow, Sunbeam House Services is a voluntary organisation providing a wide range of services across east Wicklow and south County Dublin to adults with intellectual disabilities.  It is supported financially by the Health Service Executive and received core funding of &euro;24.1 million in 2016.  I am very aware of the broad range of supports that Sunbeam House Services has been providing to date for people who have a disability.  These services include residential places to those with intellectual disabilities, rehabilitation training places, day services to over 300 clients and home support services to a cohort of 42 adults.  It also supports nine respite beds, providing more than 800 places to 51 service users each quarter of each year.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately I am also aware that a number of serious issues of concern have been raised by families of service users attending Sunbeam House Services.  On foot of these concerns, an externaI assurance review of the systems of governance and management in Sunbeam House Services was recently commissioned by the chief officer of the HSE community health care organisation, CHO 6.  I very much welcome that this was an external review because this was important for providing reassurance to families that this would be an external review; someone from outside to look at these issues.  The review focused on Sunbeam House Services governance and management structures in respect of the management of complaints, the management of incidents, the management of protected disclosures and the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s national safeguarding of vulnerable adults policy.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, a review was undertaken of the independent regulator HIQA&rsquo;s inspection reports on Sunbeam House Services disability residential centres.  I understand that in addition the review process involved interviews with families who had raised complaints and concerns.  There was also a consultation with service users, because it is important that the voice of the service user is heard in this process, and meetings with staff focus groups.</p>  <p>  The review team has now finalised its formal written report in line with its terms of reference.  I wish to be clear that I consider the issues to be extremely serious and I have engaged closely with senior management of the HSE regarding the review report.  I have stressed the need to ensure that an appropriate implementation plan is put in place as a matter of priority and I understand this is currently being finalised.  I will be meeting with HSE management to focus specifically on this issue and I intend to meet tomorrow with representatives of families who have raised concerns.  I have been, and will continue to be, very clear that I want to see all recommendations of the report acted upon quickly and any further actions that may be required to be followed up without delay.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I wish to assure Deputy Casey that I and my Department will continue to maintain close contact with the HSE with a view to ensuring that all necessary service improvements across the range of services provided by Sunbeam House Services are instigated as soon as possible.  I also want to thank the families for coming forward and highlighting these very important issues.  If it was not for the families then we would not have the body of knowledge which merited the external review.  My assurance to them today on the floor of the D&aacute;il is that each and every one of the recommendations in the report must be implemented by the HSE and by Sunbeam House Services.  I expect the HSE to get on with ensuring the implementation plan is in place as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I thank him for his response and for his confirmation that he is meeting immediately with the HSE on this matter.  I am also delighted to see that he is meeting formally with the families tomorrow.  This is what is needed.  Now that action is being taken a public response is needed that all service users, the families of service users and front-line staff can take confidence in.  There needs to be a rapid, time-bound approach to every single recommendation contained within the reports into Sunbeam House Services.  I accept that due process is important but these concerns have been investigated for a long time now.  Families have stressed to me how the vanishing of reports from the website has further contributed to the concerns of families.</p><p>Reports appeared on the website and were taken down the next minute.</p> <p> The Minister will be aware of the proposed merger involving Sunbeam House Services, KARE and St. Catherine's, which would, in effect, bring the entire service offered to those with intellectual disabilities in Wicklow under one managing entity.  It is my information that the insurance report recommends this merger be put on hold until such time as the issue in respect of Sunbeam House Services has been resolved.  If the Minister is not aware of that, I would ask that he come back to me on it.  I also ask that he ensure that, at a minimum, this recommendation is followed.</p></speech>

I have been involved with advocating for people with disabilities in County Wicklow since my teenage years.  I have absolutely no intention of allowing a report that has been commissioned and that has made very clear and stark recommendations to sit on a shelf.  It is my absolute determination that the HSE will deliver what Deputy Casey rightfully calls for, namely, a very public response in terms of an implementation plan that shows exactly how we are going to deliver on all of the improvements the report seeks in respect of Sunbeam House Services.</p>  <p>  For quite a period, parents have been highlighting concerns about a number of issues at Sunbeam House Services.  It is my absolute view that the report vindicates those concerns.  I understand the HSE published the report online and that it was subsequently taken down, and that there is some legal or administrative reason for this.  The main comfort I take is that the parents have the report.  It has been circulated because many parents got it from the website and they have seen it.  I am sure Deputy Casey has seen it.  I have seen it.  There is no doubt about the body of work that needs to be done.  I agree with the Deputy about the need to hold off on any merger until all of these issues have been fully resolved.</p>  <p>  Many of the staff in Sunbeam House Services have been doing Trojan work at different levels and in a variety of roles.  There is a clear need for improvement and things have gone wrong.  The report leaves us in no doubt of that.  However, for the people who work in Sunbeam House Services and do their very best to provide a good service, for the parents who advocate on behalf of their service users and for the families, I really believe that by working together we can make this an organisation that delivers the type of service we want to see in Wicklow and south Dublin, and one of which everybody can be proud.  The report is the beginning of that process and stands as an important roadmap for the improvements we need to see.  Now the HSE and Sunbeam need to get on with delivering it.</p></speech>

The HSE said that the recruitment difficulties had affected the CAMHS service in Cork, particularly since the start of the year.  Since January, it has been particularly difficult to maintain the non-consultant hospital doctors' on-call rota for the two Cork city emergency departments due to a combination of vacancies, sick leave and other factors.  However, further resignations - I stress, resignations - and sick leave have compounded the service difficulties.  The HSE said that, since 25 March, it has not been possible to guarantee as responsive a service to the emergency departments as it would like.  To put the question simply, why is this happening?</p></speech>

There was nobody available from the CAMHS teams to see anyone who presented in Cork city last Monday.  If a child presented as self-harming or suicidal at the accident and emergency departments of either the Mercy Hospital or Cork University Hospital, there was no psychiatrist there to see them.  That situation beggars belief.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State visited Cork a number of months ago and heard about the situation and the services that were available.  While there is credit due to her for coming down, it also means she is familiar with the situation.  At that time, responding in Leaders' Questions in respect of the issue, the Taoiseach led us to believe that no stone would be left unturned and that every effort would be made to ensure that all resources would be provided to resolve the crisis.  Nonetheless, we see a situation in which one of the most fundamental and crucial mental health services for children and adolescents in Cork has been found wanting and left short.</p></speech>

The difficult decision has now been taken to prioritise out-of-hours cover to &Eacute;ist Linn and to postpone out-of-hours on-call cover in the emergency departments until staffing levels improve.</blockquote><p>That information was circulated to general practitioners on 7 April in the Cork-Kerry area.  Some of the replies I have got back to recent parliamentary questions are quite alarming in terms of the length of time people are waiting for services from CAMHS in the region.  Beyond that, it is also a major national problem.  I know there is extreme difficulty in recruiting at non-consultant hospital doctor and consultant level.  I accept that.  However, this has been on the cards for some time.  We have been raising the matter for a number of years.  We knew there were going to be huge difficulties because of the slow recruitment process.  Now that is evidenced on a daily basis in Cork and Kerry and throughout the country.</p><p>A general practitioner said he had an extremely vulnerable 14 year old and a 15 year old whom he could not refer to the emergency department as there was no CAMHS support available.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to this area, we do need to expedite the recruitment of clinical personnel to ensure we do not have a situation in which vulnerable children are waiting up to a year for assessment and supports.  It simply is not good enough.</p></speech>

I share their concerns, as do the people who are providing the service.  They understand the difficulty they are facing and the impact it is having on the young people in the area.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of the HSE, under its annual service plan, to provide an age-appropriate mental health service for those under the age of 18.  Mental health remains a key care programme priority for this Government, reflected by the fact that the HSE mental health budget increased from around &euro;826 million in 2016 to approximately &euro;853 million this year.  The HSE service plan for 2017 commits to further development of child and adolescent mental health services, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response services.  This is a strategic priority action in the plan, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by over 8,500 in the period 2016 to 2017, thereby creating additional demand on CAMHS.  Approximately 18,500 referrals are expected to HSE CAMHS services this year alone.</p>  <p>  CAMHS has been prioritised in new funding made available by the Government since 2012.  Additional resources and facilities mean there are now 67 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams, supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds nationally with further beds planned to come on stream in the near future.  CAMHS services in Cork have eight community-based teams.  Two of the teams have consultant vacancies, namely team C - Western Road, and North Lee North.  Team C has had a vacant psychology post since Christmas 2016, but the executive recently secured a person to fill this post.  There have been widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists, which all of the Deputies have recognised.  Recruitment efforts have been ongoing including local and international advertising for a locum consultant in Cork, which have not yielded any success.  Unfortunately, there is currently a serious shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS consultants at both national and European level.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to provide the best possible service within available staffing resources.  A key focus is on managing clinical risks and prioritising referrals accordingly.  All efforts are being made to support teams with additional therapy and administrative resources, notwithstanding the consultant vacancy, to ensure that the best possible service is provided.  The rest of the multi-disciplinary team associated with team C continues to provide a service to those deemed within their scope of practice.  Unfortunately, however, those requiring consultant or psychologist review are currently on a waiting list.  The HSE acknowledges that the lack of consultant cover is having a considerable impact on access to the service locally.  It is working to explore all avenues for the recruitment of qualified staff to fill vacancies and to replace staff retiring or resigning, particularly in areas such as consultant, psychologist and nursing posts.</p><p>I have spoken to Sinead Glennon, head of mental health services in the Cork-Kerry area.  I absolutely believe that every stone is being turned and every possible avenue is being looked at to try to fill these posts and cover weekends or various parts of the day.  Bearing in mind all of the circumstances, I am satisfied the HSE is making every effort to address this, including the prioritising of cases based on assessed professional need.  In other words, I am assured that urgent cases are being prioritised and seen within the recommended level of time.  I will continue to monitor this closely in conjunction with the HSE.</p></speech>

I am also satisfied that the HSE is making every effort to address this important issue.  This is not a personal attack on the Minster of State but I am somewhat aggrieved.  I have some experience of working within the system.  I listen to people on a daily basis who are qualified for these jobs.  It seems to me that there is no will to hire these people.  I urge the Minister of State to approach the HSE and stress this point.  The Minister of State stated the HSE is experiencing significant shortages in child and adolescent mental health services personnel.  I do not believe that.</p></speech>

However, the reality is that we are dealing with an inadequately resourced service.  Consequently, as much as the HSE can try to manage priorities, the position is that staff are being stretched too thin.  I am particularly concerned about the implications if this arises in an accident and emergency department.  Again, children could end up in the accident and emergency department of Cork University Hospital or Mercy University Hospital and not have any psychiatrist available to see them.</p></speech>

If we have to be imaginative in how we recruit, then so be it.  We have to bring forward solutions to the problems in the emergency departments where we simply have no resources available for vulnerable children and adolescents, as explained in the letter circulated to GPs.  Moreover, in letters GPs have forwarded to local Deputies, GPs have expressed legitimate concerns about their patients being put at risk because of the dearth of supports.</p></speech>

Again, we are doing everything we can and not only through the recruitment process.  We are trying to improve the environment, facilities and technology to make our mental health services facilities places in which people want to come and work.  The fact of the matter is that within the CAMHS teams and services, a high level of intensity is involved in the work.  It means there is a high level of turnover and burnout, especially given the difficult in recruiting consultant psychiatrists.  In cases where they leave after a short period, we have to try to recruit again.</p>  <p>  I believe every effort is being made.  Let us consider the teams and how they can be utilised best.  I note we are introducing the new well-being programme in our schools.  Before the summer is out, the task force will make known its actions and recommendations to the committee and the D&aacute;il.  Many other things are being done to try to stop the number of young people needing services in the first place.  This is and will continue to be a priority for me.  I will keep the House updated with any developments in these areas.</p></speech>

The Minister in question said that if the Government were to accept the redress recommendations from the commission, then the sky would be the limit for potential future liabilities.

I welcome that redress has been mentioned.  This is obviously the reason we have had to wait seven months for it to be published.</p>  <p>  I am concerned by the response of the Minister to the report and her claims that the focus of the report is on children who were unaccompanied by their mothers into the mother and baby homes and county homes.  I do not believe that is the case.  The report raises far more significant points.  The Government's announcement of its unwillingness to examine the issue of redress is an appalling slur on the victims.  Again, in the seven months the Government has waited to publish the report, probably many of these people have already died.</p>  <p>  Redress was never at the heart of this issue.  Over and over again, we never asked about redress.  It was always about stolen identity, stolen lives and broken families.  No amount of money can compensate for these things.  The people concerned want an acknowledgement of what was done to them with the knowledge of the State.  The report clearly states that the facts relating to financing gave the State the ultimate regulatory power, that is, the power to close the institutions.  The State is responsible and we have to deal with it.</p></speech>

There was no reason for the delay in the report.  The Minister has given no proper reason for its delay.  It should have been published last September.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, the Minister attended a meeting at which she was not asked about redress.  She was asked to give a report on the work of the commission and why there was a delay.  Pressure was put on the Minister to publish a report and to give maximum information.  We asked the Minister whether she knew about briefing documents at the highest level.  We asked factual questions relating to the site in Tuam being a crime scene.</p>  <p>  The Minister has come back and talked about waffly consultation.  We do not know where it will start or who the stakeholders are.  The Minister is not giving us a date for the scoping exercise to extend the terms of reference.  The Minister has put in transitional justice that no one has sought.  The Minister is talking about Caranua version two when Caranua itself is in serious trouble.  Reference has been made to the most appalling distinction between accompanied mother and unaccompanied mothers.  Shame on this Government.</p></speech>

Following a short first interim report last July, the commission submitted a second interim report in September 2016.  This report deals with a number of issues that had come to its attention during its work and analysis based on information collected up to August 2016.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I published the second interim report of the commission.  It is now available on my Department's website.  I have been mindful of the time it has taken to publish this report.  It has, however, been necessary for me to engage with Cabinet colleagues on issues in the report that extend beyond my remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  The focus in this report is on children who were unaccompanied by their mothers in mother and baby homes and county homes.  In its interim report published yesterday, the commission suggests that the exclusion of children who were resident in mother and baby homes and in county homes without their mothers from the residential institutions redress scheme, which was established in 2002, should be re-examined.  The report states that the commission is satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are unquestionably the main such homes that existed during the 20th century.  It does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated.  The commission is not recommending any changes to its terms of reference at this time.  It may recommend further investigations when its current investigation is completed.  It has not made findings to date that abuse occurred in these institutions but notes that its work is not yet complete.</p><p>The commission also recognises that people whose births were falsely registered have a need to establish their identities but that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records.</p> <p> The Government has carefully examined the commission&rsquo;s recommendation regarding redress, and has concluded that it is not possible to implement it.  As Deputies will be aware, the residential institutions redress scheme has been closed since 2010.  Following the publication of the Ryan report in May 2009, there was a range of requests and calls for the redress scheme to be extended.  The then Government took a decision in 2010 not to extend the scheme.  The Government in 2013 also decided not to extend the scheme.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said he found no basis to revisit the decision. </p> <p> This Government is conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the question of redress in advance of any conclusions on this issue by the commission.  The challenges for Government in considering the recommendations of the commission at this interim stage of its work are clear from the findings of this report.</p> <p> It is important to remember that the commission&rsquo;s investigations are ongoing.  The Commission&rsquo;s final report is due in February next year.  Its conclusions on this and all matters regarding the treatment of former residents will be studied very carefully at that point.  My focus now is on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in mother and baby homes and county homes, with a view to offering supports that will be of genuine and practical value to them.  With this in mind, I will consult with them regarding the nature and type of services and supports in the area of health and well-being that they consider would be helpful to them at this stage.  I will conclude this consultation by the end of June, and bring proposals to Government before the summer break, so that we can have appropriate supports in place as quickly as possible.</p> <p> My Department is working with Tusla to support the provision of information to assist former residents who may wish to establish when they resided in a mother and baby home.  I have asked Dr. James Gallen of the school of law and government, Dublin City University, to assist by mapping out a model of transitional justice.  This would be a means of giving a voice to former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.  Dr. Gallen&rsquo;s expertise in transitional justice will help to develop an approach.</p> <p> I am also carrying out a scoping exercise to examine the possibility of broadening the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.  This report is very helpful in focusing us on what may possibly emerge in the final report from the commission of investigation.</p></speech>

If that person feels that strongly about this and is a member of the Government, he or she should come out and identify him or herself.</p>  <p>  With regard to the mother and baby home redress fears, I think the Minister's intentions are very good.  Yesterday, she did a tremendous amount of damage to people who have been in such situations and who are above all else entitled to be treated as free and equal citizens of this Republic, not as victims or survivors, but as people who get free and equal treatment in this Republic.  The Minister should have been able to tell us that, even though the decision may not have been made yet and we know there are no findings of fact here, the commission should have been widened to all institutions and should also include the situation of birth mothers where their consent was not properly forthcoming.  We know of many of those cases.  It should also include the falsification of records and American adoptions.  If the Minister is intent on looking at scoping exercises, can we see scoping exercises that are of meaning and value to people affected by this?</p></speech>

The interim report goes some way to saying it warrants further investigation into including those who have been excluded.  The decision on which institutions to include and exclude was very inconsistent.  That needs to be addressed.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to meet with representatives of the survivor groups.  They are not happy with the Minister's response and the response of Government.  There are things they have consistently asked for that are not being addressed.  I know that people like Paul Redmond and others from the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors are really keen to have this urgently addressed.  The Minister would get the response right if she engaged with them.  Time is running out.  I urge that this be done as an immediate matter.</p></speech>

Events overtook that report and what was discovered in Tuam shocked the Government.  The Minister failed to go back to outline the significance of what has happened and to say where we are going with this.  The Minister has left it up to a local busy GP who happens to be the coroner to look after the Tuam site.  What was the last figure for the number of babies discovered with six mothers on the Tuam site?  Can she recall?  She is leaving that to a local busy GP.  She is going all over the place with consultation, scoping, transitional justice and Caranua.  The survivor groups that have spoken to me do not want any of that.  They want her to report back on what happened in Tuam over the past six to nine months.  Where is that at?  How is that influencing the commission?  What terms need to be changed?  What access to records is there?</p></speech>

I accept and hear what the Deputy is saying, but I just do not have any comment on that.  I wish to say very clearly that in terms of the Government's response, it does not mean we have closed off redress for those who have been in mother and baby homes.  When the commission finishes its investigations, social history and confidential committee of hearing evidence and makes recommendation to Government, it is then we will have the opportunity to consider redress for those people in those institutions, irrespective of whether that is a part of the recommendations.  It is at that stage the commission will have the opportunity to identify whether there are any findings of abuse in the formal process that has been put in place.</p>  <p>  I hear what Deputy Daly is saying about the extension of the terms of reference.  I committed to looking at that and I am doing so.  Deputy Daly talked about listening to survivors, or residents.  Some of the people with whom I have spoken to prefer to call themselves residents as distinct from survivors.  The Deputy said that what they want is an apology.  I spoke with a survivor or resident yesterday who does not want an apology.  Instead, what she wants is the Head of State to ask for their forgiveness.  She sees that as different from an apology.  Therefore, I understand that there are lots of different issues that people are seeking to be addressed.  Part of the reason for establishing an approach to take a look at the wider ways of listening to what people want, which is part of what is transitional justice, is because of that diversity and the importance of trying to identify it.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Connolly, I listened very carefully in terms of the meetings on Tuam that were requested.  I have received many submissions and have already written letters that are being sent back on how we will progress the different issues that arose.  As the Deputy knows, one of the aspects specifically has to do with access to information.  That is something about which I spoke in my response to the interim report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200035#HH01500"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to raise what I believe is a very important issue.  With the increasing numbers of older people in the country, a demand for long-serving staff naturally increases.  We need as many of our most experienced staff to stay in practice as long as possible.  Surely, what we should be doing is incentivising them to work for longer.</p><p>People are living longer, as can be seen in the changes in the population aged over 65, which has increased by 19.1% since 2011.  Every year in Ireland older workers are forced out of their jobs for no other reason than that they reach a certain age.</p> <p> Some two thirds of firefighters in Ireland are retained firefighters who are not full-time but who are fully trained and paid on a per-call basis.  Most firefighters in small towns and villages would work in that retained system.  The normal retirement age is 55, but firefighters who are physically capable of working beyond the preferred age of 55 have an extended optional period in which to exit the service, subject to certain conditions.  Such firefighters have the option to continue working for a defined limited period, subject to compulsory annual medical assessment measured against agreed standards.  The extended optional period is up to 58 years.  There are retained firefighters throughout the country who would like to see this period extended to 60, and I believe they should have that option.</p> <p> I appreciate that an agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved, SIPTU and the ATGWU, in November 2002, but that is 15 years ago.  From that process, an expert group's report on retirement age recommended that the retirement age for the retained firefighters should remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.</p> <p> Firefighters, like members of the Garda, should have the option to continue to serve until they reach 60 years of age.  Mandatory retirement ages, set arbitrarily on the basis of the worker having lived for a set number of years and not on his or her capability to do the job, constitute a kind of barrier to an age-friendly society.  There is evidence that longer working lives have beneficial effects on individuals' physical and psychological well-being.  Evidence also shows that workers' productivity does not necessarily decline with age and any decline in physical capacity is easily compensated by qualities and skills acquired through many years of experience.</p> <p> Mandatory retirement ages take out a significant amount of fire service expertise and leave fire departments that struggle with recruitment and retention.  I recognise the rigours of the job and I support the health and safety aspect of legislation, but all firefighters should be treated equally in terms of health and safety, regardless of age.  Retained firefighters who are physically capable of working beyond the age of 55 should have the option to continue working until 60, subject to compulsory annual medical assessment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-12a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200036#JJ00200"><p>I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this important issue and I understand his reasons for bringing it forward.  Fire services, in all their facets, are delivered by people.  On behalf of the Government, I want to recognise the contribution that all staff in the fire services, both the retained services and the full-time services in Dublin city, make in protecting our communities.  I talk to them a lot and I understand the work they do, which they take very seriously at all levels.  The Deputy is right that they are constantly updating their skills and trying to push themselves to new levels of expertise.  They are genuine in their work and always want to help and serve, which is what they are there for.  Over the years, fire services have evolved to give us the quality services we have today, which continue to drive down the annual toll of fire related deaths, injuries and damage.</p><p>Fire authorities are subject to legislation as employers in their statutory roles of providing fire services.  It is expected that fire services in Ireland will facilitate and provide effective intervention in accordance with the dual statutory responsibilities of fire authorities to protect people and property from fire and also to protect their own employees.  This objective presents the challenge of ensuring that personnel achieve and maintain the necessary competence for the range of roles and activities they may be designated to undertake.  As I said, I have witnessed them involved in continuing training and education to enhance their skills.</p><p>International research indicates that a retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure firefighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them.  The retirement age of 55 years was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.  Since the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and under subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.  A full-time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  This retirement age reflects the physically demanding nature of the firefighter role.  The retirement age for retained firefighters is 55, with an extended period to age 58, subject to a formal application process, including a compulsory medical assessment.</p><p>A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved, SIPTU and the ATGWU, in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided,<i>inter alia</i>, for the appointment of an expert group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The expert group's report on retirement age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.  Following the report of the expert group, published in April 2003, a circular was issued by the Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in regard to retained firefighters in line with the expert report.</p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations processes.  Our fire services are evolving and remain an essential service which plays a vital role both in local communities and nationally.  My Department wants to ensure that this service is provided efficiently, safely and with due regard given to the terms and conditions applying to fire authority employees.</p></speech>

What he said is fact but the case I am making is that these people are well qualified, well trained and keep themselves up to date on all the new ways of dealing with fire.  Nobody truly appreciates the work they do until the fire service is needed.  The efficient way they carry out their work deserves great credit.</p>  <p>  The rules and regulations on retirement are 15 years old.  We are told nowadays that 60 is the new 50, so these people are well capable of working for longer.  If the same rules applied here in the D&aacute;il, to myself in particular, there would be far fewer people around the D&aacute;il.  As it stands, however, nobody can say we do not do our jobs as best we can.  These firefighters are fit to carry on their work, subject to medical examination, and this should be considered.  At the time these regulations were brought in, such people could claim their pension at 65 years of age but some will now have to wait until they are 67, 68 or 69, so they will be ten years retired and still not able to get an old age pension.  This is wrong and should be looked at.  I ask the Minister of State to consult the Department to see if anything can be done in this regard.</p></speech>

However, it is not something that has been brought to my attention on a larger scale, either by the unions or management.  It is an issue on which I can do a bit more digging.  I recognise that the retirement age is a conversation that is happening in regard to many jobs, but there is an extra dimension to this job, given the physical demands on firefighters.  That is why the expert panel relied on international best practice.  It was not dreamed up and there was a sound basis to it.  Nonetheless, I have no problem in digging a bit behind that because I am conscious that, as the Deputy said, it is 15 years since the decision was made.  While there has not been a clamour for this to be looked at, as the Deputy has asked the question, I will ask around and see if there have been changes in other countries that we might need to follow.  We relied on best practice at that time and I will make sure that has not changed in other countries.</p>  <p>  In regard to pensions, I must check the point but I would imagine they are entitled to certain parts of their pension related to their job, if not the State pension.  That is also something we can look at.  I understand the spirit in which the Deputy has raised the point and I will give due consideration to whether it is appropriate to look at this again and perhaps set up a new expert panel.  If it is, we will do that, but it might not be appropriate just yet.  We will look at what is happening in other countries and then come to a decision.  I will consult the Deputy at a later stage.</p></speech>
