    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100003#A00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<blockquote>The distinguished programme is the programme that breaches the consensus of a society and shows the audience the world in a different light.  At the root of every good programme is conflict because you cannot have a consensus-shattering moment without conflict.  All distinguished programmes cause offence to somebody who wants to cling to a shibboleth, or a sacred cow, or a position that is no longer borne out by the facts. </blockquote>These are the words of the late Mr. Jack Dowling who worked as a producer at RTE until 1969.  Penned years ago, they go right to the heart of this debate.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill for debate this morning.  In particular, I thank the Minister for his time in preparing for the debate on it and my fellow Deputies for their time, consideration and contributions.  In preparing the Bill we interviewed a wide number of people involved in broadcasting, from presenters and contributors to editors and senior managers.  I thank all of them for their time, expertise and contributions.</p><p>Strong democracies live or die by free speech.  Our ability to debate openly allows society to regard itself, tackle its shortcomings, recognise its strengths, improve and withstand crises.  Full and frank debate across all media is not commendable or nice to have; it is an essential ingredient in our ability to grow and evolve together.  When we hobble such debate, we end up with groupthink, the marginalisation of dissenting voices and a failure to recognise when our social and political norms have become stale and outdated.  The importance of open debate is something we recognise in the Oireachtas where we have created a legal bubble for ourselves, the ability to speak under privilege and free from the fear of legal proceedings being taken against us if we need to speak truth to power or about wrongdoing by rich or powerful individuals or organisations.  </p><p>Of course, freedom of speech must go hand in hand with responsibility.  If any of us, through our words, seeks to damage another based on false evidence, we can be held to account through the defamation laws.  If any of us seeks to incite hatred, we can be held to account through the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  These laws seek to balance the need for and right to freedom of speech with the obligations that go with such freedoms.  This is a difficult task and, inevitably, legislation may contain errors where the balance is tipped too far in one direction or the other.  The Bill seeks to rectify one such error.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 lays out the responsibilities of television and radio broadcasters.  Section 39(1) reads:<blockquote>(1) Every broadcaster shall ensure that--...(<i>d</i>) anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence, or as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State, is not broadcast by the broadcaster, and...</blockquote>The problem is the inclusion of the word &quot;offence&quot;.  Under the Act, broadcasters are legally obliged to ensure nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as causing offence.  The Bill is simple.  It is just one line and has nothing to do with the defamation laws or most of the Broadcasting Act.  It removes the word &quot;offence&quot; from section 39.</p><p>Why go to so much trouble to remove one word?  Why spend so much time and effort researching, interviewing people, drafting the Bill and seeking to have it debated in the House?  Why ask for the time of the Minister and my fellow Deputies?  Including the word &quot;offence&quot; is contrary to the ideals of free speech and undermines free speech every single day in the broadcast media.  George Orwell famously stated: &quot;If liberty means anything, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.&quot;  This is a quote every Deputy might regard with wry appreciation.  </p><p>Closer to home, President Michael D. Higgins told the International Federation of Journalists last June: &quot;... it is critical that journalists can and must be allowed to speak the truth without fear or sanction; and that citizens must be allowed to evaluate and weigh an array of accurate and impartially provided evidence, and come to independent conclusions of their own.&quot;  How are broadcasters expected to be able to speak the truth if they are not allowed to cause offence?  How in this non-offensive world can broadcasters and journalists speak truth to power?</p><p>One journalist we interviewed pointed out that journalists, including broadcasters, had an obligation to hold institutions and persons of power to account.  Invariably, the holders of power at some stage come to regard the imposition of accountability on them as offensive.  Therefore, it seems that journalists may not just be offensive to some people at some stages, but that it is obligatory on them to be so.</p><p>Otherwise, they are probably not doing their job.  We would all agree that we have far too many examples in Ireland of those in authority and the organisations they work for not being held to account because people were afraid to speak out.  </p><p>Imagine asking broadcasters to shine a light on wrongdoing, abuse and special interests without causing anyone offence.  It would be impossible.  Yet that is exactly what section 39 of the Broadcasting Act requires them to do.  Imagine a world in which we are not allowed cause offence to anybody.  One person's reasonable comment is another person's reasonable offence, and so every person's reasonable comment may be censored for fear of reasonable offence.  If the law were fully enforced, the Minister, myself and many other Deputies in this House would find ourselves in the broadcast media a lot less often.</p><p>It is entirely legitimate to be offended by what people say.  In what many regard as his finest contribution to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Taoiseach said &quot;The rape and torture of children were down-played or managed to uphold the primacy of the institution, its power, standing and reputation.&quot;  I have no doubt that these words caused very great offence to some people.  As the law stands, therefore, the Taoiseach's speech should not have been broadcast.  It is entirely legitimate for people to have been offended by what the Taoiseach said, but it is entirely illegitimate to censor the Taoiseach because of that offence.</p><p>The argument for removing the word &quot;offence&quot; is not just academic.  It is true that the Taoiseach's speech was broadcast, but we have heard directly from broadcasters that the inclusion of the word &quot;offence&quot; in the Broadcasting Act is actively restricting free speech in Ireland every day.  Here is how one broadcaster explained it:<blockquote>The offensive test has two ill effects.  Firstly, it limits the degree to which broadcasters can examine contentious topics and secondly, it breeds homogeny amongst broadcasters.  The Panti-gate example illustrates how many broadcasters could only offer stunted coverage of an issue of major public debate.</blockquote>Some broadcasters pointed out that not only does the inclusion of the word &quot;offence&quot; allow people to shut down debate they are uncomfortable with; it also allows a tiny number of people to shut down debate for the whole population, across a wide range of issues.  As has been argued, one person's truth is always going to be offensive to somebody.  </p><p>Part of the problem is that the onus is put on the broadcaster in the Act.  There is already a legal onus on contributors to avoid defaming people, which is right and proper, but the Broadcasting Act puts responsibility on the broadcaster not just to avoid defamation, but to restrict contributors from saying anything that anyone may reasonably take offence at.  One correspondent we spoke to said that if a person believes what he or she says to be the truth and if his or her experience rings true to a situation, then it is up to that person to prove it; it is not necessarily up to the broadcaster, in that instance, to moderate the debate.  Yet the law requires it.</p><p>Another part of the problem is that &quot;offence&quot; or &quot;reasonable offence&quot; is entirely subjective.  It cannot be measured or tested for, so it cannot be rebutted.  It was pointed out in various interviews that offence, by its nature, is subjective and that there is no barometer to determine what is offensive to society at large and what is not.  Another commentator argued that we cannot legislate for what is offensive.  He said: &quot;What is giving offence?  One man's offence is another man's reasonable comment.  It is nonsense&quot;.</p></speech>

They cannot do it.  So what do they do?  They err on the side of caution.  They make editorial decisions to stay away from certain topics and certain people and in so doing, they badly damage freedom of speech in Ireland.  Here is how one journalist described the situation today, due to the inclusion of the word &quot;offence&quot;:<blockquote>There is a pathological fear of causing offence in large media organisations now more so than ever.  Everyone has the right to their truth and their story, as long as they are not lying about it or not setting out with some kind of agenda to attack somebody else.  People are afraid to tell their stories any more.  It is a much poorer society if you have a situation where people from minorities, people who are in some way damaged or compromised or on the margins are not allowed to tell their stories.</blockquote>What is the solution?  This is why the effort was spent in getting this Bill before the House this morning - because of that one little word, &quot;offence&quot;.  It has fostered a culture of fear and caution in our national media that must not be allowed to exist.  Our broadcasters must be able to ask the hard questions and to probe the difficult issues, whether people are offended by those questions or not.  </p><p>This is a simple Bill.  It does not seek to update every component of freedom of speech in Ireland; nor does it seek to update the defamation laws or any other parts of the Broadcasting Act.  It aims to do one thing, namely, to reduce the culture of fear and caution that broadcasters are telling us exists every day in every newsroom, and in so doing, to radically improve freedom of speech in our country.  One broadcaster summed up the objective of this Bill as follows:<blockquote>The reason offence should be removed from the Act is that it cannot be defined by legislation.  Libel can only be decided in court.  One person's offence is another person's fair comment.  To have this in legislation means broadcasters are simply shackled by guidelines over what they can and cannot do.  If I do not know what it means, how can I do my job properly?  What is terrible is that legislators seem to be differentiating between radio, television and newspapers.  That is extraordinary because of the pass over of people.  Eamon Dunphy writes and speaks.  Matt Cooper writes and speaks.  If we attempt to shut down critical media in the supposed pursuit of democracy, we make a mistake which will come back to haunt future generations.</blockquote>Another broadcaster hoped this Bill would pass for the following reason:<blockquote>It would make our jobs easier and it would make for a richer democracy.  Right now we are forced to self-censor.  The media are left to decide what is offensive and what is not offensive.  The referendum next year is going to be stunted for fear of offending people.</blockquote>In accepting this Bill, the Minister, the Cabinet and the Oireachtas can send out a powerful message that freedom of speech is highly valued in Ireland, that broadcasters have an obligation to probe, question and speak truth to power, that the obligation sometimes results in people being offended, and that that is okay.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100004#B00600"><p>I am conscious in dealing with this issue that this Friday legislative slot was set aside to allow Deputies, particularly Opposition Deputies, to advance Bills that could otherwise only be taken during Private Member's business or not at all.  This reform was intended to facilitate Deputies who have a particular interest or reform in mind and who require a fair wind to translate it into law.  Private Member's Bills have been adopted in the past but they have been too few and invariably they have been of some substance.  This one-section Bill is scarcely what was envisaged when the change to D&aacute;il procedure was made.  There was no need to cause the House to assemble this morning to make a point that might have been raised in several other routine ways.  Rather than dismiss it as a stunt, I will give the Deputy the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps he did not expect to be selected or did not have time to produce a considered Bill.</p><p>The Bill derives from a remark of mine published in <i>The Irish Times</i>during the so-called Pantigate affair when I said that, in the context of a wider revision of the Broadcasting Act, I was considering an amendment that would require broadcasters to avoid causing &ldquo;undue offence&rdquo;.  At the moment, Section 39 of the Act requires every broadcaster to ensure that nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as &ldquo;causing harm or offence&rdquo;.  I said, in the wake of the programme in question, that the more objectively ascertainable test would be to impose a requirement not to cause &ldquo;harm or undue offence&rdquo;.  This comment appears to have been whimsically latched onto by the Deputy, who now, in this hurried one-section Bill, proposes simply to excise the term &ldquo;offence&rdquo;.  Legislating from the hip for a passing headline is not appropriate in a complex area, nor would it improve the quality of public debate.  A more nuanced approach is required if broadcasting standards are to be maintained and if we are to prevent broadcasters from seeking controversy in the pursuit of ratings.</p><p>The Bill proposes the reinstallation of section 39(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, minus the two words &quot;or offence&quot;.  The Deputy proposes this amendment in the full knowledge that a full refurbishment of the 2009 Act is under way.  Put simply, the totality of this Bill is the excision of the two words &quot;or offence&quot;.  What would happen if colleagues in the House generally started to trawl through statutes based on something they heard over their corn flakes on &quot;What it says in the papers&quot;, resolving to excise two words they do not like and call that proposal a Bill, and defending this legislative ingenuity on the basis of whatever argument is popular at the time?</p><p>I would rather take the Deputy's initiative this morning as an indication that he wants to debate the issue, and I am happy to engage on that basis.  I am not happy, however, to be associated with any move that would seek to debase broadcasting standards in this country to what we see in, for example, the United States.  I do not want to turn the national broadcaster or any other broadcaster into a version of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.  Freedom of speech and of expression - and, equally, the right to be heard - are central tenets of Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  They are correctly regarded as being central to the proper functioning of civil society, but they cannot be taken for granted.  It matters little whether the subject is developmental issues in sub-Saharan Africa, trade issues in Asia or gay equality in Europe - unless the media can report without fear or favour then the public good is undermined.  The right and ability of media to do so must be preserved.  After all, to quote the Secretary General of the United Nations, &quot;When it is safe to speak, the whole world benefits.&quot;</p><p>There is, however, a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the constitutional rights of the individual to freedom of speech and freedom of access to information are maintained, while at the same time safeguarding individuals and groups in society from abuse.  In introducing this Bill, the Deputy referred to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with freedom of expression.  While it is strictly true to say, as the Deputy did, that there is no reference to &quot;offence&quot; in that article, it does, at 10.2, impose limitations on the basis that the right to freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities, one of which is the protection of the reputation or rights of others.  Similarly, our constitutional guarantee, in Article 40.6.1&deg;, of the right to express convictions and opinions freely, and, under Article 40.3&deg;, to communicate convictions, opinions and feelings, is also limited.  The State is obliged, under Article 40.3.2&deg;, to protect citizens, as best it may, from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  The proposed amendment to the current provisions does not take account of this obligation.</p><p>The controversy surrounding RTE's &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; brought issues of gay rights, homophobia, freedom of expression and the obligations of our public service broadcaster to the fore.  The handling of and reactions to the broadcast have been subject to commentary, criticism and query.  While I have not remained silent on my views on homophobia and the use of &quot;homophobe&quot; as a label, I sought to avoid intruding into or ascribing motivation to the RTE decision in respect of the contemplated litigation.  Deputies will be familiar with the statement at the time from the managing director of RTE television. The broadcaster's explanation is that it had expert advice available to it which cautioned that it did not have a case to defend.  As a result, it made the decision it made.  It is true that RTE is the public service broadcaster, but it is also true that it has commercial obligations under section 108 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The broadcaster made a commercial decision, as it frequently does, in the face of contemplated defamation actions.</p><p>Mr. Killane declared in his statement that RTE had not &quot;engaged in censorship, but ha[d] rather fallen foul of Ireland's defamation laws.&quot;  It is important to note that the Bill before us today would change nothing in respect of the situation in which RTE found itself.  The broadcaster would still be subject to the same six legal actions under defamation law and would be forced to consider the same decisions.  I said recently that I hope people who hold themselves out as commentators on or contributors to public debate fully appreciate that such debate can be robust, heated, personal and sometimes even hostile.  Politicians are expected to function in such an environment as normal.  That said, I understand from RTE's appearance before the joint committee at the end of March that there are four or five Members of the Oireachtas who are either in the process of taking legal action or are threatening legal action against RTE in this area.  The broadcaster is operating in a difficult and complex environment, having strict and restrictive legal responsibilities under current defamation law.  It must continue to present a wide range of views and allow forthright debate while operating within these boundaries.</p><p>The Broadcasting Act 2009 provided for the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as the independent regulator responsible for the oversight of compliance in regard to broadcast content in the State.  The numerous broadcasting complaints arising from &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; will be addressed by the compliance committee of the BAI in due course.  One of the objectives of the authority, as set out in section 25(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 2009 Act, is to ensure that &quot;the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, are upheld&quot;.  Section 39 of the Act provides for the duties of broadcasters, including, for example, in regard to objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs.  It would be a matter of serious concern if recourse to our defamation laws were to have a chilling effect on public debate, particularly in the lead-in to the referendum on marriage equality.</p><p>In the context of that forthcoming ballot, the BAI has developed and published guidelines in respect of the coverage of referendums.  These set out the rules with which Irish broadcasters must comply when covering any referendum held in the State.  The aim of the guidelines is to ensure broadcasters' coverage of all elections and referendums is fair, objective and impartial.  In covering the forthcoming referendum, broadcasters must ensure, for example, that coverage of the referendum is fair and equitable to all interests.  The BAI has previously highlighted the need for broadcasters to put in place transparent mechanisms for ensuring, in the run-up to the referendum and on the day citizens cast their vote, that coverage is fair, objective and impartial.  It is incumbent upon the BAI and all broadcasters in the State to ensure they adhere to the guidelines on referendums and election coverage, as well as to the spirit and letter of the relevant judicial rulings in this area.</p><p>The right of reply scheme published by the BAI provides for the broadcast of a right of reply statement to facilitate the correction of incorrect information that has been broadcast and which has resulted in a person's honour or reputation being impugned.  The scheme details the process for exercising a right of reply and the manner in which the public can utilise the process.  The BAI has developed the scheme further to the requirements of the current legislation, the intention being to provide an opportunity for a person to exercise his or her right to the correction of incorrect information without recourse to legal proceedings which may prove time-consuming and costly.  A request for a right of reply is made to the broadcaster, and all broadcasters are required to include on their website a copy of the scheme and information about the contact person to whom requests for a right of reply may be made.  Decisions by a broadcaster to refuse such requests can be reviewed by the BAI's compliance committee.</p><p> A right of reply is about the correction of incorrect facts or information.  However, the scheme does not provide for the broadcast of an alternative or contrary opinion.  In other words, a person who is not satisfied with the manner in which a broadcaster has relayed information about him or her has a right of reply, but it will not be granted unless the information broadcast was factually incorrect such that the person's honour or reputation has been impugned.  This was not deemed an option in RTE's response to the allegations made against it in the recent controversy.</p><p>RTE is an independent public service broadcaster and produces some 40 hours of live news and current affairs every week.  While mistakes have been made, with which we are all familiar, RTE is committed to this publicly funded content.  I am confident the recent controversy has done nothing to make the company resile from its public service obligations under the existing provisions of the Broadcasting Act.  RTE is obliged to be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, reflect the varied elements that make up the culture of the Irish people and uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially, as I have mentioned, those relating rightfully to liberty of expression.</p><p>Ultimately, we rely on our broadcasters to provide a forum for matters of public debate and, indeed, controversy and to ensure that, when these take place, the necessary level playing field is provided for all concerned.</p><p> RT&Eacute; has a crucial role in the conduct of public debate and I believe it remains fully committed to ensuring the full and free exchange of information and opinion on all matters of legitimate public interest.  However, RT&Eacute; will not be a lone platform for debate in the forthcoming referendum.  We need to remember that information will be presented and opinions exchanged across all media.  It is important that we have a free, diverse media &ndash; not beholden to a single sector, to large commercial concerns or to a single political party.  The media plays a central and critical role in conveying information, parsing outcomes and passing judgment.  Because of that, the nature and character of media also matters.  Its ability to speak truth to power and to challenge authority is one of those slender columns that sustain democracy.  If that capacity is reduced in any way, then we are all the poorer for it.  If media is fettered, either by the interests of owners, by fear of authority or by the simple fact of groupthink, then our democracy is worse off.</p><p> We can conceive of or construct media in a number of different ways, as a sector of the economy, as a means of communication, as a means of entertainment &ndash; but it is also something much more fundamental; it is central to the freedoms that we hold as core values in our democracy: the freedom to speak, to be heard, and to hear.  When I spoke previously on this issue, I wondered whether in the medium and longer term, in terms of public discourse on such a fundamentally important issue as marriage equality, we will have been damaged by the recent controversy.  As I stated then, it seems to me that this far out from the referendum, it may be no harm at all that these issues have been ventilated now.</p><p> In initiating the amendment, the Deputy stated to the House that he does not believe people should be censored for saying offensive things and, consequently, the Bill proposes to get rid of the reference to &quot;offence&quot;.  I believe a more nuanced approach is required if broadcasting standards are to be maintained and we are to avoid stations or broadcasters seeking controversy merely in the pursuit of ratings.</p><p> At present, section 39 requires every broadcaster to ensure that nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as causing offence.  As I have stated in the House, this seems to me to be an unfeasibly rigorous approach.  We all know how easy it is for some people to be offended &ndash; even where offence was neither intended nor objectively ascertainable.  However, to suggest that we should grant impunity to the deliberate giving of offence irrespective of the circumstances is to invite a further coarsening of public debate.</p><p> I will shortly propose miscellaneous amendments to the Act.  Among them, as I announced in the D&aacute;il recently, I am considering an amendment that would require broadcasters to avoid causing undue offence.  That seems to be more objective and more in tune with the realities of public debate and the Constitution.</p></speech>

I was somewhat surprised by the Minister's attitude in dealing with Deputy Donnelly's Bill.  I found him to be somewhat arrogant and flippant as to the intentions, which to be honest was uncalled for.  I do not take offence on Deputy Donnelly's behalf or anything like that but we must recognise that it is very worthy that we would have a discussion on the role of the media in Ireland.  I very much appreciate the intent in Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s Bill because we have a substantial problem.  In my opinion, the Fr. Reynolds debacle with RTE set a tone in many ways of self-censorship since that time in terms of the print and broadcast media, an overwhelming chunk of which is privately owned by one substantially wealthy individual.  We have a situation in Ireland where on the one hand the days of investigative journalism are long dead, yet on the other the media seem to be able to print any sort of rubbish about the private lives of citizens which is really of no public concern to anybody.  We have not got the balance right in this country and we need to monitor it.  We could learn a lot from France.  The French are well known as great advocates of free speech and liberty yet there are incredibly strict privacy laws and controls over the media.  It is appropriate that would happen and that we would have a balance.  We have not achieved that in Ireland.  I do not say Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s Bill achieves that but the topic is worthy of further discussion.</p><p>The background to the Bill is the Pantigate scandal and the decision of RTE to award substantial sums of money due to the alleged offence caused by Rory O&rsquo;Neill describing individuals from the Iona Institute as homophobes.  The reason there was a reaction to that and it caused a stir is that, to my mind, most reasonable people recognised that the remarks were not offensive but were an accurate reflection of the views of those individuals.  For me to respond to the poisonous bile written by Brenda Power this week in the <i>Daily Mail </i>in relation to stereotyping and derogatory racist comments about the Traveller and Roma communities and to refer to her as a racist and homophobe might be considered offensive by her but the reality is that it is an accurate reflection of the views of that woman.  We need to have a balance.</p><p>One must ask whether the problem is the law or the self-censorship of RTE.  I believe it is the latter and that if RTE had taken a challenge in the courts I do not think the people claiming the offence would have won their court action.  Most reasonable people would take such a view also.  The reason RTE responded is that it was bending the knee to those with deep pockets, which is all too prevalent in the media and it is something we must examine.  Six or seven months ago I was asked to participate in a BBC 4 radio programme on Bono.  The BBC is broadcasting the programme this week.  The reason it has taken so long is that in the past seven months the BBC has been subjected to enormous pressure from Bono&rsquo;s legal representatives, to the point that RTE would not even hand over footage of an interview Bono had done with it to the BBC, which normally would be done, due to the fear of litigation and tight control by U2 and Bono in monitoring what opinions went out about them.  A similar approach was evident with the penalty points saga where we were aware that media outlets were pressurised by members of the Judiciary who feared they would be named in the print media as having had their penalty points cancelled and information was not put in the public domain as a result.</p><p>We have mentioned in this House many times previously the tragic case of Sarah Bland who was sexually abused by her father.  Sarah and her mother presented detailed criminal complaints to the Garda about the handling of their case by their solicitor at the time - now the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  Again, articles have been written about the case but no one will print them.  In the background to much of what appears in the media there are threats and fear of litigation.  That is both good and bad.  In essence, what it means is that there are very wealthy individuals in society who try to block important information getting into the public domain.  This links back as well to the control and ownership of the media.</p><p>That said, I am in favour of free speech but I agree it is not an absolute right and it must be balanced with other rights.  That goes without saying.  The right to free speech is not the right to hate speech nor the right to say whatever one likes regardless of the consequences.  Actions do have consequences and what people say can set a tone.  I do not believe that pulling a cheap stunt in order for a person to promote him- or herself by writing or saying something offensive is tolerable in a democratic society.</p><p>I wish to use one example in that regard which to me is a very serious one.  It relates to the case of Colin Fulton and the <i>Sunday World</i>.  He is a member of the Progressive Unionist Party, a legally recognised and registered political party.  On that basis, I believe he deserves to express his opinion and the views of his community without demonisation.</p><p>The <i>Sunday World</i>ran a series of articles which featured claims that Mr. Fulton was involved in thefts from occupied houses, punishment attacks on teenagers, attacks on women, participation in illegal drinking clubs, the sale of drugs, and prominent involvement in the Ulster Volunteer Force.  Despite the serious criminal allegations made by the <i>Sunday World</i>, he has actually never been convicted of anything.  He only once appeared in court and was proven beyond any doubt whatsoever to be innocent of those charges.  </p><p>Subsequent to the publication of those articles, Mr. Fulton has had information warning of serious threats to his life, five of them since the article I mentioned was published.  Justice Watch Ireland and others believe that this publication and the judge's citing of the media's press freedom have breached Mr. Fulton's right to life as enshrined in article 2, his right to privacy in article 8 and his right to expression in article 10.  We need to have balance in that regard.  Investigative journalism is important but what is printed should be substantiated with hard facts to back it up.  It should be recognised that putting out opinion and information like that is highly prejudicial, as was the information in that reprehensible article in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>earlier this week.</p><p>I welcome the fact that we are discussing this Bill because it is appropriate.  Irish people are concerned about this matter and I am glad to hear that the Minister will be bringing a more comprehensive proposal before the House in the near future.  That is great because we do need it.  In some ways, the media in this country are totally out of control, given some of the rubbish they are printing with impunity.  On the other hand, the media have absolutely failed the citizens of this State in not calling the Government to account, not conducting any serious investigation, and standing back at the slightest threat from wealthy people with deep pockets.  That is not in the interests of citizens in this State.</p></speech>

As the barrister Mr. Brian Barrington pointed out at the time of the Pantigate scandal, by its censorship of Mr. Rory O'Neill RTE has undermined confidence in its impartiality and has also made clear that it will not facilitate a free and fair debate.  We found ourselves in the bizarre situation where members of the LGBT community were essentially being told they could not name homophobia when they see it, and that it was more offensive to call someone a homophobe than to experience homophobia itself. </p><p>Under the international covenant on civil and political rights, everyone has both a right to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of expression.  Yet RTE denied these rights to Rory O'Neill when it apologised for his comments, censored them and financially compensated the people who claimed to find his views offensive.  It is clear that a debate about this whole issue is good and positive.  On those grounds, I welcome Deputy Donnelly's Bill.  </p><p>On the other hand, we must also consider those who would use free speech to express opinions based on prejudice and intolerance.  The democratic right to protect such views must not be portrayed as censorship.  Earlier this week, a disgraceful column about the Traveller community was published in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  The article was rightly condemned by the Traveller organisation Pavee Point for using strong hate speech and stereotypes.  The Equality Authority described it as shameful and stated that it was not only untrue but was designed to be demeaning, hurtful and risk incitement.</p><p>In response, the paper's group editor publicly defended the piece on the grounds of free speech, stating &quot;We will continue to fight alone, if we have to, for the right of citizens to debate all matters of public policy without state censorship&quot;.  That beggars belief coming from such a periodical.  The author of the piece took to the national airwaves to claim that her critics were closing down debate and that she was the real victim of this controversy.  It could easily be argued that Joe Duffy's &quot;Liveline&quot; show caused offence to the Traveller community.  It could probably also be accused of causing harm in how it gave a platform for such racist views to be aired.  </p><p>There is a strange - or maybe we should say intentional - misconception that to criticise someone's views, especially when they have been given a public platform to express them, is to be an opponent of free speech.  It is important to note that those who cry &quot;censorship&quot; are more often than not the people who hold positions of power.  Ms Brenda Power has the platform of a national newspaper in which to express, as Pavee Point put it, inherently racist views.  </p><p>Members of the Travelling community are rarely given such a platform to defend themselves or to write about the damage that racist speech does, yet Ms Power is the one who claims to be targeted when her opinions are criticised for contributing to the extremely serious level of discrimination against Travellers.  We also saw this narrative play out in the Pantigate scandal, as the individuals who were so offended by Rory O'Neill's comments frequently used their positions of power in the national media to express discriminatory views about the LGBT community.</p></speech>

That would be a mistake.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100007#E00400"><p>I did not say that I would.  I am saying that the Bill is welcome because we need to discuss this whole area.  In the opening part of his speech, I found the Minister was very derogatory towards the Deputy's Bill.  I thought it was over the top.</p><p>  Another prominent misconception is that the right to freedom of expression somehow carries with it an entitlement to a platform.  In this regard, some Members may remember the occasion a couple of years ago when a university society in Dublin extended a speaking invitation to Nick Griffin of the British National Party.  The invitation was withdrawn after democratic protests by students, staff and anti-racist campaigners.  They were then accused of censorship.  The right to freedom of expression does not mean that we must tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia or any other type of discrimination.  </p><p>  Another big subject we should examine concerns who is shaping the news.  There is little doubt.  For example, we know that Independent News and Media got a bailout of about &euro;138 million from the banks.  Over &euro;50 million of this fell on the Irish taxpayer.  If one searches the Internet to see what the newspapers or RTE said about this, it is bordering on impossible to find out the information.  That is because people are afraid of the power and money of Mr. Denis O'Brien.  He is worth billions and has incredible power to shape the news.  I am surprised the Minister has not dealt with the fact that his control and influence to shape the news is too great for the health of our media.  I do not think it is healthy that power and money have such an ability to shape the news.  I would have thought that the Minister would agree on that aspect.</p><p>  Very good research was done by a Trinity College student who examined three years of news coverage of austerity.  Only 3% of the coverage stated that austerity was a bad idea for the Irish people, as well as being too harsh and unfair.  Only 3% took that position, which is a frightening figure.  It is something we need to be worried about, because a healthy, objective media could mean an awful lot for improving how we do things in this country.</p><p>The present situation leaves a lot to be desired.  Aside from being vulnerable to the wrath of the Government of the day, the national broadcaster is also rather dependent on the commercial and big business sector for advertisement revenue.  That is understandable.  However, there have been times when the broadcaster should have shown a little more independence.  Given that it is a State broadcaster, I would prefer to see a stronger streak of independence and objectivity.</p></speech>

We believe this change will promote the right of freedom of speech while ensuring that anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm, likely to promote or incite crime or attempting to undermine the authority of the State is not broadcast by the broadcaster.  The existing Act requires broadcasters to prevent the broadcast of anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence.  The Bill removes the phrase "or offence".  Fianna F&aacute;il agrees with this approach and does not believe that people should be censored for saying offensive things regardless of whether offence is reasonably taken.  Determining what may be considered offensive by anyone is a remarkably difficult task.  What I or anyone else may consider offensive may not be perfectly compatible with other people's thoughts or opinions.  In anyone's opinion what constitutes offence or reasonable offence is entirely subjective.</p><p>  The Minister rightly confirmed earlier during his speech that, as politicians, we operate in a world where frank and open debate is essential.  In his opening remarks the Minister was singularly arrogant and dismissive of this legislation.  Then again - I hope I do not cause the Minister any offence - that is a trademark of how he operates.</p></speech>

They voted me in at a time when many of my party members were not voted in.  In my humble opinion I believe that says something for my ability and what I have done for the people of that area, and I trust the Minister can see that as well.</p><p>  The point I am making is that in a democracy it is important that we can have an open and frank debate.  There are times when people say things, whether intentionally or unintentionally, which can cause offence to another party.  Deputy Donnelly stated earlier - I concur with his view - that offence is rather subjective in nature.  It is important that we have the opportunity for this debate in the D&aacute;il today.  The reason the Government introduced Friday sittings was to ensure that Opposition Deputies, whether Independents or those from a party, would have an opportunity for debate on legislation that might not necessarily come from the Government.</p><p>  Let us be frank about the debate before the House today.  What we have seen with the use of the current legislation and the use of the word &quot;offence&quot; was not what was originally foreseen.  The battle lines are being drawn before the marriage equality referendum and a full and free debate is being systematically undermined by the immediate recourse of one side to the courts to censor the other.  This is not good for debate or for our democracy.  I imagine the Minister will concur that a strong democracy is built on freedom of speech.  A lively and frank conversation with Rory O'Neill, the man behind the performer Panti Bliss, on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; was swiftly countered with legal action against RTE, although RTE offered a series of remedies to meet the concerns of the individuals involved, including the right of reply.  That is very important.  People with an alternative view had the opportunity to come on the show and explain their alternative view.  I acknowledge openly that they were entitled to their alternative view.  Anyway, after these offers were rejected by the people involved, the national broadcaster took legal advice and settled to avoid a long drawn-out legal battle which it was doomed to ultimately lose.  There has been much discussion about the rights and wrongs of RTE management deciding to bring a swift and relatively inexpensive end to the legal dispute, but the debate should not simply be about RTE.  There are far bigger issues at stake, including freedom of expression and the value system of the country.  We accept that this is the spirit in which the Bill has been introduced.</p><p>  The legal action, I and my party argue, was not about defamation but about firing a shot across the bows of the Iona Institute's opponents in the upcoming referendum debate and restricting future discussion on the topic.  The stalwarts of the institute were shaping the ground for future battles.  They had no interest in taking up the right of reply to O'Neill's views or engaging in discussion on the issues.  Instead, the institute engaged legal professionals and adopted an aggressive stance to send a clear message to any opponents that discussions would be limited to the mahogany benches of the Four Courts.</p><p>  The provision to be deleted by this Bill in essence casts a cold wind on those willing to use freedom of expression to debate in a dispassionate manner things which they believe to be right.  As a republican who firmly believes in the non-negotiable principle of equality, I am altogether unapologetic about my support for marriage equality.  I fully acknowledge that people on either side of the debate feel passionately about the issue.  I acknowledge, accept and respect that there are people on the other side who, similarly, have strong convictions and views.  However, we believe debate should be open in a republic and not limited to one side rushing to their lawyers at the slightest offence.  That does not make for a good democracy.</p><p>  It goes without saying that passions will occasionally spill over the line of acceptable and constructive debate.  We must view this in a mature way and in this light the Iona Institute cannot claim to be above name-calling.  More sensitive and thin-skinned Members of the Oireachtas might have taken offence at being called &quot;consensus monkeys&quot; or &quot;bonkers&quot;, and Members were referred to as such in certain articles.  In reality, this is about the cut and thrust of debate in our country, and that is what democracy is about.  It would be deeply unfortunate and immensely damaging to our capacity to deliberate on sensitive issues if debate is stifled by litigious elements.</p><p>  As science evolves and society changes, we will be increasingly faced with complex issues that test our sense of self and offer no easy answers.  Across a broad remit of areas, of which lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights is only one part, we face pressing questions that cut to the heart of our value system.  Any democracy should deal with these challenges through an open and fair discussion that is not darkened by the shadow of intimidation.  If debates are smothered under an avalanche of lawsuits before they begin, our ability to reach a common consensus will steadily be eroded.  Instead, we will slip into a ceaseless culture war fought between embittered sides in the trenches of the Four Courts, where deep pockets will decide the course of public debate.</p><p>Intolerance driven by trenchant ideologies rather than by empathy will become the hallmark of an increasingly sterile national conversation.  I think we are better than that.  I believe we are more than capable of having a mature discussion on issues that challenge all of us, of reflecting on the debate and then casting our ballots accordingly.  Having this discussion will demand some level of patience, personal restraint and mutual respect, and it should not be chilled by fear of a solicitor's letter floating through the letter-box.  Democratic debate cannot be held hostage by rampant litigation.</p><p> In my view we have already made immense progress in previously sensitive areas.  Ireland has made leaps and bounds in advancing genuine equality for the LGBT community over the past two decades.  From the decriminalisation of homosexuality to the enshrinement of anti-discriminatory laws in the Equality Act, this country has made significant strides forward, of which we can collectively be proud.  For these reasons, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill introduced by Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on which I commend him.  Its purpose and aims are those that we in Fianna F&aacute;il, the republican party, can and will support.  I hope the Minister does not take offence.</p></speech>

Unlike the Minister, I am not the sensitive type.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and this debate.  I commend Deputy Stephen Donnelly on his introduction of this legislation and I thank him for raising this important issue.  I note that the Minister is here this morning to contribute to the debate, even though from his introductory remarks it seems he is having a bad hair day.  I do not know whether it was the queen's pheasants in London or something else that upset him, but he is not in great humour.  I would be a smoked cod and chips man myself.</p><p>This debate is about freedom of speech, the right to express an opinion and the ending of censorship.  Any society or state that does not protect the rights of its citizens to express their views or opinions is not an inclusive or democratic society or state.  Minority groups must be protected and they must be allowed to defend themselves by expressing their views without threats, intimidation or legal challenge.  We need to ensure our broadcasters are not forced to shy away from difficult social issues.  We politicians know there is nothing wrong with honest, good and robust debate and we often get it in the neck at times.  As I say to my friends, &quot;If you cannot take it, look for another day job.&quot;  Politics is not for the precious types and neither is working in the media.  We all need to wake up to that reality.  </p><p>Deputy Donnelly's Bill proposes to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 to remove any mention of the subjective term &ldquo;offence&rdquo; from the duties of broadcasters:<blockquote>Section 39(1)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 is amended by substituting the following for paragraph (d):(d) anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm, or as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State, is not broadcast by the broadcaster,&rdquo;.</blockquote>At all times hard questions need to be asked, and views should always be challenged.  Only then can we live in a healthier society.  Recent events have shown us how true this is.  </p><p>The Bill removes any mention of &quot;offence&quot; from the duties of broadcasters as listed in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Currently, broadcasters are duty bound to ensure no material is broadcast that can be reasonably regarded as causing harm or offence or as being likely to promote or incite to crime or as intending to undermine the authority of the State.  From the point of view of broadcasting, giving offence has been elevated to the same level as undermining the State's authority.  As a result, the broadcasting complaints process is a happy hunting ground for people who are determined to take offence regardless of whether a remark has been broadcast as offensive.  As a result, our broadcasters often shy away from difficult social issues. </p><p>This Bill does not deal with the issue of defamation, although many broadcasters are calling for changes following the Pantigate issue.  I use this opportunity to commend Rory O'Neill on his forthright and honest interview on RTE.  He was dead right to challenge the prejudice against gay people in Irish society and his interview made an important contribution to the debate on equality.  That interview and his speech in the Abbey Theatre should be shown in every second level school in the State as part of social and personal education and development.  He was perfectly right to defend gay people and to challenge those who regularly attack the gay community in this country through newspaper columns.  I remember well the event of 20 years ago when a young gay person was kicked to death in Fairview Park in my constituency.  I remember the hatred and the prejudice.  We have moved on since then, but other people have not moved on and we need to challenge those people.  I commend Rory O'Neill on doing so.</p><p>It is important to listen to the views of the broadcasters.  I commend Deputy Stephen Donnelly on the research he has carried out on this issue.  He has obtained the views of many broadcasters.  His research has shown that 100% of broadcasters are aware of the current duties of broadcasters - I was delighted with that statistic.  A total of 80% of broadcasters favour change to the duties of broadcasters as set out in the legislation while 60% favour a change in the defamation laws.  </p><p>The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has indicated that he may address the issue by changing the term from &quot;offence&quot; to &quot;reasonable offence&quot; or &quot;undue offence&quot;.  Any qualification of the term &quot;offence&quot;, however, retains the troublesome subjective element in the legislation.  Any potential solution would include changing the term &quot;harm or offence&quot; in section 39.  That the current legislation is potentially at odds with European law has been ignored.  Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union makes no reference to &quot;offence&quot;.  Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with freedom of expression, makes no reference to &quot;offence&quot;.  I accept the point that we need a balanced debate on this issue.  As some colleagues have argued, the right to free speech is not a right to engage in hate speech.</p><p>Deputy Stephen Donnelly's Bill is part of that debate.  The Minister talked about a more nuanced approach.  We need a balanced debate.  However, we do not mean a debate similar to the &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.  I refer to what the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said about Deputy Mick Wallace on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, which was an appalling statement for a Minister for justice to make on the national television station.  In any other country, he would probably have been gone the following morning.</p><p>We have walked away from the censorship that was in place in the period before the Good Friday Agreement.  When I visit the North and talk to Northern Nationalists they often say that the implementation of section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 delayed the peace process and prevented people from participating in inclusive negotiations.  I wonder if many more lives could have been saved.</p><p>The right of freedom of speech does not equate to a right to incitement to hatred.  Racism, sectarianism and some of the views expressed about Travellers are not acceptable and should be challenged at all times.  In note in this morning's media that a number of Fine Gael candidates are using the Traveller issue to help get themselves elected in the local elections.  Their anti-Traveller views are known and they are stoking up the issue.  Some colleagues referred to the French model for dealing with the issue of privacy.  I welcome this debate, which is part of a process to create a modern, inclusive, democratic country in which all views are listened to and in which diversity and difference are enjoyed and celebrated.</p><p>We have seen evidence of this in the past week during the President's State visit to England and his meetings with the queen.  We must respect different views and cultures, while also retaining our own rights.  I stand by the rights of citizens in our democratic Republic.  I also stand by the right of citizens to express their views.  This matter lies at the core of Deputy Donnelly's legislation.  I welcome his contribution to the debate and I strongly support his Bill.</p></speech>

The House has had the opportunity to debate that matter on a number of occasions.  I have put my views on the record on those occasions and I have also written articles on the question of homophobia and its treatment in the media.  I do not propose to rehearse what has been said in this regard.  However, I do propose to reassert what I said earlier about the Bill.  I am greatly amused by Opposition colleagues who think that the word &quot;offence&quot; ought to be excised from our legislation in this area but who cannot remember that I drew a distinction between my convictions regarding the unsuitability of the Bill and the fact that I stated that if Deputy Donnelly wanted to initiate a debate on the issue, I would welcome that and would be happy to engage.  It seems to be popular these days to make allegations about arrogance when people do not like the argument being put forward.</p></speech>

I agree with her that there is not an absolute right to either.  She is correct and Deputy Finian McGrath is wrong.  If we were to completely remove any objective and reasonable test of what comprises an offence, it would lead to the development of American-style standards here.  Of course it is true that one person can be more easily offended than another or that someone can take offence when there is nothing of substance about which to be offended.  The latter comes down to what is personal and subjective.</p><p>The man on the Clapham omnibus is a reasonable test to apply.  If the term &quot;offence&quot; were to be excised completely, we would go down the Jerry Springer route.  There are all kinds of opt-out channels which one can view on any given evening, the content of the programmes on which bear out what I am saying.  That does not enhance the quality of public debate in this country, nor does it do anything - in terms of the argument in respect of the matter under discussion - to confuse the defamation laws with those relating to broadcasting.  Any litigation which is contemplated is grounded in the defamation laws, not in the broadcasting legislation.  As Deputy Donnelly is aware - he asked me about the matter and I informed him of what is happening - I am reviewing the legislation on broadcasting and I will introduce a Bill in due course.  However, that is not the same as stating that I intend to change the law on defamation.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality to change that law.  The laws on broadcasting and defamation are two entirely different things.</p><p>I cannot comment on the article in the <i>Daily Mail</i>to which reference has been made.  This is the first I have heard about the article, which I did not see it.  The reality is that we have a duty to protect the rights not just of individuals but also of groups and minorities.  This must be pitted in the delicate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the duty on any Government, regardless of its hue, to protect - under the Constitution - to protect the rights of individuals, groups and minorities in our society.  That is the balance which we must strive to achieve.</p><p>I will not revisit the argument which states that if RTE had withstood the litigation with which it had been threatened and gone to court, it would have won.  None of us can say that RTE would have won.  I accept that it might perhaps have won but nobody can say so for sure.  RTE has stated that the legal advice it received indicated that it did not have a case to defend and that in light of its commercial responsibilities, it was of the view that it would have cost it a great deal financially if the matter went to court two or three years from now.</p><p>I welcome this debate.  That is different to saying that I agree with the Bill, which I believe to be entirely inappropriate.  Some of the contributors to the debate essentially agree with my views.  They do not like my personality but they agree with my views.  Those to whom I refer do not support the Bill either but they wanted the issues involved ventilated.  Deputy Donnelly has facilitated that and I am glad to have been in a position to respond.</p></speech>

He avoided the content of the Bill, which is extremely surprising in view of the fact that it is so specific and contains so few words.</p><p>  The Minister may believe the Bill to be beneath him as a result of the fact that it contains so few words.  However, the broadcasters do not believe this to be the case.  It is for them that the Bills seeks to cater.  One such broadcaster is on record as stating - in the context of the inclusion of the word &quot;offence&quot; in the Broadcasting Act - that many of the interest and lobby groups on all sides in various debates now know it is worth complaining to RTE and threatening to go to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about offence caused.</p><p>The intention is simply to influence future coverage.  Complaints often relate to matters of public debate, including euthanasia, abortion, social welfare, Travellers, gay marriage and surrogacy.  I worry that these complaints have a chilling effect.</p><p> Editors and producers sometimes avoid items precisely because they are afraid of potential complaints about offence caused.  There is a great deal of work in answering these complaints and even a fear that a number of complaints implies to management that one has done something wrong.  Producers and researchers who already work under tough and tight conditions will self-edit in the upcoming debates on same-sex marriage to choose items and guests who will not be risky, as it is not worth the fight or hassle.  It is not just an issue in the culture wars; it is more widespread.  Each extreme in a debate is trying to exclude the other side and control how RTE covers stories.  The risk is that in giving in to this we will lose fresh, unheard and unique voices.  Instead, we will hear again and again from the same tired, tried and tested contributors who have been briefed, rehearsed and sanitised.</p><p> The Minister may believe the few words in the Bill to be beneath parliamentary debate, but they are the words of broadcasters.  The word &quot;offence&quot; is stifling freedom of speech and causing a chilling effect across the country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100011#J00900"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  Last July the President signed into law one of the most shameful measures taken by the Government.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 was a brutal and cynical move with one purpose - to facilitate the repossession of family homes by lenders.  The Dunne judgment was not a sustainable solution; it was a loophole found by those on the front line dealing with those in mortgage distress.  Nevertheless, it was a safeguard at a time of great distress for thousands of families whose homes were likely to be repossessed by their lenders.  Last summer Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies intentionally removed that safeguard, knowing well that they were not replacing it with any real protection for struggling families.  This week we learned of the consequences when the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform heard from AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank.  Together, these banks have issued 30,034 letters relating to repossessions and the voluntary surrender of homes, including family homes.</p><p>  The removal of the Dunne judgment was not an isolated action.  This is a Government which has overseen the revision of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to favour banks over borrowers and insisted on a personal insolvency regime which gives the banks a veto in cases in which the main debt is a mortgage on a family home.  I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is keeping the Personal Insolvency Act under ongoing review.  I hope he was listening to the CEOs of Ulster Bank and Bank of Ireland this week at the committee.  They told him and anyone else who was listening very clearly that they would veto every single personal insolvency arrangement that required them to write down mortgage debt.  He must step up and do what he said he was going to do at the time the legislation was introduced.  He said he would remove the veto from the banks if they intended to use it in all instances where write-downs were proposed on mortgage debt.  The waiting lists for MABS and civil legal aid are appalling.  When one looks at all of the measures in place, one sees that the Government has stacked the cards in favour of the banks at every opportunity.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in consulted and worked with groups working with those in mortgage distress last year when the Act we are seeking to amend was proposed.  They were unanimous in expressing alarm.  While some positive results were achieved in the original personal insolvency legislation, the Act has let the banks off the hook.  The setting of targets for resolution, coupled with the introduction of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, facilitated repossessions and sent a clear message to the banks and, by God, they took the hint, but it is not too late to wind them back in.  By passing the Bill, Members can rebalance the rules to favour the protection of the family home.  The Bill consists of two sections, both of which are about making repossession of the family home an option in only the most extreme cases.  What it is not is a free ride for anybody.  People who can pay their mortgages will still have to do so.</p><p>  The main section of the Bill contains a number of measures.  These are designed respectively to ensure a repossession process would never be rushed, all personal insolvency processes would be exhausted fully and that the initial costs of an insolvency process would be borne by the bank.  As we have seen from the scant uptake evident in the figures released by the Insolvency Service of Ireland earlier this week, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 is by no means perfect.  While it is a project in need of major overhaul, it offers a potential means to find a compromise for people in debt to allow them to keep their family homes.  By extending the adjournment period in relevant litigation to six months, the Bill would provide greater time for the insolvency process to develop and PIPs to do their jobs.  The effect of the proposed provision would be to prevent banks simply ignoring the personal insolvency process.  By extending the period of adjournments, the Bill would incentivise banks to conclude and accept arrangements rather than simply to go through the motions.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has argued and shown how we would fund public insolvency practitioners in order that clients seeking a PIP would not be subject to cherry-picking by PIPs.  We have also argued for a greater role for MABS at all stages of the process.  It is unfortunate that this has not happened.</p><p>The crux of the Bill is about empowering the court to take in a broader understanding of a repossession and, ultimately, put the burden of proof on the lender.  Section 3 maps out in a detailed way the hurdles a lender would have to clear in order that a court could be fully sure repossession was the only option.  Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) would put the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, on a legal footing.  FLAC which works with people in need of legal aid has identified the potential lack of enforceability of the code of conduct as a problem that could cause great difficulties for co-operating borrowers in distress.  The Bill would remove some of that doubt and make every bank, not just the regulated entities, subject to the code.  I was disappointed last year that, despite submissions from many groups and individuals concerned about the dilution of the CCMA, the Central Bank, with a nod from the Minister, proceeded to weaken it substantially.  It remains, however, a code that affords some protection to borrowers and at least sets a threshold of decency by which lenders must abide.  All lenders should have to abide by it.  The legislation provides that if an institution wants to repossess somebody&rsquo;s home in the State, it must at least meet this threshold.  The court would take into this account when considering any application.  This is of significant importance, given the developments of recent weeks where IBRC's mortgage loan books were sold to unregulated entities which might not have to comply with the CCMA.  There is no statutory provision for them to do so and this legislation would deal with that issue.</p><p>Section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) would introduce a reasonableness test.  The repossession of a family home resonates because of our history as a people attached to the land but often deprived of any right to it.  If an institution wants to remove a family from its home, the laws of the State should not make this something that could be done lightly.  This subsection would give the court the power to decide whether the bank or lender had acted reasonably and, if not, deny the application.  Members who have worked with constituents to help them to stay in their homes will know that reasonableness and banks can often be separate.  The reasonableness test should take into account what the PIP or homeowner has put on the table and what offer he or she has made.  Families that believe they are doing their best and have made a reasonable offer would have their day to express that opinion and the court would have to take it into account.  The homeowner would also have to be given adequate time and opportunity to appeal a rejection of a proposal by the banks.  Crucially, the court would take into account what would happen in the aftermath of any proposed repossession.  The residual debt and the bank&rsquo;s intention to deal with it would also be considered by the court at that time.  The bank would have to produce a full solution, not a partial one.  Unfortunately, every financial institution, bar one in these cases, currently repossesses homes before dealing with the residual debt at a later stage.  Bank of Ireland will chase people for the rest of their lives over that debt, which is not acceptable.  There must be an agreement at the time of repossession on what happens to the residual debt.  If the worse comes to worst, the vulnerable must be protected.  The Bill would provide that families would be given at least six months to prepare to leave their home.  If there are children, they would be given at least nine months.  Tenants in a repossessed property should have their contracts fully respected.  Tenancy agreements would have to be fulfilled by the lender taking possession of the property.  </p><p>Everyone agrees that we are not living in normal times.  The normal market rules and rules of property have been distorted by a reckless few.  Families who saved for years to buy their homes witnessed their value plummet in a short period.  In addition, a surge in the numbers who cannot find a job and billions of euro worth of cuts and taxes in budget after budget have produced a staggering crisis among people who cannot pay their mortgages.  The economic collapse and the dragging of the sovereign into the mess created by banks is a well known story.  The banks and other vulture funds cannot be allowed to pick off families in mortgage distress one by one.  We must readjust the rules and restore the protection of the family home.  We must provide leadership for those demanding it.  The Bill would go some of the way to restoring a level playing field; dispelling the arrogance of bankers on obscene wages who only see numbers on a page, not families in homes; and reversing the appalling policy of the Government of permitting the banks do what they want to whom they want.</p><p>I have discussed the legislation with the leading groups fighting for the rights of mortgage holders.  Mr. David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation stated:<blockquote>This takes a humane and practical approach by attempting to rebalance the current imbalance that exists when banks move to repossess family homes.  The proposed Bill reflects our policies and its adoption would be a significantly positive move to protect homeowners who are facing repossession.</blockquote>Mr. Ross Maguire of New Beginning stated:<blockquote>This Bill gives the courts extra power and responsibility in home repossession cases.  In particular, it does two things.  It mandates the court to be satisfied that all efforts have been made at resolution through the MARP process or the personal insolvency process before agreeing to repossession.  This would constitute a substantial safeguard for families struggling with debt.  Secondly, it forces the banks before repossession is granted to deal with the negative equity through debt write-off.  Again this would constitute a great improvement on the current system and would allow people to move on with their lives free of debt.</blockquote>I urge all Members to support the Bill as a step in keeping the thousands of families under the threat of the banks a little safer in their homes tonight and tomorrow.  I understand the Government parties will vote down this legislation.  I reiterate the figure of 30,034.  It is not a Sinn F&eacute;in figure.  It came from the chief executive officers of the four main banks in the State and is not complete because the other institutions that have not appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform are also seeking repossessions and voluntary surrender.  However, we also know that 30,000 homes will not be repossessed, but the banks told the committee they expected the number to be in the thousands.  Families will be put out of their homes and while the Bill would not prevent repossessions, it would make sure the courts had the power to consider all proposals put forward by a PIP or the mortgage holder and the bank seeking repossession had complied in a humane way with the Central Bank's code of conduct.</p><p>If the Minister for Finance has issues with the Bill, I urge that they be dealt with on Committee Stage.  People need protection and a rebalancing of the law.  Lenders who appeared before the joint committee told us they would torpedo personal insolvency agreements.  Ulster Bank and Mr. Richie Boucher, the chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, said they would veto every proposal that involved a write-down of secured debt held by their banks.  This is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation the Government enacted, nor are the 30,000 letters sent to homeowners in distress.  It is time we stepped up to the mark and rebalanced the scales in favour of the citizens we are elected to represent.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on three areas.  First, I shall respond to the Deputy's claims on what the Government has and has not done.  Second, I shall examine the progress achieved, while being very conscious of how much more needs to be done.  Third, I shall comment on the Bill and its provisions and outline the rationale for the Government's opposition thereto.  I will begin, however, in the spirit in which the Deputy concluded his contribution.  I refer to the spirit in which we seek to tackle this issue and the experience he has had in his constituency in dealing with people who face difficulties.  I encounter them daily in my constituency work.  Considerable pressure and stress have been experienced by people through no or little fault of their own in the aftermath of the crisis.  Unfortunately, what most defines the crisis for me is my meeting families who are either dealing with the stress of not being able to pay their mortgages, which is emphasised by the fact that they all want to pay them, or worried about their ability to service their mortgages in the future and facing the terror of losing the family home, in which they might have lived for some time and their children might have grown up.  Such families may live in a community in which they want to continue living.  As a constituency representative, I have first-hand experience of the strain, stress and misery experienced in these circumstances.</p><p>  Contrary to what Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, the Government has taken many measures to respond to the scale of the personal debt crisis and the vast strain it is exerting on society.  It is in this spirit that I wish to comment on the committee hearings held in recent days and which I followed.  There are two areas in which there has been significant Government intervention.  I am conscious of the strain on people and shall point to the revised measures put in place by the Central Bank.  It made very clear the quarterly targets that needed to be met in terms of the offers of sustainable mortgages and the terms on which and periods in which agreement needed to be reached.  I shall point to the measures the Central Bank stated it would implement in regard to banks if the objectives were not met.  I shall point to the progress made in putting in place personal insolvency legislation and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  The measures implemented, organisations established and legislation enacted were not in place when we began our response to the crisis that is causing significant strain.</p><p>  We put our response in place conscious of two factors.  First, we need to be able to differentiate between the considerable number of people who genuinely cannot pay because of all of the horrific changes that have taken place in the economy and the group who, for whatever reason, do not pay.  Another group about whom we must be conscious comprise the huge number of taxpayers who have put in place measures to support the banking system.  We have a duty to them to be conscious of their investment and do all we can to recognise it and ensure the taxpayer is in a position to benefit overall from what has taken place.  I am absolutely conscious of the difficulties and strain experienced by individuals and families who are unable to make mortgage repayments and worried about losing their homes.</p><p>  I have emphasised the measures the Government has put in place.  We started from a position where there was next to nothing in place.  It is not true to state the measures we have taken have had no effect.  We have seen strong signs of their having had an impact, but because we realise we need to fix the problem, we are all conscious of the progress that must still be made.</p><p>  I refer Deputy Pearse Doherty to the figures that have emerged on the mortgage restructuring that has taken place.  I am sure he is aware of them.  I am not referring to the engagement that has taken place up to the point of restructuring but to restructuring agreed to by the debtor and the creditor.  A total of 59,668 restructurings have taken place, representing an increase of 8,480 on the figure for the last quarter of 2013.  It represents an increase of 5,669 accounts since the end of January 2014.</p><p>  The number of mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days has fallen from 79,420 at the end of January to 78,210, a decrease of 1,210.  The number of temporary restructurings fell between the end of January and the end of February, indicating what we believe to be a move towards greater utilisation of the resources available and the permanent restructuring to which I have referred.</p><p>  With regard to the buy-to-let sector, engagement between consumers and lenders has led to 12,484 permanent restructurings, representing an increase of 2,336 accounts at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 and an increase on the figure from the end of January.</p><p>  I wish to contextualise the measures that have been put in place and their effect, while remaining conscious all the time of the strain being placed on people and also our determination to deal with the crisis in a sustainable manner.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in recent days, at which hearings he was present.  The Minister will be examining very carefully the contributions made by the various banks and Members of the Oireachtas at the hearings.</p><p>  The Minister has stated that the policy and way it will be implemented will be kept under continual review.  Changes, if necessary, will be made to ensure the considerable crisis we are facing will be marked by signs of improvement and that the measurers put in place will have a beneficial impact.  While the Government and I are absolutely clear that while there are welcome signs of job creation and growth in the national income, depending on its various measurements, we must make progress considering the magnitude of personal debt in the economy, its structure and impact on people and their ability to contribute to the economy and society.</p><p>  I will now comment in detail on some of the specific measures contained in the Bill.  I will do so in the order in which they arise in the Bill and Deputy Pearse Doherty has referred to them, beginning with his proposed amendment to section 2 of the 2013 Act.  He proposes that, in considering an application for possession of a principal private residence, a court would be required to adjourn proceedings for a period of at least six months.</p><p>This proposal does not take account of the additional safeguards the Minister included in the 2013 Act and which he considers already provide the court with a very broad margin of discretion when dealing with repossession applications.  The Act already allows the court to take full account of the circumstances of each individual when considering an application for repossession.  </p><p> In particular, the Act contains two safeguards which are intended to strengthen protection for borrowers in arrears.  First, section 2 provides that in repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, in other words, their home, the court may adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession.  The Act provides for an initial adjournment period not exceeding two months with the possibility of further adjournments where it considers that progress has been made on preparing a personal insolvency arrangement.  Second, section 3 of the Act provides that repossession actions in respect of principal private residences in cases where the mortgage was created prior to 1 December 2009 must now be commenced in the Circuit Court.  Of course, what this does is to put such mortgages on the same footing as housing loan mortgages created after 1 December 2009 under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  This will help reduce costs and delays for the party.  That section in the original Bill is a recognition by the Government of the value people place on their home and a recognition that where possible, everything that needs to be done to allow them to stay in their home will be done while dealing with the level of debt and potential insolvency they could face.  Section 2 of the 2013 Act allows a court of its own motion or request to adjourn proceedings to allow a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, to be considered where none have previously been attempted.  </p><p> In respect of Deputy Doherty's amendments, which would require the court to issue a series of instructions to the parties involved in the application, the point I want to emphasise is that the effect of this would be to fetter or reduce the discretion of the court in this manner.  This runs contrary to the objective that the courts be permitted to recognise and take into account the circumstances of each case in front of them.  A further aspect of this proposal is that it fails to recognise that a PIA can only be proposed through a practitioner where a debtor meets the eligibility requirements for such an arrangement and that there are sufficient funds available to make some payments to ground a proposal.  </p><p> The Deputy seeks to amend section 2(7) of the Act by inserting a definition of &quot;court&quot; to meet the Circuit Court, but that is already provided for in section 3 of the 2013 Act.</p><p> I will conclude with observations about section 3A, which Deputy Doherty wishes to insert into the 2013 Act.  Subsection 1 seeks to instruct the court to consider a number of issues when it is considering an application for an order of possession.  However, in the view of the Minister, such a proposal would seek to put limitations on the courts in dealing with such applications, which could be open to legal challenge.  In any event, section 2(3) of the 2013 already provides that when dealing with a repossession application, a court shall have regard to the conduct of the parties in any attempt to reach a solution to a mortgage arrears problem.  The Minister believes this provision provides the court with the necessary level of discretion.  </p><p> I am conscious that I am reaching the end of my time.  I will refer to some of the subsections and changes the Deputy wishes to make.  I also want to deal with a provision that would require the court to consider, where necessary, a PIA that has been rejected by creditors where the borrower has been given adequate opportunity to appeal the lender's decision to reject the proposal.  This proposal misunderstands the way in which the process operates.  It is a voluntary process and where the necessary approval of creditors cannot be obtained regarding the proposal, the process ends.  There is no appeal to the court in this regard.  However, the borrower could through his or her personal insolvency practitioner and where time permits under the protected certificate period propose a new arrangement which could meet with the approval of creditors.</p><p> Deputy Doherty would also require the court to instruct a lending institution to respect the terms of any tenancy agreement in place and to assume the responsibility of the landlord in that tenancy agreement.  This issue has already been raised during discussions on the 2013 Act, to which I have already made reference.  The Minister indicated that he would bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has responsibility in respect of residential tenancies.  My understanding is that this matter is now being considered by the Minister and the Office of the Attorney General in the context of the Residential Tenancies Bill 2012.  That Bill is awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad having passed through this House.  It is expected that any amendment on this issue would be tabled on Committee or Report Stages in the other House.  </p><p> In the response I have given, I have looked to respond to many of the main legislative proposals contained in the Deputy's Bill.  I know this is something other colleagues will be commenting on, as will the Deputy later on in the morning and I will respond to further points that will be made.  I emphasise that many of the measures in this Bill were already discussed in the context of the 2013 Act.  Some of these measures would reduce the ability of courts to take account of the specific circumstances of the families and individuals in front of them.  We believe this would be counterproductive in terms of the objectives of the Bill in the first place.  I would put all of this in the context of all of the measures that have already been put in place by the Governments in terms of the new targets and provisions for the banks and the way it is being overseen by the Central Bank and the setting up and implementing of the Insolvency Service of Ireland while making clear that these arrangements will be under continual review to ensure that the crisis of personal debt is dealt with in a sustainable manner.  </p></speech>

While struggling to make ends meet and keep their heads above water, they must now confront the real possibility that their family home might be repossessed.  This is thanks to last year's legislation from the Government dealing with the Dunne judgement.  The continued crisis represents a personal tragedy for those families caught in the mire of debt and a grave economic challenge for the country.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, which will afford a greater degree of protection to homeowners against what is in effect a home repossessions Act introduced by the Government last year.  This Bill makes a number of changes to the land conveyancing legislation introduced by the Government in 2013 to enable banks to repossess the homes of struggling homeowners across the country.  The Government's original legislation compounded the impact of a deeply flawed personal insolvency process that tilts the balance of power completely in favour of the banks at the expense of the ordinary mortgage holder.  We now need to address the impact of the Act on struggling homeowners.  </p><p>If there was any doubt about the need to legislate, those of us who had the opportunity to hear the responses from the financial institutions in recent days at the finance committee were painted the stark financial picture facing many mortgage holders and homeowners, mainly through no fault of their own.  It is right and appropriate that this legislation be given the consideration it deserves.  Given the Minister of State's response, however, it seems unlikely that the Government is of a mind to address in a real way the struggles of the families in question.</p><p> This debate over home repossessions is taking place at a time when some banks that are partially owned by the taxpayer are paying their chief executives in excess of &euro;500,000, while Government legislation removes the protection homeowners expect in order to keep the roof over their heads, which one would have thought was a basic principle.  This issue is not without complications.  Many of those whose homes will be repossessed by financial institutions will need the State to house them.  It is not as if there will not be a cost to the State in addition to the cost already borne by the taxpayer.  The Minister for Finance was somewhat disingenuous during Leaders' Questions this week when he seemed to suggest that, if the Opposition spoke out on behalf of those who were burdened by debt and whose homes were repossessed, we would be ignoring the role of the general taxpayer.  He referred to his obligation to look after the general taxpayer.  The fact of the matter is that the taxpayer has already provided the financial institutions with the capacity to meet their losses.  In doing so everyone's expectation was that the banks would be in a position to sustain a certain level of write-downs.  Deputy Pearse Doherty was right in that Bank of Ireland made it clear at a meeting of the finance committee this week that, regardless of the difference between what was owed and what would be realised in a forced sale, it would follow these families and individuals for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

I accept that Bank of Ireland is largely a private company and that the State only holds a 14% stake in it, but the State held a considerably greater portion of the bank's share capital at a time when, like other financial institutions, it was in dire straits and unable to move bonds in the international markets.  This fact seems to have been wiped from the minds of the institution's board.  That is deeply disappointing and the Minister would be well advised to address this issue in the course of his discussions with the bank which could have been in a perilous state were it not for the decision of the then Government to take a significant shareholding in it.  The bank has been able to tidy up its balance sheet more quickly than other institutions, which is welcome and in everyone's interests, but to place an intolerable burden on the shoulders of homeowners who must vacate their homes for one reason or another is not acceptable.  There must be some repayment capacity beyond which the individuals concerned would not be expected to continue paying.  There must be light at the end of the tunnel for people who will no longer be homeowners but will still be burdened by that debt for a significant time.  There must be a watershed, be it five or six years.  Through general bankruptcy, larger individuals and companies are able to get out of debt after a set period.  We must re-examine the issue.</p><p>In previous debates on the annual salary of Bank of Ireland's CEO, a matter that arose again this week, the Minister had an opportunity to show some solidarity with and understanding of the position of beleaguered homeowners.  When asked about the State's voting position on the CEO's remuneration at Bank of Ireland's forthcoming AGM, he simply replied: &quot;The State has 14% of Bank of Ireland.  How we vote on this issue at the AGM does not matter.  It is going to go through anyway...&quot;.  This <i>laissez-faire </i>approach encompasses the Government's dismissive attitude towards struggling homeowners.</p></speech>

How can they possibly believe the State is looking our for their best interests and how are they expected to place any faith in or avail of the mechanisms being put in place by the State to address this crisis?  Often, the tone can be set by a Government comment or position, even though it may not be in a position to force a particular outcome.  It is a little like being in opposition with a relatively small number of Deputies, in that one could take the attitude that because of the size of the Government's majority, one could walk away and let it do what it wishes.  However, that is not the approach generally taken by Opposition parties.  I want the Minister for Finance to do likewise and at least set out a Government viewpoint, instead of taking the view that it can do nothing about something.  Often, a sentiment expressed can deliver a message in a way that is far greater than one's voting rights.</p><p>  Statistics published by the Central Bank on 4 March indicated that, of the 764,000 mortgages on primary residences, approximately 136,500 were in arrears on 31 December 2013, with in excess of 96,000, some 12%, in arrears for more than 90 days.  Almost 31,000 mortgages secured on buy-to-let properties were also in arrears more than 90 days, representing approximately 21% of all residential mortgage loans secured on buy-to-let properties.  Of most concern is the number of accounts in arrears for more than 720 days, which increased by approximately 1,700 in the last quarter of 2013, pushing more homeowners closer to eventual repossession.  These statistics are exacerbated by the mortgage restructuring arrangements agreed to by banks to date with distressed borrowers.  They have largely been of a short-term nature, with almost half being interest-only or less than interest-only.  Put simply, these problems have been temporarily brushed under the carpet.</p><p>  In their evidence this week the financial institutions have claimed that the current phase of restructuring is not contemplating these temporary proposals but more sustainable solutions involving capital repayments, the extension of mortgages life cycles, etc.  What is not clear is the capacity of borrowers to meet these commitments, given the effect of any slight increase in interest rates, individual shocks or, particularly on the buy-to-let side, a continuation of the current level of rental income.  There is no doubt that, as the property sector starts to show some confidence again and the banks start to lend in the more traditional way, a greater number of housing units will appear on the market, which will affect rental returns.  Although arrangements are being made, I am not aware of any exercise that has extrapolated how they will perform in the future.  I accept that the banks are trying to get deals in place, but I am concerned about their long-term viability.</p><p>  The crisis has entered a new phase, one of repossessions, untold misery and a complete abandonment by the State of its citizens in their hour of need.  No amount of half-hearted measures or spinning of figures will distract struggling homeowners from their daily reality.  The much-lauded personal insolvency regime has failed to attract sufficient numbers to inspire any confidence in its ability to act as a remedy for the crisis being experienced by thousands of householders.  This is against a backdrop of despair for struggling families who are simply asking for a working mechanism to relieve them of financial hardship and an economy that needs a real solution to the never-ending cycle of unsustainable debt.</p><p>The process has been fatally undermined by the fact that banks have an effective veto in the debt negotiations.  The entire process is fundamentally flawed as, at its heart, it has no commitment to be independent and impartial.  Instead of being an independent arbiter, the appeals mechanism the Government has created gives the banks a veto in making progress in tackling debt.  The very institutions which brought the country and its people to the brink are now judge and jury over families' prospects of staying in their homes.  The very people the personal insolvency regime professes to help have recognised its folly and voted with their feet.</p><p> The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act which the Bill aims to amend is yet another step in the direction of placing additional power in the hands of the banks.  If they wield their powerful veto over any arrangement, homeowners will be left with only the final desperate option of filing for bankruptcy to save themselves.  They will also face the very real prospect of losing the family home.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 was sweeping legislation, reforming many aspects of land law, including ownership trusts, co-ownership, conveyancing and - this is relevant to the Bill - mortgages.  The purpose in doing so was to simplify existing land law which stretched back to feudal times and to enable the introduction of e-conveyancing.  The legislation was the result of a detailed Law Reform Commission project under Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and Professor John Wyle.  The project began in 2003, with the Bill being introduced in the Oireachtas in 2006, with all party support.  Mortgages were not part of the major overhaul of a complex set of laws.  </p><p> A wave of unjustifiable home repossessions across the country cannot be tolerated in any shape or form.  Legislation from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which facilitated such an outcome would be to the eternal shame of legislators in this House.  Home ownership is of intrinsic importance to the well-being of the individual and the family.  Struggling homeowners need help.  To ask a large proportion of the population to participate in economic recovery when their primary concern is to stay in their homes does not make sense.  The social and economic fall-out from repossession is simply unimaginable.  Government indifference on this matter has prolonged the pain for struggling homeowners.  Behind every single mortgage statistic is an individual or a family blighted by worry and uncertainty.  Plain and simple, the people concerned need protection; they should not be left at the mercy of banks which the Government is allowing to act as they please.</p></speech>

That was the judgment that meant no bank could take possession of any house.  It is regrettable that the judgment needed to be reversed, but the harsh reality is that if banks were not able to take possession of a property on which money was secured, there would be no future mortgage market in this country or it would be treated as unsecured lending, in which case mortgages would have 10%, 12% or 13% interest rates attached.  Unfortunately, Part 1 of the Act is a necessary evil.  However, it needs to be balanced with an obligation on behalf of the State and the banks on how and when possession is taken.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act is essentially a version of the Family Home Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I introduced in 2011.  It allows a judge, for the first time in the history of the State, when dealing with an appeal from a bank for possession, to consider a wide range of new criteria never before considered.  The judge may adjourn proceedings, if that is considered appropriate, to allow for consultation with a personal insolvency practitioner and may instruct the personal insolvency practitioner to make a proposal.  Further, the judge may consider whether the mortgager, that is, the bank, has participated in any process relating to mortgage arrears and whether the borrower has made any payment to the bank.  Critically, the judge may consider the conduct of all parties before the court.  The Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, described this change as significant.  I developed that legislation with Mr. Ross Maguire, senior counsel, and I am very happy that it passed into law.  </p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill would add several criteria to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  It would allow a judge to adjourn proceedings for six months rather than the current period of three months; to insist on parties engaging in an insolvency process; to insist on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears being adhered to; and, critically, to refuse to grant permission unless the bank, the vulture fund or whoever owns the mortgage, had exhausted every reasonable option other than possession.  The Bill would further allow the judge to insist on the residual debt being dealt with as part of the possession order and direct that evicted families be given sufficient time to find a new home.  In the context of what is going on in this country, every single one of these proposals would be a fair and reasonable change to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  </p><p>  The Government has set targets for the banks.  It has told them that if they do not make a certain number of offers of sustainable restructures by certain dates, they will be penalised financially.  At the time, with others, I said these targets were not only misplaced but would also be very damaging and that they were only one part of the solution.  The Government has focused on the quantity of offers made, but it has done nothing about the quality of these offers or the consistency, or rather the complete lack of consistency, of these offers not only between banks but within individual banks.  What is the reality of a Government that is insisting on banks hitting targets on quantity, targets they can define?  Let us remember, the banks are allowed to define what is deemed to be a sustainable offer.  What has happened?  We heard really shocking testimony this week.  The four banks that appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform estimated that there would be around 6,500 evictions, based on the mortgages under consideration thus far.  This estimate does not include any of the other unsustainable mortgages which they still have to examine.  It does not include any of the mortgages which are unsustainable but still not in arrears and does not consider any institution beyond the four banks that appeared before the committee.  As we know, there are many other banks and funds in the country, with a further two from America which are debt specialists.</p><p>  What else do we know?  We now know that the banks are vetoing insolvency service proposals.  The insolvency legislation had promise, but it was neutered by giving the banks a veto.  About 50 protective certificates have been issued to date, in the context of 175,000 mortgages in arrears.  Mr. Richie Boucher, the chief executive of Bank of Ireland, told the committee yesterday that it would veto any proposal that involved any write-down of secured debt.</p></speech>

Four out of every ten of these so-called offers actually represent legal proceedings, while another 10% are so-called assisted voluntary sales.  Let us remember that some of these assisted voluntary sales may be exactly that, but I will tell the House what a lot of the others are.  They involve the bank giving customers two options, the first of which is to agree to leave the house and the bank will sell it or else it will evict the mortgage holder and charge an additional &euro;10,000 in legal fees.  Let us not forget that these so-called assisted voluntary sales are not always such.  Therefore, 40% represent legal proceedings, while 10% are so-called assisted voluntary sales, representing half of the offers made so far.  A further 35% of the offers made so far actually increase the total payments that borrowers will make to banks over the life time of the loan.  These include interest-only arrangements, term extensions and recapitalisation of arrears.  All of these propose to solve the problem of unsustainable debt by increasing that debt.  About 15% or three in every 20 offers made to date by the banks that appeared before the Oireachtas committee this week involve reducing the payment burden on the family.  That is the reality in not insisting on quality.  That is the reality of a Government which has stated, &quot;We will set targets, but you know best.  You go off and deal with your borrowers on a case by case basis.&quot;</p><p>What could possibly go wrong with allowing a few banks in Ireland to determine what should happen in a mortgage market?</p><p> We are seeing complete inconsistency in terms of how the different banks are engaging with their customers.  Bank of Ireland deserves special mention in this regard.  The legal proceeding numbers its representatives brought before the committee this week were twice as high as those of some of the other banks and four times as high as the figure for Permanent TSB.  Bank of Ireland's split mortgage product is a joke.  It involves breaking the mortgage in two and charging the same interest rate on both halves.  One half of the loan will reduce as the customer pays the capital down, but the other half will increase because the capital on that portion is not being serviced.  The Bank of Ireland delegates had straight faces as they told us yesterday that splitting a loan in half and charging the same interest rate on both pieces is actually a solution to an unsustainable mortgage.  The reason those four men could look us in the face and make that claim is because this Government is letting them away with it.  They are being allowed to come in here and laugh at all of us.  I assure the Minister of State that after the past three days of committee hearings, that is exactly what they are doing.  It is what they did six months ago and six months before that.</p><p> In fairness to some of the banks and some of the people working there, real efforts are being made to address this issue.  It certainly is not a case of a curse on all their houses, but Bank of Ireland stands out in all of this.  When its delegates told the committee yesterday that they were willing to write down unsecured debt, I asked them about situations where there is residual debt after a sale.  Say, for example, a family which owes the bank &euro;300,000 is evicted and their home is sold for &euro;200,000.  I pointed out that the remaining &euro;100,000 is, by definition, unsecured debt and must be accounted for as such on Bank of Ireland's books.  Was the bank saying that it is prepared to write down debt in those situations?  The delegates responded that because the outstanding amount used to be attached to a security, it would continue to be treated as such.  They basically acknowledged that if they are so inclined, they will follow people to the grave for that money.  We should bear in mind too that the outstanding debt of &euro;100,000 will be liable for interest at 5% per year.  In other words, it will cost a family in that situation &euro;5,000 per year just to keep its debt to Bank of Ireland at &euro;100,000.</p><p> We know that mortgages are being sold to vulture funds and it seems those funds are being allowed to pick and choose which loans they take.  When a special liquidator told me and members of the media that Lone Star and Oak Tree were not being allowed to pick any performing mortgages, we asked for confirmation in writing that this was the case.  That produced a change in the story.  The written confirmation I have is that Lone Star and Oak Tree did buy all the non-performing loans but also some performing loans.  Moreover, the anecdotal evidence we have from mortgage holders is that performing loans that are in equity have been taken by Lone Star and Oak Tree, while performing loans in negative equity are going to the National Asset Management Agency.  We have a situation, therefore, where United States-based debt specialists are apparently choosing performing loans with equity and charging variable rates on those loans.  I am not referring here to a single variable rate; I am saying that these entities are operating on a loan-by-loan, family-by-family basis, ratcheting up the interest rate as they see fit.  If and when a family says it simply has no more money to give, that is not a problem because there is equity in the house and the family can simply be evicted.</p><p> These entities are completely unregulated.  The Minister has said that if, in his view, these vulture funds are not obeying the code of conduct for mortgage arrears, he will introduce legislation to regulate them.  That is an extraordinary position to take.  It is like saying it is illegal to burgle all of these houses but not illegal to burgle those houses over there, but if we find that a lot of burglars are breaking into the second set of houses we will make it illegal to do so.  What an absolutely preposterous position to take.</p><p> There are 175,000 mortgages in arrears in this country.  Let us assume there is approximately that number again in pre-arrears, that is, people who are doing everything they can to avoid joining the 175,000 already in arrears.  That combined figure equates to some 1 million men, women and children who are directly affected by this situation.  It does not take account of the impact on parents or siblings who are helping their loved ones out or the impact on workplaces where, inevitably, people cannot bring their very best to their job because they are worried about whether or not they will have a home to go to at the end of the day.</p><p> The mortgage crisis in Ireland has been going on for six years.  We are the only country in the world to have allowed it to continue on such a scale for so long.  No other country has so spectacularly cocked up its mortgage market.  The situation continues as it is because of Government inaction and because the Government is in thrall to the banks and the markets.  We need a strategy to deal with the tens and thousands of men, women and children, according to the banks' own figures, who will be kicked out of their homes.  We need legislation that mandates a range of solutions for borrowers.  The question of whether one gets kicked out of one's home and whether one has money to invest in one's future and that of one's children must not come down to whether it is Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Permanent TSB , Oak Tree, Pepper, Apollo or Danske Bank knocking on one's door.  It is about ensuring there is equal and fair treatment under law.</p><p> The Government should accept this excellent Bill, which goes right to the heart of the power imbalance between citizens in distress and the banks they bailed out.  I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on bringing forward a timely, thoughtful and targeted legislative proposal.</p></speech>

I am fortunate to have no personal experience of having to go through this awful process.  The Minister of State referred to his constituency workload and the number of people who have sought his advice on this matter.  For every elected representative, it is an issue that is continually arising.  Indeed, housing is probably the greatest single source of difficulty for people at this time.  This Bill represents a fair and reasonable compromise for addressing some of these issues.  There is a responsibility on everybody elected to this House to legislate for the positive changes we undertook to introduce.</p><p>  The finance committee heard this week that the four main banks have issued 30,034 letters relating to repossessions and voluntary surrenders.  It is a frightening figure.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly pointed out that 175,000 mortgages are already in distress.  Moreover, as he pointed out, the actual figure is probably significantly higher.  Deputy Timmy Dooley would probably say that a lot has been done and a lot more needs to be done.  The Minister of State is saying that his Government has brought forward legislation to try to fix the problem.</p><p>  However, the number of families who are coming to us seeking help shows the problem is not fixed and there is very little clarity.  At a public meeting in Rathfarnham which I organised with one of our local candidates, Sarah Holland, people waited until the end of the meeting to speak to us privately about the difficulties they are experiencing.  Many of them referred to a lack of support, clarity and a pathway to resolution.  The lack of equality in the system as between lender and borrower and the lack of engagement by the former were a source of concern.  Other people at the meeting were not in a mortgage arrears situation but were asking how they might secure social housing or get on the rental accommodation scheme.  That was the picture of the housing situation that emerged from the meeting.</p><p>In St. Dominic's in Tallaght the local candidate in the European Parliament elections, Lynn Boylan, was present.  Those present who had been through the system spoke about their experiences.  Deputy Pearse Doherty was also present and outlined what was included in the Bill.  People revealed intimate details of the mountain they had to climb.  Options were outlined and reference was made to various groups that could help in dealing with the situation.  Others said they had gone to the groups but they had not been of any help either and asked to whom they could turn.  They go to meetings hoping to pick up information that might shine a light, indicate some way to help them to get away from the mountain of debt or find a mechanism by which they could solve the problem.</p><p> We are not living in normal times.  The housing market is not normal.  There is a shortage of houses in Dublin.  The worry is that more and more houses will be put up for sale and that the only ones who will come out on top again are the banks that originally gave the mortgages.  Many perceive the banks as having created a significant part of the crisis.  There is no comfort in the Bill for borrowers who do not make an attempt to pay back their loans or engage in the process.  The priority of the Bill is to keep people in their homes and protect the family home.  Let us consider the options for those who lose their homes.  From experience we know that social housing is not an option in Dublin.  The waiting time for such housing in the Dublin City Council area is nine years and probably longer.  In South Dublin County Council it is probably eight years.</p><p> Rents are increasing and there is great difficulty in the rental market.  The rent supplement scheme is not fit for purpose in the Dublin area as it does not meet existing demands.  The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, also has many problems, especially in the case of large families.  I recently dealt with a family with five children who are not allowed to rent a three-bedroom house as it would be considered to be overcrowded.  They are being put out of their home on that basis.  Their options are to move into a hostel, bed and breakfast accommodation or a hotel.  They are currently in a three-bedroom house but require a four-bedroom house because of their size.  However, the option offered by the State is to force them into one bedroom or, possibly, avail of the dormitory option in a hostel, a hotel room or one bedroom in bed and breakfast accommodation.  The system cannot adapt to meet the need and no compromise appears to be available.</p><p> The Government signed the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act into law which removed legal protection for the family home.  We all accept that the protection offered was not ideal.  It was blanket protection based on a legal loophole.  Nevertheless, by removing it without a sufficient legal replacement the Government was consciously &ndash; or perhaps unconsciously - opening the door to more repossessions.  That has been the result of the legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is more than familiar with the figures for the letters sent by the banks.  The family home requires extra protection and that is the direction in which the Bill points us.  We must level the playing field between the banks and homeowners by making repossession of the family home a less attractive option for the banks.  We must equalise the situation and ensure greater equality between homeowners and the banks.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s aim is that the banks should take certain information into account on a statutory basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, said this would fetter the courts in some way in adjudicating on the matter.  The aim of the Bill is to set parameters and send a signal to the courts about what we want to happen.  We want the courts to consider all options.  From the information we have received, we are aware this might happen in some cases but not in others.  That is the difficulty.  The Bill would set parameters for the courts, but it would also create a balance.  It would make it compulsory for the courts to consider whether the lender had complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which had been put on a clear legal basis for the first time.  The Bill would empower the courts to perform a reasonableness test on whether the banks had exhausted all possible options, including whether it had declined any proposal from a personal insolvency practitioner and complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

In the event of repossession a family must be given a six-month period to arrange their affairs or nine months if they have children.  We are trying to be family friendly and pro the borrower who is in the situation through no fault of his or her own.  The people affected did not create the crisis.  Many of them were in sustainable jobs which they thought would be for life, but, unfortunately, we are aware of what happened.  It is important to make the vulture funds that have taken over some of the loan books comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p><p>  In addition to support from politicians, support is available for the Bill from some of the groups dealing with the issue on a day-to-day basis.  New Beginnings welcomed the Bill.  Mr. Ross Maguire said it would give the courts extra powers of responsibility in home repossession cases.  He said it would two things: it would mandate the court to be satisfied that all efforts had been made to find a resolution through the MAR process or the personal insolvency process before agreeing to repossession.  He said this would constitute a substantial safeguard for families struggling with debt.  Second, it would force the banks to deal with the issue of negative equity through a debt write-off before repossession was granted.</p><p>  The Bill contains many positives.  It is disappointing that the Government cannot agree to move it forward.  There is a problem, regardless of whether the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, accepts it.  I believe he does accept that there is a problem, but he said the Bill would not solve it.  Let us see the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  It is clear that the law, as it stands, is not working for everyone and that we need to broaden it.  If the Government does not accept the Bill, surely it must bring an amendment before the House to put something else in place.  Perhaps the Minister of State might give an indication of what the Government is planning to do to help families and safeguard the family home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100018#Q01000"><p>I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for bringing forward the Bill.  It was alluded to by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and a few other Members that, as elected representatives, we owed it to people to be concerned about the crisis.  I am shocked that there is not one other person from the Government parties present, except the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  It is shocking.  A total of 175,000 people across the country are in deep mortgage distress and just over 30,000 face legal action and dispossession, not repossession.  The people who borrowed the money own the houses.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State if he appreciates the shame of this.  I did something I should not have done, and I apologise through you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the protocols of the House.  I wanted to be helpful to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he was taking Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business yesterday.  I have here a paper that shows - from the balance sheets of all Irish-owned banks and building societies back in 2008, combined with the mathematics of limitation through fractional reserve banking and carrying that through the process of the creation of money - that the credit crisis that occurred may have been caused by the boards of directors of the banks, and probably to a lesser extent by the regulators.  That is the reality.  The boards of banks have a fiduciary duty to carry out a fractional reserve policy with the funds that they are licensed to take from depositors.  The question is why.  If one does not keep the creation of loans to within 100% of the deposits one takes in, with the addition of derivatives and other financial instruments, one creates limitless credit - a Ponzi scheme.  Directors who participate, knowingly or unknowingly, in that are guilty of it.  Asset price bubbles cannot occur without credit bubbles.  It is physically impossible.  One cannot make bread without flour, and one cannot make an asset price bubble without credit or cash.  If one goes to the printing presses one gets the Weimar Republic.  That is why this paper is so important.  There are four pages in it, and I am glad they are in the hands of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  The Minister quips about a lot of things.  The newspapers quipped that he had passed the paper over to one of his officials, saying "Put that in the bottom drawer."  I suggest that he change that instruction and get it right on top of his desk.  I will also present the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, with a copy of the paper afterwards.</p><p> It can be shown that the weighted average loan-to-deposit ratio of Irish-owned banks in 2008, when the music stopped, was 173%.  The two big banks were, respectively, Bank of Ireland, at 158%, and AIB, at 155%.  They provide most of the weighting in the 173% figure.  One does not get to that position in the click of a finger; it takes a few years.  Given the result, the boards of banks must not have had any fractional reserve policy.  The loan-to-deposit ratio of 158% in the case of Bank of Ireland exceeded 90%, which is the time-honoured and time-tested anchor - the healthy position - by 68 percentage points.  Sixty-eight percent as a proportion of 90% - the anchor - is 75%.  Therefore, it is mathematically evident from the balance sheet that Bank of Ireland had 75% responsibility for creating the asset price bubble.</p><p> The credit that was advanced to the 175,000 customers with mortgages from the banks, including Bank of Ireland, went into a pyramid or Ponzi scheme - a credit bubble and an asset bubble.  It was not their fault when the music stopped and the asset price collapsed by 50%.  Seventy-five percent of that 50% collapse is for the account of Bank of Ireland.  In the case of AIB, on the same basis, it is 72%.  That is not my opinion; it is a fact.  This paper was handed to the previous Government on 17 September 2009, the day after the NAMA listings for the different banks were produced in this House.  I know that because I provided them and had been working on an analysis of the six banks' balance sheets at that stage.  </p><p> One may ask how this is relevant to the 175,000 people hurting or the 30,000 facing letters from their banks.  The problem is that, to use an analogy, they are like the leaves on the trees.  They are scorched, distressed, in pain and in some cases taking their own lives.  In addition, their children are taking their own lives.  We read about the problem of bullying on Facebook, which happens when there is stress in households.  It does not occur in healthy, stress-free households.  I am not talking about privileged people with advantages and middle-class existences.  When that healthy situation disappears because of the destruction of asset prices with the residual debt still there, one has distress in households which may once have been calm and composed.  It is often those children who are doing the Internet bullying who take their lives.  It is all part of a societal atmosphere. </p><p> I am mentioning these matters because I was not afforded time to do so at the hearing of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday with Bank of Ireland.  I put this to the bank's representatives and gave them this paper to consider.  In light of this truth, what would their parents think of some of the decisions they are making on a case-by-case basis?  I am helping out some people and I know that in some cases the banks are entirely incompetent in dealing with what they call a sustainable solution.  I have 20 years' working experience in recoveries and restructuring, so I know what is involved.  In each case, as with a sickness or disease, there is really only one answer.  At the committee hearings the bank representatives said they had several options for each individual case, but there was only one correct option.  In the case of a sick person, there is usually one - or maybe two - antibiotics that will address the situation.</p><p> The Government took this the wrong way around and did not measure the scale of the problem.  Back in September 2009, I warned everybody to watch out.  I said there would be losses of &euro;65 billion on commercial land bank and development property investment holding loans.  I also said there would be another &euro;35 billion of losses in mortgage loans.  That is a total of &euro;100 billion.  Yet they laughed at me and a few others.  Because I had been doing this sort of work, I knew it was discernible that there was a credit bubble building up if turbo-charged lending in six Irish banks rose from a level of &euro;200 billion in loans, which is what they had had three and a half to four years earlier, to &euro;400 billion in 2008.  That was &euro;200 billion of turbo-charged lending in a credit and asset price bubble, so it was a certainty that &euro;100 billion would need to be written off.  That is when the grown-ups should have said &quot;We must get a handle on this.&quot;</p><p> I will cite an example that I mentioned to Mr. Richie Boucher yesterday.  At the joint committee yesterday I was given five minutes out of four hours because I voted according to my conscience on a different Bill, so I lost my position on the committee.  I ask the Minister of State to please get me reinstated on that committee, because there is too much stuff that needs to be contributed in a meaningful way.  To be given five minutes at the end of four hours is nothing short of absurd.  The previous day, I got five minutes at the end of three hours.  </p><p> I know all the witnesses who attended yesterday's meeting, including Mr. Richie Boucher, Mr. Fergus Murphy and Mr. David Duffy, from my professional background.  They wondered why I was only given a five-minute contribution at the end of four hours, so I explained why that was the position.  They would have expected me to have at least an equal amount of time to others on the committee.  It is just not right.</p><p> I will finish quickly with a few things.  Bank of Ireland has a provision of 8.8% against its total loan book of &euro;92 billion.  Ulster Bank's losses and provisions are 32%, while AIB's are 18.5%.  We are led to believe that Bank of Ireland is tickety-boo.</p><p>It is public knowledge that on 31 July 2011 Mr. Wilbur Ross and his associates invested, along with others, &euro;1.1 billion into Bank of Ireland for 35% of the bank.  Given that it was 10 cent per share this meant every 1% of the bank at the time was worth - I have the figures before me and I will be quick - &euro;31 million.  Each 1% that they bought cost them &euro;31 million.  Recently, Wilbur Ross and Prem Watsa sold 6.4% of their holding, which cost them &euro;201 million.  An amount of &euro;31 million by 6.4% in shares comes to &euro;201 million.  The sale proceeds were &euro;690 million, representing a profit of &euro;489 million.  They were left with 12.8% of the bank, which cost &euro;402 million.  I do not believe the market value but the market price is based on small numbers of transactions.  Anyway, the market value is &euro;1.38 billion.  The valuation uplift of their remaining shareholding is &euro;978 million or, let us say, &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

Let us go back to my first example.  The bank caused the asset price bubble collapse.  In total, 75% of &euro;2.4 billion is &euro;1.8 billion.  There are many customers in distress with families sick and disease taking their lives at different age groups.  This is their distress yet the bank has the arrogance and temerity to insist on collecting in full with no write-down this &euro;1.8 billion, a figure which, in turn, equals the Wilbur Ross figures.  It is unbelievable.  One man, remote in America, who comes over here for board meetings can dictate the policy.  The policy holds that the bank will not do any write-downs even though the bank caused the asset price bubble and collapse and it insists on taking all the loans back.  It is so wrong and unfair it is unbelievable.  "But Mr. Mathews..." - I am sorry, I should not do that-----</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher maintains the bank has a policy.  I asked him about the policy on fractional reserving for the five years leading up to it.  We did not hear anything about that.  An appropriate policy would have kept everyone's deposits safe.  It would have ensured that there were no stupid loans and no asset bubble because we cannot have an asset bubble without a credit bubble.  That is why the reports of Watson, Regling, Nyberg and Honohan were irrelevant because they did not identify the real problem and concentrated only on the guarantee.  As any honourable banker knows, the only thing that needed to be guaranteed was deposits because bonds have a maturity and cannot be called on until the maturity arises.</p><p>  In that regard I reminded-----</p></speech>

Does the House know what the bank's bonds in issue amounted to on the balance sheet?  I am referring to senior secured bonds in 2008.  Mr. Boucher could not remember but I reminded him.  There was &euro;61 billion, almost half Ireland's national income, waiting for redemption soon after 2008.  How did the bank redeem them, because the bank was on a life-support system and no one really understood what was going on?  The Government was clueless and the Department of Finance did not have a clue.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;61 billion was redeemed.  Everyone was beginning to recognise that all the Irish banks were as bust as a few of us had been saying.  How did they get the money to pay back all these bonds?  They got it from the euro system and emergency liquidity assistance.  This is why I keep battening on and why I continue to ask the Government to batten on to try to get some credit or loan capitalisation for the banks.  Why?  If the banks had enough capital they would actually be writing down the loans.</p><p>  The strange thing is that Wilbur Ross or his associates know that they will have to do it soon and that there will be further provisioning, because the bank is out of line with the others at 8.8% provisioning.  When the bank does that, I anticipate, as opposed to speculate, that the share price will drop when they decide they must do it.  When the price does drop, the speculators will come in and buy more Bank of Ireland shares but they will be buying into a good bank because it will have made the provisions.</p><p>  They are throwing bones to everyone in three and four-hour hearings and so on.  The real problem is not out on the leaves, although it is for those who are out in the leaves in households, those burning in agony and so on.  However, the way to cure the problem is to look at the roots and the nourishment required by the tree.  What health is the bank in?  The banks need more creditor or euro system capital.

Ordinarily, when loopholes in law are closed off it is deemed to be a good thing because the presumption is that a loophole in law is a negative and needs to be remedied or addressed.  However, last July when the Government signed into law the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, that was far from the case.  As we know, the legal loophole from the judgment of Ms Justice Dunne had given, if by default, a level of protection to the family home.</p><p>  Other contributors have referred to hearings in recent days in which the banks have come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to report and check in with us on the targets set by the Government in respect of distressed loans and mortgage distress.  As we have heard already, the four main banks have issued over 30,000 letters relating to repossessions and voluntary surrender.  That is shocking, is it not?  When they were before the committee previously we heard other figures that were shocking.  We have now an established pattern of behaviour by the banks.  It is important to state as much for the record.</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, and his colleagues in government often challenge the Opposition to bring forward positive proposals.  They tell us repeatedly to bring forward good ideas and maintain they will examine and consider them.  Not only that, many colleagues of the Minister of State insist that they will realise them.</p><p>  In simple terms, what the Minister of State has before him today is a series of good ideas.  Let us go through them to clarify the position.  It is a good and necessary idea to level the playing field between banks and homeowners and to make home repossession a most unattractive option and one of absolute last resort for the banks.  We can all agree that is a good idea.  It is a good idea to increase to six months from two months the length of time a court can adjourn a case to allow for the personal insolvency process to proceed.  That is simply a matter of common sense and would represent better practice.  It is a good idea to empower a judge to force parties to engage in an insolvency process and to force the banks to cover the costs.  It is a good idea, in these traumatic circumstances, to insist that a process is undergone and to insist that the bank, given the disparity of wealth and power, will pick up the costs.  It is a good idea to make it compulsory for courts to consider whether the lender has complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It is a very good and necessary idea to put that code on a legal basis.</p><p>That, too, makes sense.  It is a good idea to empower the courts to perform a reasonableness test to check out, in other words, whether the banks have really exhausted all other options and to examine and to know whether a particular bank has declined any proposal from a personal insolvency practitioner and, as I said earlier, whether the banks have complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Those are all necessary checks.</p><p> In my opinion the best idea of all contained in my colleague's legislation is to ensure that before any repossession is ordered by a court, that an arrangement is in force to deal with the residual debt.  That is not just a good idea but it is a great idea and it is very necessary.  It is a must-do.</p><p> It is a good idea in the very traumatic event of a repossession of the family home to give a six-month period to families or nine months in the case where there are children or minors in the family, to allow families to organise their affairs.  That is a matter of the most basic decency that we could legislate for.  It is also a good idea and a necessary idea to ensure that vulture funds that have taken over some of the loan books should comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears if they are seeking a repossession.  </p><p> I challenge the Minister of State and any member of the Government, notwithstanding the smart-aleck comment of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning, to identify for me which of those is not a good idea.  I rather suspect that the Minister of State would recognise all of those as positives.  I ask why the Government would not therefore support this legislation.  I did not hear the earlier comments but I am advised that a list of all the wonders of this Government in response to the debt crisis and to mortgage distress was yet again read into the record of the House.  That is fair enough if the Minister of State wishes to fly the flag and to assert what he sees as the positive progress.  What we actually need is a response to the proposals contained in this legislation.  People who find themselves in these awful circumstances need to have something that genuinely works.  The Minister of State and I share a constituency and we have been elected from the same communities, broadly speaking.  He will know as well as I know that families are deeply frustrated.  Many of them are at the point of despair that any of this would be dealt with in a meaningful way.  For many families it seems that it is a case of, &quot;heads, you lose; tails, you lose&quot;.  The measures introduced by the Government which were introduced, I believe, in good faith, amid a lot of fanfare, have not delivered the kind of results at the pace required.  That is a bald statement of fact.  My colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, referred to public meetings that he and others from Sinn F&eacute;in had organised and attended.  He spoke of the human stories that are related at those meetings.  I am very sure that it is not just Opposition Deputies who are hearing those narratives; I am sure that everybody elected to this place and to the Seanad has heard similar stories.  The question arises as to what we as legislators do about it.  I do not think on this issue - as with many others - that a Government that simply bats things back or has a sense of holding the fort to protect its own prestige because they are the ones who govern, and would reject legislation like this - that this a good day out for Irish political life nor is it an approach that is appreciated by the citizens who elect us.</p><p> I refer to those organisations that deal daily with individuals and families faced with mortgage distress and potential repossession.  I instance Ross Maguire of New Beginning who says, &quot;This Bill gives protection to all borrowers regardless of the lender.  It will mean that borrowers whose loans have been sold to vulture funds are equally protected and that is to be greatly welcomed.&quot;  I refer also to David Hall, the director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Association,  who calls the Bill a humane and practical approach attempting to rebalance the current imbalance that exists when banks move to repossess family homes.  Those are the voices and words from those organisations in the front line who deal with these scenarios every day.  Unlike us, their organisations intervene to try to give a level of resolution to families in these circumstances.  They support this legislation.  The big question for me is why the Government will not support it.  If the Government does not support it, I ask it not to aggravate the Opposition further with the constant refrain of: &quot;Ye never come up with anything positive and if you do, we will support it.&quot;  Here is a series of great ideas and an excellent Bill, a good piece of legislation and I challenge the Minister of State and the Government to give it the support it deserves.</p></speech>

In reply to Deputy McDonald, I do not know whose contribution she was listening to this morning but she was not listening to mine.  I made it very clear that I am acutely aware of the strain this is causing people because I meet them so regularly.  I am acutely aware of their difficulties.  When I was outlining the Government's actions I did so in the framework that while progress has been made in some areas we are deeply conscious of the magnitude of the crisis and how much remains to be done.  We have put in place a framework to respond to this crisis that is showing some important signs of progress but we are conscious of the strain on people.

I emphasised the figures at the beginning of my contribution and I will emphasise them again.  These figures show the engagement and the agreements reached to date.  A total of 59,668 agreements have been made which is an increase of just under 8,500 compared to the situation at the end of last year.  The people for whom restructuring arrangements have not been agreed who bought properties at a time when neither the property market nor the banks were being regulated, made decisions in very good faith and with the best information available to them.  We are doing our best to respond.</p><p>  I will deal with the points made by various speakers.   </p><p> Deputy Timmy Dooley highlighted the various things which could cause a further deterioration of the position on mortgages.  It is worth pointing out that there are a number of factors which could materialise and improve the position in the context of what might happen in the real economy.  Not least among them is people's ability to be paid more for the work they do.</p><p> Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly stated we focused on quantity as opposed to quality.  If we had not set targets in the context of the response to the crisis, Opposition Deputies would be in a position to pose legitimate questions as to why we had not done so.  The targets were set in order that we might respond to the crisis.  If they are not met, sanctions can be imposed on the banks.</p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe was correct to point out that we were already experiencing huge difficulties in the provision of social housing.  He also referred to the position on waiting lists, a matter of which I am aware.  He made a further point - I am surprised others did not raise it - about the difficulties people were continuing to experience in identifying a single individual with their bank who had responsibility for dealing with them on an ongoing basis.  Some banks are operating well in this regard, while others continue to fail to meet their obligations.

In the context of his analysis to the effect that an asset price bubble can only happen when there is a credit bubble, I must point out that lack of supply, not just what is happening at the demand end of the equation, is also a major factor in driving the development of asset price bubbles.</p></speech>

In view of his continual requests for dialogue, I would have thought he might be interested in my response.</p><p>  From my recollection of the contents of the reports compiled by Regling and Watson, Professor Honohan and others, the Deputy is correct to state they place a great deal of focus, as should have been the case, on the banking guarantee.  I also recall that some of the reports examine the events leading up to its introduction.</p><p>  A number of Deputies have asked why we are opposed to the Bill.  There are two legislative based reasons for our opposition.  I again recognise the work done by Deputy Pearse Doherty and his colleagues in drafting the Bill, but I must highlight the two main reasons for our opposition to it.  The first is that the proposed amendment to section 2 of the 2012 Act would undermine the ability of the courts to recognise people's individual circumstances and request that arrangements be put in place for them.  We are also of the view that the proposed amendment would place a limitation on the ability of the courts to do the work envisaged for them in the Bill.  We are of the view that if the amendment were to be accepted, it would open the arrangements that would be reached to legal challenge.  In the light of what the Bill seeks to do, this would prove completely counter-productive.</p><p>  The second reason to which I refer is that account is not taken of the fact that the courts already recognise the role played by the CCMA, that they examine the position of lenders seeking to repossess principal private properties and that they ask whether the latter have acted in a way which is in accordance with the code.  There are a number of reasons we are opposing the Bill, but I have focused on the two main ones.  As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated, we will continue to evaluate the laws and services in place in order to ensure the crisis relating to personal debt will be dealt with in a way that is fair both to the people unfortunate enough to have been affected by it and the broader interests within society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-11a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041100022#U00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Deputies Timmy Dooley, Stephen S. Donnelly, Se&aacute;n Crowe, Peter Mathews and Mary Lou McDonald for their contributions.</p><p>  When I heard that the Government intended to reject the legislation, I was disappointed, as I could have brought forward a much more robust Bill.  I could have revisited the personal insolvency legislation and sought to remove the veto of the banks.  However, I did not do so because I knew the Government would oppose me.  As a result, the legislation before the House would not prevent family homes from being repossessed.  That is despite the fact that many Members believe family homes should not be repossessed at this point.  We did not bring forward a Bill of the kind to which I refer because we knew the Government would object to it.  We decided instead to introduce the Bill before the House which seeks to put in place stronger protections for homeowners and rebalance the scales in favour of homeowners and against the banks.  Other contributors have acknowledged the fact that the gladiators on the front line who are taking on the banks on behalf of distressed mortgage holders - the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, New Beginning and others - recognise that this needs to be done because the scales have been completely tipped in favour of the banks.</p><p>  I am not sure whether the Minister of State is aware that repossession does not happen on a voluntary basis.  It happens against the homeowner's will.  People are having their houses repossessed without being given access to any form of legal representation.  They are obliged to go to court and do not know what is going on because they have no legal representation.  As stated, there are massive delays in providing free legal aid.  Those on the front line have informed us that people are going before the courts without any legal representation whatsoever.  It is for this reason that we believe judges must adjourn cases involving people at risk of losing their family homes to their banks, as a result of repossession, and who have not gone through the personal insolvency process.  Judges should adjourn such cases and instruct those involved to partake of the process to which I refer.  As stated, a bank should not be able to repossess someone's home without all of the other available options being exhausted first.</p><p>  The Minister of State has indicated that what we are seeking to do would limit the options open to the courts.  Perhaps we should limit these options.  We are talking about individuals who may be scared out of their wits because they are being brought before the courts - perhaps for the first time in their lives - by the various banks, vulture funds, etc., and their legal teams in order to have their homes repossessed.  Perhaps we should legislate to oblige judges to adjourn proceedings in such cases and encourage those involved to consult a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP.  The Minister of State did not deal with the second part of the legislation.  The 2012 Act makes provision whereby a judge may do as I am suggesting.  However, I presume this might be at the request of the individual involved and that he or she might not be in a position to make such a request as a result of a lack of legal representation.</p><p>  The other point to make in this regard is that the banks would be obliged to cover the costs involved.  As a result and in circumstances where someone's family home was being repossessed and the judge adjourned the proceedings and directed him or her to consult a PIP, the bank should cover the fee.  That would be fair and practical.  If, after all, a judge rules that the person should lose his or her home, he or she will be put out onto the street.  The Minister of State did not comment on that aspect, but he did state the possibility of the options open to the courts being limited was one of the main reasons the Government was opposed to the legislation.</p><p>  The Bill recognises that in the case of repossession of rental properties, tenancy agreements must be upheld.  This is something about we have been asking the Government to take action for a number of years and the Minister of State indicated that it might be dealt with in the Seanad in the context of another item of legislation.  Regardless of this, what really scares the life out of me is that the Government has not outlined any step it proposes to take in order to deal with the issue under discussion.  I reiterate what I said earlier, namely, that 30,034 letters seeking voluntary surrender or legal repossession of people's homes have been issued.  That means that there are 30,034 reasons the Minister of State should be indicating that while it has some issues with the Bill, the Government supports it.  If it has misgivings, they could be dealt with on Committee Stage.</p><p>I do not mind if the Bill is strengthened and improved or if things must be deleted.  We will deal with that issue.  There are people, however, who face the repossession of their family homes and are scared out of their minds.  It is not only their financial but their mental health that is at risk.  I have met them.  We must stand up and take notice of this.  When the banks were last before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, we were told that 15,000 letters seeking repossession or voluntary surrender had been sent.  This figure has increased to 30,000 after only six months.  The reason for the increase is the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, which has allowed banks to proceed in this way.  I welcomed the Government's setting of targets, but what has happened is that banks have been allowed to issue these letters as a way of reaching them.  It is not just me saying that.  Ulster Bank told the committee that if the easiest way to reach the target was to issue legal letters, that was what it would do.</p><p> The Minister of State has told us, as we have heard before, that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, will keep the Personal Insolvency Act under review.  The Minister is completely distracted by his personal scandals involving GSOC and the bugging system and has his eye completely off the ball.  If we had a Minister reviewing the matter who was on top of his game, we would not have this.  It did not take the committee to bring this out.  The Minister should have known about it, given that two of the major four lenders intend to veto every single proposal coming from a PIP that involves secured creditor write-down, yet we still hear that the matter will be kept under review.  Alarm bells should be ringing loudly in the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance.  Maybe the Government's eye is not completely off the ball.  Maybe it is willing to be a spectator in this game where the banks are let off the leash, mortgage holders are put at their mercy and a couple of individuals who have come together in different organisations are there in the middle of the mess trying to represent tens of thousands of people.</p><p> The Minister of State said the targets were a great success.  I do not deny his figures on concluded solutions.  Bank of Ireland said yesterday that of its concluded solutions, 1,000 involved repossession or voluntary surrender.  The Minister of State did not mention that.  He did not mention that in a large number of cases the parties to these concluded solutions are people who are forced to give up their family homes.  He did not mention anywhere in his contribution the fact that 30,000 letters have been issued seeking legal repossession or voluntary surrender, a large number of which relate to family homes.  The targets are not working.  No bank would have met the targets if it had not been for letters seeking repossession.  Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank and permanent tsb would have failed miserably if it were not for that.  The Minister keeps telling us that banks should not be using these letters to achieve repossession, but he hides behind the Central Bank.  It is time to stand up for ordinary people and Irish interests.</p><p> The Government heralds the personal insolvency legislation as the other revised measure.  The Minister of State said he disputed my claim that it had no effect, which was not true.  I did not say it had no effect.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted for the personal insolvency legislation.  It is important to reduce the bankruptcy term to three years and implement a system to deal with multiple creditors.  However, we have major issues with the legislation, one of which is the fact that banks retain a veto.  A second issue is that there is no public personal insolvency, with the result that many people cannot avail of the provisions of the Act because of the fees.  Yet the Minister of State heralds the service as the bee's knees.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, told us last year that he expected 19,000 cases to come before the personal insolvency service in its first 12 months of operation.  In the first seven months, there have been 523 cases.  The Minister of State heralds this as a way in which the Government is dealing with the mortgage crisis.  The insolvency service has resolved four mortgages.  I emphasise the number - four.  We must pull our heads out of the sand and start to talk about reality.</p><p> The Minister of State referred again and again to the stress, strain and misery that people are experiencing.  I know he is genuine when he says that.  However, he cannot be genuine in those comments and then say &quot;We are going to do nothing about it.&quot;  The system is broken.  The banks have abused the targets and are seeking repossession knowing the Government has adopted a hands-off approach.  The personal insolvency system is broken.  Richie Boucher, one of the most arrogant CEOs of any bank to have come before the joint committee, is telling us he will veto every single proposal.  Ulster Bank says the same.  I am sure the vulture funds will follow suit.  It is broken and we need to fix it.  The House has a responsibility to act in the interests of the people.</p></speech>

There should be certain proposals that all lenders offer.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that repossessions will take place in a normal market.  When they take place, the residual debt must be dealt with.  It is unacceptable and unforgiving of the Government to allow banks to take family homes from people while leaving them with &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 of residual debt.  A Deputy mentioned that where there was a residual debt of &euro;200,000, &euro;10,000 a year must be paid to the bank to maintain the debt for the rest of a person's life.  There is no home there.</p></speech>

None of the other banks has.  If the Minister of State was genuine in relation to his comments on the strain, stress and misery and on resolving this, he would support our genuine attempt to deal with it.  Our proposal is supported by those on the front line.  The Government should reconsider its position before we vote on this on Tuesday and allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage.  The system is broken.  This is one way to fix it in the most severe cases in which repossession is being threatened.  There are many other issues to be fixed, including mortgage-to-rent arrangements.  Sinn F&eacute;in will come at this not in an adversarial way but by trying to do what is best on behalf of the Irish people.  We wish the Government would meet us halfway.</p></speech>
