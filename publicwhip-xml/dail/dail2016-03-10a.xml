    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="00:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000004#B00600"><p>I thank the Clerk.  I am conscious that this is an historic moment.  As we assemble on the first day of the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il to elect a Ceann Comhairle we are actually seeing history being made.  Perhaps fittingly, in this the centenary year of our country's Proclamation of our right to self governance, Members of this House will elect their own Ceann Comhairle for the first time.  This process marks a significant change and is the first in a wide range of reforms that are necessary.  We need to separate the D&aacute;il from government, to allow the D&aacute;il to function as a relevant Parliament and not be a servant to government - a distinction that has been rarely, if ever, seen or evident in the past.</p>  <p>  The political system as a whole is under scrutiny.  The increased cynicism towards political institutions is an issue we can no longer ignore.  This D&aacute;il is more diverse than any other ever elected and affords us an opportunity and, even more, a necessity to embark finally on a programme of real and comprehensive reform.  All institutions of the State need it, none more so than in here.  As elected representatives, we have to start this reform right here at home in our national Parliament.</p><p>The Office of Ceann Comhairle can lead and steer these changes and, most importantly, be a champion of Members' interests.  However, the Ceann Comhairle cannot do this alone, which is why the various proposals which, I think, will be accepted to establish a working group to be chaired by the Ceann Comhairle to be elected today to consider the issue of reform, make proposals and report to the House are very welcome.  This cross-party committee will be responsible for ensuring its work is acted on.  </p> <p> I am entering my third D&aacute;il term.  I believe I have the skills and abilities necessary to effect such an agenda of reform to enhance the functionality of the D&aacute;il as a Parliament and to make the Oireachtas more transparent and relevant to the general public.  My role as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has provided me with valuable experience in making committees work and I hope this is generally acknowledged by my colleagues.  The committee carries out a very heavy work programme and has published 36 reports.  I am committed to giving committees more power in the upcoming term.  </p> <p> I do not want to pre-empt the work of whatever working committee is set up, but there are a couple of issues at which we should look as a starting point and one of which is the use of the guillotine.  Deputies are elected to legislate and we should be given time.  There is no necessity to impose the use of the guillotine.  Given the diverse make-up of the House, we need to recognise the need to give smaller groups more speaking time and this is something that must be worked out.  In giving more power to committees and the Ceann Comhairle more influence on the Order of Business a fundamental role of the Speaker of the House should be deciding the agenda of Parliament of which he or she is cathaoirleach.  If all of these measures are combined and acted on, we can allow for the guillotine not being used and more speaking time for smaller groups to get work done.  More power for committees is a key part and central plank of this.  </p> <p> We need to rebalance the way business is done and can work together to achieve this common aim.  Enhanced oversight and scrutiny of the Government by the Oireachtas, including the D&aacute;il, is central to this.  This, in turn, will allow for better quality legislation and a more expedient way of delivering it.  We could adopt best practice from other countries such as setting aside time, either in committee weeks or by way of the arrangement some of us witnessed in the Scottish Parliament under which mornings are set aside for committees and afternoons for plenary sessions in order that Members will not be running back from committees to vote in the House and we can dedicate our time to the work of committees.  </p> <p> The D&aacute;il - the national Parliament - has the power to change the way it does its business.  It is up to it and Members to see what it can make of this opportunity.  The vote to elect a Ceann Comhairle will give the Deputy elected a mandate to work with all Members in driving forward an agenda and the reform proposals necessary.  As I said, we cannot do this alone.  In co-operation with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in particular, the Ceann Comhairle will have to seek real D&aacute;il reform during his or her term of office.  Let this be the first day on which we see real reform of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The people who elected us nearly two weeks ago expect as much and we must deliver.  I believe I am the right person to drive forward this change for the benefit of all Members of the D&aacute;il.  History will probably reflect positively on the events of today in the manner in which the new Ceann Comhairle is being selected, but the jury is still out and it is up to us to determine whether history will reflect positively on the work we will do from now on.  Therefore, it is important that, with good will and co-operation, we all work together.  I am asking for Members' support.  </p> <p> I wish my colleagues who are also running the very best.  It is important that whoever is elected today have the support of all Members of the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000005#C00300"><p>This is unfamiliar territory for me, given that I am more of a protagonist than a moderator, but every situation after every general election throws up challenges and one should never be afraid to face them.  There have been changes in recent times, not only in this country but also in many democracies throughout Europe and the rest of the globe.  It is important that we be prepared to react to and accommodate changes as they take place and before it becomes necessary to do so.  One of the things this and future Parliaments must be prepared to do is to anticipate long before things develop what is likely to happen and how we should respond to them.</p>  <p>  I hope I have gleaned some experience in the years I have spent in the House and learned a little.  I am willing to learn more all the time.  Some of the things which I believe are sacrosanct at this stage are, first, the rights of the Member.  The late Oliver J. Flanagan once told me that I should never allow my rights in Parliament, including my right to table parliamentary questions, regardless of whether I was in government or opposition, to be eroded.  He gave very good advice which still stands to this day and is more important than ever.  If it is possible to gain information on an issue by way of a freedom of information request, it should also be possible to gain the same information through a parliamentary question.  If that was the case, as I believe it should be, there would have been no need for many of the inquiries that have taken place in recent years.  If I happen to be successful, I can only undertake to say I would like to see the principle that every Member has the right to raise a parliamentary question on any issue at any time and expect to receive a substantive reply honoured.  That is hugely important to the entire democratic system.  </p>  <p>  We also need to look at the way we do our business.  My colleague, Deputy Andrew Doyle, has already referred to this issue.  We need to change because we are in the public arena to a greater extent.  The outgoing Ceann Comhairle introduced one very important innovation to this House in introducing and facilitating live broadcasting of its proceedings.  It has changed and should change completely the way we do things.  It has brought us under the microscope to a far greater extent.  It has allowed members of the public the length and breadth of the country to observe at first hand the performances of their elected public representatives.  That is as it should be.  We need to be able to conduct our business in a dignified way without rancour and bitterness in order to accommodate each other's opinions at all times, even though we might hold differing opinions.  That is part of the democratic process established in many Parliaments all over the world, none more so than this one.  If I am successful, I hope I can contribute in some way to the fulfilment of the rights of individual Members of the House in a way that is meaningful to them and the people who elected them.  The people who elected every one of us sent us here as messengers and we bear a huge responsibility for them in that we need to be able to respond to them in a meaningful, substantive and responsible way.  </p>  <p>  I offer my good wishes to my colleagues who are also contesting the election.  Let the better person win.  Whoever is Ceann Comhairle will definitely have a challenging role to play, but he or she will be assisted considerably by the proposed changes in D&aacute;il reform.  The new Ceann Comhairle will preside over a standing committee which will order the manner in which we will do business and eliminate much of the conflict that arose in the past.  This is hugely important.  </p>  <p>  I thank my colleagues who signed my nomination papers and offered support.  I hope I can justify their trust in the time ahead.  Members of the House, many of whom are serving for the first time, will long remember this day with fondness.  It will be a memory they will cherish for the rest of their lives.  This is a very important day.  Being elected to the national Parliament carries with it a very important responsibility.  I hope we can all live up to the high expectations the public have for us.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn uilig ionada&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh ar son &aacute;r dtoghth&oacute;ir&iacute;.  Mar is eol do Bhaill, t&aacute;imse ag lorg a v&oacute;ta&iacute; inniu do r&oacute;l an Chinn Chomhairle.  Iarraim ar Bhaill a muin&iacute;n a chur ionam agus a dtaca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt dom inniu.</p>  <p>  I extend my congratulations to all the elected Members of the 32nd D&aacute;il on their election in the recent general election contest.  We have each come through a tightly fought contest and most of us will have memories of challenging and perhaps even blistering moments.  The election is now behind us.  On 26 February, the people spoke.  They have given us an honoured mandate and one which no doubt we will all strive to respect and fulfil and so it is that we meet here today to take the first steps in the outworking of the people&rsquo;s decision.  For the first time in our parliamentary democracy we, the elected Members of the D&aacute;il, will decide who among our number will preside over the business of this House, who it is we will entrust to oversee the fair conduct of our deliberations and exchanges in this Chamber.</p>  <p>  The position of Ceann Comhairle and the allied roles of that office require experience of parliamentary procedures and a disposition that is respectful of all opinion and the right of all to have their views expressed and heard.  I believe that in the past 19 years I have acquired the required experience and have demonstrated that I have the skills and the natural disposition to serve in this important role.  I have over these past four D&aacute;il terms worked closely with colleagues of all political opinion, party members and Independent Deputies alike.  I have been an active and front-line spokesperson in technical groups in two D&aacute;il terms.  I have been convener of cross-party and Independent Members in two major health-related campaigns, Justice for the Victims of Michael Neary and Justice for the Survivors of Symphysiotomy.  I am an active member of the Oireachtas group on mental health and I am a founding and executive member of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  I have considerable experience of working on Oireachtas committees, including the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Finance and on Health and Children.  I believe that while I was a passionate and committed advocate of my and my party&rsquo;s policy positions and outlooks in these fora, I was at all times an interested member and listened to all contributions and was jointly involved with colleagues from government and opposition in producing a considerable body of work, reports and recommendations.  I have openly campaigned with outgoing Government Ministers and Deputies on the children&rsquo;s rights referendum and on the referendum on marriage equality.  I have at all times demonstrated my willingness to work with colleagues of all parties and none in the interest of the common good and of outcomes of importance to Irish society.</p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle must of necessity be independent of government and opposition.  It is my certain view that the Ceann Comhairle is duty bound to uphold the primacy of the individual parliamentarian over and above all considerations of party or groupings.  He or she must conduct the business of this House in a fair and impartial manner and adhere to the highest standards of the office.  D&aacute;il reform has been much commented on of late.  It is not within the gift of the Ceann Comhairle to make changes to the conduct of business already governed by D&aacute;il Standing Orders.  However, in his or her capacity as chair of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Ceann Comhairle can facilitate and encourage real and substantial change.  As Chair of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Ceann Comhairle can lead effective change in Members&rsquo; interests.  As a member of the Presidential Commission and of Comhairle na Mire Gaile among other roles, there is a lot to the position that Members in the Chamber and the wider public do not see. </p>  <p>  I am greatly interested in taking on this honoured responsibility.  I am humbled by the support of colleagues who have nominated me and I thank them for their encouragement.  In conclusion, I ask each of the Members to consider supporting me this morning.  I respectfully request their number one support and if that is not possible, their number two would be greatly appreciated.  If called upon on the conclusion of today&rsquo;s ballot, I will proudly and solemnly declare that I will duly, faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and ability execute the office of Ceann Comhairle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without fear or favour.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go leir.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;m rath D&eacute; ar obair na mBaill agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh tr&eacute;imhse fada agus fi&uacute;ntach againn anseo.  Is c&uacute;is bhr&oacute;id dom &eacute; a bheith ainmnithe mar iarrth&oacute;ir do phost an Chinn Chomhairle agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och do mo chomhleacaithe as a gcuid ainmneacha a chur leis an iarratas.  Le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; anuas, t&aacute;im tar &eacute;is a bheith ag stocaireacht agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och do chuile dhuine a thug an t-am chun ceist an toghch&aacute;in seo a phl&eacute;igh liom.  D&rsquo;fhoghlaim m&eacute; go leor agus bhain m&eacute; taitneamh as an dteangmh&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  On this the first sitting day of the 32nd D&aacute;il, we begin our business with a changed approach to the election of Ceann Comhairle.  Change is the word that has been most frequently uttered by Members of this House and in the media since the results of the general election became known.  While some of us have struggled to interpret the people&rsquo;s decision of 26 February, one thing is abundantly clear to me: the Irish public requires us to restructure government and to re-order this D&aacute;il in a manner that more accurately reflects the real needs of a modern Ireland.  The Ceann Comhairle has an opportunity in this situation.  He or she has a responsibility to play a central role in the reform of our governmental, political and parliamentary system.  Every one of the 158 Members here has a mandate that is of equal value and, therefore, each of us is entitled to and must receive in this House parity of esteem.  Equally so, each of us has an inescapable responsibility to ensure that the parliamentary forum always conducts its business in a manner that is respectful, constructive and in the interests of the Irish people.  We need to work to create a D&aacute;il that we have reason to be proud of and one in which our people can readily place their faith.</p>  <p>  As Ceann Comhairle, I would see my role as an active promoter of reform, based on consultation.  The process of reform must begin immediately and when agreed it must be implemented without fear or favour.  At the heart of what we do must be a change in the relationship between the Executive and the D&aacute;il and the creation of a situation in which the Executive is truly accountable to this elected assembly.  In pursuing this objective, I see the Ceann Comhairle as a servant of the Members and not a slave to the system.  I would be most grateful for the Members' support and commit myself, if elected, to vigorously asserting the rights of the Members and the integrity of the House.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me to conclude without wishing well the four other contenders, Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Andrew Doyle and my friend of long standing, Deputy Bernard Durkan.  Each would, if elected, give distinguished service.  It would be remiss of us all not to acknowledge that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, with whom many of us might have disagreed on several occasions, devoted himself tirelessly to the service of this Chamber and to the service of the people of Ireland.  He deserves recognition of that in this House today.</p></speech>

I ask myself why there was that sense of alienation, disillusionment and apathy.  Part of the answer lies in the way we conduct business in this House, the way we conduct ourselves and the way we treat each other.  At times we leave the electorate feeling frustrated, angry and let down because they expect so much more of us.  We owe it to the electorate, those who voted for us, those who voted for our opponents and those who did not vote at all, to do our business in a way that will have the D&aacute;il meaningful and relevant to them and acting in their best interests.  We have to show we are listening to the electorate and that we realise they want us to put in place a government to deal with the issues and problems facing the country, and to do so in a fair, more open and just manner.</p> <p> It is a privilege and an honour to be elected.  I am conscious of those former colleagues from the 31st D&aacute;il who lost their seats and are not here today.</p> <p> I was part of the Convention on the Constitution that discussed D&aacute;il reform - how to make it more accountable, democratic and efficient.  It is positive and progressive that the position of Ceann Comhairle is no longer in the gift of the ruling parties.  It is very positive that each of us sitting here today had the possibility of standing in this election and there have been five nominees in the end.  It also would be positive and progressive if voting did not follow party and non-party lines - I may be voting myself out of a job before it even happens.</p> <p> I did not actively seek the nomination, but I was encouraged to have my name put forward by Deputies, and with the support of my canvassers and campaigners in the Gregory group.  I thank those who nominated me and the others who wanted to nominate me but I had the requisite number.</p> <p> In my six and a half years here I have always tried to be fair, to respect the views of others, to respect difference and to listen.  Almost everything in life is done in a collaborative way, through compromise, consensus and reasoning.  I have experienced that here.  I was a member of the Oireachtas group on mental health.  I was a member of another group that worked on prisoner issues.  I chaired the Irish section of AWEPA.  I was part of the Justice for the Forgotten group and a group on animal welfare where members from political parties and Independents worked together.  In each case it was the issue that brought us together and we worked on that issue regardless of our political views.  Of course, the Technical Group was a good example of working in that collaborative way.  Ceapaim gurb &eacute; sin an tsl&iacute; is fearr chun dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh ag obair le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; ciall san seanfhocal, "n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile".  </p> <p> People voted for change and they are looking to us to deliver that change.  That begins with reforming the way we do business here in the Chamber and in committees.  It is both a challenge and an opportunity.  Whoever is Ceann Comhairle must, with the relevant committee of like-minded people who are committed to reform, deliver on that reform.  It is a reform that I hope will mean people will have credibility and confidence in democracy.  It means doing whatever is necessary to increase the authority and autonomy of the Oireachtas so that we legislate in ways that are fair and equitable.  It also means that electoral commission really getting going.  It means committing to the procedures and practices that encourage and ensure transparency in all decision making.  It means equality-proofing of budgets and an evidence-based approach to all resource allocations.</p> <p> It means moving from the adversarial, the conflict, the theatrics, the shouting-down, and the interrupting that sometimes has this House looking more like the Coliseum than a Parliament.  It means a different way of setting agendas.  It also means accepting that whoever is in government is not all-seeing and all-knowing and that those not in government have nothing to offer.  It also means being prepared to involve others who are not political.  That means a Ceann Comhairle who will ensure respect for difference, who will ensure questions are answered, who will ensure meaningful debate and constructive criticism, and who will drive an appropriate agenda.  It might not make the headlines; it might not make for good or sensational television, but it would go a long way towards eradicating the apathy and disillusionment I mentioned at the beginning.</p> <p> Bismarck said that politics is the art of the possible.  Anything is possible, including a woman Ceann Comhairle, which would be a precedent.  I am conscious of those countries where women do not have a voice at all today.  I think most importantly we need a person who is best for the job regardless of gender, age or politics.</p> <p> We have major challenges ahead, including in housing and homelessness, and health, especially for those with disabilities, with mental health issues and those in addiction.  We have major challenges regarding climate and the environment.  We have challenges regarding our new communities and we are a long way from being progressive in animal welfare.  I think of our communities and our youth services are areas of great need.</p> <p> Deirim ar&iacute;s, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.

I thank my constituents in Kildare South for their support and for giving me the chance to take up this particular role.  I thank my wife, Mary Clare, and my children for their patience and support over the years.</p><p>It is an immense personal privilege for my family and me to hold this position and it is not one I treat lightly.</p> <p> I pay tribute to Deputies Andrew Doyle, Bernard Durkan, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Maureen O'Sullivan for their contribution to this contest.  Each of them would have made an excellent Ceann Comhairle and I hope I will match their energy and commitment to this House.  Furthermore, I will endeavour to follow in the footsteps of Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett who, in a deeply difficult time for this country, played a central role in this Chair in steering this House through often uncharted waters.  I am aware that in the time to come, tempers may fray and disagreements may flare up.  I promise you I will adjudicate without fear or favour based on the respect for each Deputy's inalienable democratic mandate.  I implore you, the Members, to respect one another's voices as each of us stands not simply for himself or herself, but for his or her constituents across every reach of this country, in town, city, village and countryside.</p> <p> Disagreement is the beating heart of a democracy but argument is the lifeblood of a vibrant chamber and mutual respect is the foundation of an effective parliament.  Our unprecedented election of this position is just the first step of what I hope will be many on the road to reforming the workings of our political system.  I personally am fully committed to overseeing that crucial task.  More than 100 years on from the foundation of our Republic, the democratic institutions of the State have often been tested; their strength has not been found wanting.  We have stood up when many believed we would fall and this House has played an essential role in withstanding the storms of history.  The great project of Irish independence, which the first D&aacute;il embodied, still endures in the soul of this 32nd D&aacute;il.  That it continues is an historic responsibility that rests upon the shoulders of everybody in this Chamber.  I look forward to putting in train and overseeing the implementation of deep-reaching reforms that will benefit both those of you seated here today and the people of the country, as well as the generations that will follow us into this, the people's Chamber.  I look forward to working with you all in the coming years as we endeavour together to build a better republic for all our citizens.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

It is a momentous occasion for them that you have reached this historic office in such an historic way with a secret ballot and then through unanimous declaration and acclamation from the House itself.  You are a committed and skilled parliamentarian and always have been, as well as a person with a strong social conscience who is committed to the issues of housing, agriculture and many others.  I believe you will bring an open and accommodating style to the House and given the skill sets you have, you are ideally positioned to grasp the historic opportunity that presents itself in respect of altering the fundamental relationship between the Executive and the Parliament.  This is essentially what the people want and require.  You now enjoy the confidence of the full House and I believe you will bring those skill sets to bear and that by the end of its term, the 32nd D&aacute;il will be a much different place than it was at the outset.  A Cheann Comhairle, I simply will quote your opening remarks to the House this afternoon when you stated you will serve the Members as opposed to being a slave of the system and of that, I have no doubt.</p></speech>

I also wish to take a moment to thank the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Barrett, for all his work during the past five years and to congratulate all those who offered themselves as candidates in what has been a first for the D&aacute;il, namely, the election by secret ballot of the Ceann Comhairle.  I know you, as a politician, to be a man of decency and integrity who is dedicated to the public interest and to that of your constituents.  It would appear from reading the tallies that not only did you attract the support of your own party, but you also attracted significant support from other parties and most likely from Independents in the House.</p><p>I express good wishes to you.  As the chairperson and speaker of this Parliament, it will be a productive Parliament under your guidance.  We have a large national agenda with which to proceed and it will fall to you to steer the reform process I think everyone has agreed is required in respect of the workings of the D&aacute;il and its relationship with the Executive.  We must also look to outcomes that are good for people and that help to generate greater improvements not just in the workings of the D&aacute;il but in the outcomes for the people of this Republic.</p></speech>

It is the first time we have had a secret ballot on the election of a Ceann Comhairle.  I congratulate you and wish you and your family all the best for the future.  I also thank and commend our previous Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, for the work he has done over the past five years during a very difficult time.  We had many rows but he never personalised the issue and always handled it in a professional and impartial manner.  I also commend and thank the other candidates today, namely, my friend and colleague Deputy Bernard Durkan as well as Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Andrew Doyle and Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  They were all excellent candidates.  We have all been talking about it over the past week or so and we knew they would have been up for the job.  Again, I congratulate you for winning the election.</p>  <p>  A Cheann Comhairle, as you said yourself during your introductory remarks, it is important to note, given we now have a new D&aacute;il, many new Deputies and fresh energy in the Chamber, that now is the time to change the whole system.  There is an opportunity for all of us, across different parties, to work together in the national interest.  We in the Independent Alliance will do that.  We have a vision for change.  We have a vision to do something practical to help our people.   I wish everyone well and, once again, congratulate the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

As the youngest Deputy in my party, I am immensely proud to do so.  I may be new to this Chamber but I know the difference this Taoiseach has made to the country.  Perhaps it is hard to see and sometimes, indeed, hard to hear through the sound and fury of political opposition.  Yet, his achievements are there and his achievements will last.  These achievements include marriage equality, the country being saved from the financial abyss, an end to the tide of emigration of people my age, two increases in the minimum wage, saying goodbye to the troika and a change in politics for the better and forever.  Your election today is testament to that kind of change and I congratulate you most sincerely, a Cheann Comhairle. </p><p>When the Taoiseach was first nominated, the country was asked to trust in the untested and to hang out its brightest colours in faith.  There is always the idealism of the untested, the ideal perfection, but that is not reality.  We know the reality.  The reality is that experience bloodies and experience bruises sometimes.  There is no doubt that being in government has bruised us as a party too.  However, while in government, we took on the challenges for the greater good of the country.  I am proud this Taoiseach has always put the country first and confident he always will put the country first.  A Taoiseach should always be fighting for the good of our society, economy and country, and Deputy Enda Kenny, always has.  It has not been perfect and there is so much more to do.  However, one can only build a house on firm foundations.  There is no doubt that this Taoiseach has strived to build those foundations in a selfless, consistent way, day in, day out.  We can now build on those foundations, if we so choose.  In this year, the centenary of our Republic, it is perhaps worth reflecting on that.  </p><p>When I was younger the Taoiseach gave me the advice of Thomas Jefferson - &quot;In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.&quot;  I will stand with him today and always.  He brought this party back from being written off.  Far more important, he brought our economy and our country back when many had written us off.  We should not lose sight of that.  As we mark 100 years of independence, we can look forward to a brighter future.  I believe Deputy Enda Kenny is the man to bring us towards that brighter future.  I am proud to nominate Deputy Enda Kenny today.</p></speech>

A Cheann Comhairle and Members of the D&aacute;il, it is my honour to second the nomination of An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, as Taoiseach to the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I have had the privilege to serve under his leadership of the Fine Gael Party and as Taoiseach of our country for the past five years.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I believe Deputy Kenny is a man of honour, integrity and vision.  He never fails to impress with his enduring energy and enthusiasm.  His experience and vision for a better Ireland are qualities we need in our next Taoiseach.  This is very important.  Over the past five years, Deputy Kenny has shown great leadership, not only at home but also abroad.  His hard work in very difficult times has helped to create a climate where people can return to work and education, providing hope and opportunities for the many young people who wish to return home from abroad.  I believe that Deputy Kenny's strength of character and social conscience will provide the leadership that is required in the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il.  I therefore formally propose to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the nomination of Deputy Kenny as the next Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I move that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominate Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for appointment by the President as Taoiseach.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is very well qualified to undertake the duties of the office of Taoiseach.  In nominating him, Fianna F&aacute;il is making it clear that it is opting for a change of Government because that is what people voted for.</p>  <p>  First elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1989, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has been re-elected on every occasion since to represent the people of Cork South-Central.  He is an honest and passionate republican who believes in Ireland and wants to deliver a fairer society for all.  Deputy Martin has extensive experience in this House.  He is a former Minister for Education and Science; Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Foreign Affairs.  He has represented the Government with distinction in Northern Ireland, Europe and across the globe.  For the past five years, he has led the Opposition and tenaciously highlighted issues that were having a negative impact on communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  During his time in opposition, he reached out to people and listened to their problems with sincerity and empathy.  He recognised that families and communities were struggling and that Ireland was experiencing a two-tier recovery with some of her people being left behind.  He saw at first hand how public services were depleted, how frustrated people were and how difficult it had become to access even the most basic essential services.  He is a strong believer in politics and has been a positive advocate for the people he serves.  He has led the way in bringing forward proposals to reform how politics is done in our country.  The failure to implement any meaningful political reform over the past five years is the single greatest failure of the last D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  On a personal level, it is a huge honour for me as a new Deputy in the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il to be nominating Deputy Martin.  He has been an invaluable mentor to me throughout my time in politics and has always made himself available to assist me and other younger representatives within the party on our journey through political life.  He has shown courage and determination in bringing a new generation into politics and bringing about real changes in the way we do our business.  As party leader, he has always endeavoured to be inclusive and to ensure that all voices are heard and respected.  I have no doubt that he will be a strong advocate for young people in this country and that he will continue his commitment to political reform and inclusivity in this House.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin believes in the people of Ireland.  He knows this is a country rich with immense potential and generosity of spirit.  People want an Ireland for all and not just for a few.  With Deputy Martin's determination and work ethic, I know he could lead the next Government to achieve this objective.  Throughout his political life, he has been approachable, fair minded and straight talking.  He faces challenges head on and knows that people want a decent society.  In conclusion, I and my party colleagues consider him to be uniquely well qualified to be Taoiseach and to lead Ireland towards the realisation of our shared objective - an Ireland for all.</p></speech>

In this time of uncertainty, instability and hardship for many families and communities, Ireland now needs strong, proven leadership.  Ireland calls out for a leader of vision - not the narrow vision of the conservative establishment parties, but a vision that embraces this entire island, that goes beyond the Border and encompasses both the North and the South of Ireland and all of its people, whether Catholic, Protestant, dissenter or other.  As the leader of the only all-Ireland republican party and the largest all-island political party, and as one of the architects of the Irish peace process, Deputy Gerry Adams has consistently displayed qualities of strong leadership, courage and perseverance.  He has clearly shown that he is willing to reach out to, listen to and work with those who have opposed him.</p><p>He has successfully built peaceful relationships between the most bitter of opponents.  Ireland calls out for a leader who will give hope back to the people, to those who have struggled on the watch of previous Governments and who struggle still; a leader who will protect the vulnerable and the marginalised, our young people and our older citizens, who will create real opportunities for decent work and a decent standard of living; a leader who will lift the burden on low- and middle-income families who have been crippled by burdens not of their making and overwhelmed by stealth taxes such as water charges and the family home tax; a leader who is not afraid to take on the elites and the vested interests who laid this economy and society low.  Deputy Gerry Adams will give a voice to those who have not felt recovery - that is, the majority of our citizens.  His positive vision for Ireland will give hope back to the people and will deliver fairness and equality for all.</p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; tiomanta do chur chun cinn agus neart&uacute; na Gaeilge.

Deputy Gerry Adams has shown that he is a person of strong principle and endurance.  He is someone who is focused and determined and who sees the bigger picture.  Deputy Gerry Adams is someone who has never put self-interest above or beyond the national interest.  In this centenary year of the 1916 Rising, in order to achieve a truly fair Ireland, an Ireland we can be proud of, an Ireland in which all of our people can say that we and they feel the recovery, I am happy and honoured to propose Deputy Gerry Adams as Taoiseach.</p></speech>

For many years, Deputy Gerry Adams has demonstrated outstanding political leadership, especially on the peace process and as the leader of the real Opposition throughout the 31st D&aacute;il.  Deputy Gerry Adams offers a different vision for the Irish people, a commitment to Irish unity, to working with our Unionist neighbours and to pursuing policies based on fairness and equality - policies that will end the water charges and the family home tax, that will tackle the crisis in our emergency departments, that will provide homes for more than 100,000 people on the housing waiting list and that will ease the burden, especially in rural Ireland, for those who see no evidence of a recovery.  I am honoured to second the nomination of my friend and party colleague Deputy Gerry Adams.</p></speech>

As we approach the centenary of the Rising, about which we will hear a lot over the next number of weeks, it is clear that we live in a very unjust society, where vast wealth is concentrated in the hands of a tiny few while the majority have seen their living standards plummet.  A crisis rages in health and housing, and an attempt is being made to turn water into a commodity capable of being privatised and fetching a profit.  To this day, the church remains entangled with the State and women are denied their civil rights on abortion.</p><p>It is clear that, as James Connolly said a hundred years ago, the day has passed for patching up the capitalist system; it must go.  We need democratic public control and ownership of wealth and resources if society is to be run for people's needs, not profit.  We need a separation of church and State.</p><p>Today, we will not vote for the identical twin candidates of the two parties that imposed austerity in this country, nor can we endorse the candidate of a party that is claiming to be the friend of ordinary people while implementing austerity in the North and which is based on one side of the community.  All three candidates who have been proposed accept the crumbs of the fiscal space and thus cannot deliver the real change that is needed by the majority in society.  We need the immediate abolition of the water charges, which were clearly rejected by the majority of the electorate, and we support and call for an extension of the boycott to make sure those charges are finished off while the two parties dither over whether they will carry out abolition.  Neither can we wait any longer for a State-backed housing programme to deal with the housing emergency and for NAMA to be declared an agency for affordable housing, which the previous Government refused to do.  We need to end the 32-year hypocrisy of the eighth amendment to the Constitution and allow women to make this decision for themselves in all cases, not just a few.  To fund our public services, we need to end the use of our country as a tax haven and to take control of the wealth of the 1%.</p><p>James Connolly wanted to change the system, and we agree with him.  Sixteen days before the Rising, Connolly outlined who will change Ireland, and in whose interests, when he said in the pages of <i>The Workers' Republic</i>:</p><blockquote>Not the rack-renting, slum-owning landlord; not the sweating, profit-grinding capitalist; not the sleek and oily lawyer; not the prostitute pressman &ndash; the hired liars of the enemy.  Not these are the Irish upon whom the future depends.  Not these, but the Irish working class, the only secure foundation upon which a free nation can be reared.</blockquote><p>The candidates of the socialist left will not win the position of Taoiseach today but, in standing, we are making a declaration of intent in this D&aacute;il.  We intend to have a strong, independent voice for workers in this D&aacute;il.  We invite everybody who wants real change in this country to get involved in the political process and to join with us to help build a new mass party for working people in this country in order to finally replace the thoroughly discredited and compromised Labour Party, a party of working people for working people and for a society ruled and run by working people in the interests of the majority.  To this end, I propose Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett for the position of Taoiseach in the 32nd D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Maybe it is because there are lots of people in the seats, but it does feel a good deal smaller than the image that is portrayed.  However, I feel quite tall in being here, first, to represent the people who elected us and, second, to nominate Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett as Taoiseach.  I want to say a few words about Deputy Boyd Barrett.  This is a man of principle who has led many struggles of ordinary people against austerity, against tax injustice, against the water charges and, indeed, what he has marked out himself, which was fighting on the question of the environment, the harbour in Dun Laoghaire and saving our forests.  I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett would make a fine Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Having said that, we know he is not going to be elected.  Indeed, according to the good man over there, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, nobody will get elected today, so we are in a bit of theatre.  In this theatre, the radical left has as much right to be a player on the stage as anybody else.  I would argue, in fact, that there are at least 90 Deputies in this House who were elected by the people to abolish the water charges and to deal with the punitive action of making people pay water charges.  Over 50% of the population has said "We are not doing it."  That has really set the stage, and that stage has been set on the back of people power.  I want to talk about that, because the radical left, particularly as represented by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, is quite different in the sense that we are here as the voice of people, we are here to represent people and we intend to do a very strong and good job.</p><p>However, what really matters is what happens in society because people are constantly being treated as economic units.  The measures engaged in by previous governments have been to see the economy as what we need to do to get jobs and all the rest.  However, we have to start putting people before the interests of a tiny elite who gain from the profits in this country.  People are not economic units.  They are human beings with real needs in the areas of housing, health, education and all of the issues mentioned by colleagues.  This is the way we need to go.  We need to combine people power with our voice here and deliver a society that puts these interests first.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett is being nominated, not because of him as an individual, but because of the issues the radical left has to bring to the table.  In the spirit of the Proclamation, we want to see equality for young people and women.  We want to see a referendum this year - the anniversary of the Easter Rising - on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  These issues are a big challenge to the future government which I assume will be formed some time in the future.  This is about how people see the shaping of the government.  There is clearly a major crisis in political terms in this country.  As far as we are concerned, the voice of people power has been brought into this Chamber and will be well represented by all of us here on the radical left and beyond, by all of the left and, in particular, by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I formally second his nomination.</p></speech>

The past two Governments had the choice to protect the most vulnerable in society but instead both of them chose to protect the super rich, the bankers and the bondholders.  There are now at least 1,600 children in emergency hotel accommodation.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine claims that between 300 and 350 unnecessary deaths take place each year due to trolley chaos in our hospitals.  This is more than the carnage on our roads.  Yesterday, for example, there were 32 people on trolleys in South Tipperary General Hospital.  In University Hospital Limerick, which serves the northern part of Tipperary, there were 50 people on trolleys.  This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  The people have rejected the approach of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  Both of those Governments caused this human emergency.  This new D&aacute;il must take a radically different course to the two previous D&aacute;ileanna.  It must take a course that prioritises human need for adequate medical treatment, including death prevention and the care of all the children of the nation above all else.  I believe there is and should be no higher priority.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I ask the new D&aacute;il to enact the following emergency measure as its first legislative act, namely, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann set aside and cancel all reductions in universal social charge and-or income taxation granted in the 2016 budget to the 5% of income recipients with the highest incomes and instruct the Government to bring forward amending legislation to enact this measure immediately.  Today, I submitted a Private Members' motion to that effect.  Approximately &euro;125 million will be saved by this measure.  This money should be immediately applied to rescue homeless children and prevent unnecessary deaths due to hospital chaos.  This is the least we might expect on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  While this measure will, of course, not be enough to remedy the problems of homelessness and inadequate human services into the future, it will ameliorate the position in the short term while fundamental policy changes are formulated and enacted by the new D&aacute;il.  More importantly, it would give a signal that fundamental choices which prioritise the well-being of human beings above all else will be taken by this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Broken promises are eroding democracy and flouting the will of the people.  This D&aacute;il must ensure that citizens are centre stage, with an ongoing input into the democratic process, including the recall of Deputies and the reintroduction into our Constitution of the people's entitlement to instigate referenda and legislation.  I intend to submit proposals to that effect to the new reform committee, which I understand will be established later this afternoon.</p>  <p>  As a founder member of the Right2Water group, it goes without saying that I will support the abolition of water charges.  These charges and the family home tax are regressive measures designed to load the burden of the crash on those on low and middle incomes, who had no hand, act or part in creating the crisis.  These taxes are designed to protect the super rich from fair taxation.  A situation in which the Exchequer is paying more than &euro;7 billion per year in interest at the expense of under-funded public services must not continue.  That portion of the debt which arises from the compensation of large investors from their failed investments in private banks must be mutualised and negotiations must be reopened immediately on this issue with the European Union authorities.</p>  <p>  I contested the recent general election as part of the Right2Water, Right2Change alliance.  Therefore, I will be voting for candidates nominated for Taoiseach who supported and were part of that alliance, namely, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Gerry Adams, and will oppose the pro-austerity nominees of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="01:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000014#EE00400"><p>In the general election, the Labour Party sought a mandate to continue implementing our policy in government, the job of rebuilding our society and our economy.  We viewed as essential that Ireland would have stable, balanced government to continue addressing entrenched problems, such as health and housing, that will take more time and resources to put right.  We believed the return of the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government offered the best possibility of stable, balanced government and for that reason, we support the nomination of Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach today.</p>  <p>  We also support the nomination because the Taoiseach supported key economic and social goals driven by the Labour Party in government, even when they did not form part of Fine Gael's manifesto.  From minimum wage increases to marriage equality and from strengthening workers rights to enhancing maternal care for women, the Taoiseach brought his party with him in recognition of the fact that it was a coalition and that these progressive measures were in the country's and the people's best interest.  That is the importance of compromise and partnership in the national interest.  The electorate has given a greatly increased mandate to those currently on the Opposition benches.  I believe there is, therefore, an onus and responsibility on those same parties, groupings and Deputies to step forward in the national interest and not sit back. </p><p> None of us is foolish enough to believe that Sinn F&eacute;in and the ultra-left are likely to suddenly play their part.  If they are remotely serious about fixing Ireland's problems, they should be prepared to make sacrifices in the national interest, as opposed to promoting narrow partisan agendas.  We sometimes forget that one of the basic demands that people make of politicians is that they should be prepared to govern and take decisions in the national interest or the people's interest.  The Labour Party has never been afraid to take responsibility and sometimes the cost of taking responsibility is very high, as we know.  As Shakespeare put it, "He jests at scars that never felt a wound".</p> <p> Given the reality that quite a few on the opposition benches do not want to be in government, there is therefore an onus on those who have been there before, although Fianna F&aacute;il presided over and created the crash.  There is an onus on that party to step up to the plate and seek to remedy its wrongs.  In 2011, the Labour Party did not stand idly by in its own best interest and we, as its members, stood by the republic.  Fianna F&aacute;il should do likewise now.  Together with Fine Gael, it can provide a Government with sufficient numbers for stability, and such stability is vital now.  To see why, we need only look at Spain.  Three months after its election, there is still no sign of a government there and Spain's unemployment rate is still over 20%, with business leaders warning that the stalemate is having a chilling effect on investment.</p> <p> Ireland and its people cannot afford a similar stalemate when we have returned to strong growth and added 140,000 new jobs.  We have put the public finances back on a much healthier footing, created room for additional investment in our schools, begun the process of raising living standards after a very traumatic time for our people and made significant social progress too, including legislating for the X case, strengthening children's rights and delivering marriage equality.  We also delivered significant political reform.  Some of the first legislation brought before the House by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was to protect whistleblowers and there was also legislation to regulate lobbyists and restore the Freedom of Information Act.  It will fall to the next Government to protect and extend those gains.  Given that Fianna F&aacute;il was the party that shredded the Freedom of Information Act, I would welcome an assurance from Deputy Martin today that he would commit to retaining these new laws.</p></speech>

Labour will apply pressure for further economic and social progress by providing principled, responsible opposition.  When we went into government in 2011, we put the country first and I have no regret about that, despite the losses we incurred.  I am proud of the work undertaken by my colleagues and my party and as we rebuild from the opposition benches, we will continue to fight for a recovery that works for all and puts equality at the centre of everything that this republic stands for.</p></speech>

I will give a personal reflection if I may regarding the circumstances as I see them.  I will refer to my family roots at a time when we are all looking back.  I knew all four of my grandparents very well.  I saw one as from a Labour background and one as an Independent.  The two others lived with us for ten years and I knew them very closely.  One of those was as dyed-in-the-wool Fianna F&aacute;il Sliabh Luachra as possible and one was a staunch Michael Collins west Cork Fine Gael supporter.  They hated each other's politics but they got into bed together for 50-odd years and it seemed to work as a relationship despite their dramatic differences.  In the recent days, I sense Fine Gael Members opposite, clutched together, the boys all in the bed with the sheets right up to themselves, pointing across and saying that the rest can have a civil partnership but we know it would not work or be a proper partnership.  It would not be civil, given the circumstances we have in this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We need a Government and it may be time, as the numbers work, for the civil war divide to come to an end.  It may be possible to do that without opening a new divide, pretending that a left-right divide is the defining issue of our time.  We know the right has to learn that business must show it has a soul and social responsibility.  The left must know how wealth can be generated to pay for the social services we also need.  I heard Deputy Varadkar the other day on the radio speaking a truth that my party learned as part of a Government.  We must start on the basis of trust and certain civility.  It takes time to achieve the changes we must make.  It would not be right or in the interest of a party or the public to set up some sort of short-term arrangement that everybody knows will fail.</p>  <p>  In thinking big for the long term and about taking time, I indicate that the progeny of the grandparents I mentioned turned out to be green.  I say to those in the position to form a Government that we would like to see them take some leadership in this respect.  There was a meeting in the audiovisual centre last night that set out the stark reality of the science that is facing us.  These issues, including the protection of our living systems upon which we depend, trump everything.  If a Government is not formed that is willing to show leadership and position Ireland to take its place in the nations of the world as a country accepting that responsibility, grabbing the opportunity to create a new economic model that is socially just, it is not worthy of anyone's support.</p>  <p>  We have four or five weeks to see whether that is possible.  We will not be voting for any Taoiseach today and it is likely we will go into opposition in a proposing mode.  We suggest to those who have the opportunity to create a Government that they should not miss this historic opportunity or let the Irish people down.  Let us have a civil coalition arrangement and let this D&aacute;il work in the way the Ceann Comhairle suggested when he spoke earlier.</p></speech>

Most people watching at home would be struck by the deep disconnect between the rhetoric of this Chamber and their own lives.  The speakers from the former Government parties have spoken left and right.  Between unemployment, activation schemes and emigration, there are 500,000 people who are the collateral damage of this last Government's economic policies.  I met an elderly woman in Meath recently who had to battle her way through the health service in this country.  She felt the health service had been deeply vandalised by the last Government.  She was experiencing delayed diagnosis and treatment and hundreds of thousands of people are like her.  The answer of the previous Government is to delay the proper functioning of the D&aacute;il, so her issues will not be dealt with.</p><p>For the past four years we have had an immediate housing crisis, but that term is an oxymoron.  Homeless people can see closed housing estates across the State.  Today, they will see the two largest parties talking about closing this House down for another month before those issues can be dealt with.</p> <p> We cannot divorce the realities and immediacy of the crisis facing people outside this Chamber.  The Irish people are tolerant but that tolerance is a limited resource and will soon be spent. </p></speech>

It is nothing personal against either Deputy but if one looks at the role the Taoiseach has played over the past five years it is clear that he betrayed the mandate he was given in 2011.  Long gone is the democratic revolution that he proclaimed.  There are many reasons we should not elect Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I will give him 203 reasons.  That is the number of people who lost their homes to the banks in the past three months of 2015.  I will give the Taoiseach 511 reasons, which is the number of people who have been lying on hospital trolleys as we sit here discussing these issues today.  I will give him 1,600 reasons, which is the number of children who will go to sleep in emergency accommodation in our capital city and elsewhere as we discuss these issues here.  They are the reasons he should not be elected as Taoiseach because he allowed that to happen on his watch.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach talks about how he said goodbye to the troika but he rolled over on every single occasion.  He adopted a policy of no bondholder being left behind, and he picked the pockets of the ordinary people of this State to pay for that indulgence.  He did so in the form of water charges and property taxes.  </p>  <p>  There has been much discussion about political reform, which is the new buzz word in recent weeks.</p></speech>

Sometimes I feel that when one walks through the gates of Leinster House one is entering a twilight zone because everybody believes that D&aacute;il reform is the number one issue.  D&aacute;il reform is important; of course it is important that we figure out how to divvy up speaking time, who chairs different committees and how we deal with x, y and z.  However, of the thousands of people I met and canvassed in Donegal, not one mentioned the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  I did not hear one whisper of D&aacute;il reform on the doorsteps in Donegal and I would say that was also the case in many other constituencies.</p>  <p>  People were talking to me about other matters.  A woman with two children wondered what she would do since she was up in court because the banks want to repossess her house.  She does not know where to turn.  Another mother spoke to me almost in tears.  She has a child with life-limiting conditions yet she cannot get support from the HSE.  She is exhausted from battling the system.  I spoke to a grandmother who worked to build this country into what it is today.  She talked about her disappointment after Christmas when she saw her daughter and granddaughter leaving for Australia again.  Those are the issues the people of this country voted each and every one of us in here to deal with.  If we want to fix D&aacute;il reform we can do it overnight, it is simple.  Let us get down to the real issues, however, and deal with the real problems we have.  There was a crisis in health just before the election, but there is still a crisis in health.  There is a crisis in accommodation, including housing, which is still there.  There is also a crisis in homelessness.  If we put names to it does it make it more real to people?  If we mention the names of John Corrie and others, or the name of a woman on a trolley, will it make it real for people?  We need to get real here because there is a sense of disconnect, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned.  Political reform, including D&aacute;il reform, is important so let us do it, but let us also deal with the real issues that people want us to address.  </p></speech>

It is not an issue for many who would rather talk about how they will divvy up the positions and all the rest.  Let us deal with the real issues.  If we are really genuine about this, we should not only establish a committee on D&aacute;il reform but also committees to deal with homelessness and the 511 people on hospital trolleys.  That is what the public demand of us and that is why I will not support Deputy Kenny as Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  I welcome the maiden speech by Deputy Lisa Chambers, as I welcome all new TDs to this House.  She spoke of Deputy Martin as being the champion of political reform.  Let me remind Deputy Chambers, however, that when I made my maiden speech after winning a by-election in 2010 it only happened because I had to take Deputy Martin and his colleagues to court.  He sat on the Government side of the House and voted not once or twice, but on three occasions to deny the people of Donegal South-West for over 18 months the most precious right to cast their vote to elect a TD.  Now we have champions of political reform but I do not trust them.</p></speech>

The issue here, as Deputies on this side of the House have raised, is something which we should welcome but which surprises us.  We welcome the fact that, on all sides of this House, they are converts to political reform but where did this come from?  We got a message from the electorate which was very strong and very definite.  It was particularly pointed at that side of the House.  It was that there was to be a new politics in this country and that they were tired of the resistance of the major parties to political reform.  They wanted something new, different and radical.  Let us not pretend that this conversion has been sitting there simmering ready to erupt on the Government side; it has been forced on them.  Let us welcome that because that is the message from the electorate.  We will participate eagerly and enthusiastically in all efforts, and in the committee that the Ceann Comhairle is setting up today, for political reform in the full knowledge that that zeal for reform has come from the smaller parties and Independents in this House, and not originally from the major parties.</p><p>It is only right that the Members opposite be reminded that they spent the past five years resisting that particular policy which they are pretending to champion today.  If that committee does not succeed in introducing radical reform by agreement, we will all look like hypocrites who have not delivered a message that has been given to us by the electorate.  I want to put the Members opposite on notice that that is the message they should be getting.</p></speech>

We welcome the result of this election.  The result is not a problem; it is a solution.  It is a message that the shape of politics in this country has changed forever.  It is a message that Fine Gael and other major parties cannot simply unite to block radical reform in this country.  </p>  <p>  We in the Independent Alliance are very happy and more than willing to help and support a Government, or form a Government, that espouses reform in all areas, not just D&aacute;il reform.  Why is it that we have we set up a committee today, laudable as it may be, on political and D&aacute;il reform?  Why have we not set up a committee to deal with the issue of housing, and other more acute problems, before the D&aacute;il returns?  Deputy Pearse Doherty was right.  D&aacute;il reform may be fascinating to us, and it may be necessary, but it did not really come up on the doorsteps.  It was not mentioned as an immediate problem.  Why did we not set up a committee to address those immediate problems and come back in four weeks' time with proposed solutions to issues such as homelessness, negative equity, reform of the banks, and other things that have so crucially hurt the people of this country in the past five years?  We have an opportunity and we will engage enthusiastically with those parties to whom we are speaking, and others, if they are serious about addressing the reforms this country and the electorate have demanded from us.  However, I fear that there is a movement once again towards traditional old politics.  We must resist that.  That is the message we are giving today, and we will not and cannot support anybody who does not come to us with what we regard as a solution for which we can vote.  We will enthusiastically help to form a Government with the six members of the Independent Alliance, who increased their representation by 50% - a lot more than many others in the last election - and, regardless of personality, support those who embrace our reform agenda.</p></speech>

This is an important day for everybody in this House who has been elected.  It is particularly important and special for all those who have been elected for the first time, myself included.  What we have seen over the past hour or so is a piece of political theatre.  There are many issues affecting people outside this House that need to be addressed.  We all know what they are.</p>  <p>  When I listened to the T&aacute;naiste's speech, it was very clear that she and Labour Party had not learned the lessons of the election campaign and were not prepared to take responsibility for their failures.  The reason the Labour Party was decimated in this election was that we have people lying on hospital trolleys, children sleeping in emergency accommodation and people in dire straits and living in poverty.</p></speech>

There is no point in the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach or anybody else blaming Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody in the Opposition for their failures.

I do not envy his job, given some of the bickering I have heard today.  I have not been in the D&aacute;il long.  I hope that, across the divide, we will give everyone an opportunity to speak and not butt in and criticise what they have to say.  Every Member of this D&aacute;il is elected by people who went to a ballot box and put their stroke down for these people.  I would like to see a D&aacute;il where we are all treated in a fair and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  There is an opportunity in this new D&aacute;il for all of us to start working together.  As we went around the country, we saw an island of two economies.  We have seen people whose children are in a foreign land crying on the doorstep.  We have seen people who have problems with unemployment and a rural Ireland that has been forgotten.  I welcome the fact that all the main parties have been talking about a Minister for rural affairs over the past few days.  However, I urge that power and muscle be put behind that to make sure that rural Ireland gets the lift it needs.  I have seen a health system that is in chaos in different parts of Ireland.  Let us be honest with the people.  It will not be solved tomorrow.  The only way it will be solved is for people right across the divide to put their heads together and work together.  We must give hope to the people out there who are losing hope and show that things can be changed, because that is the responsibility on our shoulders as newly elected politicians.  </p>  <p>  As Deputy Ross said earlier, we are not afraid to stand up and be counted.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I would ask the new Government to make sure that the five pillars required, including agriculture, infrastructure, communications, jobs and enterprise for rural Ireland, are fair and equitable and that there is rural-proofing of all decisions.  I know there is a housing crisis in Dublin and around the country but there are solutions to this if we use our heads and do not act in a complicated way.  In this country we are great at complicating simple matters.  Working together we can solve many problems.</p></speech>

This day four weeks ago I had no idea or ever dreamt that I would be addressing D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a Member of the 32nd D&aacute;il.

They are looking at us today and wondering what is going on.  In the same way as the parties proposed their leaders for Taoiseach, I could have proposed my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, for Taoiseach but I would never try to make a laugh of the country.  That is what is going on here today.  I am sorry to say I will be voting against the four nominees proposed here because they are not providing a permutation that will work as a government this evening.  More talking needs to be done, and more should have been done in the past two weeks since the election.</p>  <p>  The people of Ireland played their part.  They voted for every Deputy here.  They are relying on all of us to come together and form a government.  There is talk that we may have to have another election.  What difference will that make?  Will the people of Ireland change their minds in a few weeks?  I do not think so.</p>  <p>  I do not know what happened in the Civil War; it was long before my time but there is a lot of talk about it.  The bigger parties must get together and offer us a government and give over what I call posturing because time is slipping by.  Imagine if a referee was in Croke Park on the third Sunday in September and Kerry and Dublin were in the field and the referee had no ball.  That is what we are like here today.  We have nothing substantial to vote for from any side.  I will be voting against the people proposed today. </p>  <p>  There is talk about four weeks.  That is too long.  Two weeks is too long.  The parties will have to get together and give us a proper permutation that will provide a stable government for the country.  The people voted; they have spoken.  It is up to the parties to forget about the past.  The future is what we want.  We are living for today.  They have the ball in their hands.  They should not drop it.  They will have to get around the table and work together because the people are asking for that.  When I go down to Kerry tonight, they will be very disappointed that there is no government.</p>  <p>  The whole of Ireland is looking at us today.  There are many people from Kerry outside the building today.  It is sad to think we are going down without a government after all this.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said this morning, what if this number of people turned up for a wedding and the bride and groom never turned up?  It is much the same here.  The parties do not have their figures right.  They have not added them up together.  No permutation or leader proposed offers us a real chance to provide a stable government for the future.  I ask them to work better at it now.</p></speech>

To be Ceann Comhairle of this House is a great honour.  I know he will carry out that duty with great distinction, as he has conducted his role as a Deputy over the years.</p>  <p>  I was not minded to speak in this debate but perhaps my physical proximity to Deputy Ross was the catalyst for me to feel I should speak.  The election is over and we do not need to hear re-hashes.  The people have spoken.  That is not a clich&eacute;.  The 158 people assembled here have been entrusted by a vote of the people to make important decisions.  I do not think that over the duration of this particular D&aacute;il I will repeat the next sentence too often: I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that the issue of D&aacute;il reform, important as it is, was not the issue that people talked about to me at the doors of Wexford. </p>  <p>  The first constitutional duty of this House is to elect a government.  We have no quibble about the selection of the Members of this House.  That is the people&rsquo;s choice and prerogative.  Our job is to accept that and get on with providing a stable government to address all the issues.  The Labour Party stood up in 2011 and did that.  The then leader of the party said that we would face enormous difficulties and that the next time we met we would be wading through a sea of placards because we had been briefed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA and the Central Bank.  We knew the economic morass the country was in and we stepped up to the plate.  I will not argue the case for Labour again.  The people have made their choice.  It is now for others to stand up for the Republic, stand into that breach and provide a government.  The notion that somehow there are parties in this House that are exempt from that responsibility until they reach some magic quotient of numbers is not true and it is not acceptable for people to talk about crises or difficulties or people&rsquo;s terrible wounds without being willing to share the responsibility of providing a solution.</p></speech>

There are people here who regard the very notion of having to do that sort of business as beneath them.</p>  <p>  Even the notion of the centrality of reform is not a one-off issue.  Reform is a process that will go on.  Before the last D&aacute;il assembled, I was asked by my party to put forward 140 proposals, the vast bulk of which we implemented.  They were groundbreaking reforms, like the legislation to protect whistleblowing, the major expansion and empowering of the ombudsmen, the reform and repositioning of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, and much more.  Those things are for another day. </p>  <p>  Today we will vote on four nominees for Taoiseach.  By common consensus, none will command a majority in this House.  It then falls on all of us not to stand back but to stand forward and those who have sought and received an enhanced mandate need not to reject that mandate, but to use it to provide the stable government that this country and our people need.</p></speech>

Until very recently I worked as a full-time union organiser.  I represented people working in the public service so I have seen at first hand the work of the Taoiseach and Deputy Martin.</p><p>The recruitment moratorium was introduced under Fianna F&aacute;il and it was continued under Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I have seen the impact of the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party on front-line health, education and local authority workers.  These people have systematically kicked the heart out of our public services.  I could not face the people who voted for me or face the people I was privileged to represent as a trade union organiser if I were to vote for either Deputy Enda Kenny or Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p></speech>

I refer to Deputies Cullinane, Ross and Pearse Doherty.  The fact remains that the people voted for these Deputies because of what they said on the doorsteps and the manifestoes they put to the people.  Have we not learned that this is how people have voted?</p>  <p>  Irrespective of what those in the press or the two major parties might think, the people have made a decision.  They have said they want members of the Socialist Party, members of the Green Party, members of Sinn F&eacute;in, members of Fine Gael, members of the Labour Party, members of the Independent Alliance, members of the Social Democrats and non-party people.  They have dealt this deck of cards to this House.  I forgot Fianna F&aacute;il - my apologies.</p></speech>

Are we seriously thinking that in the very near future, in a few months, we can go back to the people and say, "We are not happy with how you voted; would you please vote again".  We cannot do that.  We have a responsibility to the people of Ireland to form some form of government.  Can we please stop going back five years to Fianna F&aacute;il or going back two months to Fine Gael?  We are as we are.  This is what we have.  This is what people want.  There is no point in making derogatory remarks to people calling them ultra-left, ultra-right or whatever.  These people have to be treated with respect.  They have been voted for by the electorate.  Everyone here has been voted in with a mandate to form a Government.  We have a responsibility to speak to one another and forget the idea that one party will not speak to another party or that one party will not go into power with another party or whatever.  That is not what the people have voted for.  The people have voted for the 158 people present today.  It does not matter to me if it takes the next two, three or four weeks.  I do not think it matters to the people of Ireland; what they want is stability.</p>  <p>  We are coming into some very desperate times.  In June the United Kingdom could be facing exit from the European Union.  It is not home and dry that will not happen.  That could have a detrimental effect on Ireland, depending on one's point of view.  The markets are unstable, including the markets in Japan and Germany, and we do not know what will happen in America.  We do not have six months or a year.  Having said that, we should take our time over a short or medium period of time to form a government.  I do not want to go into Civil War politics, the Blue Shirts, Sinn F&eacute;in, the IRA or whatever.  The fact remains that all 158 Members here have been voted in by the people of Ireland to form a Government; so do it.</p></speech>

I have listened very carefully to all the speeches made but in particular to the speeches proposing Deputies Enda Kenny and Miche&aacute;l Martin for the position of Taoiseach.  During those speeches people spoke about the progress that has been made over the past five years of the outgoing Government and the commitment of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to tackle the many crises that all Deputies know exist in our health system, housing system, child care and schools.</p>  <p>  As I was listening to these comments, what struck me were the families that will spend tonight in emergency accommodation and the families that will become homeless tomorrow and the day after.  What struck me when I listened to those words were the sick people lying on trolleys for which the numbers have increased again this year on last year as they did on the previous year.  In all areas of public services we can talk about families and particularly women locked out of the workforce because of the cost of child care.  We can talk about the increasing numbers of children who will go hungry because of rising child poverty rates or the still unacceptable level of young people unemployed and continuing to leave the country.</p>  <p>  I mention these people in the context of this debate on the election of Taoiseach because these people have been left behind by the outgoing Government.  They have been left behind by Deputy Enda Kenny's two-tier unfair recovery.  They are also the people who were let down when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin last sat around the Cabinet table.  To reuse a theme that Deputy Burton used, these are the people her party sacrificed when it abandoned promise after promise and voted for five regressive budgets introduced under the outgoing Government.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin made a very important point for all of us.  I did not get elected to stand on the sidelines.  I did not put my name forward and ask people to vote for me in order not to take responsibility.  However, my responsibility goes beyond just the election, as Deputy Howlin says, of a stable government.  It is to stand up for those people who have been left behind by the parties that formed the previous two Governments.  I do not believe that a Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael is in the interests of those people who have been left behind.</p>  <p>  Today on Kildare Street outside Leinster House there is an Oxfam campaign van calling on this D&aacute;il to make equality its top priority.  We have had 88 years of the inequality in Irish society led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  My responsibility as a new Deputy, whether in government or in opposition, is to champion that cause of equality and challenge the policies that have generated such deep levels of inequality in order to try to make this country a better place.  That is the reason that not only will I not be voting for Deputy Enda Kenny or Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, but also the reason I will proudly vote for the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="03:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000025#TT00200"><p>First, I would like to congratulate the many Deputies who have been elected to this House for the first time.  This is a special day in their lives and one I am sure they will remember.  It is a special day for them and their families, and I hope that after the proceedings die down they will remember it with a degree of fondness.  I would also like to express my commiseration to the many former Members who were not re-elected on this occasion, many of whom did sterling work in the interests of the country and its people, particularly during the recent crisis years.</p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il has so far failed to agree on the nomination of a Taoiseach.  Therefore, in accordance with the precedent set in 1989 and followed through in 1992, after today's sitting has concluded, I will inform the President of my resignation from office.  In accordance with Article 28.11 of the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Government and I will continue to carry out our duties until a new Government has been appointed.  Let me assure the Irish people that the Government remains in place and that I and my Cabinet colleagues will continue to work hard in the best interests of the country and of all the people.  My immediate duties as Taoiseach include official travel to Washington to meet the US President, Mr. Obama, the Vice President, Mr. Biden, and the Speaker, Mr. Ryan, for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  Following that, I will attend the European Council meeting in Brussels, which will discuss a number of important issues, including in particular the migration crisis, which has enormous implications for European Union, the future of the Schengen area and the Dublin Convention itself.  The Government and the State agencies are also fully engaged in preparation for the centenary commemoration of the Easter Rising, which will be a respectful and inclusive occasion to mark a truly seminal moment in our democratic history.</p>  <p>  Beyond these immediate events, a range of important issues and challenges face Ireland.  The careful management of the economy and the public finances must and will remain a priority, particularly in the complex and uncertain international economic environment.  The presentation of the Spring Economic Statement, the introduction of a new way of dealing with the Estimates, and the presentation of the budget in approximately 28 weeks' time are matters to be focused on.  In a matter of a few short months, the people of the United Kingdom will vote on their future relationship with the European Union, the outcome of which has huge implications for this country and for Northern Ireland.  While Brexit may not have been an issue on the doorsteps in the recent election, it is an issue that is coming at us and the implications are not to be underestimated.  We will continue to provide jobs for our people by driving the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs, which has been so successful at reducing the rate of unemployment from 15% in 2011 to 8.8% today.  We will work in a diligent way on the critical discussions that must take place at a European level now in respect of climate change issues that are arising and that must be dealt with in the near future.</p>  <p>  Five years ago, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party entered government, we did so at a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty for Ireland.  At that time, our very survival was in doubt.  Public finances were out of control, jobs were decimated at an alarming rate and Government had to face unprecedented difficulties.  Many believed the situation was hopeless and that rescuing the economy and ending the bailout was virtually impossible.</p><p>The Government faced that crisis head on, with tough and very difficult decisions taken that we knew well would be unpopular, and they still have a lasting effect on many people.  They were necessary, and as a result of those decisions being taken to end the crisis, the bailout was ended and the country is in a different place now.</p> <p> As I have acknowledged on many occasions, we did not get everything right over the past five years and we were not able to achieve all we had hoped, but the country is moving in the right direction.  I note the official Central Statistics Office preliminary figures published today demonstrate that our economy grew by 7.8% in 2015, the highest rate for 15 years and the highest rate in Europe for the second year running.  Our proposition for the re-election of the Government of Fine Gael and Labour did not receive the mandate of the people in the general election and it is incumbent on us all to work with the outcome of the recent election and the verdict given by the people.</p> <p> I thank all those who served as Members in the outgoing Government in the very difficult circumstances we inherited five years ago.  In particular, I thank the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, who was leader of the Labour Party, and the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, for their diligence, commitment and courage in standing up and making very difficult decisions in the interest of the country.  Beyond that, the backbenchers of both parties were on the receiving end of a very difficult public onslaught and I thank them for their courage in standing by the country and its people.  Many of them are not here today because of the outcome of the general election.</p> <p> We must continue to address the very real issues in the health area, homelessness and housing.  These are not issues that can be put on hold until a new Government is appointed and they will not be put on hold.  It is incumbent on us all with the privilege of serving in the 32nd D&aacute;il to intensify our efforts to provide this country with a lasting and durable Government.  Since the general election, my colleagues and I in the Fine Gael Party have been deeply engaged in dialogue with many of the parties, groupings and individual Independent Deputies.  These discussions have been very constructive and I have found a strong consensus across the groups on the need for a stable and lasting Government.  As Taoiseach and leader of the largest party in the House, I am fully committed to working over the coming weeks to ensure the people get the Government they need and deserve and on which they have given a verdict.  I invite all those who share that common objective to work with us in the time ahead and see that it can become a reality.</p> <p> From many of the contributions I have listened to, it seems that a substantial number of people do not want to serve in a Government and to have the responsibility of making decisions for the future direction of our country.  That is their right and they are entitled to that view.  Those of us who accept the responsibilities of a mandate given by the people in respect of providing a Government for the future of our people and country have a duty to face those responsibilities and deal with them in the best way possible.  There are options and it behoves those of us who accept responsibility, as I do as Taoiseach, Head of Government and leader of my party, to examine all those options in the interests of providing this country with a working Government that will last.</p> <p> While the work of forming a stable Government is going on, there must be clear consensus, as there is in the House, that a process should be put in place to make that become a reality.  I am glad the Ceann Comhairle is the recipient of his authority after being independently voted on through the reform example of a secret ballot in the House.  It is true that D&aacute;il reform was not the issue on every doorstep in every constituency; of course it was not.  We also made the change when D&aacute;il committees are set up of allocating members according to the d'Hondt system.  The committees will no longer be the preserve of the Taoiseach or the ruling parties of the day but will be weighted in terms of the numbers of seats that groups and individuals have.  In that sense, I am very glad to see the increased number of women Members in the House.  I know there was controversy about the selection process and the issue of quotas, but regardless of whether it was a help, everybody is here in his or her own right and on the basis of his or her qualities, personality and strength of conviction.  Long may that continue and we would like to see such reform increase in the years ahead.</p> <p> Pre-legislative scrutiny has been an important issue of reform that has allowed further engagement for Members.  Having spoken to most Members at this stage, I am very committed to understanding that the respect and integrity of every Deputy must be seen.  In return for that, there will be a change in the way business is done at committee level.  It will not just be a case of wanting more money for this or that every week.  The pot is not endless and people must make recommendations based on their own views about how issues are prioritised.  That will change the nature of debate and the work of committees so that the Executive and Cabinet can make decisions in a much more informed manner arising from a really comprehensive set of discussions.  I wish the Ceann Comhairle the best in his chairing of a standing committee to deal with issues that Members on all sides, including new Members and those here for years, can raise.</p> <p> This is obviously not the outcome I personally would have liked to see.  I respect the verdict of the people in the general election and that of the House.  I shall in due course tender my resignation to the President in accordance with the relevant article of the Constitution and see that the Government continues its work in the interests of the people and the country until a new Government is endorsed by the House.</p></speech>

No. 5<i>a</i>regards transitional arrangements for the committee dealing with European Union business.  No. 5<i>b</i>is an all-party motion regarding the establishment of a committee to deal with proposals for D&aacute;il reform and No. 5<i>c</i>is a motion regarding the adjournment today and the date on which the House will reconvene.  I suggest that the Taoiseach could move the first motion and perhaps he might suggest that a speaker from each group could respond.  We can address the motions collectively.</p></speech>

One of them relates to water charges and the majority of Deputies have the mandate to abolish water charges.  Why are these motions not on the supplementary Order Paper and why are we not respecting the mandate we have been given to end water charges and Irish Water?  It is very clear that water charges are dead and gone.  They have been buried with Irish Water, and that happened in the general election.  Why are those motions not before us today?  Why are there three other motions?</p></speech>

We submitted these motions in good faith.  There is a scandal around NAMA and I and others have asked for the past two years straight questions of the Government but we never got answers on them.  The committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly has now brought forward a very detailed report, and part of the motions spoken about by an Teachta Doherty include a request for a commission of investigation into that matter.  Why may we not debate that?  We have also submitted a motion relating to the crisis in the health services.  Why may we not debate that?</p></speech>

The establishment of a committee on D&aacute;il reform may address how these matters are to be dealt with in future, as well as issues of timing.

I heard your explanation concerning the constitutional aspect of the setting up of committees and so on but, as Deputy Adams said, in one of those motions we also called for a commission of investigation.  The Taoiseach said that the health crisis would not be put on the long finger, yet, according to the motions that we are now to discuss, health will not be discussed at the next sitting or on 6 April when we return after the break.  I therefore ask that these motions be placed on a Supplementary Order Paper.  I suggest that we adjourn until that happens, so that when we resume on 22 March we will have the four motions before us that can be debated on those days.</p></speech>

Last month the Irish people chose to elect a highly diverse D&aacute;il.  Each Member of this House carries a mandate and a duty to represent those who elected them and to fight for the policies they advocated when seeking support.</p><p>I congratulate all new Members who have been elected.  Each of them has an obligation to work towards resolving the many issues that we met on the campaign trail.  I offer commiserations to those who were not successful in being elected but who had the courage to put themselves forward and compete in a parliamentary democracy.  </p><p>No one in here carries the right to claim to speak on behalf of all of the people, or to tell others what their mandates represent.  We have had an element of that already this afternoon.  There is only one core message that we must all acknowledge, which is that a strong majority of the Irish people have voted for change.  They have voted for a change of government and a change of priorities and, of course, they have voted for a different type of politics.  </p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has emerged from this election with the support of over half a million people.  I want to welcome my new colleagues and to acknowledge the incredible work of our members in every part of the country.  We have gained the largest increase in vote of any party and have more than doubled our representation.  We did so based on a very clear platform of priorities for this D&aacute;il and a specific approach to delivering the change we believe is needed.  We argued that the outgoing Government should be replaced and that Fine Gael policy in particular had been divisive and unfair.  This remains our position.</p><p>Following this vote, the most urgent question for us all, as Members of the D&aacute;il, is how we will move forward in addressing the desire of the people for change.  It is our intention as a party to continue to work for the permanent removal of the now acting Government.  As we have been outlining in discussions with various parties, groups and individual Deputies, our immediate priorities are for urgent action on the housing emergency, addressing the growing inequality in the availability and quality of employment, reversing damaging health policies, and implementing a series of measures to support communities and families.  We have been encouraged by the response in many of our discussions to date and have indicated that we will continue them in a more intensive manner after today&rsquo;s votes.  There has been a lot of talk about strong government.  I believe that what the people want first and foremost is good government.  Some of the worst governments in the world are strong, and the acting Government was rejected by the people after five years of the strongest majority in our history.</p><p>We should all realise that one of the arguments that failed to persuade the people was the claim that there would be chaos unless we immediately had a new Government with a solid majority.  If we respect the will of the people, then it is time to put aside the argument that the speed of formation and the size of the majority are what matters in choosing a new Taoiseach and Government.</p><p>Following this vote, the situation we find ourselves in is far from unprecedented.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has twice in the past failed to nominate a Taoiseach on its first day.  There have also been instances in which a Taoiseach lost support and there was a delay in electing a new Taoiseach.  In 1992, the formation of a new Government took nearly two months.  During that time urgent business was addressed, including the passage of critical Supplementary Estimates and a Finance Bill measure.  Given the fact that the budget has already been passed and there is no urgent Government measure which requires D&aacute;il sanction, we clearly have the time to deliver a Government that respects the views of the Irish people.  In fact, Ireland is relatively unusual in how fast it normally carries out the business of Government formation.  This may well be one of the reasons for the fact that the focus is often placed on who holds power rather than what they do with it.</p><p>We have already talked about the need to reduce the excessive control of Government on the work of our Parliament. Let us now show that we are serious by taking up this challenge at the start of the 32nd D&aacute;il in an inclusive and urgent way.  Let us do this with a commitment to making this a D&aacute;il in which all Members have both the opportunity and the obligation to contribute and be accountable.  Motion 5<i>b</i>is a commendable step in that direction, but we are keen that the committee reach a conclusion before 6 April and that it make recommendations that can be immediately introduced to amend Standing Orders in a way that will fundamentally alter how we do our business in this House.</p><p>Reform cannot just be about how we ask questions and the timing of legislation; it has to be much deeper.  We need a D&aacute;il that is more independent of the Government, but we also need a D&aacute;il that is more expert in its work and in which the proposals it considers, whichever part of the House they emanate from, are subject to real scrutiny.  That is why I and my party took the initiative, while many of the counts were still ongoing, of calling for D&aacute;il reform as the first item on our agenda.  We welcome the fact that there is now a consensus on this.  The failure of D&aacute;il reform efforts in the past has been founded on the fact that the process has been in the hands of a Government majority.  If we truly want to change the way we do our business, then the best way to do this is to reach agreement on reform before there is such a majority in place.  This is an issue that we as a party have addressed repeatedly in recent years, publishing a list of more than 100 specific reforms.  We have gone beyond general principles and set out exactly how procedures and structures can be reformed in order to implement those principles.</p><p>The consensus in favour of a cross-House committee chaired by our new Ceann Comhairle is welcome.  Certain reform efforts require consideration of constitutional issues as well as complex statutory provisions.  However, many simply involve the passing of procedural amendments.  We believe there is enough detail in the proposals that have already been prepared by parties and Deputies to ensure that proposals for immediate and specific reform can be ready within weeks.  I am pointing that out despite the degree to which some Deputies in today's debate have tried to scoff and pour scorn on the urgency of D&aacute;il reform.  People talk about Irish Water and the debacle that it became.  That is intrinsically connected to the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  Why?  It is because the Water Services Bill was rammed through in 24 hours without any proper scrutiny in the House at all.</p></speech>

My point is that D&aacute;il reform is essential in terms of how we deal with issues that are critical to people's lives, including health.  We have had a lot of discussion in the last while about having proper parliamentary engagement on that issue.  Let us not just pour scorn, as some Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies tried to do earlier, on the importance of D&aacute;il reform and its connection with good policy formulation and good outcomes on the key issues that concern the Irish people today.</p>  <p>  We believe that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is in a position to immediately take up urgent matters that were central to the election campaign.  That is why I approve of the proposal to bring the D&aacute;il back on Tuesday, 22 March to debate the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and housing matters.  We also tabled a motion on housing today, but we sought consensus with other parties in order to ensure an ordered approach.  We did not try to monopolise the situation by saying that we are the only party that cares about housing and health.  Everyone genuinely has an interest in these issues, so it makes sense to have a consensus and some degree of efficiency in how we conduct our business on 22 March.</p><p>If people want to debate more, I am open and willing to do that on 22 March, or 23 March if people want that.  It is important that this has been provided for when the D&aacute;il returns.  If we want to break the dominance of Government in all D&aacute;il matters, there is no better way to start, as we said earlier in our consultations with others, than to schedule issues for debate without the immediate distortion that comes from the House being divided into two sides.  We accept that it would be a constitutional nonsense to expect Ministers who do not hold the confidence of the House to be accountable for future policy so let us begin-----</p></speech>

He should allow me to make my contribution to the House.  It would not be possible, so let us begin our work by holding debates where all Deputies have an opportunity to set out constructive action on the issues that should dominate the proceedings of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I think we have had the agreement of most of the parties in terms of how we schedule these debates around the housing emergency and other issues.  There is precedent for this with at least one lengthy policy debate held on urgent European matters in the period of the acting Government after the 1992 election.  Should other urgent business appear in the weeks ahead, and the outgoing Government has so far not indicated that such business is likely, there will be no difficulty in addressing it before the new Government is formed.</p>  <p>  In the past, there has been tendency for leaders and Deputies to stand up and simply seek to re-run the election in their contributions following the vote on the election of An Taoiseach.  I have chosen not to do so today but instead to be constructive about how we can make this a D&aacute;il that delivers to the people credible change in how we do our business and how we make sure we are focused on the people's concerns.  We have a strong democratic tradition in this country.  The situation after this vote this afternoon is not exceptional.  The situation now is as it was before.  Every one of us has an obligation to work on behalf of the people who elected us and on behalf of our country.  Notwithstanding the ritual condemnation of Fianna F&aacute;il by some today and the alleged damage we have done, I noted the degree to which some of them were very anxious to get us into Government as quickly as possible.  In doing this, our first obligation is to operate in accordance with the mandate we sought.  In the days and weeks ahead, my party and I will continue to do this.  Our priority remains to deliver the change of Government, change of politics and change of priorities which the people have so clearly demanded.</p></speech>

I would warn against excessive procrastination.  The people have spoken and have given mandates to many of the parties here.  There can only be one outcome to the different mandates that is positive for people.  This is the formation of a Government that has the capacity to govern wisely and well in the interests of all of the people of Ireland.  The issue of D&aacute;il reform is important but I would argue that it is secondary to the interests of the people in the formation of a solid, stable and balanced Government for this country.  The people have voted and given mandates as they did so to a variety of different political parties.  Political parties cannot just decide to sit back and not be involved in what the people voted for.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach and possibly the Ceann Comhairle to take the initiative to provide that on each of the days on which the D&aacute;il is assembled - 23 March and 6 April 2016 - there will be a report by the Taoiseach to the House on what progress has been made towards the formation of Government.  I have no problem with the issues that have been identified for debate if that can be agreed.  They are significant issues but they are secondary in terms of the constitutional imperative that the country will need a Government and that there should not be excessive procrastination.  Of course, there must be discussions and people must grapple with new realities in respect of how people voted, which may not have been the outcome for which they wished.  The outcome for which the people voted is here in this House and people cannot avoid their responsibility to give the people of this country a stable and, hopefully, lasting Government.</p>  <p>  Inherent in many of the contributions today is an implicit recognition that the country has moved on, not to a perfect place but to a far better place than was the case when we took over in 2011.  As is the case after every election, there is a need for more progress to be made for people's conditions to be improved but that does not mean that we should take for granted the progress that has been made such as the fact that we can now borrow on international markets.  When we came into office, Ireland could only borrow at interest rates of around 10%.  We can now borrow at interest rates of roughly below 1%.  Excessive procrastination will send out a message about the country.  On reflection, people may wish to acknowledge that not everything is perfect in the country but that very significant progress has made, not least the fact that the level of unemployment has fallen from a high of over 15%, so-----</p></speech>

How ironic is it that they have been punished by the electorate for doing so?  Voters correctly rejected Labour&rsquo;s way and Fine Gael&rsquo;s way and the largest majority in the history of this State was squandered.  They also rejected the Fianna F&aacute;il policy which Teachta Martin rightly reminded us that Fine Gael and Labour were implementing.  I take this opportunity to welcome Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s conversion to the politics or at least the rhetoric of fairness that has given the party a bounce in the polls but the electorate will be unforgiving if Fianna F&aacute;il fails to match its words with action.</p>  <p>  Several speakers, including the Ceann Comhairle, referred to this year as being the centenary of this Republic.  That is incorrect.  This is not the republic proclaimed in 1916.  It is not the republic of Pearse or Connolly and the spirit of the first D&aacute;il is not embodied in this D&aacute;il.  In fact, the spirit of the 3rd D&aacute;il, established in August 1922 for 26 counties, is what is represented here.  At least the Ceann Comhairle and others who spoke on this issue should be clear about that.  The republic of 1916 is still to be established and all of us, whatever our party political and individual positions, should endeavour to achieve that and to work every day for that, not just every 100 years.</p>  <p>  In that spirit, I welcome all new Deputies here today, including the 12 new Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and wish them and everybody else here the very best in their roles.  I thank everyone who voted, stood and worked for our party and all of our families.  Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir &eacute; a bheith tofa ag an bpobal, ach go h&aacute;irithe mar Theachta de chuid Shinn F&eacute;in.  I also extend my best regards to those who, for a variety of reasons, whether through retirement or loss of their seats, have not returned to the 32nd D&aacute;il and thank them for their contribution to the 31st D&aacute;il.  Thug Sinn F&eacute;in faoin dtoghch&aacute;n seo le plean chun toradh a bheadh c&oacute;ir a bhaint amach, i gcomhph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht le na daoine eile sa ghr&uacute;pa Right2Change.  Th&aacute;inig m&eacute;ad&uacute; m&oacute;r ar &aacute;r gcuid taca&iacute;ochta.  As the party with the largest number of votes on this island, as the largest bloc within the Right2Change movement, as the third largest party in the D&aacute;il and the main party of the working class, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to get on with the work of building with others a progressive alternative to the politics of the establishment.  There is an urgent need.  It is a deadly serious urgent issue for people who are denied equality that they should have equality, fairness and public services-----</p></speech>

I believe, and here is the nub of my remarks, that we should be allowed to get on with the work we were sent in here to do.  There has been, since the aftermath of the election, a domination of the media and the other play-acting that is going on, shadow-boxing on behalf of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  We are being told now that we cannot deal with the issues we want dealt with.  Each of us, every Deputy, has the responsibility to fulfil the functions assigned to us.  That does not include adjourning the D&aacute;il to facilitate what we have seen thus far.

That is for the reading of statements.  We have lodged four motions and we will table an amendment for a debate on scrapping water charges, on the hospital and health crisis and on the need for a national monument to take in all of Moore Street.</p>  <p>  I want to make the case again for an investigation into the sale of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA&rsquo;s, Northern loan book.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste have all dodged that question for the past two years when I and others put it to them.  The Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;s Committee for Finance and Personnel has just published a progress report on its investigation and put 2,000 pages of evidence, including much material which was previously undisclosed, into the public domain.  Why can these critically important issues not be debated here?  The committee was rightly critical of both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and NAMA for the way they handled the sale.  This is the people&rsquo;s money.  The Taoiseach should make a statement to the D&aacute;il on that matter sooner rather than later and we should be able to debate that entire scandal here.</p>  <p>  We support the establishment of a sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform as provided for under Standing Order 107.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an Ceann Comhairle ina chathaoirleach ar an gcoiste sin agus go mbeadh sc&eacute;ala ar ais againn sa D&aacute;il faoi cheann cheithre seachtaine.  Meaningful reform of the D&aacute;il has to include the notion of a rotating Leas-Cheann Comhairle, end the practice of excluding the introduction of money Bills from the Opposition benches, afford Oireachtas committees the power to introduce legislation, allow Members decide what the business of the D&aacute;il will be - that should not be the preserve of the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip - and provide for Northern representation here, without voting rights but with speaking rights, which was agreed by a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach and ourselves and others.  T&aacute; a fhios agam, &oacute;n m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Ceann Comhairle, go bhfuil s&eacute; ar son deis a thabhairt do Theachta&iacute; na ruda&iacute; seo a phl&eacute;igh.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an deis againn &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach tells us he is now going to proceed, as he is bound to, to place his resignation in the hands of the President.  He remains the caretaker Taoiseach and the Ministers remain in situ.  They have the right, and I would argue the duty and the responsibility, to attend and be heard in this Chamber.  They are going to come in and make statements but they cannot be held accountable.  It is our firm view that they should be held accountable for their actions and decisions and that the D&aacute;il should meet at least one day a week for meaningful debate, not just to go through the motions or for the optics.</p>  <p>  Those of us present here and our party sought a very clear mandate to deal with the issues of, for example, the homeless who remain homeless as we sit here, the families in mortgage distress, the victims of the recent flooding who have still to get redress and others in rural Ireland who have been let down.</p><p>I received a call today from a Magdalen laundries survivor who had not yet received a full pension, despite assurances from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The outgoing Ministers will not have a problem in receiving their pensions.  There are still children suffering from long-term illnesses who cannot receive full medical cards.</p></speech>

If the establishment parties do not want to debate these issues, that is fair enough and we will have to abide by that, but I have always believed people are essentially decent and even if they are not directly affected by these issues, they want everybody to be treated fairly and decently.  They want us to find solutions and be accountable for our actions.  We are obliged to fulfil our mandate.

Obviously, special speaking rights have been given to various groups, including my own, Independents for Change.  However, there is no reference to Independents generally, including colleagues such as Deputy Thomas Pringle and others.  In the spirit of D&aacute;il reform which you espoused in your speech earlier, it is very important to amend No. 5<i>c</i>to include special speaking rights for Independents because at that stage we will not have a Technical Group.</p><p>The Ceann Comhairle will have a very special role in forming a committee, in which I may be involved.  One of the ideas you might pursue is having a permanent standing Estimates committee in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I believe the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have made some reference to special budget offices in the Oireachtas.  It is critical for us to have a committee which would be a mirror image the Committee of Public Accounts which looks at past spending.  However, forward spending should also be looked at.</p><p>It is incumbent on everybody in the House to accept the results of the general election and that the people have spoken, especially in their decision on water taxes and their clear wish that Irish Water and water taxes be abolished.  It is incumbent on all of us to accept that.  However, I agree with one point the T&aacute;naiste made.  On 22 March we should receive an update on what has been done to form a government.  That is the responsibility of the major parties, whether we are talking about a grand coalition or something like confidence and supply.  Some such arrangement should be made.  We should know exactly what will happen in this regard on 22 March.</p></speech>

Broughan's proposal in respect of an amendment to No. 5<i>c</i>regarding the speaking order of the differing groupings in the opening sessions in order to recognise that there are Independent Members in the House, particularly in the light of the sentiment expressed in No. 5<i>b</i>to establish a standing committee to look at the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  In that context, the order should be amended to reflect the fact that the Independents should have speaking rights in the opening sessions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1348" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="03:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000030#YY01100"><p>Earlier I said this D&aacute;il must see fundamental departures from the policies in the previous two D&aacute;ileanna.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned how easy and cheap it was to borrow.  I wonder what that means to the 1,600 children in emergency hotel accommodation tonight.  What does it mean to the 82 constituents of mine who were on hospital trolleys yesterday and the 511 patients on hospital trolleys around the country today?  This D&aacute;il needs to send a very clear message to the public that there will be fundamental change and that the Members of the 32nd D&aacute;il will ensure the most vulnerable people in society will be protected.  I have tabled a motion to that effect and expect it to be taken during this sitting of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>On reform, I welcome the motion.  Like most others, I am a signatory to it and it appears to have been agreed to by most Members and most parties.  It is a very important and fundamental matter which needs to be dealt with urgently before the formation of a new government.  If it is not done before the formation of a new government, nobody believes it will ever be.  That type of reform is not good enough.  We need the public, the electorate, to be brought centre stage in the democratic process.  That means ensuring there will be a mechanism whereby Oireachtas Members who break their commitments and promises to the public can be recalled by the public.  We must restore the elements that were included in the first Constitution whereby the public could initiate referenda and initiate and amend legislation.</p><p>We also need to ensure there will be no giving away of State assets such as the &euro;31 billion in Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes, which was done without the approval of the D&aacute;il.  One of our Deputies is contesting it in the Supreme Court.  It is vital that any such proposal be subject to D&aacute;il approval.  There are a number of other issues, on which I will be making submissions to the committee.</p><p>I concur with Deputies Thomas P. Broughan and Thomas Pringle who drew attention to No. 5<i>b</i>.  We have heard a lot this evening about D&aacute;il reform.  We have heard the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin go on about it for quite some time.  It is ironic that in the very first piece of D&aacute;il business to be conducted on 22 March some 19 Independent Deputies will be excluded from speaking.  I hope that is not the message we will send from this first meeting of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I hope, expect and demand that the proposal be amended to ensure every Member of the House will be entitled to speak.</p></speech>

We spent several weeks campaigning on our different policies, priorities and political records, but now the judgment has been made.  Our job is to act as swiftly as possible on that judgment and to respond to the concerns, the needs and priorities expressed by the people, both in terms of political reform and the pressing issues which face vast numbers of our citizens.  The prerequisite for us moving to address those issues is the formation of a Government.  Much as I would like for the parties of the left to be in a position to form a Government, we are not in a position to do so.  That is a campaign which we must continue, namely to convince people of our policies and our priorities.  Of course, we will continue to do that.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the responsibility to move swiftly to form a Government lies with those in a position to do so.  One judgment made by the people, which to my mind is beyond dispute, is that they have asked us to move beyond Civil War factional politics.  Instead, they want issue-based politics.  Those parties, whose histories lie in Civil War divisions but where no real substantial differences exist on issues or policies, have a responsibility not to allow tribal or factional differences delay the formation of a Government, so that we can move on to the issues which need to be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  For our part, as a small part of this D&aacute;il, the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group is willing to talk to anybody about addressing those issues.  However, realistically, we do not believe we have the same approach to addressing them as do those parties which have the numbers and are in a position to form the majority.  We will do so on committees, whether it is to do with D&aacute;il reform or elsewhere and we will work with and discuss with others ways of addressing those issues.  Now, however, a Government must be formed so we can move on to that discussion.</p>  <p>  While a combination of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is not the Government I would want, they have a responsibility now to explain why they cannot form a Government or move on to form one.</p></speech>

Again, I would ask for humility in the face of the judgment of the people.  Nobody here has a monopoly on demanding or calling for political reform.  That demand has come from the people through the ballot box and in many movements on different issues affecting our society, whether it is water, hospitals, disability, young people and the issues that face them, or communities which have been desperately disadvantaged and hurt over the past several years.  It is the responsibility of all of us - it is why I welcome this motion - to respect the judgment made and to allow this D&aacute;il to have a diversity of voices, as well as a parity of esteem among those different forces elected to this House.  They must all have the opportunity to speak, debate, as well as put forward their ideas, policies and priorities.  These should not just be noble words spoken on the first day of the D&aacute;il, soon to be forgotten.  This business has to be done and settled.  Everybody has said today that they want to see it happen.  Now it has to happen because we had similar promises before.</p>  <p>  I agree with the points made by Deputies Pringle, Healy and Broughan.  It is an error in this motion not to have reference to the Independents, notwithstanding the need for the more detailed debate about changes to the rules of this House.  The motion should be amended to include Independent Members who are not of any of those groups referred to in it.  The Government must acknowledge that this amendment must be included.</p>  <p>  There will be a debate about what messages have been sent by the electorate.  Several of them are incontrovertible and are not open for debate.  Ninety-nine Deputies elected to this House were elected on a pledge to either abolish water charges or, at least, suspend them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-03-10a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1371" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="03:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016031000031#ZZ00800"><p>That is fine but the Deputy is going beyond the terms of the three motions before us.</p></speech>

That is a challenge to those who are talking about democracy, making this House relevant to people who are alienated from politics and that they live up to their pledges.  There should be no attempt to slither out of pledges made in pursuit of votes in the election that has just gone.  There is an incontrovertible message which must be acted upon and that water charges have to go.</p>  <p>  An urgency was expressed about the situations in housing and homelessness and in our health service.  These are challenges to which all of us must respond urgently.  The situation regarding them is not acceptable.  All of us have to put up our hands and say they have not been addressed over the past five years but must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I met a man I happen to know outside on the street who informed me that his daughter, who is in a wheelchair, went to accident and emergency in St. Vincent's hospital today.  He was told by a consultant that she might be four days on a trolley before she gets treated there.  That is not acceptable.  We need a Government to be formed.  We need the issue of how the business of this House will be done to be addressed as a matter of urgency, so we can move quickly to address the intolerable situation in our hospitals and the unacceptable situation of homelessness in the State.</p></speech>

He was the only Member who won an election today.</p>  <p>  All Members have great expectations.  Mine is that, in a short time, I would be able to hold various Ministers to account.  I know there will be a caretaker arrangement for the next period.  However, between now and a Government being formed, it is important the issues which face the people of my constituency and across the country are dealt with.  Yesterday evening, there was a car accident outside Drumshanbo in which a young woman was injured.  She waited over an hour for an ambulance to come from Carrick-on-Shannon, which is less than 15 minutes away.  Dynamic deployment of our ambulance services across the whole western seaboard does not work.  I want to be here to hold the Minister to account in respect of that.</p><p>It does not work in respect of that.  I also wanted to come here to hold the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to account with respect to the many farmers in my area who have a major problem in getting their entitlements, with respect to the issue of young farmers and with respect to the farmers who have been left behind in trying to get their issues resolved.  </p> <p> Another issue concerns St. Patrick's Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon where the nurse-led service, which was withdrawn in recent months, has not been restored.  A further issue involves many people in my area, the people who live on the Burren Road in Templeport and the people who live in the parish of Gortletteragh, who have tried to obtain a school bus service because the rules have been set in such a way that a school bus will only transport their children to the nearest school, even if it is not the school in their parish.  These are the issues I face in my constituency.  When I came to this House I had the expectation that I would be able to hold people to account around these issues, yet we find we have motions before us that will defer democracy until some time in the future and we do not have a date set for it.  We have been told that on 22 March statements will be read in the House.  That is of little use to the people who put us here.  Many young newly elected Deputies to this House expect an awful lot better.  We were all told before beforehand that there is a lot of pomp and ceremony around it, and we understand that, but we want to get down to business.  While I understand a Government has to be formed, and we wish that this will happen as quickly as possible, we also want to ensure today and tomorrow that the issues that face the people who put us here are dealt with.  It seems to me and to all of us that this is being deferred.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

I, along with my colleagues here, spent the past few days talking to colleagues across this House about D&aacute;il reform, and we have spent the past four hours talking about it, yet the first motion that has been put to the House excludes one eighth of the membership of this House.  The third motion that will be put to the House excludes one eighth of the membership of this House, and that is not good enough.  To take the example of agriculture, it is a big issue in my county and the adjoining county of Galway.  Five out of the 11 Members who have been democratically elected for those two counties have been excluded through that motion.</p></speech>

I  hope he will have easier days and harder days than what he is having today.</p><p>As we have agreed motions 5<i>a</i>and 5<i>b</i>I wish to turn to motion 5<i>c</i>.  We are proposing that we return to this House on 22 March for fewer than six hours to discuss three items.  On the timing of the items, on the first issue, statements on the European Council meeting, 20 minutes will be available to every other Deputy, apart from the main spokespersons.  On the second issue, statements on Council of the Agricultural Ministers meeting, 35 minutes will be available for the rest of the Deputies, apart from the main spokespersons from each of the groups .  On the third issue, that of housing, which we all agree is so serious that even the Taoiseach and Deputy Martin said in their contributions that we cannot put these issues on hold, we cannot have a debate on housing and homelessness for only two hours and think that it will satisfy people who are about to lose their homes, or people who are sleeping on the streets tonight or people who are in emergency accommodation.  A two-hour debate is an insult to those people.  We have had many debates on housing and homelessness and I have no problem with having another debate on those issues but every Deputy who wants to make a contribution on these important issues should be allowed do so.  What is being proposed in this motion is a two-hour debate, which allows only 35 minutes for every other Deputy, apart from the main spokespersons for each grouping.  That is not satisfactory.  That would mean that 21 Sinn F&eacute;in Party Members would be unable to speak on housing or homelessness.</p></speech>

The first part of the amendment is that the non-aligned Independents, who are not included under motion 5<i>c</i>, would be included under it.  Second, I propose that we also discuss one of the motions we put down, which relates to the issue of water, given that there are nearly 100 Deputies in this House who are opposed to Irish Water and water charges, either through proposing their abolition or their suspension for five years or more.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>There is no doubt this is one of the key issues which needs to be discussed.

I would also like to propose two other amendments to motion 5c.  The first is that what is set down as a statement on housing and homelessness for a debate commencing at 6.30 p.m. and to last for two hours, would be brought forward to the start of the business of the day.  It would be the first debate and would conclude after four hours rather than two hours, thereby at least doubling the time, but the debate would also include provision for motions to be proposed to the D&aacute;il and for motions to be adopted by the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The tsunami of homelessness and the housing crisis that was spoken about in the course of the election campaign has not gone away.  In fact, it has got worse.  All the empirical evidence in terms of people we meet is that the situation continues to worsen on a daily basis.  Those people affected by the crisis, amounting to hundreds of thousands, cannot wait for a Government to be formed to resolve this crisis.  They need action immediately.  That applies to the 1,600 children living in emergency homeless accommodation.  They cannot wait.  It applies also to the 100,000 families on the social housing list.  They cannot wait.  It applies to the tens of thousands facing imminent rent hikes that they cannot afford.  They cannot wait.  In addition, it applies to those facing mortgages they cannot afford.  They cannot wait.  It also applies to the man living in a box 100 m from the D&aacute;il.  He also cannot wait.  We need to have a substantive debate but we also need provision for motions to be proposed and adopted by the D&aacute;il and, in particular, we need emergency action to resolve the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  The second concrete proposal is that we believe there should be an additional debate and statements on Irish Water and the water charges.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will support the amendment of the day&rsquo;s business along those lines.  This is the elephant in the room from the point of view of the establishment parties.  It was conspicuously absent from Deputy Martin&rsquo;s listing of priorities.  As a number of speakers have said, the elephant in the room on the one hand is the 70% of people who voted for parties committed to abolition or at least suspension of the water charges, which means there is clearly no longer a mandate for water charges or for Irish Water.  The media have reported a stampede of people cancelling direct debits, tearing up bills and the growing boycott that will force abolition.  It is approximately a year and a half since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, declared that the Opposition was having its last protest against water charges on 1 November while we were having protests across the country.  We had another protest today.  The people at the ballot box had a very significant protest and I believe there will be another massive protest on the streets of Dublin on a Saturday in a few weeks' time to demand abolition.</p>  <p>  It is only a few months since the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said that he spends 3% to 5% of his time thinking about the water charges.  The evidence would suggest that perhaps he and the Labour Party should have spent  longer thinking about them, the impact they are having on people and on its support.  We need an immediate debate on water charges and Irish Water.  We need it on the next sitting day and we need a recognition that Irish Water and the water charges have to go, but also a recognition by the establishment parties in here that people are not going to wait.  They are not going to place their trust in negotiations between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to see the abolition of water charges.  People are going to act decisively and force abolition and they are going to do so, correctly, by increasing the rate of boycott, by tearing up the bills and by cancelling direct debits, as is currently happening.  That is why we need a debate on Irish Water and the water charges when we return.</p></speech>

Agriculture is a very important issue in my constituency, in both Roscommon and Galway, and the motion as currently worded is unfair as five out of the 11 representatives from both Roscommon and Galway are excluded from the debate.  I accept what the Taoiseach said and I look forward to the amendment in that regard.</p><p>The biggest single constitutional role we have as Members of this House is to make sure that the Government is accountable to the people.  If we do not amend motion 5<i>c </i>to include written parliamentary questions it will mean that the Government and the public service have got away scot free for nearly two and a half months and so I ask that the motion be amended to facilitate the submission of written questions for reply on 22 March.</p><p>The third point is a procedural one to which either the Chief Whip or the Taoiseach can respond.  My understanding is that Labour Party Members are still part of the Government.  If that is the case, why is provision made in the motion before us for the Labour Party to speak?  Are there now two halves of the Labour Party, one that is part of the Government and one that is on the Opposition benches?  I would welcome clarification as to why provision is made for the Labour Party in the motion.</p></speech>

There are various points one could make but I will make just two.  In the consideration of D&aacute;il reform we should not confine ourselves completely because how the D&aacute;il works relates to how the Seanad works and also relates to the strength of local government.  The decentralisation of power is one of the solutions to the ills of our democracy.  It is a question of more democracy, both in this House and beyond it.  We will not solve issues relating to Seanad reform or further and better local government reform but they should not be excluded from the consideration of how that process will work.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Naughten that we are in exceptional times.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said the situation is not exceptional.  It is not unprecedented, nor is it unique in the sense that there are a number of other countries in Europe and generally across the western world where the political systems are in a very stressed and fearful state because people for a variety of complex reasons are also in a fearful and stressed state.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  That makes these particular circumstances unique, due to the international environment more than anything else.  In those circumstances, on the first day of this new D&aacute;il, we must enter a slight caveat and express a concern.  As Deputy Naughten said, we have no ability to ask questions of Ministers.  Ministers will attend European Council meetings that are addressing highly complex issues.  The Taoiseach will go to the European Council next week to consider migration and other issues that are not everyday issues.  This is not a time when an interim or caretaker Government can easily manage the process while not being in a position to take significant decisions.</p><p>If we end up in a situation where the public service is the interim Government and it ends up taking very significant decisions with no proper democratic oversight and, in effect, with no democratic mandate, it is something we will have to keep a very close eye on as we go through this process.  I just wanted to enter that caveat.  It is not unprecedented or unique but I argue that the circumstances are very special, particularly internationally, and require us to take care.  They require that any caretaker Government takes care of any actions it takes and that there is a certain urgency in providing the democratic oversight that is needed.</p></speech>

There have been various discussions all afternoon on the current situation.  Fundamentally, if we are to reflect on what the people said to us at the ballot boxes on the last Friday in February 2016, it is that they have sent us to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to find solutions for the situations that they, their families or communities are in, to debate those situations and find solutions which will serve them best.  In the current circumstances, with the diverse view across the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, reform is needed so that a Government can be formed under a different format to ensure that it reflects the views across the Chamber and finds solutions for the very serious problems that affect both urban and rural Ireland, families, older people and, right across the spectrum, people with disabilities.  We have a duty to the people who put us here to make sure we find solutions for those problems.</p></speech>

The issue of parliamentary questions has been raised.  The solution put forward that we would have policy debates and make policy determinations in the absence of a new Government is fundamentally flawed.  We have to have a new Government because otherwise who is to respond to fundamental policy issues?  This is not a debating Chamber alone; it is a Chamber of decision-making that has consequences.</p></speech>

I believe that saying that we respect other people's point of view is more than rhetoric.  Everybody is entitled to a view on this.  This House has a responsibility to elect an accountable Government with all speed.  The notion that we can have fundamental policy debates that alter national policy without a Government or without knowing the composition of a Government reduces us to a debating Chamber as opposed to a policy decision-making Chamber.  That is an important point to make.</p><p>I have two other points before I conclude.  A point was made by Deputy Naughten and I wondered why he sidled down to me to ask me whether I had resigned or not.  I did not realise it was to arm himself for his contribution.  I noticed that in two of the debates, there is provision for the Labour Party to participate as a separate entity but in the third debate on housing, there is not.  I do not know if there is a procedural reason the Labour Party should have a view separately from the Government on the European Council meeting and the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting but not on housing.  We need clarity on that.  Perhaps in the circumstances, each political party or grouping would have provision to have a separate view on these matters - because clearly as parties we do - as well as an interim joint Government perspective on them.  </p><p>As the T&aacute;naiste indicated earlier, since many amendments have been proposed, I formally propose an amendment to No. 5<i>c</i>that immediately after the first paragraph, which states &quot;accordingly the only business to be transacted on that day shall be as follows&quot;, the first business would be a report to the House by the Taoiseach on the progress made on the formation of Government.</p></speech>

I concur with the last speaker that the quicker the Government is established, the better.  In the interim period, we have a caretaker Cabinet with Ministers who preside over their respective portfolios and Government Departments.  As health spokesperson prior to the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il, there are key questions that I would like to pose on matters.  I want to know how these matters have progressed over the intervening period.  The same Minister holds that responsibility.  Deputy Naughten has referenced written parliamentary questions and, whether that was intentional or not, I want to be able to pose questions on the continuing stewardship of those Ministers if we find ourselves in any protracted hiatus period.  It should be accommodated in terms of the amendment to No. 5<i>c</i>regarding the extended sitting of the D&aacute;il on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  The facility should be there for Ministers to come in and answer questions properly tabled by Members of the House, not on the cut and thrust of policy, but to find out exactly what the position is on certain very important matters.  It is information which I have no other means of extracting.  As a democratically re-elected Member of this House, I want to be able to continue to perform that role of holding to account whoever is at the helm of the Department of Health.  Others will wish to do the same with regard to other Government Departments.  That should be specified very clearly in the provision of the additional time for the week following next week.  If it is in order, I formally propose that amendment be incorporated into the construct of the three sitting days which I hope we will all now agree to facilitate on the week leading into Easter week.</p></speech>

As a new Deputy, to say I was disheartened to see this in front of me would be an understatement.  To be expected to come in for a sitting and to have statements is an absolute farce.  We need questions and answers.  Ministers are being paid out of taxpayers' money, so we are entitled to answers.  In addition to that, on our way in here this morning, most of us passed people on the street not too far from the gates of this building.  It is not good enough.  I represent my constituency in which there is a serious health crisis, as there is around the country.  We have questions and we are entitled, as elected Members, to pose questions.  The people who were elected to those positions are expected to answer them at the very least.  I do not accept this and I concur with everything that members of my party have said here today.  I ask that parliamentary questions be included in that.  Obviously, those Ministers will not form policy but there should be accountability.  For decades, there has been no accountability of Governments.  Hopefully, that will change but it will certainly not go unnoticed with us in Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>

To summarise, a composite set of proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be suggesting additional sittings on 23 and 24 March, that the statements on housing and homelessness should be taken for longer than is proposed, and the proposal that provision should be made for a motion on water charges has been mentioned by both Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Paul Murphy.  In addition, of course, there is the question of contributions being made by Independent Members.  I think it already has been accepted that the Independent Members will make contributions.  The key issues are the inclusion of a debate on water charges, further sittings on 23 and 24 March and an extension of the time for debate on housing and homelessness.</p></speech>

In fact, Fianna F&aacute;il had advice 48 hours ago that we could not table motions.  We did table a motion subsequently on housing.  If it was to be known that the next session of the D&aacute;il could entail motions from political parties - I respectfully suggest that Independent groups and political parties could likewise table motions - it would be far more sensible to have a thematic approach to it in respect of the key issues.  This is because the only way in which one can deal with water charges is via legislation.  Rather than just a substantive motion in the House, one would need legislation in respect of the deletion or amendment of the Act or whatever.</p></speech>

As for Sinn F&eacute;in tabling these motions, with respect it is not just Sinn F&eacute;in motions.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled these motions and they were allowed and accepted by the Ceann Comhairle's office.  We now are moving an amendment because the Government wanted to do nothing.  We are moving an amendment that, as part of the rejigged schedule or cl&aacute;r, it be for three days and that the issue of water charges be taken on 22 March.

We have the right now to make a decision about when we come back, what we discuss and in what way we discuss it.  That is what we currently are discussing and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle must knit together a series of different proposals etc. to come up with something.  However, I do not accept the idea that we cannot pass motions of this D&aacute;il until we have a Government.  It is not legally or constitutionally true but it also is not politically true in the sense that Members here have positions.</p><p>There is all this talk of new politics and having motions where people take positions on policy as opposed to on whether they are in or out of government is part of that talk.  The proposal to have thematic debates, as referred to by Deputy Martin, is a good one.  These would include thematic debates on housing, health and water.  However, it should not be limited to statements.  It has to include the right of parties to have their motions debated and, ultimately, voted on.  Therefore, we should discuss the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on water charges.  We should have a right to put forward a motion on water charges which would place an emphasis on the boycott.  Fianna F&aacute;il should have a right to put forward a motion on water charges which says whatever Fianna F&aacute;il is going to say on them and Fine Gael and the Labour Party can defend their positions.  We can have a thematic debate on the right of parties to put forward motions and the D&aacute;il can then choose to pass those motions or not to do so.  I do not see why we cannot agree to do that on 22, 23 and 24 March.</p></speech>

A theme going through that discussion was that we need to empower the Parliament and take more power away from the Executive, that is, that we are the Parliament and we make decisions.  A motion has been put forward to the Ceann Comhairle's office that has been accepted.  It is quite simple.  It will end water charges and abolish Irish Water.  As stated by Deputy Paul Murphy and as referred to by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, any other Member or party can amend that motion.  However, we have an amendment before this House, which was the first amendment put down before it, relating to the amendment of the order of business for 22 March.  That amendment is to fulfil the mandate which the majority of Deputies were elected on, namely, to scrap water charges.</p></speech>

That is the gift we are seeking and that is the gift we are giving to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which claims this is its red line issue.

You have refused to take our amendment.  You cite Standing Order 28, the Taoiseach's prerogative and Private Members' business.
