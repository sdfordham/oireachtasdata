This Bill has just one purpose, to establish the new Department, confer a name upon the Department and to provide for a Minister who will be in charge of the Department.  It is important to note that the Bill does not confer any functions on the Department.  The new Department's functions are still being finalised and these will be transferred at the earliest opportunity following the enactment of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the new Department underscores the Government's commitment to rural and community development.  It reflects the priority the Government places on both and, importantly, ensures that efforts across all elements of the Government to support rural Ireland and to develop vibrant rural and urban communities will achieve the maximum impact.  This will be a key focus for me as Minister for Rural and Community Development.  To this end, the Department of Rural and Community Development will deliver on the Government's commitment to bring greater co-ordination to all the work of the Government that affects rural areas and the development of vibrant sustainable communities, both rural and urban.  It will guarantee a priority focus on rural and community matters, ensuring that tailored policy approaches are developed that will have a real and lasting impact for rural and urban communities alike.</p>  <p>  The new Department will work closely with other Government Departments that have a role in supporting the twin objectives of rural and community development, be it the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which reaches into rural areas through its many policies and programmes that support farming and fishing communities, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which is key to facilitating job creation in the regions through its support for enterprises, from start-ups to multinational companies, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and others which work closely with disadvantaged communities to improve their social inclusion, education and job prospects.  </p>  <p>  The action plan for rural development provides a whole-of-Government framework to support rural development through practical actions, with clear timeframes, for delivery by named Departments and agencies.  The action plan will form the basis of the work of the rural development division of the new Department.  As the Minister for Rural and Community Development, I will continue to work tirelessly with other Departments, public bodies and stakeholders to deliver on the actions in the plan.</p>  <p>  We have had many debates over the past 12 months in this House and Oireachtas committees about rural areas.  While we may have had differing views from time to time on matters of detail in these debates, no Deputy or Senator believes that supporting rural areas is a bad thing.</p><p>I see the talent and potential of rural Ireland every day.  I see how the people of rural Ireland have adapted and changed with the times.  Rural Ireland in the 21st century is modern, dynamic and creative, and is an important part of our identity and our economy.  It is my job to help realise that potential.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I will work with my ministerial colleagues to bring more job opportunities and better services to the people of rural Ireland.</p> <p> Rural Ireland is a diverse and varied place.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to supporting rural Ireland.  That said, there are many examples of very successful approaches that can be captured and copied throughout the country.  The Great Western Greenway in Mayo is a fine example of this and has led to huge interest in other greenway projects around the country, while the emergence of new enterprise clusters in areas such as agri-tech in the west also point the way forward for creating high-value-added jobs.  I want to change the narrative around rural Ireland.  I want to build on the positives.  I see and meet many exceptional business people and many exceptional rural communities.  The establishment of the new Department of Rural and Community Development provides an unprecedented opportunity to build on the work the Government commenced last year, to work in partnership with business leaders and communities and to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of the people who live and work in rural Ireland.</p> <p> All this, of course, will be complemented by the work of the community development division in the new Department.  To move forward and grow as a country, we need strong and vibrant communities.  Strong communities are the glue that hold our society together and enrich our lives.  The framework policy for local and community development in Ireland is a critical piece of work in this regard.  It sets out national priorities and a framework for a cross-Government approach to improving engagement between national and local government and local communities in the planning, delivery and evaluation of policies and interventions that affect them.  It focuses on tackling poverty, disadvantage and social exclusion.  It seeks to provide better ways of working with communities to identify local priorities and develop local solutions to address these, with the aim of securing positive impacts on jobs, gender equality, poverty, rural communities and people with disabilities.</p> <p> Delivering on the commitments in the policy will be a key priority of mine and the new Department, working in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and a range of key community development, local development and community and voluntary sector stakeholders.  Developing a strong relationship with local government will also be critical given the significant role local authorities and the newly established local community development committees, LCDCs, will have in translating the policy into local actions and approaches.  By working together locally and nationally, we can identify better ways to provide more effective services for those who need them most.  We can plan in a way that involves communities in identifying their own needs and priorities, that co-ordinates what we do and, most importantly, that delivers real outcomes for all involved.</p> <p> A strong relationship with local government and the new local governance structures will also be important in terms of programme delivery.  LCDCs have a role in the new Department&rsquo;s Leader programme in many rural areas as well as responsibility for delivering the Department&rsquo;s social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, at local level.  SICAP is the country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention and, as such, I am keen to support its ongoing development, to work closely with those managing its delivery and to ensure it continues to support those who need it most.  The new SICAP, which will be rolled out in 2018, will also be complemented by the new communities facilities scheme and the new RAPID programme, which will provide capital funding for projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level.</p> <p> The contribution of the community and voluntary sector to the well-being of our nation should never be taken for granted.  If there is anything all public representatives have in common, it is their awareness and direct experience of the vital impact voluntary work has at community level.  A key focus of the new Department, therefore, will be to raise awareness of the contribution the community and voluntary sector gives nationally, while developing and strengthening policy approaches and existing supports that will grow the sector in years to come.</p> <p> The establishment of the new Department of Rural and Community Development will strengthen delivery of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to rural Ireland and its communities.  The primary function of the Department will be to support local communities and to ensure rural areas, market towns and villages can develop and thrive.  The Department&rsquo;s role in leading the action plan for rural development and the framework policy for local and community development in Ireland will bring an added impetus to the local and economic development of rural Ireland and will improve the lives of those living in disadvantaged communities nationwide.  I am enthused by the potential for the Department to achieve real progress for rural Ireland and our communities.  I look forward to finalising as soon as possible the transfer of functions order which will set out in further detail the role of the Department.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200004#B00200"><p>That was a great example of a clich&eacute;-laden speech with no substance.  The way the Department of Rural and Community Development is being set up is abysmal.  We need a lot more detail from the Minister as to what is intended.  Let us strip away all the fine talk and all the r&aacute;im&eacute;is in the Minister's speech that says nothing and is just a collection of wild statements with no substance and find out what he is doing.  We are being asked to approve the setting up of a Department the functions of which we do not know.  We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the obvious.  If we only transfer over the functions of regional and rural affairs that are in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs at the moment, a budget of &euro;79 million transfers over with that.  If we transfer over the community affairs section of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, a budget of &euro;80 million goes with that.  That would give the Department about &euro;160 million.  If we look at the gross Estimates, even the Department of the Taoiseach, which is not a conventional Department because it is an administrative Department, does not have line functions and, therefore, does not have a significant budget, would have a bigger budget than this new Department.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has a budget of &euro;368 million, making it by far the smallest Department, given the other Departments are spending very large sums of money.  The Minister has not told us what this Department is going to do or if it is only going to continue on those functions.  If that is all the Minister is getting, to be quite honest, it is more about show than substance.  It is more about gaisce than really doing anything for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  It seems to me the Government is trying to get this through before the summer because it wants to avoid the debate about what should be the powers of the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  Let us look at what was previously within the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that is not going into the new Department.  Responsibility for the North-South bodies, which include Waterways Ireland, which is predominantly a rural agency North and South, was in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Responsibility for the rural social scheme was in that Department.</p><p>Responsibility for the Gaeltacht, all of which is rural - was in the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Responsibility for the islands - and there are no urban islands with a population on them - was in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It had a budget of around &euro;380 million at the time.  It also had other functions and I believed there were other aspects that should have been in that Department.</p> <p> It seems to me that the Minister is losing the battle.  He is losing the battle because the Departments defend the citadel against any change in any transfer of function.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, had some big ideas but he was quickly brought to heel.  Is the Minister, Deputy Ring getting responsibility for the rural social scheme, for example?  Is he getting the T&uacute;s scheme, which was set up subsequently by me when I was the Minister for Social Protection?  Will the Minister get responsibility for farm assist, which by its very definition is a purely rural function?  Will the Minister get responsibility for rural transport?  Will he be given responsibility for decentralisation?  We had the farcical situation at the coiste na Gaeilge last night of the Office for Public Works outlining the absolutely fantastic rents it pays here in Dublin when there are empty sites down the country for which plenty of civil servants, particularly the middle and lower ranks, are only bursting their guts and who could then be promoted into the senior positions in those rural locations.  Is the headquarters of the Minister's Department to be here in the city or will it be in some rural location?  In short, what is this Department about?</p> <p> I read the Minister's speech and there is nothing really to read in it.  It is all nice words such as "ensures that efforts".  The Minister and I know - I would not like to embarrass him too much today - that he was supposed to be the Minister of State for rural development.  He had all these functions already.  He and I know that the famous rural action plan is the greatest piece of codology that was ever written around this place.  They went around every Department and listed out everything they were doing that had any connection with rural Ireland - we know they have the odd health centre, school, road and sewerage and water scheme and all those other things in rural Ireland - and they put it all into the plan.  Everything that every Department was doing with a rural aspect was put in this plan, but nothing else was.  I am forgetting that there was something else; there was the famous promise that is not provided for in the budget, for &euro;20 million for some vague scheme towards the back end of this year.  That was what the whole plan was about.  There are pages and pages of it and that is all we get out of the plan.</p> <p> Between now and the end of this debate - I believe the debate will go on for a long time, a lot longer than he had anticipated - the Minister, Deputy Ring, had better start spelling it out.  More importantly the Minister with the purse strings who brought in the Bill did not even bother turning up today.  Even though it is his Bill, the guy who ultimately decides, in reality, who gets what out of the State's kitty, is not even here.  I think this tells us everything.</p> <p> Every day, every week and every month material is sent to Members about spatial strategy.  It is clear that the Government, of which the Minister is a part, intends to publish a spatial strategy that would put all of the money into a small number of urban areas.  It is quite a ridiculous approach, despite anything that any of these so-called experts tell us.  The experts, however, do not often have to live with their folly.  The experts tell us to push people into the cities because we need international competitive cities.  We need an internationally competitive country, not internationally competitive cities.  If the country is competitive then the cities will be competitive too.  The Minister, Deputy Ring is telling me that in Galway we need a whole lot more people, when we cannot get housing for the people who are already there.  We cannot accommodate them and we have no way of accommodating them over the next five years with this Government's plans.  We are not building any houses either private or public.  The Minister is telling people to go to Galway but there is no road in or out of the city and it has some of worst traffic jams in the State.  Has the Minister, Deputy Ring, ever tried to get into the city coming from Westport any time between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.?  Has the Minister ever tried, without using the ministerially-privileged bus lanes, to get out of the city any time from 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.?  Yet he wants to push a whole lot more people in to that city and leave the small schools all over rural Ireland such as those in Achill and Newport?  He knew there was a population issue.  The health centres are underutilised and the sports clubs are looking for players.  What a waste of resources.</p> <p> Has the Minister ever thought of the human outcome?  We are always told that cities are successful.  Parts of cities are successful.  I can name some very successful companies and people in this town but we must remember the masses of people who are forced to live in the most deprived communities in our land.  We must remember those people whose chance of getting a third level education is about 20% and those who live in communities rife with drugs.  Does the Minister want to put more people into those communities?  Does he want more people to suffer?</p> <p> We need to know what the Minister's plan is with regard to the Government's spatial strategy.  The Minister will wind up with a few little pretty schemes and the big boys and girls will go off to play.  They will make the big decisions with the Minister who could not face us in the Chamber today and who did not want to be challenged about the big plans for investment in the State.  These plans will put all of the money - as the Minister, Deputy Ring, and I both know  - in towards the cities and yet the Minister wants us to sign off on this Bill and say that he is a great guy because he got a titular Department with no money, no functions, no power and no input.  He will have no influence in the big decisions.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, however, will be able to boast that he set up the dedicated Department of rural affairs.  To be honest, there was a Department with that function.  I saw a press release saying this was the first Department of rural affairs.  I had to laugh.  I also saw in the newspapers recently a piece that seemed to say that the Minister, Deputy Ring, had set up the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I have heard of the rewriting of history-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200005#C00800"><p>That is wrong on two counts.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, did say it and I did not close it.  If the Minister was to check the Department Estimate of the year that I was in the Department in 2010, he will find that there was a substantial amount of money for the CL&Aacute;R programme.</p><p>I did not close it and the Minister, Deputy Ring, did not set it up.  The reality is there was previously a Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs - which, in its final iteration included the equality remit -  set up by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il set up the CL&Aacute;R programme and the rural recreation scheme.  I proposed the development of the greenway along the line from Westport to Achill - I have the newspaper cutting in that regard from the year in question.  Fianna F&aacute;il also set up the rural social scheme and many other schemes.  When Fine Gael came into government in 2011, it demolished the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p> <p> I am glad that there has been a Pauline conversion and that the latter-day saint, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has realised that Fianna F&aacute;il was right to have a Department of Rural and Community Development.  However, the Government should have had the guts to include within its remit responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, which are certainly not urban: they are geographic entities.  The Government has not even had the good grace to spell out the functions of this Department.  This could be a long day and it could be a long week.  The Minister owes it to us to spell out the functions of this Department.  Will it make a significant difference or is it a fig leaf to cover the nakedness of the Government in terms of investment in rural Ireland?  </p> <p> Ba mhaith liom focal a r&aacute; faoin leas&uacute; at&aacute; curtha isteach againn ar an mBille.  Creideann muidne gur cheart go mbeadh freagracht na Gaeltachta agus na n-oile&aacute;in curtha faoin Roinn seo.  N&iacute; bheadh aon gh&aacute; ag an Taoiseach na Air&iacute; at&aacute; ceaptha aige don Roinn a athr&uacute; mar t&aacute; mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Kyne, ag d&eacute;anamh jab foirfe mar Aire St&aacute;it le freagracht as an nGaeltacht.  Ba &eacute; an Aire St&aacute;it ab fhearr a bh&iacute; againn &oacute; 2011.  M&aacute; ghlacann an Teach leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute;imid ag moladh, agus m&aacute; ghlacann an Taoiseach le toil an T&iacute;, beifear in ann c&uacute;raim&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus na n-oile&aacute;in a aistri&uacute; go dt&iacute; an Roinn agus beifear in ann, gan aon dua agus gan teacht ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach, tosn&uacute; le Roinn a chur le ch&eacute;ile go mbeadh substaint ag baint leis.  N&aacute; habair liomsa go bhfuil s&eacute; ciallmhar go mbeadh Roinn Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; le forbairt fisici&uacute;il na Gaeltachta agus na n-oile&aacute;in agus go mbeadh Roinn eile ag pl&eacute; le forbairt na gceantar tuaithe.  N&iacute;l aon chiall leis.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire nach bhfuil aon chiall leis.  </p> <p> Ar nd&oacute;igh, m&aacute; bh&iacute;onn cearc &aacute; roinnt n&iacute; rabhthas s&aacute;sta scaoileadh leis.  Nuair a th&aacute;ngthas ag iarraidh cumhachta&iacute; don Aire, fuarthas amach nach raibh an Roinn s&aacute;sta g&eacute;illeadh, mar is maith leis na Ranna St&aacute;it an m&eacute;id a bhfuil acu a choinne&aacute;il.  Is ioma&iacute; s&aacute;r&uacute; a bh&iacute; agam mar Aire le st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh as Ranna &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Deirim i gc&oacute;na&iacute; gur gcaithfidh s&eacute; bheith curtha ina gcloigne nach raibh 15 rialtas ann, n&oacute; 16 rialtas mar is &eacute; sin an m&eacute;id Ranna St&aacute;it a bheas againn.  N&iacute;l 16 rialtas againn.  N&iacute;l ann ach Rialtas amh&aacute;in de r&eacute;ir an Bhunreachta.  T&aacute; dualgas, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar na hAir&iacute;, ach ar na Ranna St&aacute;it ar fad agus ar na comhlachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag obair f&uacute;thu tuiscint chuile l&aacute; go bhfuil dualgas ioml&aacute;n orthu feidhmi&uacute; mar aonad ar leasa an n&aacute;isi&uacute;in.  Sin rud nach dtarla&iacute;onn.  Cuireann na Ranna St&aacute;it a sp&eacute;iseanna roimh leas an phobail.  Mar sin, beidh orainn smaoineamh go doimhin sula dtabharfaimid taca&iacute;ocht don mBille seo.  Le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, beidh deis ag an Aire inniu athmhachnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gcur chuige seo.  Beidh deis ag an Aire n&oacute; ag duine &eacute;igin &oacute;n Rialtas teacht ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach agus a r&aacute; linn c&eacute;ard a bheas ar bun ag an Roinn seo.  Beidh muid in ann breithi&uacute;nas a dh&eacute;anamh nuair a dh&eacute;anann an Rialtas &eacute; sin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200006#D00200"><p>This is the third manifestation of this Department in just over a year.  In May 2016, the Government announced the addition of the regional and rural responsibilities to the existing Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in response, I imagine, to the critical level of debate in the 2016 election on the need for the Government to elevate address of the crisis that was developing in rural and regional Ireland.  The problem with that particular exercise, with which the Minister may agree, although not publicly, is that it was in the main a cosmetic exercise in that the necessary powers or budgets were not transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to allow it to do the work which its title claimed it would do.  For example, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, retained control over broadband and all the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could do was put in place a few people in certain local authorities to identify if there were any small problems they could iron out.  Also, responsibility for spatial planning remained with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and his Department.  Spatial planning should be at the centre of regional development.  Regional development should not be the responsibility of one particular Department and spatial planning the responsibility of another Department.  As I said, the fact that the budgets were transferred made it difficult for the new Department to carry out its work.</p>  <p>  For Members on this side of the House, this was extremely disappointing.  There is serious economic damage being done in this country.  The chasm that exists between parts of this island, economically, demographically and socio-economically, is incredible.  I believe there has been an over-concentration of population and economic activity in a very small space on the east coast and a damaging emptying of population on the west coast.  Counties such as Mayo and Donegal have experienced population decreases during the inter-census period of 2011 to 2016.  In many other counties there were minute marginal increases in population while the population on the east coast increased massively.  As we know, Dublin is growing out of kilter.  As I have said previously, we are in serious danger of developing a city-state island - a city surrounded by a national park.  That is how stark this is.  </p>  <p>  The Minister makes the good point on a regular basis that people should not be negative towards rural areas or regional areas but we also should not censor ourselves with regard to identifying problems.  If we do that, we will not be able to draw attention to problems and have them addressed.  There is a rake of problems in regional and rural areas.  The main problem is that the location of decent jobs is on the east coast.  Teagasc has produced a very good report on this issue, in which it indicates that young families with young children need two incomes to survive and, as the only place where they can get those two incomes is on the eastern corridor, they are, in general, moving towards the east.  What does this do?  It creates radical problems for infrastructural spend.</p><p>It means that new schools have to be built on the east coast while schools are emptying on the west coast.  There is no capital investment logic for that.  It means that important services on the west coast have to be closed, and then opened up on the east coast.  One of members of the senior management team of An Post informed the committee of which I am Chairman that 500 post offices in this State are unsustainable.  In large part, that is a reflection of what is happening with the shift to the east coast.  Unemployment is currently three times higher in the Border regions than is the case in Dublin.  In certain parts of the west, broadband speeds are 36 times slower than in the centre of Dublin.</p> <p> The north-west region is without a rail line or a motorway.  Gaining access to the north west is very difficult for those in business.  Businesses are very simple entities.  A business will set up in a space where it can attract customers, communicate with those customers and transport its product or service to them.  If it cannot do that, it will locate elsewhere.  We know that the demographic changes in the south west to which I referred mean that Balbriggan - on the east coast - has the youngest population in the country and that Killarney has the oldest.  Demographic profiles are changing as young couples move.  The change has been shocking.  I covered the enterprise brief on behalf of my party in the previous D&aacute;il.  In the five-year lifetime of that D&aacute;il under the previous Fine Gael Government, IDA Ireland pumped 60% of all foreign direct investment, FDI, into Dublin and Cork.  In 2010 and 2011, the figure was as low as 20% of FDI going outside the Dublin and Cork regions.</p> <p> This is not anti-Dublin bias.  I want to see Dublin become an international city of renown and to be able to compete internationally.  The fact is, however, that the more Dublin expands without planning, the more difficult it becomes for people living and working in Dublin.  We all know that it is very difficult for individuals to get to their places of work during rush hour.  We have heard much about the baptism ban but, in fact, there is a building barrier in this country because the Government is not building the necessary schools.  People find it very difficult to get their children into schools.  Water shortages are happening in Dublin at the moment.  We are increasingly told that the headroom in respect of water is very small in Dublin, which means that this Government is seeking to take water from the Parteen basin along the Shannon in the mid-west region and bring it to Dublin.  The logic, again, should be that the Government should look at developing Limerick and similar cities in a regional capacity so that they would be able to allow for infrastructure to be used more evenly.</p> <p> One of the most disappointing items of information to emerge at meetings of my committee in the past year was that relating to the Western Development Commission.  In his new role in this Department, I hope the Minister will focus his attention on this matter because the Western Development Commission is a very useful organisation, so much so that my own party examined the possibility of replicating its structure in other regions.  Mr. Paddy McGuinness was the chairman of the Western Development Commission.  He is a friend of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  He was given the job of being the chairman of that commission.  He came before the committee and - this is on the record of the committee - that the Western Development Commission has had its budget and its level of staffing slashed.  Considerable funding which was assigned to the Western Development Commission was put in a capital budget space, even though the need was for a current rather than a capital spend.  It was mind-blowing.  The Western Development Commission was given money that it could not spend, which is incredible, and it still cannot spend it.  As a result, many organisations that work with the Western Development Commission are being held up with regard to investment due to this particular spend.</p> <p> Mr. McGuinness has said that the position of CEO in the Western Development Commission has been vacant for five years.  It is incredible that this is the case.  There has been no board in the Western Development Commission since February of this year, which means that it is rudderless.  The latter means that community organisations cannot get the necessary funding and are being left in limbo.  Mr. McGuinness went further than that.  He said that the Western Development Commission was hamstrung, oppressed and hampered by the Department and that the only time the Department ever took an interest in the commission was on the issue of its governance.  That must make the Minister's blood boil.  It makes my blood boil to realise that we have a functional, decent organisation operating in one of the most disadvantaged parts of our country and that it is materially discriminated against and worked against by the Department.  The latter is creating a blockage in the context of the development which would naturally and organically happen in that part of the country.</p> <p> The other issue about which I am concerned in respect of the Department is the fact that the word "Regional" has been deleted from its title.  The Minister may say that he is going to keep an eye on regional development and that is going to be a task of his Department - and a greater task for the other Departments as well - but we know that the titles of Departments reflect their priorities.  If a particular objective is not set out in the title of a Department, the opportunity of giving that objective priority is missed.  Those involved in the arts logically become annoyed when the word "Arts" is left out of a Department's name.  Those in Gaeltacht areas logically become annoyed when its name is left out.  The word "Regional" has been deleted from the name of the Minister's Department.  I think that is a mistake.  Rural areas are more regional in their location, but there are rural areas in County Meath, which is also in the greater Dublin area.  The two issues are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p> In addition to my concerns regarding the changes in their titles, I also have a difficulty with the lack of work that happens in these Departments.  Rural and regional areas are experiencing a crisis in the context of broadband.  Mr. Dermot Ahern, a former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, was the first to promise the provision of broadband services throughout the whole State.  He promised that in 2004.  Mr. Noel Dempsey, another former Deputy and a county colleague of mine, promised that every house in the State would have broadband by 2010.  Deputy Eamon Ryan from the Green Party promised that we would have broadband for all by 2012 and, in 2014, the Fine Gael Government stated that the entire country would have broadband by 2020.  In 2016, that target was stretched out further to 2022.  Now the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has admitted that the plan may not actually be completed by that date and has started to suggest a target date of 2024.  We can have all the name changes and departmental changes that we like, but if we do not have the implementation of key policy such as that relating to broadband, we are going to find it very difficult.  This is horizon politics.  Each of those particular politicians to whom I refer stated that the sunny day when rural Ireland would have broadband was on the horizon.  However, the problem is that as we get closer to those dates, the horizon shifts out farther and that sunny date becomes more and more difficult to reach.</p> <p> Agriculture is obviously a major concern for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, I hope, for the new Department for which the Minister, Deputy Ring, will have responsibility.  The problem is - Teagasc reflected this as well - the really shocking figure that only 37% of farmers in this State are economically viable.  It is mind-blowing that 63% of farmers currently operating in this State are not independently economically viable.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to focus on the Leader programme.  Our committee held public meetings in Bailieborough and Athboy.  People came to us from Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Meath and told us that only one or two people in those counties had been approved for Leader funding in the past year.  There were 18 separate steps from start to finish for a particular business to achieve.  If one was to purposefully design the most bureaucratic nightmare for a small business - and a small business in a rural area would not have experience with bureaucracy and would be averse to it - and to stop individuals in it from doing anything, one would design a way of having 18 steps before it could get the necessary funding to allow those people to do their particular jobs.</p><p> Change is good and necessary but I worry that in the new manifestation of the Minister's Department, we will see more change management.  Anyone involved in organisational management will say that if one keeps changing the structure of an organisation, more energy goes into managing that change than achieving the organisation's objectives.  The HSE is rife with this.  Each time there is a new Minister for Health, he or she wants to change the structures and management becomes sucked into a black hole of managing that change.  The patients, whom one would hope are the HSE's objective, are left towards the end.</p> <p> There is also a question of a departmental turf war which the Minister is long enough in politics to be able to identify.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v identified a major gap in this legislation in that we do not know the exact responsibilities and functions this new Department will have.  I wish the Minister all the luck in the world in ensuring the necessary tools for regional, spatial and rural development come under his Department because all the other Ministers, and their staff, will fight tooth and nail to prevent that happening.  We saw that in the previous Government.  We want a real Department, not just an edifice with nothing behind it. </p> <p> The Department will need a certain level of investment, and the type of control the Minister has on his budget is important.  This country has the second lowest capital infrastructural spend in the EU.  Romania beats us to the last position.  We are hearing a lot of talk about a rainy day fund.  If the Minister had a house with a massive mortgage and its roof was blown off, would the Minister fix the roof and pay down the mortgage or would he decide to put his money into a rainy day fund and leave himself without a roof and with a massive mortgage?  It is logical to tackle the infrastructural problem with the house and, when that was complete, to pay off some of the debt, after which one might put a few bob aside for a rainy day fund.  The idea of creating a rainy day fund when there are massive infrastructural gaps in this country is nonsense.  One cannot travel to the north west by rail or by motorway.  There is no broadband three miles outside Navan.  I am sure that is also the case three miles outside Westport.  When we do not have these things, the money needs to be directed into their provision.  Capital spend is not a waste of money.  It is money that makes money.  That is its logic.  I ask the Minister to look at that issue.</p> <p> The Government must consider the all-Ireland context in which we live.  In January 2016, I carried out a report on the all-Ireland economy during which I interviewed around 100 organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry, the unions and the Ulster farmers.  Everyone I spoke to felt that if we planned, funded and delivered together, we would have more efficient and better services for everyone on the island, whether they be cancer services in Altnagelvin hospital  or an air ambulance based out of Enniskillen for the north west or Daisy Hill Hospital which serves people in the north east.  Most experts in this area to whom I spoke said that the all-Ireland economy had fallen off the agenda.  After the Good Friday Agreement, it had been the great new hope, but nothing but lip service was paid to it between 2011 and 2016.  The Minister is a decent man and I believe if he had the opportunity to do something about this, he would.  That is why I tabled an amendment to include "all-Ireland" in the name of the Department because we cannot continue to develop the island spatially on a Twenty-six Counties or Six Counties basis.</p> <p> It happened before.  During the 1970s the unionist government in the North decided to build a motorway to Newry and then decided to extend it to Warrenpoint, which is a beautiful, small sea village on the coast of County Down.  It did not want to build it to Dublin.  It took until 2007 to build that motorway going to Dundalk, Drogheda and on to Dublin.  Look at the economic energy which has been generated from that Belfast-Dublin corridor.  The money the DUP secured from the Tories is largely designated for the three north-eastern counties of the Six Counties.  We must ensure all the Departments are aligned.  The Minister needs to speak to his private secretary and every member of staff in the Department and tell them nothing can happen in the Department regarding regional and rural planning unless we are consulting our colleagues across the Border.  That economic corridor between Letterkenny and Dundalk is one of the most deprived in the State.  If the Minister does not use the name I suggested in my amendment, some level of regional, rural and all-island development should be included which would set out the new dispensation for this island in a radical new way.  It would say we are not going to plan with our backs to each other and to our own cost.  It is a major opportunity to save money on the island while increasing services and should be taken.  I wish the Minister luck in his new role.</p></speech>

Unlike others, I will not play party political games.  My party and I believe that rather than playing party political games around the establishment of this important Department, we should focus on having it established <i>quam celerrime</i>and ensure the maximum number of functions fall under its remit, especially those pertinent to the lives and economy of rural Ireland.  I congratulate and support Deputy Ring's appointment as Minister for rural affairs primarily.  I am delighted that the rural part of this has primacy and is prominent in the title of the Ministry.  I give my unequivocal support because it is important that issues of rural concern are given the priority status they deserve because they have been overlooked for a long time, although not by politicians.</p><p>During the 1990s, I lodged a significant document with the then Deputy S&eacute;amus Pattison in Kilkenny, whom the Minister will know well.  I spoke about the centrality of post offices and the CAP.  The media has been so lazy in announcing the promises of some people that one would think that rural issues had only been brought to the attention of this House in the past five years.  They have been known here for at least the past 25 years that I have been a Member, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know that parties have always emphasised issues relevant to rural Ireland.  I come from a very rural area and I would not be allowed to forget where I come from if I did not articulate and espouse the importance of rural issues and the people who live in my area.</p><p>I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Labour Party regarding the establishment of this important Ministry which deals particularly with issues of rural preservation, regeneration and revitalisation.  No one will know more about this than the Minister himself.  I recall when he was elected to the House in 1994 or 1995.</p></speech>

The people did not forget that the Minister spoke for them and espoused their cause.  Rural-proofing of decisions would ensure rural Ireland was not sidelined or overlooked.  All we are looking for is our just desserts.  We are not looking for any more than that.  It is an important principle to be treated equitably and fairly, and all we seek is the fair play to which we are entitled.</p>  <p>  The cause is not one to which I have come in recent times but one which has underlined the Labour Party philosophy which I developed and articulated during the 1990s.  It is our party policy.  As a party we are unequivocal and passionate about ensuring economic growth in every part of Ireland in order that families can continue to live, work and raise their children in rural areas and play a central and important role in their communities.  We need a real and effective charter for rural Ireland that clearly identifies key issues to better support rural areas.  There must be active participation in rural development initiatives which have been developed by communities, not by bureaucrats.  They are the people whom the Minister has to rule out.  He Minister can develop these things himself.  He does not need any consultant to tell him what is wrong with rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  That said, we need not talk about what is wrong.  There are huge opportunities in rural Ireland.  Let us be positive about where we live.  We cannot always be using the b&eacute;al bocht.  We must say that we are here and are looking for that to which we are justly entitled.  When we get it, we will show the rest of them a clean pair of heels, as they say down our way.  Let us get on with it.  We do not want solutions that are generalised, idealistic or theoretical coming from the mouths of bureaucrats.  The Minister must cut them out at the pass and, if he does so, he will do a good job.</p><p>It has to be done using a bottom-up approach to support economic and community development and with stronger action to keep family farms and rural enterprises alive.  We have to address structural issues such as the age and gender profile of the agricultural sector and the rural community generally.  Agriculture is not the only active industry in rural Ireland but it is the backbone of the rural economy and we have to ensure better co-ordination between local enterprise offices and local authorities to support local enterprise projects and minimise the red tape that is strangling initiatives.  We made proposals in this regard during the election campaign but nobody wanted to discuss them.  We have had our fill of glossy reports and we want real, effective and substantial resources.  We do not want to receive a pittance, which amounts to a few bob being thrown at long-standing issues while rural communities die.</p> <p> There has been significant depopulation and we face significant challenges in rural areas, including inadequate infrastructure, about which the Minister will be well aware.  The N4 is an important route running from Bunbrosna through Edgeworthstown and Newtownforbes to the north west.  He knows better than anybody that this route has to be developed to ensure the people of Donegal, Sligo and the north west get a fair bite of the cherry.  The N5 is equally important and the Minister fought hard for the road improvements around Strokestown and so on but inadequate infrastructure elsewhere on the road has to be addressed.  There are threats to the rural fabric, including shops, pubs, petrol stations, retail, newsagents, shops and the post office.  I have referred previously to what we can do regarding post offices by allocating the provision of banking services to them.  However, I will never join a march or a protest over rural shops or anything else because the first thing rural people do is they pass the rural shop and they do not go into it.  They hive off to Mullingar or Longford to the large shops such as Aldi and forget about the rural shops.  It is all right at 10 p.m. to go to them when someone needs a pint of milk and none of the large shops is open.  Rural people can save rural Ireland if they shop in rural Ireland and spend in rural Ireland, send their children to schools in rural Ireland and attend the local churches and support their local clubs.  We have it in our own power to do that and all we need is the Minister to give us additional resources to give us a push along the way.  We are not here with a begging bowl mentality or with the b&eacute;al bocht.  We are working in co-operation and collectively with the Minister to get this through.  There are threats to rural schools because of the decline in population which I see in my own area of Ballynacargy.  We used to have a huge young population but that has declined.  Sports teams are also threatened.  In addition, there is a threat to GP services - 40% of the GPs in County Longford will reach retirement age in the next seven years, and 30% in County Westmeath.  The problem is trying to get young GPs to replace them.  A proper GP contract will have to be brought forward, which recognises the costs associated with providing these services in rural Ireland because, after all, we also suffer from poor health in rural Ireland; it is not just an urban Ireland phenomenon.</p> <p> If the Minister grabs the ball, accepts honestly the position of rural Ireland and its deficits, secures additional resources and realises this requires a whole-of-government approach, he will find that rural people will rise to the challenge and opportunities will manifest themselves.  Let us contribute to a narrative of positivity and inculcate a sense that we are in this with him.  He will not be left on his own; we will be there.  The greatest curse for rural dwellers is the level and nature of bureaucracy.  The dead hand is always around to impede people who get off their behinds to do something.  Stupid and ineffective regulations that might well apply to a large enterprise and undertaking are often applied with greater diligence to a small shop or a two-person enterprise that is trying to establish itself and get off the ground.  It is easy for environmental health officers to drop by a local rural shop and not like the colour of the paint or something.  That has to stop.  It is hard for businesses to survive.  Rather than applying the full panoply of planning laws to young entrepreneurs and innovators, we should establish a system of licensing even for a time-limited period in order that someone could pay a licence fee of &euro;500 instead of &euro;8,000 in planning costs to see how he or she gets on.</p> <p> The tax system, which is created by politicians, although probably dreamt up by bureaucrats, totally disregards the energy and efforts of people in establishing a business.  There should be a recognition of how important SMEs are to rural Ireland where they provide 300,000 jobs.  The only recognition they have is that they correctly pay their taxes, as they should, but they are effectively tax collectors on behalf of the State.  Surely the 12.5% corporation tax rate could be applied to start-ups and small business for three or four years.  A sunset clause could be applied in order that the rate would not apply forever.  The rate should be available to small businesses.  If it is good enough for FDI and the big announcements, it has to be good enough for Johnny in Ballynacargy or Milltown, or Rathowen, Edgeworthstown, Legan, Abbeyshrule or Kinnegad.  Let us be innovative and give them incentives.  This is the way to do it.</p> <p> Banking annoys me.  Rural people are being crucified by the banks and they are being disregarded.  Something has to be done about the way they are treating small businesses.  They are basically now an inconvenience and nuisance.  The banks are axing face-to-face counter services.  All people will get is the option of self-service machines to lodge and withdraw cash.  Some banks might provide a morning service but everything is being done to disadvantage individuals and small businesses trying to go about their business by effectively running cash-free banks.  I raised the need to implement the commitment in the programme for Government to investigate the establishment of a public banking network in Ireland with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister when he was Minister of State at that Department and I hope the establishment of such a network, which would have a special significance for rural Ireland, will fall within his remit.  I appreciate he is familiar with this important concept and the offer of free invaluable external expertise and resources to help such a network get off the ground.  The Labour Party and I are wholeheartedly in favour of this concept, which fits in neatly with our philosophy.  Banks such as the Sparkassen savings banks in Germany are the backbone of funding SMEs.  They proved their worth during the recession when, unlike other banks, they kept credit flowing to entrepreneurs.  A number of positive developments for a public bank system in this State have been identified.  It would be not for profit and be restricted to lending in the regional economy; it would fill the gap following the demise of the building societies and enterprises formerly served by the ACC and ICC; both the post offices and credit unions could earn additional income from selling public bank services across the counter; and it would provide a suitable vehicle for the European Investment Bank to lend funds to SMEs.</p> <p> As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, the BMW region has suffered from a slower recovery, infrastructural deficits and the withdrawal of banks.  I recall 30 years ago many bank and building society branches playing an important role in community development and community life in general.  Branches were staffed by people rooted in the community who knew its strengths and weaknesses, knew the customers and their needs and concerns and had a stake in a local, vibrant economy.  With the demise of building societies and the withdrawal of bank branches and human intelligence through the axing of counter services, the knowledge of business in the BMW region has been replaced with algorithms and remote banking with no interest or stake in the community.  A dedicated public bank network would fill this void and would support enterprise and jobs in the regions.  That is what we need.  It would ensure a bank and service committed to the local community, ensuring SMEs and the agricultural sector would have a dependable source of credit and communities would benefit as the not-for-profit model would not only support enterprises and job creation but the surplus would be reinvested in worthy regional projects.  The Minister could take this on board.  He will face lots of opposition with more people telling him why he should not do it than do it but I know him from old and the more these people oppose him, the better he likes it.  I wish him well because he must oppose them.</p> <p> Another issue that will affect rural Ireland is the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA.  The Labour Party is very much in favour of free trade and our positivity towards it has been expounded by our party leader, Deputy Howlin, in the House.  Trade leads to commerce, industrial activity, jobs, incomes and prosperity but we must be vigilant in overseeing and scrutinising trade agreements at the macro level.  I do not have sufficient time to highlight my concerns about CETA and how it has been advanced to this stage where the negotiations have been completed and the text of the agreement fixed and finalised without a proper debate in the Oireachtas before the Government agreed to the conclusion of the negotiations last October on which services or sectors we wish to protect in Ireland from the effects of the agreement.  </p><p>It is not only politicians who are raising these concerns.  The view is shared by organisations as diverse as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association and the Environmental Pillar.  NGOs, business organisations and a range of civil society organisations came together last week in a major press conference to highlight their opposition to the CETA deal and their concerns.  Their opposition was not to trade.  That is an important point.  However, there was firm and united opposition to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement as the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, arrived.</p> <p> Obviously, there were great photo shoots with the Taoiseach and everything else, but the Taoiseach needs to be wary.  That is why I do not want this to land on top of the Minister, Deputy Ring, some day.  He might wonder why no one did anything or why no one shouted stop.  A colleague from the Minister's area, John Healy, used to say that no one shouted stop.  I believe that in the Minister we have someone in this area who has fine vocal cords.  If John Healy were here now, he would say we have someone whom we believe will shout stop.  That is why I am such a strong advocate and supporter of the Minister personally, and I always will be.</p> <p> I want to highlight two points in the context of the debate on issues for rural Ireland.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Kyne, will be aware of these because he is from an agricultural background and has degrees and so on.  He is well-up on this area.  Only 5% of Canadian farmers produce nearly 50% of total Canadian food output.  That is the scale of operator that Irish farmers will be competing against.  In 2015, a Teagasc report estimated that 63% of Irish farms are already not economically viable.  Of course, without the CAP payments they would not be.</p> <p> Another major worry is Brexit.  An amount of between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion will be lost from the CAP budget.  This corresponds to perhaps a 5% to 10% impact.  That is going to be significant and it is another issue that has to be considered in this area.</p> <p> There will be an increase in competition from these massive industrial-scale Canadian operations.  That is what concerns me.  That will always be to the detriment of the small farm holder or anyone else.  Other EU trade agreements are being negotiated.  This will have a devastating impact on small Irish farmers in particular.  Consequently, it will have a knock-on effect on the fabric of rural society in Ireland.  The shops, pubs and communities of rural Ireland are held together by these farms and these rural projects.  I have already alluded to this.</p> <p> Pressure for intensification will alter the character of the landscape and the patchwork system of fields that is so important to biodiversity.  It will affect the hundreds of thousands of jobs reliant directly and indirectly on our landscape through our tourism industry.  This will apply nowhere more than the Minister's area of Westport.  The Minister and the area have had great success with the cycleway and everything else.  Well done to the Minister in that regard.  Westport is a vibrant thriving town, and long may it continue.  I have visited it and I intend to visit it again over the summer.  In fairness, people who criticise the Minister can only look at that.</p> <p> I only wish we had something similar, although we have a greenway in Mullingar that runs from the Meath border through to Longford.  It is excellent.  I remember some people were not so positive.  I remember when the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, gave us &euro;950,000 to bring it from Coolnahay right through to the Longford border.  The amount of people who utilise it is significant.  There should be some grants to help people establish little tea houses and so on along the canal.  Waterways Ireland should look at that.  The body should help, assist and grant aid people to establish such facilities.  I note Clare and Paddy Crinnigan do a great job in Coolnahay of providing teas and a stop-off there.  They are excellent.  They have Christmas lighting and so on and people come from hundreds of miles around to look at it.  Well done to them.  George Lloyd was a great help to them as well.  It is critical to support and supplement the livelihood of those in rural Ireland in the tourism industry.</p> <p> The effect of the financial exposure from the CETA investment court system will be significant.  The system allows for businesses to sue governments outside our courts for damages for vast amounts.  Earlier this year, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation admitted it had not even done a cost-benefit analysis on this.  It did not do the analysis before the Government supported and signed the agreement at the European Council last October.</p> <p> We have not even got over one bailout.  Now we are going to be hit by something that I believe has the potential to be even bigger.  When the Exchequer gets squeezed, we know how rural Ireland suffers because it is the poor relation.  We want to ensure the pot we are entitled to is not squeezed further.  Whatever about adding to the pot, we do not want the Exchequer to take the view that, once a squeeze comes, it should grab the money from CEDRA or the Leader programme or reduce the associated funding.  We do not want another blank cheque for big business that the citizens of this State will have to foot the bill for.  That is what concerns me about CETA.</p> <p> The loss of sovereignty is a problem.  Authority will pass from the Irish courts to an arbitration court outside the Irish jurisdiction for disputes between governments and mulitnationals.  At a recent meeting in the European Parliament office in Dublin, a senior counsel and Queen's counsel who is a constitutional lawyer stated that, under the Constitution, the Government does not have authority to transfer power from the Irish courts to an arbitration court outside the country.  Furthermore, he said that to do so would contravene a number of articles of the Constitution.</p> <p> Throughout Europe there is widespread condemnation of the investment court system.  Canadian subsidiaries of US-headquartered mulitnationals will be able to use CETA to sue European governments.  There was a debate in the Seanad on this and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins said it could serve as a back door for more than 40,000 US companies.  This is especially worrying for Europeans as US corporations dominate the Canadian economy.  The legality of this is being questioned by the Association of European Administrative Judges, German magistrates and various professors of law in various counties as well by legal scholars.</p> <p> We have to be vigilant.  I have plenty of hope.  I believe the Minister is the person to inspire that hope.  I have no doubt that if we give the Minister the backing he deserves, we will get to a point where rural Ireland will get its fair share and will be on a level playing field.  That is all we want.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200010#H00200"><p>The Minister was already supposed to have responsibility, as a Minister of State, for rural affairs.  Unfortunately, it seems to have been a rather empty Ministry as there have been no changes to rural Ireland.  I appreciate and respect the Minister, and he knows I do.  Anything I am saying is not about the Minister personally, because I know the type of worker he is and the reputation he has for being not just a good representative but an excellent one.  I acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  The Minister knows the obsession I have about the divide between urban and rural Ireland.  I have said it consistently since I came to this House.  Many people think the world stops at the Red Cow roundabout.  Many officials working in Dublin think that.  They think there is nothing outside the Pale.</p>  <p>  I will always acknowledge when good things happen.  I acknowledge that the programme for Government uses the word "rural" 74 times.  It was not in the previous programme for Government.  That is why the Government fell spectacularly at the most recent general election.  It was because of its lack of interest in rural Ireland.  I am not blaming the Minister for that.  He Minister was probably one of the people in the Government who were fighting for rural Ireland, if we want to tell the truth about it.  When the previous Government thought it was a good idea to do away with our town councils, I imagine the Minister did not agree with that decision.</p>  <p>  The urban-rural divide still exists and it is only getting bigger.  We have problems with rural transport, centralisation and ambulance services.  Who in his right mind could ever defend or try to say that it was a good idea to centralise our ambulance controls and take away the local knowledge we have in County Kerry when it comes to managing our ambulances and our ambulance service?  Who thought it was a good idea to set up the service here in Dublin in a disused fire station?  There was total chaos for the first number of months.  When a call went in from a certain townland in County Kerry, the first ambulance that was sent out was to the same townland in Cork.  The people were wondering why they were waiting for an ambulance.  This is what we get out of centralisation.  This is what happens.</p>  <p>  Some genius thought it was a good idea to centralise the processing of medical cards and take it away from our local inspectors.  In many cases, those local inspectors had such local knowledge that when an application came in for a medical card, the person working in the office knew the family involved and knew whether it was a serious case or a not so serious case.  We lost all that local knowledge.  I am fearful and I want to put it on the record of the House today, because I work a great deal with our social welfare inspectors and I have tremendous respect for them, as does the Minister and any proper Member.  They work with the Department of Social Protection in our communities.  They are a great group of people who have local knowledge.  I am fearful for the future of what I term that setup.  I am fearful that it too will be centralised.  The Minister might ask what would make me say that.  Is the trend not going that way in recent years?  Why would the Department not do it?</p><p>If we were to go down that road, the local knowledge would be lost along with the person who knows the family background and situations and the personal difficulties which people might be having in their lives whether through illness, accidents or tragedies. The local community officers are part of the bedrock of our communities because they live in the communities and are steeped in the local activities, whether it is the local GAA club or children going to the local school.  It is terribly important to retain the network of knowledge which we have. </p> <p> On broadband, how can we stand over a situation in rural Ireland where not only do we have inadequate broadband, but we do not actually have a mobile phone service?  There are places in the county which I represent where there was excellent mobile phone coverage before.  Now there is no coverage.  They are complete blank spots.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, knows well that I recognise and appreciate the good work he is doing, but these are basic requirements which we have.  We cannot expect jobs to come to rural areas when there is not adequate infrastructure such as broadband and other basics.</p> <p> We have to look at business rates in rural Ireland.  People are being rated out of business.  As the Minister knows, there is a trawl going on in this country.  I am always mindful to say I have a small shop on the side of the road in case anybody would say that I have a conflict of interest.  I have been paying rates for 30 years and I have no problem doing so, provided the rates are not so extraordinary that they would force a person out of business.  The Minister knows there is a review ongoing at present and that many people who own service stations have seen their rates increase by enormous figures such as 20%, 30% or 40%.  That is unsustainable.  I have been dealing with people around the country who have come to me about this issue and who have said that it will put them out of business.</p> <p> On the closure of post offices, I was the first person to ever stand in this House and say that it was my honest opinion that 700 or 800 post offices could close.  I was challenged at the time by people in the media who thought that it was ridiculous and wondered how I could say such a thing.  Well, it is happening.  It is happening under our noses.  I told my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group yesterday of one person who came up for review.  The review meant that their income decreased by &euro;18,000.  How could any person in business sustain an &euro;18,000 cut in their basic income?  It is beyond belief.  It cannot happen.  I want to put on the record that this idea of the Government closing our post offices is false.  No such thing happens.  I own a small post office.  The Government will not close my post office.  The person who will close it is myself.  The reason I would be forced to do so is a lack of Government intervention.  </p> <p> I am not standing here on behalf of postmasters saying that we want money from the the Minister, Deputy Ring, or from the Minister, Deputy Naughten, or from the Government.  We do not want a handout.  We want the Government to hand us work.  We want it to keep our offices busy.  That is what we are seeking.  We want footfall to go through.  This is a common-sense approach.  We do not have the begging bowl out.  We are not saying the Government must help us or we will be destroyed.  That is not the case.  We want the Government to proactively engage in helping.  A Private Members' motion was brought before this House and was unanimously supported.  If the thrust of that motion was to be implemented it would save our rural post office network.  We have 1,140 post offices.  If we do not act we will lose 700 or 800 of them.  To prove the point, 10,000 post offices were lost in England through inaction.  They were going to be lost in New Zealand but were not because action was taken in time.  Community banking was brought in, which saved the post offices.  </p> <p> Rural Ireland is dying and is being allowed to die.  The only things which are sustaining rural Ireland are the poor farmers who are struggling and trying to keep their gates opening and closing, and the people involved in tourism.  There are great people, of whom I am terribly proud, running small guesthouses and hotels, little shops or little pubs and who are working tremendously hard.  There is no such thing as a minimum wage.  They might have no wage.  They are only just barely managing to pay to their way, to pay their bills and to keep the door open.  There is nothing fancy about their lifestyles.  There are just continuing to do what their parents and grandparents did, which was to keep the door of the pub, shop or hotel open.  We have to commend those people who provide great service to our tourism sector.</p> <p> All the fancy plans in the world are great to look at, as are the lovely photographs, but money talks.  We must have serious investment in rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland will continue to decline.  The Government should get serious about it.  We want the Minister for Rural and Community Development to invest, to be proactive and to look at things we have asked him to do.  They are sensible and practical things.  If I was to prioritise one issue it would be the issue of the post offices.  I know it might not now be under the direct responsibility of the Minister but I know he will work with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in that regard.  They can be saved and to do so would show that the Government will be proactive, that it will not let the ball slip and that it will ensure that the great service which has been provided by postmasters and postmistresses over the years will continue into the future.  If we lose it, it will be gone forever and we will be sorry forever.  We will not be able to bring them back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200011#J00200"><p>While we are talking about rural Ireland and about Kerry, where I come from, I will say what I said one of the first times I spoke in the House.  I firmly believe that we will not get fair play in Kerry until the Red Cow is moved out to Bull Rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  I believe we will not get fair play until that time.  The Minister has departed but the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is here and I am sure he will interact and will tell the Minister what we say here.  What is going to be the difference between the Minister holding the rural and community development brief and the Minister holding the rural affairs brief?  How will this change better serve the people in rural Kerry?  What parts of the programme will the Minister be in charge of?  The farm assist scheme is a vital way of helping small farmers in rural Ireland.  Will that be part of the Minister's brief?  The rural social scheme is also very important for farmers who have little to do and little income.  That scheme helps such farmers greatly if they can get on it.  Will that be part of the Minister's brief?</p>  <p>  What budget will the Minister have?  When we were upstairs in the Department of the Taoiseach a year and a few months ago discussing the programme for Government, I asked the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, whether additional money would be provided if there was a new department for rural affairs.  He said there would not be and that it would have to come from the other Departments.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Ring, has returned.  Will he get more money for rural Ireland?  I take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Noonan and thank him for the great work he did for the people of Ireland.  Perhaps one of the routes he took in respect of one aspect was not so successful, but overall I thank him for his great service to the country and to the people.  How strong will the Minister, Deputy Ring be on getting money for rural Ireland?  I know that he is a forceful man.  I ask him to fight tooth and nail for the people in rural areas.  He is from a rural county himself.  Many Ministers seem to forget that when they come up to Dublin.  I hope the Minister does not.  </p>  <p>  Since I came up here I have been asking the Minister about the local improvement schemes.  First he told me that the local authorities could spend money on the local improvement schemes.  One cannot spend money one does not have.  Until the Minister gets money for the local authorities they cannot proceed with the local improvement schemes.</p><p>As I have said, people in rural areas such as Kerry are as much entitled to roads to their doors as people in Dublin 4.  The Department would like to say that those are private roads.  They are no such thing.  There are no gates across them.  They are public rights of way in the same manner as the small, third-class roads that were taken in charge.  These roads to people's doors were omitted and should have been taken in charge by local authorities.  Those people should get funding.  They are paying motor tax and property tax and most have their own water and pumps or, if they do not, are on group water schemes.  They make no hullabaloo about this and are costing the State nothing in that regard.  However, they are entitled to good roads to their doors.</p> <p> I ask the Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, if they will be supporting the Road Traffic (Fixed Penalty &ndash; Drink Driving) Bill 2017 proposed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, which will isolate people in rural Ireland even more than they are already.  God almighty, people can currently go to their local pub and have a pint and a glass and take an hour or an hour and a half to do so and talk to whoever is left in those places.  That is their only outlet.  Is the Government going to deprive those people in rural Ireland of that?  The Minister and Minister of State are from rural constituencies.  Will they further affect and hurt people in rural Ireland?  If they do so, they will not be serving the people who elected them.  I know the areas from which the Deputies come.  They must consider their position in that regard, take a stand and ensure that people in rural Ireland will not be not hurt further.  Those people are entitled to travel and to have a social outlet.  If that is taken from them, they will be looking at the four walls.</p> <p> Will the Minister, Deputy Ring, be in charge of the Leader programme?  There has been no Leader programme since 2013.  The Minister should seriously consider its reinstatement because the development companies that divvied out that fund over 25 years did a great job.  It was a bottom-up approach.  It is now coming from county managers and directors of services who do not honestly understand the value of rural communities.  Something has to be done about that.  The summer recess is approaching but many small entrepreneurs are awaiting funding.</p> <p> One must have regard to the great work done by Tidy Towns committees, most of which operate on an entirely voluntary basis.  Many of Ireland's little villages would have fallen asunder long ago if it were not for those committees painting facades and the fronts of houses and making places look a little bit better and more enticing to visit or revisit.</p> <p> There are many things wrong in respect of planning.  As I have said on several occasions, planning in rural areas is again becoming a problem.  For several years, things rolled along evenly enough but there are now problems such as a situation where five families cannot obtain planning permission for access to the national secondary road between Killarney and Barraduff because the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2012, signed something that gave the Department the right to disallow access to that road.  I ask any Member going to Killarney to pay attention to that issue.  It is a mile before the Lissivigeen roundabout and there is at least a mile of straight road where those five people were coming out using existing accesses but they were refused planning permission.  That is not fair.  The Government is talking about providing housing.  Those people were not looking for anything for free but just wanted planning permission to build their houses.  There are now designations by the local authority that planning permission cannot be granted in respect of areas under urban pressure.  That could be fine but maybe it is not so fine because people have a democratic right to build houses in the same way as anyone else.  Local people in an area affected by urban generated pressure can buy a site and get permission to build 300 yards from the place they were born and brought up in.  A person with a landholding can do so, but a person buying a site next door cannot.  Those issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There is a Bill to allow unfinished developments be completed.  There are people with one house who are in the same position.  Will they be included in that Bill?  If they are not, it is totally unfair and undemocratic.</p> <p> The repair-and-lease scheme will not help people in some villages because it does not apply to areas where there is no demand or pressure for social housing.  The scheme should be expanded to allow people, especially those in rural areas, to take advantage of it.  All the houses that are on the Department's list as being vacant are vacant but one cannot live in them until they are done up.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister, Deputy Ring, the best of luck in his new Department.  He comes from rural Ireland.  He needs all guns blazing and every Department working with him.  He will need plenty of armour because he is taking on a difficult portfolio.  No Member should say that it is going to be simple.  Rural Ireland has some great aspects but there are other areas and issues that have been neglected for many years.  If Members want to bring a balance to all regions, which I know is the aim of the Minister, we need to ensure that this is done right.  Rushing through a Bill without giving the Minister fair play is not sufficient.  He must have everything he requires to deal with this in the proper way.  Clear answers are not being received to the questions that Members ask the Department regarding what is happening with rural affairs.  It is like a plane without wings at an airport that is trying to take off.  The Department needs to ensure that everything is right before take-off.</p>  <p>  The Department with the second-lowest budget receives nearly twice that proposed for the Minister's Department, which has been allocated approximately &euro;170 million.  The budget for the Department of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is approximately &euro;360 or &euro;370 million.  That would not do anything for a Department.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have looked for a ray of hope to be sent to the people of rural Ireland in recent weeks.  I am sure the Minister is trying or has tried to do that.   That ray of hope could be that the people of rural Ireland will have one of their own fighting for them.  I give the Minister one thing - if he gets the money, he will be good at delivering and giving those people the ray of hope they deserve.</p><p>In my opinion, the first step to bring hope to people is by putting that Department into the heart of rural Ireland, not saying, as we hear day in day out, &quot;Sure, everything is in Dublin.  What can you do?&quot;  I believe that would be the first signal of intent.  The Minister might disagree but I believe that is the first step we should have taken.<br/><br/>The furthest part away from Dublin is the islands and from my understanding, the Minister does not have control of the running of the islands.  They are rural Ireland, they are people and they matter as well.  Whoever is blocking this, the Minister should be able to pick <i>&aacute; la carte</i>whatever is required.  Rural Ireland is made up of nearly a full Government of 14 different Departments the decisions the Minister makes and over which he has power will determine the way forward.<br/><br/>We saw yesterday evening - I saw pictures of the Minister - welcome news about entrepreneurship in the BMW region.  When one goes right through local areas, even if it is a community in a small area where, be it for the football team, the Tidy Towns or a charity, people on winter nights gather together planning different events to make their communities better, there is a desire among those people to improve their area, village, province and country.  These people do it voluntarily day in, day out and we need to ensure that rewards are given.<br/><br/>The first question I would have is whether the Minister, Deputy Ring, has control over rural social schemes, RSS, or the community employment, CE, schemes?  Has the Minister control over ensuring services for entrepreneurs?  I note he spoke of the LEOs yesterday evening and a lot of work has been done.  However, for any young person starting off, there are still a lot of hurdles to jump.  As I stated earlier, when people raise money in the local area, one will hear someone asking what the area has but there may be someone who is making concrete stakes or someone doing hire work or there may be a shopkeeper.  The amount of donations given and the willingness to make areas better are unbelievable and that is great.  We need to start helping those people.  I welcome that regeneration is starting.  However, in small towns, for example, we need to think outside the box.  Should we, for example, take the VAT off if one paints the outside of one's house or business in a town.  I have seen a few towns over the past few weeks where people got together and, in the evenings and at weekends, went round and tidied everything up.  They got paint, and even painted the poles for the lights in the town.  One can see what they have done when one drives through that.  It regenerates.  To put it simply, it makes a place look good.  The more of such activity that is encouraged the better, but one has to give an incentive.  I believe a Minister for rural affairs should be able to tell a Minister for Finance that the Department will give an incentive for everyone to do up the front of their shops or paint them and will give the VAT off.  I am aware that under EU law the Minister cannot just make that willy-nilly, but he can give a rebate on it.  That is quite allowable.<br/><br/>No one knows better than the Minister, Deputy Ring, - I have been down in Westport at Allergan - that one great legacy we have heading to the west is the road from Dublin to Galway.  In fairness, it is a terrific road.  In a few months, another wing of that will have been added on, which will be a significant help.  However, heading to Deputy Ring's own country, when one goes past Mullingar and the road starts to narrow, it is that bit tougher to encourage investment, as we all are trying to do.  If one is behind a 35x tractor while trying to get to Castlebar fairly quickly, and there is only a single lane with traffic coming against one, to put it simply one will be stuck for a while.  This is one issue that I believe will ignite both the South of Ireland and the Northern part, as well as Donegal.  There are good things happening as well, such as that the A5 will be completed down to Aughnacloy, but we should be looking at a spur from there onto the M1.  We need infrastructure down along the west coast and the Minister is well familiar with the western corridor route of road infrastructure.  Funnily, this is not in what Deputies would refer to as &quot;my constituency&quot;.  Part of it is, but it is for all of the people in an area.  These are matters that need to be teased out.<br/><br/>The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, seated beside the Minister, is from an area where a road is badly needed but people are objecting and trying to block progress, which is intolerable.  People out in Connemara are entitled to a good road the same as if there is one beside me or anybody else.  These people seem to make a business out of objecting to the likes of this.  The port at Galway port also needs deepening.<br/><br/>There is much that can be done but the Minister must have the power to overrule another Department if there is stuff going on that is blocking progress.  No doubt the Minister will have all the ideas in his head.  The Minister will deliver if the paperwork and the blocks on the road are taken out of his way but, unfortunately, we do not seem to be able to cut through the likes of this red tape that is blocking progress in different parts of the country.<br/><br/>The banking sector was touched on earlier.  I read today in a newspaper article that we have bailed them out for &euro;60 billion and they do not even think it worthwhile now to put a face in front of us within their branches.  We met Bank of Ireland a few weeks ago and put proposals to it, and asked why it always go out with a negative story.  We asked why, for example, the bank does not go to the credit union in a town and say, &quot;If we cannot deliver this service, we will team up with you.&quot;, and give them X amount in the year and bring out a story that together they would deliver this service, rather than merely willy-nilly state that they would cut the service out.  The bank did that without even having a bit of regard for those with small businesses who have gone through a hard recession, have driven on after it or given employment.  It is not that these people are millionaires or anything.  They are just surviving and have, maybe, changed some of their business to ensure that they kept a service going in an area.  As I said to the banks that day, if one takes only 4% or 5% out of a town and tells them to head off to the urban area to get their change or that if they want to look at someone behind a counter, they will have to go to the urban area and if those customers start doing any bit of shopping in that urban area, the 4% or 5% could sound the death knell of the smaller towns.<br/><br/>The Minister will be well familiar with and has put work into the post office set up and new ideas are coming on stream.  They need to come on stream.  What I would always say is it is grand talking about it but we have to use them as well and ensure that we send letters or whatever.  Pressure will come on them down the road.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, according to media reports, the broadband situation seems to be deteriorating.  There will be a briefing on Thursday and let us see how that goes.</p><p> The bid to host the Rugby World Cup is great and everyone across the political divide agrees with it.  I wonder whether the Minister will get involved.  It is great to see what has been done with Croke Park.  We also have the Aviva Stadium, Thomond Park, P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, which is a fine stadium, and Semple Stadium.  The west of Ireland needs a focal point of one good stadium, where we could host Ed Sheeran if we wanted, or a rugby, Gaelic or soccer match.  We must come together to ensure this happens for the west of Ireland, which deserves it.  We have plenty of bed spaces.  We should ensure that matches are distributed evenly.  We could even have conference centre in the stadium.  Let us be equal to everybody else.</p> <p> The Minister needs to have a say in the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP.  I do not agree with an oil sheik getting &euro;150,000 and fellows in Aughagower, Glenamaddy or Strokestown getting &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, just because the guy was lucky in 2000, 2001 or 2002 and killed a lot of cattle and had a lot of punches in the bullocks' ears at the time.  I know it will become more environmental, but the Minister will need to have a say in its distribution.  The CAP budget will be affected by approximately &euro;100 million because of Brexit, but we are not watching the big problem that may be coming down the line, which is what the eastern bloc countries will fight to try to get.</p> <p> There is still plenty in the kitty.  As the Minister knows, the family farm is crucial to the local community.  It is the small farmer who buys a bag of nuts, a loaf of bread, a pound of ham and a pair of Wellington boots in the shop.  The general hardware shop in rural areas is very important and helps to create a few jobs.  We are losing farms at present and there is no point in saying we are not.  According to the statistics that came out last week, the age profile of farmers in general along the west coast is higher than in other parts.  If we do not ensure the next round of the CAP is fair to the family farm, the Minister will have an awful job on his hands.</p> <p> At present, there is a lot of pressure with regard to forestry.  I cannot understand why a farmer has to seek planning permission but that the land involved can be sold to someone else.  Every time trees are planted on a farm, it means a family leaves the area.  I know we need a certain amount of trees, but it should be equal in all parts of the country.  If we sow five acres in one section of the country there should be five acres in another section of the country, and it should not be tilted towards losing a lot of people in one section of the country.</p> <p> There is land in Limerick and surrounding areas that is designated for the protection of hen harriers.  Farmers in those areas cannot plant trees or farm their land because they cannot clean drains or use mowers.  Something has been put on their land which is affecting them.  There was also destocking of hills.  That is fair enough if they had to be destocked for the environment.  The problem now, however, is that if someone previously had 100 or 500 sheep but this has reduced to 40, the 40 sheep will not eat every blade of grass and they will go for the sweetest bit.  Then an inspector will come out and state that 20% of the area was not grazed and the farmer will lose the payment.</p> <p> These are the pressures.  Many good things are also happening and it is not all doom and gloom.  Every day people fight tooth and nail, and there is no better place to live than rural Ireland.  We have freedom, fresh air and, above all, people have their own independence no matter where they go in their area.</p> <p> The Minister needs to put the boot in and get more for rural areas.  I know he would have more of a workload and that there would probably be more pressure on him as a result.  However, I rate the Minister as someone who would never be afraid of a challenge or pressure.  He needs to ensure that he gets control of more stuff.  The Minister needs to keep an eye on county councils for the simple reason that the budget has been reduced by up to 40% since 2008 or 2009.  We need to keep the roads and infrastructure in good shape because they are crucial to development.  The Minister was involved in the Wild Atlantic Way, which has been a huge success.  Entrepreneurship is part of it and what people have done in an area to drive it on.  People took risks and showed example.  Will the Minister fight tooth and nail?  The islands should be a no-brainer.  The Minister should have the final say on a lot of stuff.  This would make it better because, in fairness, he understands the position.</p></speech>

I am delighted he got the position and I wish him well.  I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, well.</p>  <p>  There is a plethora of difficulties, as the Minister well knows, with regard to the west of Ireland.  I and my party are of the opinion we must seriously look at the Department being decentralised to the west.  The west, as a region, needs to have this Department in it and working out of the locality.  It cannot be done out of Dublin.</p>  <p>  At present, we have a withdrawal of counter services in banks, which is causing huge difficulties throughout the region.  We also have an issue with roads.  The Minister knows the N5 as he travels up and down it most days, as do I.  The state of it is appalling.  We have a complete lack of jobs.  The programme for Government refers to balanced regional development.  The Minister knows this is not happening.  Where are the jobs in Roscommon or Galway?  I admit the Government is doing a bit better in Mayo, but the jobs are not coming to counties such as mine and people are leaving.  People speak about the unemployment figures reducing in our county.  People are getting work, but they are getting it outside the county.  They travel to Galway, Dublin or wherever they must go but there are no jobs in the county.</p>  <p>  There is a situation with regard to the equalisation fund and local authorities.  This is a massive issue.  Recently, I spoke to the CEO of Galway County Council.  There are difficulties at present regarding the council's finances, the need to balance the books and the amount of money it must give to the equalisation fund.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, knows this well.  It is not an acceptable situation.</p>  <p>  We must also look at the demise of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  For years they gave a great deal of employment in particular localities but the goalposts have changed and a lot of the traditional work has gone.  Fewer people are employed in my county by the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  We must also look at the position regarding T&uacute;s, SOLAS and rural social schemes.  Much work needs to be done with these schemes.  They are not satisfactory as matters stand.  They were previously very beneficial to particular areas.</p>  <p>  Revaluation is a huge issue, particularly for rural Ireland.  The revaluation of property is causing consternation for many small businesses.</p><p>Many of them will close unless this matter is tackled by the Government.  We can also talk about the rail services, post offices and planning.  I was delighted to see the Minister address the planning issue in a comprehensive manner recently in the farming news section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I hope he will use his good offices to do something about rural planning.  We all accept that there must guidelines and regulations, but the regulations have now gone over the top.  It is virtually impossible to get planning permission in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Broadband is critical infrastructure for SMEs and households across rural Ireland.  The Government's performance to date in implementing the national broadband plan has been shockingly slow and ineffective, revealing an incapacity to project manage, execute and deliver a plan of this nature.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, confirmed this as far back as 2015 when he said the Government has lost patience with the pace of the roll-out.  The procurement process has been ongoing for a considerable length of time.</p>  <p>  There have been many commitments.  In 2012, the then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, published a plan committing the Government to providing 100% broadband provision well ahead of 2020.  In its 2016 manifesto, Fine Gael committed to the provision of high speed broadband to at least 85% of premises by 2018 and 100% by 2020.  In 2016, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, said that the contract would be awarded by June 2017.  However, now we cannot even get a date from that Minister for when the procurement process will be completed.  The decision to allow Eir to proceed with 300,000 households appears to have condemned the remaining 542,000 households to an indefinite wait for broadband.  Ronan Lupton of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators summed up the situation when he said that the commercial viability of the national broadband plan is now in question.  He said, "We're in Angola with regards to rural broadband and it looks like we're going to stay in Angola".</p>  <p>  The reason for the Government's decision regarding Eir, which is a commercial company, must be far more transparent.  Does it fundamentally alter the procurement process, given what companies were originally tendering for and the new situation?  In the replies the Minister gave to questions in the D&aacute;il he spoke about the next phase of the plan and so forth.  However, the deadlines have been missed and the programme for Government commitment is way out when compared to what was said.  There must be full transparency on this.  Why is the Minister not in a position to give a date for the completion of the procurement process and the awarding of the contract in respect of the remaining 542,000 houses?  Otherwise rural Ireland will be condemned indefinitely in terms of the provision of broadband, which will have dire consequences for the retention of investment and attracting inward investment in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200015#N00500"><p>The Government believes in an economy that is based on equal opportunity, that is, the opportunity for every individual and family, as well as every region of the country, to join fully in the economic recovery and to experience prosperity.  We are seeing economic growth in all parts of the country, as is evident in the statistics.  There is jobs growth in all parts of the country and unemployment is falling in all regions.  That is extremely important for many reasons.  However, we must accelerate the recovery in rural areas and ensure that the areas that have not grown as fast as our cities are able to catch up.  Improvements in infrastructure are crucial to enabling them to catch up.  That includes improvements in transport infrastructure, which are under way with the Gort to Tuam motorway just one example of a major project, and improvements in broadband, to allow premises, businesses and homes to connect to the high speed broadband network.</p>  <p>  Currently, just over 50% of premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  We estimate that it will increase to over 75% by the end of 2018 and to between 90% and 100% by 2020-21.  Eir has committed to providing high speed broadband to 300,000 premises and it will start on that shortly.  In the larger intervention area 550,000 premises have been identified for intervention under the national broadband plan.  At present, detailed discussions are taking place around the contracts.  They will run until September, approximately, and it is estimated that the companies can put in their final bids at that point.  It is a huge contract and we are anxious to ensure we get it right.  The Deputy will be aware that there were difficulties and problems in the past with telecommunications contracts, and with such contracts going wrong, so it is important that we get this absolutely right.  The money is available to support it and the Government is fully behind it.</p>  <p>  We are determined to minimise any delays in providing broadband to all parts of the country.  Indeed, at local authority level officers have been appointed to be a single point of contact in respect of broadband, so they can overcome difficulties that in the past and even now could be created by local authorities in providing access to the infrastructure required for the roll-out of broadband.</p></speech>

Eir is not the Government and he should stop trying to claim credit for what a commercial operator is doing.  Deadlines have been missed repeatedly and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has refused to give a date for when the procurement process will be complete and the contract awarded.  The Government's commitment in the programme for Government has gone by the wayside.  That programme states: "Following the completion of the tender process and the awarding of the contract, targeted for June 2017, the new Government will work with the winners to accelerate the roll out of the infrastructure next year".  We are nowhere near that, and there is no transparency around it.  Cliff Taylor put it very well in a recent article when he wrote: "At this stage even the National Children's Hospital will be operational before the broadband plan is complete."  The degree to which the needs of rural households and businesses are being denied and dismissed is scandalous, given the shambolic approach to delivering on a national plan that was published as far back as 2012.  We now face the prospect of it being potentially 2019 or 2020 before we see the commencement of this plan, if at all.  We do not know whether the companies that bid for the original process are now redoing their sums as a result of the Government's decision with regard to Eir.</p></speech>

If one bids for 900,000 and 300,000 are taken out, with no reason given for the change in the Government's approach in that regard, does the plan not change fundamentally?

That is very welcome.  Obviously we wish to ensure that when we use taxpayers' money we do so where it is needed, not where the private sector or a commercial enterprise can do it for us without recourse to the taxpayer.  That is under way and it will allow another 300,000 premises across the country to be connected to high speed broadband.</p><p>That is very important and welcome.  As for the other 540,000 premises, Government intervention will be required and we are determined to do that as quickly as we possibly can.  However, we have to follow proper procedures and procurement rules.  We hope there will be a number of bidders for this enormous contract and it can be awarded as soon as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will minimise delays.  We are absolutely committed to ensuring that every premises has access to high speed broadband to enable all of them to take part in the modern digital economy as they wish to do. </p></speech>

Those who met included James Connolly, P&aacute;draig Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Joseph Plunkett and Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada.  Michael Collins, the Taoiseach's hero, also played a prominent role in the battle of Moore Street, as did nurse Elizabeth Farrell.  The street is, therefore, of significant importance to the story of Ireland and our revolutionary history.  It is an indictment of successive Governments that the site has not been developed as a heritage site or national monument but allowed to fall into dereliction.  We may wonder why this is so.  It is because the ruling elites in this State have no affinity with the egalitarian message of the 1916 Proclamation and its promise of, and commitment to, equality for all citizens.</p>  <p>  Moore Street was to be destroyed and replaced with a shopping mall but this was prevented by public outrage.  Last year, during the centenary commemorations of the 1916 Rising - the Taoiseach should consider the irony of this - the relatives of the leaders of the Rising were in the High Court in opposition to the Government's plans.  The High Court accepted their case and ruled that Moore Street constitutes a national monument.  What did the Government do but appeal the decision of the High Court.  Is it not incredible that in the centenary year of the Rising, the Government appealed against a legal ruling that Moore Street, an integral part of the Rising, should be saved?</p>  <p>  At the same time, a consultative group established by the Minister also recommended the development of Moore Street as a battlefield site and part of an historical cultural quarter.  The group, comprising of Oireachtas representatives, Dublin city councillors, representatives of 1916 relatives groups, Moore Street campaigning groups, street traders and other relevant stakeholders, put forward detailed proposals for the preservation and regeneration of this iconic place.  The Minister accepted the report, although she has not yet brought before the Cabinet.</p>  <p>  On the one hand, the Minister is appealing a court ruling that Moore Street be preserved while, on the other hand, she has accepted a report recommending the preservation of this iconic site and detailed proposals for its development.  While her acceptance of the report has no legal status at this time, the Government's appeal against the High Court decision clearly has such status.  Not surprisingly, the developer of the site is not engaging with the oversight group.  It now appears the developer is prepared to await the outcome of the Government's appeal which is to be heard in the autumn.  That is disgraceful.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach stop the Government's appeal against the High Court decision on the preservation of Moore Street?  Will he confirm his support for, and take the necessary steps to ensure the implementation of, the report of the consultative group established by the Minister?</p></speech>

In particular, a couple of years ago, I went on a tour of the area with some of the representatives of the families of descendants of those who were involved in the 1916 Rising.  Deputy Adams will know that there are different views among the different groups of descendants and family representatives on this important issue.  Moore Street is an historical site, one of many connected to the Rising, including the GPO, College of Surgeons and many of the other locations where commemorations were held last year.</p>  <p>  The State has acquired Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and part of No. 18.  When all other proposals to restore the buildings failed, the acquisition was facilitated by the National Asset Management Agency as the buildings were under lien to the agency at the time.  The Department then took up a tender process that had been initiated by the previous owners for the conservation and restoration of the buildings as a 1916 commemorative centre.</p>  <p>  The Moore Street consultative group was set up to bring together all relevant interests after the High Court ruling of March 2016 which stopped work on the State's restoration project.  The group reported to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, at the end of March 2017 with a set of recommendations for a way forward for the street based on consensus.  The report looked carefully at all relevant aspects, including the variety of State, public and private properties and interests on the street and the need to cement the presence of the street traders.  The report signals the potential for a successful outcome to be agreed between the relevant parties that balances the perspectives of all the key stakeholders.  The Minister and Government are fully supportive of this approach and we want to see the work that has been done continue in order that we can progress to the next stage and see tangible results and real improvements on the ground.</p>  <p>  The next step was the establishment of a new advisory group, which the report identifies as the most effective way to move forward with its recommendations.  An advisory group chaired by Dr. Tom Collins was established and its work is under way.  Its members are drawn from among the membership of the former Moore Street consultative group.  The advisory group's task is to engage with all stakeholder bodies that have a role in bringing the recommendations of the consultative group to fruition.  Its objective will be to secure an outcome that is acceptable to everyone and provides an agreed framework for the future of Moore Street.</p>  <p>  The Government is continuing with the appeal of the High Court decision, not only because of its implications for the Moore Street site but also because of its implications for infrastructure projects more generally.  It would not be appropriate to get into the detail of the appeal in this House as it is before the courts.  The work of the advisory group can continue notwithstanding the appeal and the Office of Public Works has taken in charge Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 Moore Street. </p></speech>

I wonder if he had a "Love Actually" or "Michael Collins" moment when he went down Moore Street.  This House is the place for the Taoiseach to give notice that he is stopping the appeal against the High Court decision.  He is new to this job and this is probably the final time he will take Leaders' Questions in this session.  The vision he has set out runs totally contrary to the 1916 Proclamation.  The Republic proclaimed in the revolutionary period has yet to be realised.  Last year, we had a hugely popular, public and justifiably proud celebration in commemoration of the Rising.  The core values proclaimed at that time should underpin the daily work of Members and any Government working for the future that describes itself as republican.</p>  <p>  As is often the case in this State, the court case was taken by a citizen, Colm &Oacute; Mordha.  Instead of the State doing this, we have citizens standing up and doing it all the time.</p>  <p>  There is no division of opinion.  The report of the consultative group has widespread support.</p></speech>

I asked the Taoiseach to drop the Government's appeal.  He copped out and dodged that question and spoke of the importance of history.  Does he know that, according to the Minister, the money that will be used to fund the appeal will more than likely come from the 1916 commemorations fund?  Public money set aside to preserve our history will be used to destroy our history.  As I do not have time to repeat my questions, I ask the Taoiseach to drop the case and confirm his support for the consultative report.</p></speech>

The vision I have put across of the Republic I want to see is one in which every individual and every part of the country has an opportunity to share in our prosperity.  That is why infrastructural development is so important.  The reason the Government is appealing the case is on a point of law and because of the potential impacts it could have on other developments around the country.</p></speech>

If that precedent were followed in other places, it could make it very difficult for us to embark on the ambitious expansionary economic policy that we have and the building programme we have in many other parts of the country where we need to invest in infrastructure and build new housing, hospitals, primary care centres, schools and third level institutions.</p><p>We need to be assured that the implications of this case do not prevent us doing those things in other parts of the country.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, reassures me that the funding for the case, if there even is a bill - of course we do not know what the outcome is going to be - will not come from the 2016 commemoration fund.</p></speech>

The study was conducted as part of a Europe-wide examination of how to strengthen social investment.  It says that the housing crisis has not yet peaked and is likely to escalate over the next five years.  It also states that families can be severely damaged and traumatised from living in emergency accommodation, including family hubs.  This study is based on international experience and research into Irish emergency accommodation.  Does the Taoiseach agree that families and children should not - as the report and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommend - spend longer than three months in emergency accommodation, including family hubs, and that this should be legislated for and there should be a commitment to close all hubs by December 2019?  Does he agree there is a danger, as the study says, that the newly established family hubs could become a form of direct provision for poor families?</p>  <p>  The report finds that the major reliance of successive Governments, particularly in the context of Rebuilding Ireland, on the private sector to provide social housing has contributed to the problems now facing the State where two thirds of new social housing has come from the private rental sector?  The report finds a core tension between Irish housing and economic policy with one trying to address the social housing crisis and the latter encouraging and relying on the private market to deliver investment in housing.  The report states that the absence of State investment in social housing negates the rights of the vulnerable.  It also states that the housing assistance payment - a payment to households on the social housing list but living in the private rented sector - is not a valid mechanism to meet the right to housing.  While the report makes this argument from a security of tenure perspective, it also notes that, from a cost perspective, direct-build social housing presents a far greater return on State investment and thus is a more cost-efficient policy option.</p>  <p>  There are other points I want to make but I will conclude on this.  Even Rebuilding Ireland's inadequate targets are not being met.  The relevant figures show that just 200 new social housing units were built in quarter 1 of this year.  There will be fewer than 1,000 new social housing units built this year, which is less than a third of the Rebuilding Ireland target of 3,200.  Of the &euro;1.3 billion budget for so-called social housing this year, just a quarter, approximately &euro;390 million, will be capital investment in the new build social programme.  The real test for the Taoiseach, his Government and his commitment to human rights and equality is whether he is prepared to say that enough is enough, that this is an emergency and that no family will spend longer than three months in emergency accommodation.  He should put every resource available to the State into undertaking an emergency social housing building programme, beginning in the next month, in order to meet the target of 5,000 social housing units a year.  This has to be done and the problem must be faced up to.</p></speech>

Staying in a bed and breakfast establishment or a hotel is not appropriate for families.  This type of accommodation is much preferable to the situation we have at the moment with people staying in bed and breakfast establishments and hotels.  It is not considered to be a long-term housing solution.  It is absolutely not the intention.  It is only intended to be a short-term solution while people are provided with houses, apartments or proper accommodation under the social housing support system, whether through rent supplement, HAP or social housing.</p>  <p>  In terms of the progress being made on the implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, it is important to point out a few things.  Planning permission has been granted for 16,375 new homes in the past 12 months, which is an increase of 26%.  Commencement notices have been issued for 14,192 new homes nationwide, which is an increase of 38%.  When it comes to housing completions as measured by ESB connections, in the 12 months up to the end of March 2015, it reached 15,684 homes across the country, which is 19% on the previous year.  We are, without doubt, seeing an acceleration in the provision of housing and house -building.  We are way behind where we need to be but we are now moving in the right direction.  In terms of social housing there is a pipeline of 600 social housing projects involving the construction of over 10,000 homes at various stages in the process.  There are currently 130 schemes under way on sites nationwide building over 2,400 homes.  These include large-scale sites brought forward for mixed-tenure housing such as O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin City Council, Kilcarbery in South Dublin County Council and also in Fingal.</p></speech>

There are also the silent homeless living in overcrowded accommodation.  There are also those who are in emergency accommodation.  The reality is that the issue is not being addressed.  We have not even reached the peak of this housing crisis and we are not addressing what we should be doing over the next five to ten years.  The fact is that we are not short of solutions.  The report outlines many, -as Neary and others have done - in terms of the State stepping up and delivering and leading the supply of social and affordable housing, something it has resolutely failed to do up to now.  Instead, it is waiting and encouraging the private market which this report shows will not deliver social or affordable housing.  We need to increase our capital expenditure funding to at least &euro;1 billion a year in order to deliver funding to local authorities and housing bodies to enable them to build a minimum of 5,000 units a year.  It has been said to the Taoiseach here today that these hubs can possibly become the direct provision centres of the future.  He has heard it and he has had to respond to it.  He has to deal with this emergency and meet with this group, Rory Hearne and the housing committee to go through this report.  It is really crucial that we deal with these issues now and not let this continue.</p></speech>

I recall he was student union president in Trinity when I was a student there and I think he may even have been an election candidate for one of the left-wing groups more recently than that.  I met him not too long ago at a running event in the Phoenix Park where he was less than pleasant, to put it that way.  It certainly was not the kind of polite conversation I would expect from a university academic.</p>  <p>  There are 90,000 people on the housing list but very many, if not most, have houses and apartments.  However, these are houses and apartments that are being provided to them through rent supplement or the private rental sector and they want different houses or apartments that are more appropriate to their needs.  It is important to recall that of those 90,000 on the housing list, the majority are in houses or apartments, just not the permanent homes they would like to have and which we would like them to have.</p>  <p>  The total commitment in terms of the Government to social housing is a commitment of &euro;5.35 billion so it is pretty much &euro;1 billion a year, if not more.  That is intended to deliver 47,000 social homes by the end of 2021.</p></speech>

We are aware of the very tragic death of Mrs. Malak Thawley.  Her husband Alan has been devastated and has called for an independent investigation into her untimely death.  She had a blood vessel accidentally severed during routine surgery she was undergoing following an ectopic pregnancy.  The coroner's inquest left many questions to be answered.  He was denied access to medical records; phone logs; the full names, qualifications and expertise of the doctors and consultants involved in his late wife's care; the identity of other hospitals involved; statements, minutes of meetings etc.; Garda information; and feedback.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the list of issues.  There was no blood in the laboratory, not enough blood in the theatre and so on.</p></speech>

A maternal death is always a very sad and tragic event.  I know in all cases people do everything they can to avoid them happening.  I express my condolences and deep sorrow to the family.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, an inquest was carried out.  Inquests by their nature are independent.  It follows a court-type process where evidence is given.  People, including doctors, are called to the stand and are asked questions.  Therefore, an inquest is an independent inquiry and provides some answers.  In addition to that, an independent or external case review could also be carried out.  It is not that one contradicts the other.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, said he would reflect on the request.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago, UNICEF published a damning international report on child well-being, which revealed that the teenage suicide rate in this State is the fourth highest in the EU-OECD region.  Professor Brendan Kelly of Trinity College told the Seanad Public Consultation Committee last week that it is almost impossible to get a hospital bed for a child or an adolescent struggling with mental health issues.</p>  <p>  At the weekend it was reported that 44 children had been admitted to adult units in the first five months of this year, which is an increase on last year.  My constituency has no child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in the north Louth area.  Community-based psychiatric services in Dundalk are practically non-existent, apart from Ladywell, which, despite the hard work of the staff there, is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Given the much talked-up summer economic statement today, will the Taoiseach commit to the provision of fully staffed and adequately funded mental health services?  Will he ensure a significant increase in mental health funding in budget 2018?</p></speech>

It has increased this year from &euro;826 million to &euro;853 million.  For example, the budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention has more than doubled in recent years.  We are now seeing a reduction in suicide rates.  It is already the case that suicide rates in Ireland are below the average in Europe, although there is a particular high level among younger people and younger males in particular.</p>  <p>  Some 100 new assistant psychologist posts have recently been sanctioned.  That is particularly for the early intervention primary care area.  The contract has been signed for the new forensic mental health hospital in Portrane.  It will replace a very old facility in Dundrum with a new state-of-the-art one that is now under construction.  In the first five months of 2017, there have been 136 CAMHS admissions, of which 44 were child admissions to adult units and 92 to CAMHS units.  The Mental Health Commission report for 2016 shows a downward trend of about 30% in the number of child and adolescent admissions to adult units, compared with 2015.  However, I appreciate that we have had a step backwards in recent months.</p></speech>

In May, I raised the need for an amendment to the coroners legislation, an issue raised by many Members in the House.  I believe there is now cross-party support for the need for mandatory inquests on all cases of maternal death.  I was assured that was a priority - I have that in writing from the T&aacute;naiste - and that work was under way to allow a debate on a coroners (amendment) Bill to take place before the end of this D&aacute;il session.

Could the Taoiseach tell us when the Government will get serious about the crisis in child welfare, because 1,500 children being taken into care under emergency care orders in three years is very serious?

The reason I raise the matter is that the Coughlanstown Road, the L6048, at Ballymore Eustace has been closed for the past 11 months due to subsidence.  The impact on residents in the area has been incredible.  Although many of them only live half a mile from the village they have to travel a detour on bad, narrow roads of nine miles.  That also has a huge impact on business.  The reason I raise the matter here is that Arup drew up a report that shows the cost of restoring this vital artery would be &euro;3.5 million at a minimum.  That would amount to 25% of Kildare County Council's annual fund for roads.  The council is responsible for 2,528 km of road in the county.  It is essential that national funding be provided.  I have spoken to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on the issue but we need the Taoiseach's support.</p></speech>

I raised the matter in the House a few weeks ago and the T&aacute;naiste forwarded a reply indicating that the strategy would now be published next week after the House rises.  The purpose of raising the question initially is that the strategy is to run for an extended period, to 2025, and the intention was that it would have been debated in this House, had things gone according to plan, but that is not now possible.</p>  <p>  This is the second time this has occurred.  I asked the Taoiseach previously whether he would publish the submissions on the mid-term capital review and if we could have a debate on it.  My concern is that issues of national importance in terms of strategies and policies are being adopted by the Government, a minority Government, that will endure long beyond the life of the Government, without respect for this House having an opportunity to debate them.  In future, will the Taoiseach acknowledge the issue I have raised and allow debates on those issues rather than for the Government to adopt policies and strategies without any reference to this House?</p></speech>

I imagine it will be possible to facilitate a debate in September or October after we return.  As Deputy Curran said, it is a long-term strategy.  I accept the validity of his point that it would be better if we were able to debate strategies in the House in a timely manner, although that would obviously restrict us from publishing any strategies during the recess period.  I agree that it would be preferable and more ideal if we were to allow for debate in the House on strategies around the time they are published.</p></speech>

It is designed to give people who qualify for the fair deal scheme the option of home care instead.  The Bill did not go to Committee Stage because the Government gave me a commitment that the Bill would be discussed on Committee Stage within six months.  The six months elapse tomorrow.  Is it the Government's intention to let the Bill go to Committee Stage, and if so, when?</p></speech>

Originally, the consultation process was due to be launched in May with a closing date in August but it was only launched last week and the closing date is still August.  The group appealed to the Government to extend the consultation period by at least a month because many of the groups concerned will not be able to meet to discuss the issue within the existing timeframe.</p></speech>

I do not have any objection to the date being extended, as August is a difficult time for many people to prepare submissions and get them in, so I will raise the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and see if that is possible.</p>  <p>  Any scheme will have financial implications.  The fair deal scheme costs about &euro;1 billion a year.  I do not know how much a home care scheme would cost but we would need to know how the scheme would be designed and its cost before we could proceed with a money message.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might do that.</p>  <p>  Today I am asking about the motorised transport scheme.  It was suspended in February 2013 because the Ombudsman said that the Department was acting unduly.  At that time we were advised that a new scheme would be introduced within six months, which are now long gone.  Over the past 12 months, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has stated several times that the new scheme was imminent.  The scheme is aimed at people with severe disabilities who cannot walk.  When the Taoiseach talks about equal opportunities for all, I suggest that people with a disability deserve an equal opportunity.  When will the replacement scheme come into force?  Four and a half years later, I think there would be grounds for a legal challenge unless the Government reintroduces the scheme without much more delay.</p></speech>

In light of Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments yesterday, when he asked why Ireland helps NGOs that call for the destruction of Israel and why it does not condemn the Palestinians for incitement and glorification of terrorists, will the Taoiseach reject without reservation Prime Minister Netanyahu's accusations against Irish NGOs and Irish Aid?  Furthermore, will the Taoiseach confirm the Government's support for the work of Irish Aid and NGOs in the Middle East and in Palestine?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the work of NGO Monitor, an Israeli Government organisation that has made some very serious charges against Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid in a letter that came to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence on 16 May?  I submitted the letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the time.  Grave accusations are being made against Irish Aid.

In a recent reply from the HSE, I was informed that 1,825 people are waiting for X-rays, CT scans and MRI scans in University Hospital Kerry, and that 13,184 in total in the eight hospitals in the South/South West hospital group are waiting for what would be considered very simple and non-time-consuming procedures.  This waiting list is far too high.  I have older citizens in Kerry telling me that they could be waiting up to 12 months for an MRI scan.  This is no good for a country that spends so much money on health care.  How is the Government still failing to provide adequate health care?</p></speech>

I remind the Taoiseach that this is a very important tool in fighting crime.  I ask the Taoiseach to put on record that there will be no cutback in the funding of the text alert system.  It has replaced garda&iacute; on the beat since their numbers were reduced and stations closed.  We need to keep the system.  Text alert has made people alert.

While 55% of the rates collected by Kildare County Council are contributed by just 2% of the companies, Kildare County Council and its members have no ability to vary the rate or give preferential rates to smaller more indigenous traders.

The Limerick-Foynes route is now moving towards final route selection and is in the planning phase.  More importantly, the Adare bypass is in the capital investment plan and Foynes is a tier 1 port in Europe.</p><p>Has an application been made for TEN-T funding for this motorway?

I understand that 50% of GPs in County Leitrim will retire over the next seven years.  The HSE has failed to get a doctor to attend to people in the town of Kinlough, which has grown substantially in recent years and has quite a large catchment area.  As a doctor, the Taoiseach knows that the front-line soldiers in the health care system send people into the secondary care system.  If we do not have enough doctors, our accident and emergency units will be flooded.  They are extremely bad and they are going to get an awful lot worse.  A new recruitment drive is needed to retain GPs who have trained in this country.  We need them to stay here.  I understand from media reports this morning that there are plenty of training places.  It is not the case that we do not have enough places for training doctors.  The problem is that doctors are leaving the country when they are trained.  We need to do something.  I suggest we should push ahead with the primary medical care centres, which are part of Government policy, and organise a promotion to keep the doctors here.

There are significant problems with medical services in rural Ireland.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the number of occupational therapists and language therapists.  County Leitrim is meant to have two occupational therapists, but both of them are on leave and have not been replaced.  The occupational therapy service in County Sligo is operating at less than 50% of capacity.  These are serious issues for families throughout the country, particularly the families of people with disabilities.  An effort needs to be made to try to deliver on some of this stuff.</p></speech>

The rural practice allowance, which incentivises GPs to work in rural areas, is now more generous than it has ever been before.  I signed that order a year or so ago.  The model is changing.  Fewer GPs are willing to work single-handed or to take on the enormous debts that are required to establish a practice.  One of the features of the negotiations that are going to start with the GP representative organisations is the possibility of having more salaried positions.  Under such an approach, the Government would pay people a salary to work as GPs in particular areas.</p></speech>

The purpose of the two Bills is pretty straightforward.  The Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Blasphemy) Bill 2017 would allow a referendum to go ahead that would seek the approval of the electorate for the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  This would involve amending Article 46.1.1&deg; of the Constitution.  The Defamation (Amendment) Bill 2017 would remove the offence of blasphemy by repealing sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.  As long ago as 1991, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the offence of blasphemy be removed from the Constitution and rightly recommended that it be taken in conjunction with another referendum to save on expense.  The commission's view was that there was "no place for an offence of blasphemous libel in a society which respects freedom of speech".</p>  <p>  A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, recently admitted that the law in this area is ridiculous and needs to be repealed.  He was speaking in response to the embarrassing publicity for our country when an internationally renowned comedian faced possible charges and a potential &euro;25,000 fine simply for expressing his beliefs on a TV programme about faith.  Many of us could have been fooled into thinking this was an elaborate joke but, unfortunately, it was not.  As long as we maintain an offence of blasphemy in our laws, the joke is on us in Ireland.  The Social Democrats believe the offence of blasphemy is an outdated concept that should be removed from our Constitution and our laws.  It is yet one more example of where church and State need to be fully separated.</p>  <p>  The offence of blasphemy is archaic, obsolete and unnecessary.  It fundamentally offends the principle of freedom of speech, promotes disrespect for our laws and damages our international reputation.  In any case, having the offence of blasphemy on our Statute Book offers little protection in genuine cases of deliberate incitement to hatred.  The Defamation Act 2009 is now under review.  We urge the Minister to update it without delay to offer better protection in cases in which minority and majority religious groups face deliberate and excessive provocation.  For now, there is no reason we cannot proceed with updating our Constitution and removing this offence from the Statute Book.  In a society where freedom of expression is valued and supported, there is absolutely no excuse for inaction in this regard.  We hope we can count on the support of Deputies on all sides of the House in respect of both Bills.</p></speech>

While I welcome the Bill in question, which deals with tableware, it is a bit skimpy and more substantial meat will need to be put on its bones.  The Bill I am introducing today on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in is more comprehensive.  At least last night's positive initiative prompted this Parliament to discuss waste, which is a serious issue for our society.  We need to deal with waste because it is having a detrimental effect on the countryside and on streets, rivers and oceans.  The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is having wide-reaching effects.  We need to take a broader approach to waste management.  It is simply not effective to concentrate on what goes into the household bin while neglecting the producer who is at the start of the chain in the first place.</p><p>The comprehensive Bill I am introducing seeks to deal with our ever-growing waste mountain.  It proposes to amend various existing waste management statutes, including the Waste Management Act 1996.  We are proposing that a deposit recycling scheme should be established, that a levy should be imposed on the industry and that a deposit should be applied when certain drinks containers are purchased.  Under this proposal, when a drinks container is returned to the recycling unit, a credit which can be redeemed will be provided.  The Minister focused heavily on the cost last night.  We are not talking about a cost on the Exchequer here.</p><p>We are talking about a circular economy for waste, where the benefit comes back to the householder, industry and the environment.  The objective is to encourage the return of such containers - glass bottles, plastic bottles and aluminium cans.  We see them discarded in hedgerows and streets throughout the country and our local councils spend millions each year cleaning up illegal dumping.  In setting up a scheme we need to consider the current extensive costs for local authorities, money that would be better spent elsewhere.  We also have to think of carbon emissions from the production of these waste containers and the horrific effects they have on the environment.  By 2050 it is expected that the oceans and seas will contain the same weight in plastic as in fish, which is a horrific prospect.  The scheme we propose will give an incentive to the individual to return containers, and where deposits are not redeemed, the money will go into a central fund to be used by county councils for environmental measures.</p> <p> It is clear that the level of illegal dumping across the countryside needs to be dealt with.  Accordingly, we propose an amendment to the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to increase fines for illegal commercial dumping and to place liability on those found guilty for the costs of the clean-up.  We also provide for on-the-spot fines to be reviewed and we propose to amend the Residential Tenancies Act to place an obligation on landlords in respect of waste collection, as well as ensuring tenants have a legal means of disposing of waste.  We provide for an increased protection for householders who use waste protection companies, having heard stories about the latter putting onerous charges on people under allegations of cross-contamination.  That needs to be regulated.</p> <p> Given the figures, the costs and the effects on the environment, we have to move away from our single-use, throwaway society and the mentality of the past.  It is having a dreadful effect on our countryside, the environment and the economy, and if we do not do it, we will have a bleaker future.  We cannot put this off any longer.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, talked about costs last night but Sinn F&eacute;in is not talking about costs.  We are talking about measures that will create jobs, as they did in Sweden and Finland and many other countries which are 30 years ahead of us in this area.  We have made good progress on recycling.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is talking about job creation and not costs to the Exchequer.  We need to model our proposals on what other countries have done and to build circular economies.  The time for action is now and all of us, householders, elected representatives, local authority members, officials and industry, must play our part.  This Bill is a means for doing that and will provide a more sustainable economy.  I urge the Government not to oppose it as it is a positive measure for a more sustainable future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200024#V00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the issuing of heritage licences to island fishermen to facilitate the continuance of traditional fishing practices on Ireland&rsquo;s offshore islands; and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>I will share time with Deputy Martin Kenny.  Over recent years we have become acquainted with the situation in rural Ireland, particularly our coastal communities.  While they are suffering terribly, our island communities are suffering even more.  The way of life of island communities has survived by means of fishing and farming, and much of their fishery included drift netting for salmon, potting for crayfish and lobster, some trawling, gill netting for various species and fishing for pollock, spurdog and bass.  In recent years, the island communities have become detached from the Common Fisheries Policy quotas and now receive little, if any, quota apart from some in the whitefish sector.  There is a European ban on spurdog, despite that many fishermen in our coastal communities say there is an abundance.  They are no longer allowed to fish bass, even though fishing trawlers and boats from other EU countries are allowed to.  The biggest hit of all was the banning of the drift net for salmon.  Fishing and farming were a way of life in our coastal communities and they managed to survive in a sustainable way.</p><p>Before we prepared this Bill, Deputy Martin Kenny, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I met the island communities, and it is conjunction with them that this Bill has come forward.  We need a sustainable way of life and the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 is one way to bring that about.  I ask the House to support it because it will go some way to address the terrible imbalance between our island and coastal communities and the rest of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200024#V01000"><p>The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill is about ensuring people who live on the islands have a future and about facilitating their right to maintain a way of life they have had for centuries.  The problem at the moment is that under the Common Fisheries Policy many small fishermen on our islands are not able to have a living.  Working in conjunction with the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO, we developed the heritage licence scenario.  The Bill is designed for people who live on the islands and want to make their living from fishing and will try to allocate a portion of the quota to the island fishermen.  In providing for this, the Bill facilitates the islandmen in having a future and the continuation of traditional fishing practices on our offshore islands.  It provides that the issuing of a licence to island fishermen will be confined to people who are habitually resident on one of Ireland's offshore islands and are engaged in small-scale coastal fishing to earn a livelihood.  Small-scale coastal fishing is defined as fishing from a vessel of less than 12 metres in length and not using towed fishing gear.  We are putting in restrictions to ensure it cannot be expanded to anyone else and the licences cannot be traded or sold off, as has happened in the past.  They will be non-transferable and will be in force only when the holder of the licence is on board the vessel.  In other words, one person cannot have several boats.  This ensures it is about the small fishermen on the island having a future.  The enactment of the Bill will involve a transferable community island quota, such as has been done in other jurisdictions in the EU.</p>  <p>  Much of the work that went into this Bill was done by the island fishermen themselves, who came to us looking for a solution to their problem.  This is an attempt at such a solution and we would appreciate the support of the Government.  People on the islands feel they are disadvantaged not only by their geography but by the erosion of their traditional way of making a living by legislation brought in by Brussels and enacted here.  I appeal to the Government to support the Bill.</p></speech>

The Prime Minister was especially welcome as my first international visitor given the close and historic ties between our two countries.  Our meeting was an opportunity to discuss our shared and common outlook on the issues of free trade multilateralism and climate action.</p><p>We discussed the importance of the bilateral trade and investment relationship between our two countries.  Annual trade between Ireland and Canada is valued at more than &euro;2.75 billion while Canadian tourist traffic to Ireland has increased by 56% in three years, with close to 200,000 Canadians visiting Ireland every year.  The Prime Minister and I agreed that there is considerable potential for growing trade and economic links further given increased direct air access, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the strength of our respective economies.</p> <p> We discussed the current state of play of Brexit since the commencement of negotiations, and I outlined Ireland's priorities in this regard.  The Prime Minister was also interested in developments in Northern Ireland, and I updated him on the current political situation there.  He reiterated to me the Canadian Government's commitment to support the Northern Ireland peace process and offered any assistance that might be helpful to drive progress.</p> <p> The Prime Minister and I discussed the benefits and opportunities regarding CETA for both our economies and progress towards the commencement of provisional application.  CETA is a progressive and comprehensive agreement which will remove over 99% of tariffs and create sizeable new market access opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p> <p> We also discussed climate change and reaffirmed our commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  The Canadian Government continues its efforts to work with the US on climate change matters given that US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement cannot proceed until 2020.</p> <p> The Prime Minister and I reaffirmed our commitment to working together across a range of common interests and I look forward to working to strengthen further the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada in the time ahead.  For the sake of completeness, let me add that North Korea did not feature in our discussions.</p> <p> I later hosted a dinner at Dublin Castle in Prime Minister Trudeau's honour.  This event was attended by distinguished guests representing various aspects of Ireland-Canada relations, including politics, tourism, business, culture and sport.</p> <p> Prime Minister Trudeau's visit to Ireland, coming so soon after the visit of my predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, to Canada in May, represents a new era in Irish-Canadian relations.  There are enormous opportunities for our two countries to work much more closely together, including on economic issues and trade, and I look forward to this relationship blossoming in the coming months and years.</p></reply>

Never more did we see this on show than during the visit of Prime Minister Trudeau, when the focus of much of the commentary was about socks, image and jogging through the park.  There was no serious debate about the substantial issues for which the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Trudeau affirmed their support, which are the actual reasons the political establishment is in trouble, namely, the consequence of 25 years of corporate-led globalisation, of which CETA is the latest version.  I say seriously to the Taoiseach that he should recognise, even for his own narrow political concerns or, for that matter, those of Deputy Martin, that the reason the establishment is in trouble is the consequence of corporate-led globalisation on ordinary working people and their incomes, public services, infrastructure and the growing inequality in the distribution of wealth, which CETA will further exacerbate.  The Taoiseach keeps saying he favours trade.  So do I.  I favour trade in a way that will benefit the majority of people.  All the lauding of CETA, which the Taoiseach has reaffirmed, fails to acknowledge, first, that he plans to apply it without any democratic mandate in this country, as in many other places, which infuriates people, and, second, that he fails to acknowledge the damage it will do to workers' rights, environmental standards, the distribution of wealth, health and safety standards or, according to a recent academic study, the estimated 300,000 jobs that will be lost in Europe as a result of the agreement.  None of these things is mentioned.</p></speech>

To take a specific example, the concern is that it does not protect the environmental standards we need desperately to enforce.  One can say one thing but do another.  The Taoiseach said that many of his discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau concerned the issue of climate change.  Whatever the spin may be, I am afraid my understanding is that the Canadian Prime Minister spoke at a recent oil conference in Canada and said no one would find 173 billion barrels of oil and not use it, and this is what the Canadian Government is doing in one of the greatest acts of environmental destruction happening on our planet.  The use of that oil would account for approximately 30% of the total global carbon budget that we can afford to release into the atmosphere.  Prime Minister Trudeau's Government's co-operation with the US Government in building and reopening the Keystone pipeline and other pipelines calls into question their role in the climate issue.  I am interested to know what the discussion about climate change between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Trudeau was about.  What did the Taoiseach propose as our special initiative or special actions in this area?  Did he ask the Canadian Prime Minister to explain how he can talk up climate and yet plan to burn 173 billion barrels of shale oil, the dirtiest form of fuel available to us?  What leg does Prime Minister Trudeau have to stand on in respect of the climate issue when he is planning to do this and ship the oil across the Keystone pipeline and other pipelines to the rest of the world?</p></speech>

Supporting international trade means we have not only a right, but also a responsibility to drill into the individual component parts of each trade agreement.  The concerns expressed about the investor court system in particular are a matter I raised last week.  It would address a huge number of people's concerns here if decisions in respect of disputes in international trade were fully determined by our domestic courts and would not be subject to any external overview beyond that.  I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's view on this matter.  It was because of this and issues related to the environment, for example, as raised by Deputy Ryan, that Seanad &Eacute;ireann voted against CETA.  I would be interested to hear the Government's response to a vote of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this regard.  Relatedly, when will the D&aacute;il get a chance to debate fully a motion that the Government ratify the agreement?</p>  <p>  I was intrigued by the answer the Taoiseach gave regarding Prime Minister Trudeau's offer of assistance from Canada in the next phase of the peace process.  What was the Taoiseach's response to that offer?  Does he envisage or see the kind of supportive role that was played in the past by the United States being supplemented by Canada, and how would this manifest itself?</p></speech>

There has been no proper debate here in the D&aacute;il, and the Government has chosen to ignore all this and has signed off on the provisional application of the deal at EU level.  It has ignored that such a treaty must be agreed by all state parliaments, including the D&aacute;il, and we have yet to vote on this.  The only vote in the Oireachtas, as an Teachta Howlin acknowledged, was a Seanad resolution calling on the Government not to ratify the deal.  One of the issues at the core of the concerns is the inclusion of the investor court system, which would allow Canadian-based corporations the right to sue governments in the European Union for compensation for the loss of expected future profits in response to government actions that impact on the companies' activities.</p><p>We have received legal advice that the inclusion of this system is not compatible with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  There is a duty and a responsibility for the D&aacute;il to discuss these issues to ensure that citizens are fully informed of what is included in this trade agreement.  Will the Government agree to CETA being debated in the D&aacute;il?  When will we have the opportunity to vote on this controversial trade deal?  Has the Government sought a legal opinion on the need for a referendum to ratify CETA?</p></speech>

I remind Deputy Adams that we tabled a Private Member's motion here on CETA and enterprise, which was passed, and there was a debate about the issue in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago.  Perhaps he was not around or did not realise that this had happened.  We did it for a reason.  I attended a Dublin Castle event and met representatives of some companies.  Among them was a small company from Limerick which employs around 80 people.  I asked them if they realised that there was a chorus of negativity around CETA in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and they were taken aback.</p></speech>

These are two young men who set up a software company and they could not understand the disconnect between some politicians and the real world out there, where people want the Canadian trade deal in order that they can export their products.  To a certain extent, all of the noise made has been negative and anti-CETA, and there has been no corresponding balanced perspective in terms of the value and importance of trade and weighing up that balance in terms of a free trade agreement.</p>  <p>  Free trade agreements are notoriously slow to deliver.  They move at a snail's pace.  Multilateral trade agreements are extraordinarily difficult to get over the line.  When they do get over the line, we have a regular chorus of negativity and anti-trade sentiment.  People say that it is all wrong and that it is a terrible thing.  Exaggerated claims are made to the effect that it is a dastardly attempt to destroy the ordinary people.  Many ordinary people depend on jobs in companies that are growing and prospering because of free trade.  We have never had any realistic, logical alternative from the left, from People Before Profit or the Anti-Austerity Alliance.  We hear that those parties do believe in trade, but of a different kind, whatever that means.  We are a small island on the Atlantic.  We need an open economy.  We made the decision in the late 1950s and early 1960s to open up.  We cannot dictate to the entire world and we will not be in a position to dictate to the entire world.  Trade is the lifeblood for working people in this country and there must be a degree of honesty about this debate and face up to it.  Other parties might talk about establishment politics, whatever that means.  We are all elected here.  I do not label anybody in terms of establishment or anti-establishment.  That is the oldest trick in the political book in terms of rhetoric.  The reality is we represent ordinary working people who depend on a salary every week or month because they work in companies that have to sell goods and services, be they beef, milk, software or life sciences; companies that will not expand if they do not have access to new markets.  </p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach make any specific commitments about the ratification of CETA and when will this Parliament ratify CETA?  I agree with other Deputies on that matter.  I have been calling for this for 12 months.  Let us have a debate and a ratification process here.  </p></speech>

We saw soft focus pictures of the Taoiseach jogging in the Phoenix Park, which the media, compliant as they are, chose to focus on.  CETA is a very serious issue and as other people, including Members of the Seanad, have said, there is a conflict between CETA and our Constitution.  The key issue is the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, now known as the investor court mechanism, which allows companies to sue states for a loss of profits or interfering with their right to make profits.  For example, should the State implement regulations around environmental standards, working standards or other regulations?  Yesterday a Bill on waste reduction was progressed in the D&aacute;il.  Is that something that could hit companies?  </p>  <p>  I do not know which circles Deputy Martin moves in but there is huge international opposition to this, including from trade unions, so I am surprised that his friends were not aware of that.  </p></speech>

Some international trade must be challenged.  Some trade is absolutely ludicrous, such as bottles of water passing each other on aeroplanes.  We want to protect the environment.</p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach going to allow a debate in the D&aacute;il?  A Private Member's Bill does not cut it, nor does a motion.  Will there be a proper debate in the D&aacute;il in the autumn, and will the Taoiseach allow this to go to a referendum if he does propose that it should be passed?  </p></speech>

Perhaps in his view going from an 80% share of the vote to 60% means one is in trouble but going from 2% to 2.5% is a great victory.  Everyone has a different perspective on these things but I consider the fact that his party has so few votes and so little representation in democratic assemblies to be more of a reflection of his politics being discredited and in trouble than that of the major parties in this House.</p>  <p>  Provisional application for CETA was ratified by the European Parliament on 15 December.  Trade is principally an EU competence and the European Parliament, which is elected by the people of Europe, ratified democratically the provisional application of the agreement by Europe.  We expect the provisional application to take place this year.  The real benefits derive from provisional application because that allows us to remove tariffs on the vast majority of goods that are traded between Canada and the European Union.  We expect that application to happen this year and we will see the benefits flow from that in the years ahead with more trade between Europe and Canada, consumers getting better prices and successful companies getting more business and therefore being able to create more jobs-----</p></speech>

However, no date is set for that as yet.  Thus far only two members states, Latvia and Denmark, have ratified the agreement in full.  We do not have any date for that at present.  The real benefits in terms of trade, business, jobs and revenue come from provisional application, which will happen this year and was approved democratically by the European Parliament on 15 February.</p>  <p>  There was some anti-free trade rhetoric in the House during the questions.  We have heard this anti-free trade rhetoric before.  We heard it when people opposed joining the European Economic Community back in the 1970s.  We heard it when people opposed the Single European Act in 1986.  We heard it when people opposed joining the World Trade Organization.  Very few people in Ireland seriously wish to reverse any of those free trade agreements or pacts we have entered into because people recognise those agreements are part of the reason we have 2 million people working in Ireland, rather than only 1 million, as was the case not long ago.   </p><p>It is part of the reason for the improvement in living standards and prosperity in recent decades because we are a trading country and an open economy, and on balance we benefit from free trade agreements.  There are pluses and minuses in any treaty or agreement but we certainly have more upside than downside.  That is why people, including small and big farmers and businesses, are now fighting so hard throughout the country to retain free trade with Britain.  They understand instinctively that their farms, property, businesses and jobs benefit from free trade.  That is why we are trying to defend free trade with the United Kingdom which in some ways appears now to be turning inwards.  That is why we are so committed to retaining free trade with the rest of the European Union and expanding our trade agreements with Canada, Japan and any other place within reason that is willing to negotiate agreements with us.</p> <p> On climate action, the Canadian and Irish Governments recommitted themselves to the implementation of the Paris Accord.  We had some discussion about the United States and the fact that even though it has issued its intention to withdraw from the Paris Accord, that cannot happen in effect until 2020 which potentially will be after the next electoral cycle in the United States.  We expect it will meet its targets in the meantime.  We will struggle to meet ours but we do intend to do so and will publish the national mitigation plan next week.  We did not get into much detail on what Canada and Ireland are doing to implement the Paris Accord but we did commit the two countries to implementing it.</p></speech>

There was no specific offer as to how it can help.  I did recall the important role General John de Chastelain, a Canadian, played in monitoring decommissioning and the putting of arms beyond use.  I inquired as to how he was doing and he is still alive and well.  We did not get into any particular detail on what additional assistance the Canadian authorities could offer in the peace process.  We have got to the point now where the amount of external assistance we need from other countries is less than it might have been in the past.  Most of the issues that need to be resolved need to be resolved by people in Northern Ireland and in Ireland and Britain without external help.  That is not to say, however, that we do not reserve the right to request it from time to time.</p></speech>

One of those, which we have talked about incessantly, and at the time of the previous budget, People Before Profit was the only group of people to include it in their budget submission, is the need to increase the arts budget significantly and to recognise the enormous, cultural, economic and social potential of the arts.</p></speech>

In reality, however, the arts budget for 2017 was reduced by 16% on what it was in 2016 and we are at the bottom of the league table when it comes to expenditure on arts as a proportion of gross domestic product, GDP.  We do not recognise the value, potential, work or contribution of artists.  There is probably nothing that has enhanced Ireland's reputation at every level on the international stage more than arts, poetry and music, yet the level of interest of the political establishment beyond rhetoric is pathetic.  That is borne out by the pitifully low level of investment in the arts.  Is the Taoiseach's new regime going to recognise this huge gap, begin to back the arts and artists and invest in our cultural talent?</p></speech>

The idea that the old committees had to be abolished because too many were attending &ndash; I think the Taoiseach said there were up to 30 or 40 &ndash; is ridiculous because the Taoiseach has it in his power to say only so many should attend and keep it streamlined, as was once the case.  There is a serious concern that this new setup will reduce transparency and co-ordination by rolling a wide range of issues into the one committee.  Up to the present we could at least judge the level of activity on health and judicial reform and other areas by seeing the number of meetings which these committees held.  Under the new arrangements, even this small amount of information will not be available.  The number of my questions that have been transferred by the Taoiseach's office or submitted for disqualification has expanded fairly dramatically in the past three weeks.  Once these committees are in operation, what level of detail will the Taoiseach be willing to provide to the House on their agendas, activity and the substance of their discussions?</p>  <p>  It is important that a Cabinet committee on the arts be established.  I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Boyd Barrett on his criticisms of previous Governments.  They did not dominate.  They were elected in a parliamentary democracy.  One of our enduring legacies to the nation was that during the rise of fascism, we managed to produce a republican constitution in 1937 when the rest of Europe was going fascist.  The Deputy should never forget that.</p></speech>

While arguably the lack of support for the Irish language and the lack of adequate funding for, or recognition of, the arts are evidence that some committees have not made a huge difference in respect of Government policy, nonetheless the scrapping of half these committees means that these important matters will get even less attention and be given even less priority.  That is a matter of deep concern.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McHugh, said that one of the new committees on social policy and the committee on the economy will have direct responsibility for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  He says this will provide a greater focus.  How does the Taoiseach expect this to happen?</p>  <p>  The arts are the essence of what we are.  They are bread and roses.  In their widest form, particularly in working class communities, the arts can be uplifting.  They can also be an economic driver.  The Government's approach to the arts has been pitiable despite the fact the arts are most of what Ireland is best appreciated for in the wider world.  An example of Fine Gael's approach to this was the appointment of John McNulty of that party to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, by a previous Taoiseach merely to facilitate a nomination for a Seanad election.  We need to stop messing about with these essential issues.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider creating a dedicated arts and heritage Cabinet committee to drive that work forward?</p></speech>

A number of things are important and I ask the Taoiseach and the relevant Minister, who is sitting beside him, to consider a number of things.  First is the multi-annual funding of the arts, which we provide for some of the major art organisations like the Gate or the Abbey.  It is impossible for significant organisations to plan without a commitment to a three-year horizon at least.  Multi-annual budgeting is something I tried to introduce myself across Departments.  For arts bodies to plan or hire artists, it is necessary to think about a timeframe well beyond 12 months.  It is something we might do.  One of the things we sought to do in this year's budget was to ensure that the significant boost in the capital spend for the 1916 centenary commemorations would be embedded as a capital spend in the arts.  Unfortunately, it was not done.  While some residual funding was embedded, not all was provided.  These are a few of the issues a Cabinet sub-committee, which I hope will find time to debate the arts, should address.</p></speech>

The budget increase for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for last year was between &euro;18 million and &euro;20 million.  This included a &euro;5 million, or 8%, increase in the annual budget of the Arts Council, an increase in the budgets of all of the national cultural institutions, &euro;2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored historic wings at the National Gallery of Ireland, which are now open, the opening of Killarney House, which took place the other day, an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, an increase of &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland and funding of &euro;5 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme for 2017 to 2022.  While it was the case that there were budget reductions during the downturn when budgets were being decreased in all areas, people can see from the actions of the new Government that when there is a little bit more space and more resources, the arts are getting their fair share in the increases I have just outlined.  Other measures are in place.  Creative Ireland is very exciting and I am very much behind it.  It is now under way.  We had Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca over Easter and there are local government plans in place.  There is &euro;5 million for that this year.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I worked together to change the social welfare code to exempt self-employed artists from normal activation measures.  They can now concentrate on their art for a time without having to go through the normal activation procedures provided they are recognised by a recognised arts body.</p>  <p>  I engage with people in the arts sector a great deal.  It is an area I have been interested in myself.  I will be at the Galway Film Fleadh on Thursday where one of my friends is premiering "Pilgrimage".  I recommend people go and see it if they get a chance.  When I meet people who are interested in or involved in the arts, they tend to ask me about funding.  Sometimes, they ask me about multi-annual funding.  I agree with Deputy Howlin's comments in that regard.  It would be much better if we could have multi-annual funding horizons in place for the national cultural institutions and the Arts Council.  It is not something I can guarantee will be in the next budget but it is something I would like to see there.  I have never had a single person involved in the arts or culture ask me how many times a sub-committee met.  It is really not top of the list of concerns of those involved in the arts and culture whether we have a sub-committee and how often it meets.  What they are interested in is funding generally and funding on a multi-annual basis.  Funding will increase next year.</p></speech>

There are vacancies for an assistant Government press secretary, two of four press officer positions and three executive officer equivalents in the communications and media assistant area.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to fill all of these, will that be done in the normal way through the Civil Service recruitment process or will specialists be brought in?  The Taoiseach said he wanted to restructure the Government Information Service.  What does he have in mind in particular?  Will the new unit with responsibility for strategic communications across Government be housed within the Government Information Service and serve under the head of that service?  Is that how it is to work?  Is it a link between press officers in Departments to provide better information?  How is it to work?</p></speech>

I imagine some are Civil Service vacancies, which will be filled in the normal way should the Secretary General determine they remain necessary.  Political appointments such as that of the assistant Government press secretary simply have not been made yet and probably will not be until the autumn given that we are entering a relatively quiet period in terms of media.</p>  <p>  The strategic communications unit will be separate.  It will be a unit of the Department and not under the auspices of the Government Information Service.  The Government Information Service will do what it does currently, namely, deal with the press on a regular basis, deal with protocol and deal with national commemorations.  The strategic communications unit will be something new.  It will try to pull together all of the communications that occur across Government.  We have a lot of Departments and agencies and they are spending a great deal of taxpayers' money.  They have an awful lot of staff.  I do not believe an adequately coherent message is coming from Government.  There is an opportunity to make savings in the total amount spent by Departments and agencies on communications and public relations and there is also an opportunity to present a much more coherent message to the public as to what the Government and its agencies are doing and what the public service is providing people with.</p></speech>

Given the emphasis the Taoiseach and his advisers place on photo opportunities and media management, their jobs will be quite difficult.  The Taoiseach might explain why the summer economic statement is being delivered at a press conference instead of in the House.  It is in order to deliver it in the House.</p><p> The Taoiseach needs to explain this strategic communications unit.  I know he has covered it up by saying it will save money but it sounds very much to me like this is a political machine that is being put in at the heart of the Taoiseach's office to deliver a coherent political message on behalf of the Government.

I would imagine that this could be a Tony Blair type machine, but it could equally be something that looks at the main strategic objectives of a Government.  One would argue that, at this time, they have to include the delivery of the Good Friday Agreement, Brexit, a united Ireland and how one would get and win a referendum on unity.</p>  <p>  That brings us to who it is we need to engage with.  The Government needs to engage with people in the North.  It is very important that there would be an ongoing engagement.  Some parts of the North cannot even get RTE.  The images coming out of the North during this 12 July period are very upsetting and offensive.  I think they would be considered hate crimes in anyone's book.  They are the work of a very small minority, however.  The vast majority of the Orange celebrations will go on without any great disruption to people's lives.  However, one asks if the Taoiseach has thought about engaging with people in the North through the media about Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government's position is wrong on Brexit.  It wants a designated status for the North outside of the European Union when the only sensible position is to have a designated status for the North inside it.  Would this strategic communications unit deal with that issue in the North and our friends in Britain and, of course, the big issue of a united Ireland?  If the Taoiseach is serious about it, surely the strategic communications unit should be tasked with communicating the Government's position on that important issue.</p></speech>

It probably will not be established until September but I am happy to give the House notice of it and any information I have on it now.  It will be supplementary to and separate from the GIS because its role will be different and complementary.  It will not be political.  It will not be staffed by political appointees.  People will be seconded from other parts of the Civil Service and public service.  Its role principally will be to inform the public about what the Government is doing and explaining to the public, and more broadly, the actions of Government.  For example, it will explain the budget.  There will be a &euro;58 billion spending package announced on budget day, but people have very little knowledge about and understanding of it.  There is an opportunity to explain it a bit better.  The unit will explain the capital plan when it is published and how that will impact on and benefit every community throughout the country.  As another example, in a few weeks' time the new universal child care subsidy kicks in.  This subsidy will be worth approximately &euro;1,000 a year, or &euro;20 a week, to families with children in child care.  Every child between the age of six months and three years will benefit from this subsidy, but how many people know that this is going to happen in less than six weeks?  We need to invest a lot more effort in explaining to the public some of these new initiatives that are being led and implemented by Government and how Government is working for them to make their lives better.</p></speech>

They fit a sadly familiar pattern of terrorism that has blighted many countries around the world.</p>  <p>  The expert threat assessment is that while an attack here is possible, it is unlikely, and there is no specific information relating to any threat to Ireland from international terrorism.  That said, there is no complacency in this regard and the level of threat from this source is kept under constant and active review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to go into the detail of the security measures in place without handing an advantage to anyone who might wish to do harm.  While we must not underestimate the challenges posed by brutal incidents of the type we have seen, I can assure the Deputy that the authorities here are taking and will continue to take all necessary and appropriate measures to counteract the threat.  Indeed, only this morning I was briefed again in some detail on these matters by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The Garda has in place appropriate operational measures to prevent and to respond to terrorist incidents in terms of intelligence, a well-trained and equipped special intervention capability and other national support resources, including armed support.  The considerable operational skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available where needed.  Additional resources were provided in the Garda Vote last year that included a dedicated allocation of funding for combating the threat from international terrorism.  This is being used in respect of certain additional training, operational equipment and personnel requirements.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the armed response unit for the Dublin region is a key investment in enhancing the armed response capacity for critical incidents and in freeing up and supporting the specialist capacity of the emergency response unit, ERU.  The resources requirements and allocations in this regard are being kept under active review.</p></speech>

There is a concern as to whether we are sufficiently prepared to meet the challenge of modern terrorism.  That concern was added to because one of the individuals involved in the killings in London had lived in Ireland for a while.  On a positive note, we have members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with considerable experience in dealing with terrorism on this island.  More recently, they have also combated serious gangland violence.  However, there are a number of negative aspects that the Government needs to address.  After the terror attacks in London and Manchester, senior members in the Garda representative organisations said they did not believe that ordinary rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were prepared for such terrorist attacks.  We need to ensure they are adequately prepared.  We need to liaise with the Commissioner to ensure sufficient measures are in place in order that if there is a terrorist attack in this country, in an urban or rural area, there can be an immediate response.  That issue needs to be addressed imminently.</p></speech>

The Garda authorities have been implementing all necessary security measures proportionate to the threat, and all relevant agencies co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to take all possible steps to deal with any threat to this country, combining its strong intelligence base with a well trained, armed, special intervention capacity and a range of other national policing resources.  In respect of the resources available and having regard to the fact that the threat from international terrorism is an evolving one, the Garda Commissioner reviewed Garda capabilities and the Government provided additional dedicated funding for personnel, equipment and training requirements that have been identified in this area.  In seeking to adapt to these changing circumstances, we must constantly review the resource requirements that may arise for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is precisely what is happening.  I keep matters under constant review from a departmental perspective.  This morning, I had another opportunity to receive a detailed briefing from the Garda authorities.  They have made it clear that ongoing priority is being given to ensuring that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who will be in the front line when dealing with this type of attack, are given appropriate training.</p></speech>

Of course, terrorism cannot be responded to just through policing.  The State must also have adequate intelligence services in place.  It is probably time for us to consider whether the intelligence services we have need to be updated, reviewed or improved.  In the context of the appalling terrorist attacks in Britain, we must examine the structures we have in place for gaining intelligence.  It appears that Ireland is the only EU country that does not have a national security and intelligence agency.  I am not saying we should have a knee-jerk reaction by establishing a separate body and taking those responsibilities from the Garda and the Army, which have fulfilled them very well over the years.  However, we must consider what role we, as legislators, can play in terms of assessing and questioning the intelligence community.  Nobody is suggesting that confidential information should be handed out or opened and disclosed in a non-confidential way but in other countries such as Britain, for example, there is a parliamentary committee that deals with intelligence issues.  That is something we should consider for this country in order that public representatives can ask questions on important issues relating to the safety of people on the island.</p></speech>

However, the arrangements that are currently in place have served the State very well in countering threats to the security of the State over the years, particularly from terrorism and terrorist acts in the course of the Troubles during our lifetime.  While public discourse and debate on terrorism, its impact on communities and threats to safety are welcome and valued, recent commentary citing either inadequacy or unprofessionalism on the part of the Garda or the Defence Forces authorities in dealing with these matters is both unfortunate and ill-founded.  They have a proud record in protecting and defending the State from a sustained terrorist threat over many years, particularly from paramilitary groups.  However, given the dynamic nature of security threats, especially from international terrorism, arrangements are kept under constant review, including the decision making arrangements across the common areas of the State's security.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the final terms of reference for the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland were recently announced.  That commission will inquire into policing in Ireland.  It will also consider, among other things, all the functions carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the provision of security services to the State.</p></speech>

Following a Garda investigation and consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, the matter in question was brought to trial and a duly constituted jury of the accused's peers gave its verdict.  It appears that this is absolutely in keeping with our system of justice and the separation of powers, which is designed to ensure fairness and equality before the law. </p>  <p>  I am, of course, aware of various concerns and criticisms that have been made in some quarters about these matters.  It is clearly inappropriate for this House to engage in a critique of the decisions or conduct of independent bodies such as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or, indeed, the courts.</p>  <p>  Regarding concerns that have been voiced about the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this case, I note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting an internal review of the policing response and subsequent investigation into this matter.  Notwithstanding this review, Deputies will be aware that there are well established and independent structures for bringing complaints about the conduct of garda&iacute; through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.</p>  <p>  It is my view that this matter has been fully aired and brought to a conclusion before the courts, which are the ultimate arbiters of justice in this State.  I therefore see no reason to establish any other form of inquiry into the matter.</p></reply>

In fact, during an RTE "Prime Time" interview the Taoiseach said it was a problem that Garda evidence conflicted with video footage.  He said, "We need to be able to trust that when the garda&iacute; stand up in court and they say something happened that it did happen and it shouldn't conflict with video evidence and if it does then that is a problem."  We have a problem even by the Taoiseach's analysis.  Nobody is arguing about the outcome of the trial, but it is important to examine the circumstances under which so many sworn witness statements contradicted video evidence.  That is important not just for confidence in the Judiciary but also confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I am aware of those comments.  However, the key issue remains that this case was fully considered before the court and a verdict was returned after due and careful consideration over a lengthy period.  This point was made by the Taoiseach at the outset.  Regarding concerns that have been voiced about the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this case, a point raised by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, these are operational issues and it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and her management team to address these in the first instance.  As I mentioned, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting an internal review of the policing response to, and subsequent investigation of, this matter.  That review should be allowed to take its course before jumping to conclusions, as Deputies have done and as we heard earlier in the House.  In the circumstances it is most unhelpful to the rule of law and the administration of justice.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, if an individual wishes to complain about the conduct of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na there are mechanisms for doing so.  I refer particularly to the role and function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p></speech>

We are trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  An internal review is being conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Will the findings of that review be made public?  Is the internal review also examining how so many Garda statements could contradict video evidence?  That is important.  Finally, I do not agree that the DPP is above critique.  There have been a number of instances, particularly with regard to the death of Garda Tony Golden and the death of Shane O'Farrell, where serious questions must be answered by the DPP.  I do not agree with the Minister's analysis that the office is above critique.  It might be independent of the House but it certainly is not above critique.</p></speech>

This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million for overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with more than 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015, and a provision of &euro;46 million has been made for new Garda vehicles under the capital plan 2016-2021.</p><p>The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  Under Operation Thor, there have been more than 74,000 targeted checkpoints and 52,400 crime prevention patrols across the State.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation, the Central Statistics Office burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The<b></b>30% decrease in burglary for the 12 months of 2016 when compared with 2015 parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.</p><p>The Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the recent enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars with previous convictions who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>The programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  A range of partnership initiatives have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and other rural community groups.  These include the well-established community alert programme, the work of the metal theft forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the theft of livestock, the Theftstop initiative relating to farm equipment and the highly successful Garda text alert scheme.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government is pursuing its plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits, up to 500 civilians and approximately 300 members of the Garda Reserve.  These appointments will support the wide-ranging reform plan is in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and benefit policing services for all communities, whether in rural or urban areas.</p></speech>

Deputy Cahill recently brought a delegation from County Tipperary to discuss with me ongoing crime issues in the county.  This issue is not confined to Tipperary but affects all areas, especially in the countryside.</p>  <p>  A recent survey carried out by one of the farming organisations showed that ongoing agricultural crime was creating significant costs to individual farmers who had been victims of these crimes.  The statistics indicate that rural crime is costing &euro;2.4 million per annum, with an average cost of &euro;4,300 for each farming victim.  Large numbers of farmers have had equipment stolen.  They know that individuals come in to the community, case the area, spot where equipment is being kept and take it and other items required to run a farm, including diesel. </p>  <p>  I note the Minister's comments on Operation Thor.  While the operation has undoubtedly been a success, the problem has not been solved.  The Minister refers to statistics showing a decline in the number of burglaries but if the figures are broken down, I do not believe they will show a decline in the number of burglaries in rural communities.  This problem is faced by all members of the farming community and it is becoming more significant.  New measures are needed to deal with it.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the report to which the Deputy refers, which was compiled by the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.  I welcome the report and similar reports and look forward to giving all of them due consideration when they have been published or dispatched to me.  The report to which the Deputy referred covers a period of 24 months beginning at the start of May 2014 and concluding at the end of May 2016, which includes a period of 17 months that predated the launch  - in November 2015 - of the sustained drive against burglary and property crime being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor .</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to make available to the Garda an appropriate level of resources to ensure that we continue to operate against a proliferation of rural crime and that the burglary figures continue to decline.</p></speech>

It suggests that a significant problem remains and that the decline in crime, as indicated by the Minister, has not occurred.  The Minister also indicated that he wishes to support community-based support groups.  This support is important.  The Minister will have received an email from the secretary of the Lisdoonvarna, Doolin and Kilshanny community text alert group, which has 223 paid up members.  The email brought to my attention and that of other Deputies the fact that VAT is charged on texts being sent by a community group.  We need to take innovative measures to ensure individuals who are offering community based solutions to the problem of rural crime receive State support.  It is not good enough to indicate that the Government will provide garda&iacute; who will support people in rural areas.  We must support individuals who are doing their best to pursue a community-based approach to protecting agricultural products.  This could involve reducing or abolishing VAT on text schemes.</p></speech>

We are considering new initiatives that could allow text messaging to be carried out in a way that is not unduly burdensome on communities.</p>  <p>  I have made clear to the Garda Commissioner and in public that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to have all necessary resources to provide high visibility policing and tackle serious criminality in rural areas.  An additional &euro;88.5 million in overtime is to be provided this year to maintain an adequate policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis in respect of concentrated policing targeting gang-related crime, continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor and continued support for measures against terrorism.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, his colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, proposed a Private Members' Bill, entitled the Coroners Bill 2015, to address issues with regard to the investigation into maternal deaths.  That Bill proposed to introduce mandatory reporting, post-mortem examinations and inquests into any maternal death.  It also proposed the extension of the current scheme of legal aid to next of kin in respect of maternal death inquests.</p><p>The Government decided not to oppose that Bill on Second Stage.  My predecessor subsequently met Deputy Clare Daly to discuss her concerns regarding the issue further.</p> <p> Following that meeting, the Government approved the urgent drafting and publication of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2017 to ensure that, as Deputy Harty stated, all relevant maternal deaths would be fully reported to and investigated by the coroner.  The Bill will be based on the relevant sections of the Coroners Bill 2007, which completed Second Stage in the Seanad on 4 October 2007.  The mandatory reporting, post mortem and inquest provisions of that Bill will be updated beyond maternal deaths to a wider listing of deaths to be reportable to a coroner.  The 2017 Bill will also provide for legal aid for a family member at any inquest into a maternal death.</p> <p> In order to address concerns previously raised by the Attorney General and others concerning the need to improve compliance with European Convention on Human Rights obligations in this area, I propose to address a limited number of other issues in the Bill so as to ensure that the coroner has sufficient and effective power to obtain relevant information in regard to maternal and other deaths.  These powers were already included in the 2007 Bill.</p> <p> Subject to the final advices of the Attorney General, I hope to be in a position to publish the new Bill early in the next session.</p></speech>

It was also raised in the D&aacute;il this morning by Deputy Howlin.  This is a question of openness and accountability.  It is not about apportioning blame for maternal deaths.  Rather, it is about acknowledging what happened when there is a maternity-related death and to learn the lessons from that incident.</p>  <p>  It is obviously a distressing and calamitous event for people when a mother or partner is lost.  The failure to have maternity inquests is a glaring gap in our health and legal systems.  We must have impartial investigations into all deaths.  Families have to fight hard to have inquests held.  There has been a limited number of inquests to date, with the verdict of medical misadventure applied to all of the deaths in question.  As such, it is important that we put this on a statutory footing.</p></speech>

I have had a number of meetings, one of which was with the Attorney General, in order to ensure that there would be no undue delay in having this Bill, which enjoys the support of the House along party lines and among Independents such as Deputy Harty.  I regret that we will not be in a position to have the Bill debated in the House prior to the end of this session, which will be this week, but I have made every effort to ensure that it will be worked on and drafted, sent to the Cabinet and signed off on at the earliest opportunity.  With the agreement of the Business Committee, I hope that the House will be in a position early in the next session to enact it.</p>  <p>  Further issues with the 2007 Bill need to be addressed in order to strengthen the effectiveness of coroner inquests and improve compliance with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  These issues include the strengthening of the powers of the coroner to summon witnesses to an inquest and direct a witness to produce documents and evidence and answer questions, and the introduction of penalties in respect of non-co-operation.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Harty for raising this matter.  It is my intention that it will be progressed with all due haste.</p></speech>

He and many other Deputies are committed to the issue, as are the many city and county councils around the country that have debated it and endorsed the sentiment of having a mandatory and automatic inquest.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm that all maternity units are identifying all of their maternity deaths in their annual reports?  Are national statistics being compiled on maternity deaths?  A maternity death in a hospital is taken seriously by clinicians.  They see it as a fundamental disaster and hospitals run internal investigations when there are maternity deaths, but we need openness, transparency and accountability when a maternity death occurs.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give a date for the legislation's publication and commit to introducing it in the D&aacute;il at the earliest opportunity in the autumn?</p></speech>

My understanding is that there is all-party support and support from the Independent benches.  With that in mind, I hope that matters can be progressed at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's comment on maternal deaths and the compilation of figures, such deaths are thankfully rare events in this country, as Deputy Harty will know from his medical experience.  Due to their seriousness, however, it is vital that they be carefully monitored, reported and investigated.  In this regard, I will advert to the second report on Ireland of the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths, which was published in Cork in February 2015.  It identified a total of 31 maternal deaths in Ireland over the 2009-2012 period.  My information is that practically all of those deaths were reported to a coroner, but I take Deputy Harty's point.  It is important that each and every such death is carefully examined and dealt with.  I hope to have the legislation enacted prior to the end of the year.</p></speech>

It poses a major danger to the riders themselves as well as to the public generally and renders many housing estates unusable for other purposes because of road safety reasons.  A concerted Government response to the problem is now required.</p></reply>

It is a serious issue.  The Deputy will be aware that the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, MPVs, including quad bikes and scramblers, in a public place is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that these vehicles, when used in public places, must comply with the Road Traffic Acts, including in terms of motor tax, insurance and possession of a valid driver licence or learner permit.  Under the Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is allowed to stop an MPV in a public place and demand production of a driver licence.  In addition, garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, in a careless manner or dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under the road traffic code.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by local authorities under the 2011 parks and open spaces by-laws.</p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective.  Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers and so on owing to the inherent safety risk in pursuing these vehicles.  If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of their ending in collisions at speed, resulting in serious injury or death.  As a result, bringing these vehicles to a stop is challenging.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities further advise that the issue is one that is best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  In that regard, garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering ones.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to Deputy Shortall on this issue.  I understand its importance, particularly in urban areas, including this city.</p></speech>

The problem is that it is exactly the same response we have been hearing for the past number of years.  I and many other Members have raised this issue.  We know it is against the law.  Those vehicles are covered by road traffic legislation.  I do not think it is widely known among parents who frequently buy these vehicles for their children as birthday or Christmas presents.  There is obviously a need for an information and awareness programme to be run on it.  There is a need for that kind of campaign to make parents aware they are breaking the law in buying these vehicles for their children.</p>  <p>  There are two issues here.  One is the use of the vehicles on public roads.  As the Minister says, garda&iacute; have been instructed not to pursue people driving these vehicles.  That is absolutely understandable.  It means the issue is not being policed at all.  The second issue relates to public parks.  There is no policing of it there because road traffic legislation does not apply there.  We need a new response.</p></speech>

In the first instance she asks about raising awareness.  I assure her the Road Safety Authority has again been asked to raise awareness of these issues in the context of the current summer climate which obviously gives rise to a greater use - or, indeed, greater misuse or abuse - of these vehicles in urban areas.  In response to Deputy Shortall's assertion that she has heard this all before and that the answer to the question is the same, I say that in order to better facilitate a multi-agency approach, I have written in very recent days to the relevant parties, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Garda Commissioner and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  I have done so in order to ascertain whether there are additional measures by way of legislation or regulation at local authority level with a view to finding solutions that can assist us in dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive manner than has been the case to date.</p></speech>

We need to do something more substantive than that.  I welcome the announcement the Minister has made today because it has to be a cross-agency approach and it has to happen at national level.  There have been minor attempts to do it locally in local communities.  Many of us experienced that in our own constituencies.  There is a need for change in the law, particularly on awareness.  There is a strong case for introducing legislation to prohibit the sale of these vehicles unless there is evidence provided of insurance, tax and driving licences.  We need a concerted and co-ordinated approach because too many lives are being put at risk.  There have already been some deaths.  There have been several serious injuries.  It also contributes hugely to the level of anti-social activity in many of our housing estates.  I hope the Minister will move ahead with that kind of cross-agency approach.  There is a need for a task force.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to setting up such a task force.</p></speech>

It is important we examine every opportunity across a range of agencies and Government Departments to see how best we can work out a solution to what is a real and serious problem particularly in urban areas in Dublin.

I recognise the very significant part Forensic Science Ireland plays within the criminal justice system, including its vital role in providing evidence to the courts.  There is no doubt this work has been invaluable to the successful detection and prosecution of many serious offences over recent decades and will continue to be so.</p>  <p>  While the establishment of the DNA database has impacted on the work of the Forensic Science Ireland, several steps have been taken to increase resources and improve processes to ensure that Forensic Science Ireland continues to deliver a high-quality service to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Forensic Science Ireland that the backlog of unanalysed drug cases with it currently stands at approximately 2,800.  I assure the Deputy there has not been any impact on the Garda's efforts to enforce the law and there have not been any prosecutions lost on foot of this backlog.  In the first six months of 2017, 4,099 drugs cases were submitted to Forensic Science Ireland for analysis.  A total of 4,444 drugs cases were analysed and reports generated by Forensic Science Ireland in that period.  Additional staff have been assigned to the drugs area in Forensic Science Ireland and it is planned to assign ten additional scientists to the area later in 2017 as they are recruited.  These measures are expected to lead to a progressive reduction in the backlog.</p>  <p>  In terms of processing cases, the Deputy may wish to note that Forensic Science Ireland prioritises drugs cases requested for court purposes by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Forensic Science Ireland is working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the DPP to improve the effectiveness of the presumptive drug testing scheme.  This scheme is available for personal possession cases under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  The testing is carried out by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been trained by Forensic Science Ireland using test kits validated by it.  The purpose of presumptive testing is to allow a large number of section 3 cases to be dealt with effectively and expeditiously at local level and to free up the resources in Forensic Science Ireland.</p></speech>

When garda&iacute; seize a substance they believe to be a drug, they have to send it for testing.  They send it to Forensic Science Ireland and it carries out the test to determine whether the  drug is illegal and what is its make-up.  I tabled this question because there were recent reports in a newspaper that indicated the establishment of the national DNA database has overwhelmed the State laboratory where Forensic Science Ireland works and that it has led to a large backlog of testing of illegal drugs seizures.  The Minister pointed out in his answer that the backlog is some 2,800 tests.  It is important, even though no cases have collapsed, that the Minister and Government ensure the backlog is cleared up rapidly.  There is no doubt the establishment of the national DNA database is an essential part of our criminal justice system.  It must proceed.  As a result of a lot of resources being devoted to that, the work being carried out by Forensic Science Ireland is being interfered with.  Does the Minister agree the situation is less than ideal and that it has to be addressed, otherwise we will have cases collapsing?</p></speech>

It delivers independent expert opinion, advice, training and research to support the Irish criminal justice system.  The highly trained and dedicated staff provide specific analysis and objective expert advice.  I acknowledge that there is a backlog.  I will assure the Deputy of two things in respect of that backlog.  First, we are working towards its elimination by the appointment of extra personnel.  I assure the Deputy there has been no impact on the efforts of the garda&iacute; to enforce the law.  There have not been any prosecutions lost or found deficient on foot of this backlog.  Forensic Science Ireland continues to work very closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure all cases of priority are dealt with in an effective, speedy and swift way.  Equally, any analysis and reporting conducted by Forensic Science Ireland is provided to an exceptionally high standard and that will continue to be the case.  I am happy to keep the Deputy informed of developments as we move towards reducing the backlog.</p></speech>

I welcome that there will be recruitment of extra personnel.</p><p>While it may not get much media coverage Forensic Science Ireland carries out a highly important role.</p> <p> The drugs section of the laboratory primarily deals with two types of cases: section 3 prosecutions, which are for simple possession of drugs and section 15 prosecutions, which are for possession with intent to supply.  As the Minister mentioned in his answer, sometimes the matter can be speeded up because in respect of section 3 offences, when a suspect has drugs for their personal use, garda&iacute; have the six months and sometimes an individual who has them can admit or accept they were in possession of illegal drugs.  However, where they do not, obviously the Garda is working under a very tight six-month time limit within which it must get the drugs tested and get the prosecution commenced.  If it does not do that, the matter cannot be tried summarily which is how most personal possession drug cases are dealt with.</p> <p> I welcome that extra personnel are being recruited, but the Government needs to recognise the crucial role of Forensic Science Ireland and it needs to be adequately resourced into the future.</p></speech>

For some time the need for a new forensic laboratory appropriate to the State's requirements has been regarded as one of the most critical capital projects in the justice sector.  In that regard the Government has allocated &euro;45 million for the construction of the laboratory with work due to commence at the earliest possible date.  Some &euro;6 million was provided in my Department's Vote to enable the commencement of building work this year.  This new facility at Backweston will allow for the merger of FSI with the Garda technical bureau which is part of the current reform programme in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This, of course, will provide for the consistent processing of crime samples by one body and ultimately lead to a more efficient and effective forensic science service.  FSI is highly regarded by the Government and its contribution towards the criminal justice system is immense.</p></speech>

Members of the units are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high-visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective regions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware an armed support unit has been established in the southern region, based in both Cork and Limerick, since 2008.  Therefore, non-lethal capability and capacity by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the southern region, and in Cork city, is provided for by the regional armed support unit.</p>  <p>  In the event of an armed incident or similar incident, armed detectives from local district and divisional units will respond, as will the armed support units, which are based in each Garda region, including Cork city.</p></speech>

As he knows, the regional armed support unit does not operate on a 24-7 basis in Cork city.  If an incident occurred, garda&iacute; and detectives might have to wait for members of the armed support unit to travel from Limerick, up to an hour and a half away.  If a guy is going crazy with a knife or a crowbar, that is not much good to the front-line garda&iacute; and detectives who are trying to deal with that situation.</p>  <p>  They are telling me that last year's tactical awareness training really brought home to detectives how exposed they are without non-lethal Tasers.  If they have to deal with an incident in the absence of the regional armed support unit, they will be forced to deploy their gun.  As the Minister knows, the guidelines are that if a gun is to be used, it is to be used in close proximity to the upper body which will generally result in death, which is not a position they want to be in.  They have strongly called on Garda management to provide non-lethal Tasers to assist them in their front-line work.</p></speech>

However, I have been informed that members of the ERU or the armed support units, which are organised on a regional basis, will not necessarily be available within Cork city if an incident were to occur.  The detectives who have undergone training feel very exposed and at risk.  They feel they are not being given the capacity to neutralise a threat that they may be the first people to have to confront.  That is the situation on the ground.</p>  <p>  There is a dispute between the GRA, representing the detectives and Garda management.  It needs to be resolved first and foremost to protect the welfare of the front-line garda&iacute; and detectives to ensure no unnecessary harm is caused to members of the public or indeed to the perpetrator, who certainly would not deserve a gun being deployed in an incident that could properly be dealt with through the use of a non-lethal Taser.

The programme for Government contains a number of commitments to improving the lives of persons with disabilities.  These commitments include supporting people with disabilities to maximise their potential, removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work or health care, and providing supports at key transition points in their lives.</p><p>The programme also recognises that persons with disabilities should have more control in accessing services and giving them greater independence and choice to better fit their needs.  That is the plan in the programme for Government.<br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to provide an update on every individual commitment in the programme for Government but I am prepared to answer any other individual questions.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the programme for Government is just one part of the wider Government policy in supporting persons with disabilities and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br/><br/>In addition to the commitments in the programme for Government, the Deputy will be aware of the forthcoming National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which will form a key part of driving Government policy in this area.  The aim of the strategy is to significantly improve the lives of people with disabilities in a practical sense and to create the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.  The strategy is an all-of-Government approach and is broadly based around eight key themes including ensuring equality and choice, the provision of services, accommodation, health, employment, transport and education.  As chair of the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, I have driven the preparation of the strategy, including an extensive consultation process, and its recent finalisation, and I am delighted to inform the Deputy that it will be launched this Friday, 14 July in Croke Park.  I am happy to provide additional information on people with disabilities.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>I can assure the Deputy that the Government's commitments to improving the lives of persons with disability will not end with the publication of the strategy, and I am committed to ensuring that the strategy results in real and concrete change for the better for children and adults with disabilities.  I am happy to provide additional information on individual commitments in the programme if the Deputy has specific issues in which he is interested.</p></speech>

I have probably asked him this question numerous times since I have been elected, namely, when will the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, take place?  Since the Government came into office more than a year ago it said the ratification of the convention would be advocated.  Fourteen months later the convention has still not been ratified.  I find that extraordinary.  This week we have a raft of Bills being pushed through the House.  We have a Bill about the Rugby World Cup, which is very important.  I am a big rugby fan myself.  That is one Bill that is being pushed through but 11 years after it was introduced, the UNCRPD has still not been ratified.  It is extraordinary that 156 countries have ratified the convention and Ireland is not one of them.</p></speech>

I meet officials from the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality every Monday to drive this agenda.  Up to now, nobody took an interest in this issue at all.  However, I do accept that the delays are frustrating.  The two delays relate to the deprivation of liberty and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Much work has been done and the Department of Health is due to publish revised heads in that regard towards the end of August.</p>  <p>  Amendments to disability legislation on the deprivation of liberty will be published after the summer break.  We are moving on this issue.  We have had interviews in recent weeks for a director and project manager for the decision support service, DSS, office which will help to drive the ratification of the UN convention.</p>  <p>  I reject the criticism made in terms of other countries ratifying the convention.  Many countries ratified the UNCRPD but some of them still chain disabled adults to heaters and bars in institutions.  We are doing the opposite.  We are trying to put the services in place.  This year we are investing &euro;1.69 billion in the services, an increase of &euro;96 million between residential services, day services, respite residential support, personal assistant service hours, home support services and moving people from institutions.  We have a good record and I want to ratify the UN convention and I intend to do so very quickly.</p></speech>

I asked the Minister of State about it three or four times since I was elected.  I understand the relevant Bill is on Committee Stage.  Waiting for the ratification of the UNCRPD is becoming a latter-day "Waiting for Godot".  If there is a will in this House, things get done but if there is not a will, things do not get done.  It is as simple as that.  I will probably ask the Minister of State the question again in September or even next year.  Hopefully, the convention will be ratified but one gets disillusioned very quickly in this place when one sees the things that happen.  I am sure the Minister of State wants to see the convention ratified as much as anybody else but people with disabilities are looking to Members to ratify it.  I do not think everything has to be in place.  Let us ratify the convention and give people with disabilities an equal footing with able-bodied people.</p></speech>

I am determined to ratify it and I have the strong support of the lead Minister in the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  Department of Justice and Equality officials have been fantastic, in particular in recent months, in driving this issue because, like me, they are determined to get this done.  I accept Deputy Gino Kenny's frustration but there are complex issues that have to be resolved regarding the deprivation of liberty, and they are being resolved as I speak.  However, it does take time.  It is not as simple as people think.  There is a side of me that strongly agrees with Deputy Gino Kenny and I am tempted to say let us do it and get on with it but, to be honest, I want to do it properly and we intend to do it in as short a timeframe as possible.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, since 2010 our division suffered one of the highest reductions in Garda force numbers.  In County Cavan the force has been reduced by almost 20% and there has been a 28% reduction in County Monaghan.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that in the allocation of new recruits, particular consideration is given to the requests from the Cavan-Monaghan division for additional personnel.</p></reply>

To make that a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  Last Thursday a class of 198 Garda trainees attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - the largest class to attest since the Garda College reopened in September 2014.  That brings the number of new recruits who have attested since the college reopened to almost 1,200, with another 400 scheduled to attest later this year.  That will bring Garda numbers to 13,500 by the end of this year.  Once projected retirements are taken into account, that is an increase of 500 over last year.  That is real progress on reaching our target of 15,000 members by 2021.  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Deputy Brendan Smith will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that the new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in Cavan and Monaghan and across other communities.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources.  She is mindful of the point raised by the Deputy.  Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review.  I am informed by the Commissioner that 26<b></b>newly-attested garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Cavan-Monaghan division since the college reopened.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><table><tr><th>CAVAN-MONAGHAN DIVISION 31 MAY 2017</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>DISTRICT</td><td>STATION</td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td><div>43</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYJAMESDUFF</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOTEHILL</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINGSCOURT</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLAGH</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHERCOCK</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>VIRGINIA</td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>67</div></td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td>BALLYBAY</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBLANEY</td><td><div>29</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROCKCORRY</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>71</div></td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>ARVA</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINAGH</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYCONNELL</td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELTURBET</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKLION</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAVAN</td><td><div>66</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOWRA</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLESHANDRA</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILNALECK</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWANLINBAR</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>101</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>CLONES</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EMYVALE</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONAGHAN</td><td><div>75</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SCOTSTOWN</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>83</div></td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN/MONAGHAN  TOTAL</td><td></td><td><div>322</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

At a recent meeting of the County Cavan joint policing committee, under questioning from other members and I, Chief Superintendent Mangan indicated that he needed at least 30 new recruits.  The force's strength in Cavan-Monaghan is approximately 330.  As I said earlier, that division has had the highest reduction in Garda numbers in the country during the period in question.  We also lost nine Garda stations.  My colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, referred earlier to the problems associated with rural crime and the targeting of rural families and the farming community in particular.  We have particular difficulties in the Cavan-Monaghan division in that we have a land border with a different jurisdiction, which touches on the Northern counties of Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh.  That is a long frontier to be policed.  As we know, a border with another jurisdiction puts extra pressure on policing resources.  I am aware that the chief superintendent has been seeking additional resources through the assistant commissioner in charge of human resources in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as with the Commissioner.  I appeal to the Minister, in view of the particular circumstances that face us in the Border area, that particular consideration be given to providing us with a decent allocation when the next recruits graduate and are assigned to their posts.</p></speech>

It is an issue that is also under consideration by the Garda authorities.  The table included with my reply sets out the situation regarding garda&iacute; in the Cavan-Monaghan division as of 31 May 2017.  Deputy Brendan Smith will be aware that Ballyconnell in his own original area has 18 garda&iacute;.  Belturbet has five , Blacklion has three, and Cavan town 66.  There are 75 garda&iacute; in the very busy station in Monaghan town and there are some officers in Clones also.</p>  <p>  As well as Garda numbers, I draw the Deputy's attention to the importance of operation Thor, which is a sustained drive against property crime and burglary in rural areas.  There are also further initiatives involving community activity, for which there are some rather modest grant schemes available from my Department.  I urge Deputy Brendan Smith to consider them also.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister's contribution to having some of those measures implemented in the Fresh Start deal agreed at Stormont.  An agency was put in place.  Illicit trade has not gone away, however, and is starting to appear again.  It poses a danger to legitimate business, consumers, the environment and our Exchequer.  That is just one issue with which garda&iacute; in Cavan-Monaghan and Border divisions have to cope which is not as prevalent further to the south.</p>  <p>  In view of the particular needs of a Border Garda division, particular attention should be given in the allocation of resources.  I hope the Minister will give me a commitment that he will speak to the Garda Commissioner about the needs of the Cavan-Monaghan division.</p></speech>

We had the opportunity to engage in some debate on it in my previous capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, when Deputy Brendan Smith was foreign affairs spokesman and, more recently, in his capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is an issue in terms of cross-Border crime, the matter of smuggling, racketeering and all sorts of criminal activity, including environmental crime.  It was the subject of a discussion I had this very morning with the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner assured me that co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland is at its highest ever.  Of course, I am keen that this co-operation would continue.  It is producing the type of dividend that I know Deputy Brendan Smith would like to see along the Border, particularly in his own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</p>  <p>  One consequence of the failure to reach agreement on the matter of the Northern talks is that we are unable to have a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I am unable to liaise with a counterpart Minister in Northern Ireland because of the absence of a working Executive there.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise issues of Border crime and cross-Border crime with the Garda Commissioner and, indeed, at every level.</p></speech>

I have, in tabular form, the Wicklow division total, which is 296.  The table is included with this reply.  If I were to read the entire table into the record, my time would be exhausted.  Suffice to say that the districts of Baltinglass, Bray and Wicklow had a total of 296 garda&iacute; as of 31 May 2017.</p><p>Last Thursday, we had a passing out parade when a class of 198 trainees attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is the largest class to attest since the Garda College reopened in 2014.  This brings the number of new recruits who have attested since the college reopened to almost 1,200, with another 400 scheduled to attest later this year.  This will bring Garda numbers to 13,500 by year-end once projected retirements are taken into account, which is a net increase of 500 over last year.  This is progress on reaching our target of 15,000 members by 2021.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; across every Garda division, including County Wicklow in the coming months and years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resource increase that has been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's capital plan 2016 to 2021.

Today, however, I am specifically focusing on Wicklow.  County Wicklow requires a greater Garda deployment.  We have only had nine new recruits since 2014.  That is out of a total allocation of 1,000.  Two of them have since resigned and 32 garda&iacute; have left the division in the past 18 months.  That is a net reduction in Wicklow of 22.  Another 28 garda&iacute; could retire tomorrow morning if they so wish.  Wicklow has also had the loss of two Garda stations, namely, those in Donard and Wicklow town.  They need to be restored.  They cover large rural areas where communities feel very vulnerable to local crime and crimes coming down on the main arteries from Dublin into the rural areas.  We are aware that Donard is being considered in the review and that one station has been reopened on foot of that review.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister could give me an update on that.  The farming and business communities in County Wicklow are expressing no confidence in the current capacity of the Garda to prevent crime in the county.  This can be attributed to the lack of Garda numbers there.</p></speech>

While I do not have a direct role in the matter, I am anxious to ensure the investment of the public money the Government makes available for the Garda leads to the provision of more effective policing services throughout the State.  I have no doubt that the new resources and the fresh investment now coming on stream will lead to an increase in the visibility of garda&iacute; across our communities, including those in County Wicklow.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that 18 newly attested garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Wicklow division since the reopening of the Garda College.  I have placed on the record a table showing that 296 garda&iacute; are assigned to the Wicklow division.  We are ensuring the Garda organisation is structured in a way that allows the Garda Commissioner to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; in every division, including the Wicklow division.</p></speech>

I was not aware of that but I welcome it nonetheless.  I will give an example of rural crime in County Wicklow, which depends significantly on tourism.  Two weeks ago, eight cars were broken into at the Shay Elliott car park in Glenmalure.  Such incidents cast a bad reflection on County Wicklow as a tourism destination and cause additional worry.  People in the county have been working on this issue for a number of years.  When I was a member of the Wicklow joint policing committee, we came up with a number of initiatives, including the tourism ambassador programme.  We rolled out tourism ambassadors in sensitive rural locations throughout the county.  We are losing that now because of the reduced number of people going into the T&uacute;s programme.  Additional signage has been installed in sensitive tourism locations to warn visitors not to leave property in their cars.  More resources are needed because garda&iacute; just cannot get to remote rural locations at present.</p></speech>

We are investing to facilitate increased Garda numbers.  It is important to acknowledge that measures have been put in place to combat crime, particularly in rural counties like Wicklow.  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other offenders.  It involves working positively with communities with a view to preventing crime.  Additional investment makes it possible to extend the range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting under Operation Thor of those involved in burglaries and crimes against property.  The concentrated policing activity under Operation Thor is reflected in the implementation of over 74,300 targeted checkpoints nationwide, many of which have been in County Wicklow, and in the making of approximately 4,400 arrests.  We will continue to monitor the situation.  I will be happy to engage further with the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

Many of them are assigned to Garda stations very close to Deputy Aylward, including Glenmore, Kilmoganny, Mooncoin, Mullinavat, Piltown and Thomastown.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring there is a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government's plan for making this a reality involves achieving an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians in support of the Garda's wide-ranging reform plan.  Funding has been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserve members, some of whom will operate in County Kilkenny.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a class of 198 trainees attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on Thursday last.  This was the largest class to attest since the Garda College reopened, having been closed in 2010.  This brings the number of new recruits who have attested since the Garda College reopened to almost 1,200, with another 400 recruits scheduled to attest later this year.  This will bring Garda numbers to 13,500 by the end of this year, when projected retirements are taken into consideration, and will mark a significant increase of 500 this year alone.</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3"><div><b>KILKENNY/CARLOW DIVISION 31 MAY 2017</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><b>DISTRICT</b></td><td><b>STATION</b></td><td><div><b>TOTAL</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>BALLON</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRIS</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARLOW</td><td><div>83</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HACKETSTOWN</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MUINEBHEAG</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MYSHALL</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHVILLY</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULLOW</td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>113</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>CALLAN</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLECOMER</td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILKENNY</td><td><div>120</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>URLINGFORD</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>137</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>THOMASTOWN</td><td>BENNETSBRIDGE</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLENMORE</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GORESBRIDGE</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>GRAIGUENAMANAGH</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>KILMOGANNY</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>MOONCOIN</td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>MULLINAVAT</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>PILTOWN</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><b> </b></td><td>THOMASTOWN</td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b> TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>62</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><b> KILKENNY/CARLOW TOTAL</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><div><b>312</b></div></td></tr></table></p></speech>

I tabled this question on foot of the crime epidemic that has swept rural Ireland in recent years.  People in rural communities, particularly the elderly, are fearful because of the significant increase in burglaries and related offences in 2014 and 2015.  This fear has now turned to anger.  It seems to me, on the basis of the conversations I have had with community representatives in rural towns and villages in my constituency, that we will soon be dealing with a wave of vigilantism among our citizens.  Too many people have fallen victim to calculated and brutal attacks by well-organised criminal gangs that are continuing to terrorise townlands and villages across rural Ireland.  People are rightly fed up of living in fear.  We need to ramp up the deployment of garda&iacute; in rural areas.  They are needed now more than ever.  As the Minister has said, Garda recruitment resumed almost three years ago in 2014.  While I welcome what the Minister has said, I think it is just the start.  We need a lot more to stop the crime wave that is coming our way, particularly from cities such as Limerick and Dublin.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that significant resources have been made available to the Garda to upgrade equipment in Garda stations, including ICT and email equipment.  In addition, &euro;46 million has been provided for Garda vehicles, some of which have been assigned to the Carlow-Kilkenny division.  This investment will facilitate the provision of a more effective policing service.  I have no doubt that the resources which are coming on stream will lead to an increase in Garda visibility in communities across Carlow-Kilkenny.</p></speech>

When I raised this matter with the previous Taoiseach in this House a few weeks ago, I did not get a very good response.  There are two motorways - the M9 and the M7 - in my constituency.  As I said earlier, organised gangs are coming from the cities to target rural businesses and steal from them.  In one case in May of this year, a gang came from Dublin to Urlingford, which is a small village in north Kilkenny, to rob from a business.  They took the lot and were in and out in 13 minutes.  They got back onto the motorway, which enables criminals to travel 100 miles in any direction from the scene of a crime within an hour.  I believe they were back in Dublin within an hour.  What is the status of this legislation?</p><p>In a recent response to a parliamentary question, the Minister indicated that the Garda Commissioner is likely to sanction the reopening of Leighlinbridge Garda station in County Carlow.  I add my support to the reopening of Leighlinbridge and ask the Minister to take a close look at County Kilkenny as well.  In Kilkenny and Castlecomer, two Garda stations cater for districts with huge rural and urban populations and I ask the Government to consider 24-7 services at these stations or, failing this, an additional allocation.  Stations in rural towns close down at certain times and Kilkenny city takes on responsibility.  I ask that these rural towns, especially the designated towns, have enough garda&iacute; to cover areas where several Garda stations have been closed down.</p></speech>

There are 11 garda&iacute; in Castlecomer and two in Urlingford and the area is served by the 120 garda&iacute; in Kilkenny city.</p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of garda numbers the Deputy will be aware of the community scheme in respect of text alerts and the work with local communities through the community alert organisation and local organisations such as Muintir na T&iacute;re and farm organisations.  I assure the Deputy that additional investment will make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations with particular reference to Operation Thor, which has been particularly active in the Kilkenny area.

There have been 15 recruits over four huge divisions in three years.  This hardly inspires confidence and at this rate it will be some time before Garda numbers are increased to 15,000, as provided for in the confidence and supply arrangement.  West Cork has a population of over 105,000 with a wide geographical spread of over 100 miles.  There needs to be a strong Garda presence in rural areas and this is not the case at the moment.  Rural Ireland has to deal with the fact that many Garda stations have been closed, a move which completely decimated the forces of law and order in many areas.  Crime and anti-social behaviour are on the increase all over west Cork and the absence of garda&iacute; facilitates this.</p></speech>

In fact the figures state the opposite - there has been a decrease in crimes against property.  I assure Deputy Murphy O'Mahony that the focus of investment in personnel is critical and the Garda Commissioner informs me that 15 newly-attested garda&iacute; have been assigned to the west Cork division since the reopening of the college.  The Deputy will be aware of the moratorium on Garda recruitment which was introduced in 2010, which resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am committed to a rebuilding programme, in terms of numbers and facilities.  Personnel are important but we have also made available some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT, some of which has been expended in the Cork area, and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, which are important in the context of the Deputy's question, which referred to 105,000 people spread over an area of 100 miles.  These investments, along with increased personnel, will facilitate the provision of a more effective policing service.  I have no doubt that the new resources coming on stream will produce an increase in Garda visibility in west Cork.</p></speech>

It recognises that every community, rural and otherwise, has its own concerns, priorities and expectations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I welcome the strong emphasis of the modernisation and renewal programme, MRP, on further developing and supporting the ethos of community policing.  This enables garda&iacute; to spend more time in the community, allows them to gain the trust and confidence of local communities and provides a greater level of security in communities.  I refer the Deputy to the community policing framework initiative in which community policing teams, comprising garda&iacute; from a range of areas, will be set up.  These teams will work with local communities to prevent and detect crime in their locality and each will be supported by the community safety forum.</p><p>These forums, which will comprise local garda&iacute;, members of the public and members of community groups, will promote crime prevention strategies.  This will ensure a clear and consistent approach to community policing and a better service for communities in west Cork, Carlow-Kilkenny and, in the case of Deputy Healy-Rae, Kerry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.629" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200039#LL00400"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle and their respective offices for affording me the opportunity to raise once again the stalled development of the town centre in Naas.  This has been a blight on the town for almost ten years now and I think everyone has tried their best to move the development onwards and get the works rolling and restarted once again.  It is especially timely to mention the fact that Naas is the county town of Kildare.  It always has been a busy and very important market town.  For reasons outside the control of local administration, the downturn in the economy affected it very severely, and the cranes that were there at the beginning are still there.  I hope this is the last time I have to raise the issue of the immobile cranes on the horizon in the town of Naas.</p>  <p>  Since I last raised the issue in the House, there have been some positive developments but they are extremely slow.  Despite countless meetings and discussions in recent times with the local authority, the legal people, NAMA and the receiver's representatives, who have all been helpful and positive in what they have to do, one matter is outstanding.  I refer to the legal issues concerning rights of way, which I am glad to note are now at least going to the High Court for resolution.  While this might take some time, it is to be hoped that we will see these issues resolved before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is important to use the time available to all administrators, including the Minister and the local authority, to assess the situation once again in order to ascertain whether further planning permission is required.  For instance, if all planning permissions relating to the site have to be renewed, that will take some considerable time.  Therefore, I ask that in the downtime we have, while awaiting the outcome of the remaining issues, the local authority and the Minister engage with a view to clarifying, at least - I hope ensuring - that planning permission is not required or that part of the development can proceed without new planning permission.  As we all know, there is always the danger of long delays in cases of developments of this nature.  At this stage, what is important is that nothing falters from here on.  We cannot afford that to happen.  There are about five prime sites within the town boundaries - the main one to which I refer and four others - all of which are available.  It was sad that the major commercial development moved outside the town.  It was not the local authority's decision, but rather An Bord Plean&aacute;la's, to move the development outside of the town and with it bring the footfall that is the necessary lifeblood of every commercial centre in the country.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to use his influence with the local authority and seek its full co-operation in speeding up the administrative procedures now required as a matter of urgency.  If this is done now in the downtime we have, I think we can look forward to an early and positive start of the development at the town centre in Naas, with obvious consequential benefits for the entire area.</p></speech>

I have seen the site and understand even from the point of view of having passed through the town how important it is that this site be developed or resolved one way or the other.  I therefore understand Deputy Durkan's and the council's desire to keep raising the matter at every opportunity they can in order to keep pushing it.</p>  <p>  However, as indicated in previous replies, the management of the stalled development in Naas is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.  Furthermore, with processes under way involving both NAMA and arbitration, it would be improper for me, as Minister of State, to become involved.</p>  <p>  It is not appropriate to accept representations on this issue as, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be involved except in very specific circumstances, which do not appear to apply in this case.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am informed that Kildare County Council continues to do everything in its power to influence and encourage NAMA to offer the site in question for sale as soon as possible.  The council has been notified that a receiver has been appointed in respect of the town centre site.</p>  <p>  As previously outlined, and subject to a satisfactory planning approval, there is no impediment to accessing the site or to appropriate development of the site.  Kildare County Council recognises the strategic importance of the site in question and will continue to support and work in partnership with any stakeholders involved in its redevelopment.  I will pass on the Deputy's suggestion to Kildare County Council that it might be able to progress or respond to the planning questions in parallel with the legal issues that are developing because that makes common sense.  I am not in a position to instruct the council in any way in this regard but I will pass on the Deputy's thoughts and advice on the matter.  We can have that conversation with the council.</p>  <p>  During the past 18 months, Kildare County Council has initiated and supported a number of projects with the strategic objective of ensuring that the social and economic development of Naas is protected and enhanced.  This work is underpinned by the work of the Naas roads and transport steering group, the URBACT group and the Naas Regeneration Group.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has also received the approval of the National Transport Authority to prepare a traffic management study for Naas which will form one element of a strategic social and economic plan for the town.</p>  <p>  Having talked to Deputy Durkan, I have no doubt but that he is very frustrated by the length of time it is taking to get this matter resolved and I know that the local authority is doing all it can within the parameters of its role and recognising the due process necessary in respect of the receivership etc.  I am hopeful that, with the appointment of the receiver, there will be further progress to resolve the matter and facilitate the development of this strategic town centre site as quickly as possible and the resolution of the other legal issues that are developing.</p></speech>

As I have said before, it is like "Waiting for Godot", to the extent that I almost expect Godot to turn up at some stage in the not-too-distant future.  I know the Minister cannot instruct the local authority but I suggest that the Minister might consider at a certain time encouraging and facilitating the local authority and inviting it to a meeting at which these issues could be discussed, with a view to applying sufficient encouragement to try to emphasise the urgent necessity to get the project moving once again.  The reason for this is simply as follows.  According to the old saying, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, "live horse and you'll get grass".  However, if one waits too long for the grass to grow, the horse will die.  We need this to move forward now.  Ten years is long enough.  The town is now beginning to experience a little bit of a recovery following the downturn in the economy, and it would be hugely important and hugely beneficial if it were possible to identify the positives, effecting investment in the town being one of the major positives.  It would not be a great idea to have to wait for another year or two while the administrative works are carried out.  The construction works on the town centre are already substantially complete and there is a huge issue regarding whether or not there will be a need for further planning permission.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House.  I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply and I appeal to all concerned, all the bodies - we all know who they are: ten years is long enough.  Godot or no Godot, we need to apply pressure from all sides to bring about a speedy resolution to something that has confused and frustrated us up to now.</p></speech>

If we can help in any way with planning queries or other issues surrounding this matter, and if Kildare County Council seeks our help in that regard, we will be able to engage with the council.  There is no problem whatsoever facilitating a meeting if needs be.  If there are any planning or interpretive planning issues, our planning team, headed by Niall Cousins, is there to be able to deal with them.  We can engage if we can help with that at all.  Wearing my urban regeneration hat, I can say we want to see buildings such as this one which have been lying idle for a long number of years brought back into use as this enhances the town overall.  If we can help under that heading, we will.  While we cannot get involved in site-specific issues surrounding the planning and the legalities of the matter and so on, there is absolutely no doubt but that where we can help, the door is open to try to do so as best as we possibly can.  We will have more meetings with Kildare County Council on general housing issues and other issues.  As at previous meetings, I will raise this issue with the council for discussion.  I know from talking to Kildare County Council that it also wants this resolved.  Its staff look out the windows of their office and can see the site most days so I think they understand the importance of it and want to have it developed as well.  I hope that will happen quite quickly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200040#MM00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss home care packages, home help hours and dementia care at home with the Minister.  The purpose of these supports is to maintain someone in the surroundings they are most comfortable in at a particular age in life when they might be suffering from a particular illness or sickness.  It exists in order that such people can be comfortable, happy and content in the surroundings they are most familiar with.  When home care packages work well and the scheme is in place, we can see the positives and the advantages they bring, but there are problems.  We need to identify those problems and we need to deal with them comprehensively.  Otherwise the home care packages will not meet the necessary requirements of the end user.  Ultimately that can have a detrimental effect on everyone involved.</p>  <p>  There is a problem with the application and assessment process at the moment and I am going to highlight certain examples.  When the assessment is being carried out by the home care package team, my understanding is that the level of dialogue with all the stakeholders is not taking place to the extent that it should.  One of my constituents is holding up a bed in a hospital because different experts and medical professionals have recommended that that person needs 21 hours of home care support to help support the family and friends in the home.  Currently, only 13 hours are allocated.  There is a lack of connection and dialogue between the relevant stakeholders to put the appropriate home care package in place for that person.  That is not a recommendation from me or from the family.  The people who are qualified to do this should be engaging with each other in order that the best package available is put in place to help that person in their home environment.  That person is in hospital holding up a hospital bed which others cannot access, and in the meantime the person cannot be at home in the environment in which they are most comfortable.  That is a problem, a disconnect, and something that needs to be addressed and dealt with during the application and assessment process.  This is causing a problem.</p>  <p>  There is another problem with the delivery of service by service providers, where some are to provide the service to provide to the end user but it is not being provided.  I met the HSE recently about another case.  Seven showers per week were allocated to a particular person.  Everyone thought it was happening.  Three months later the family contacted me to ask why it was not happening, and it was during that meeting I found out that while the showers had been allocated, the family did not know it had been put in place and the end user was not getting the service.  That is another issue of communication and disconnect and a lack of follow through.  The real loser here is the end user.  There is no follow-up with the service provider to see if it is carrying out the work.  There should be follow-up with the HSE when the service is allocated to check in with the end user and make sure that the service is in place, if the person is happy with it and if the service provider is carrying out the service to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  In another case involving a change in service provider, a lady who is severely disabled has not had a shower in eight weeks.  She has had a bed bath, but has not had a shower in eight weeks.  One service provider reckoned the environment was okay to carry out the work and another service provider said that it was not okay.  The user is caught in the middle.  There is a serious problem of disconnect, and a lack of engagement and consultation.  The problem is that the end user is suffering, and that is the issue that needs to be addressed and discussed in this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200040#MM00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Home care is an increasingly important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals.  The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home and other community-based services for older people.  Services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is no means testing.  The HSE, working within its available resources, has sought to maintain and, where possible, expand the range and volume of services available to support people to remain in their own homes, to prevent early admission to long-term residential care and to support people to return home following an acute hospital admission.  The demand for the home help service and for additional supports through the home care package scheme continues to grow in parallel with the increasing numbers of older people.  Many more of our older people with complex care needs are now being maintained at home, leading to increased demand for additional levels of service and for services outside of core hours of Monday to Friday.</p>  <p>  The overall funding for services for older people in 2017 is &euro;765 million.  This includes about &euro;373 million for the direct provision of home care.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan provides for a target of 10.57 million home help hours, 16,750 home care packages and 190 intensive home care packages for clients with highly complex needs.  The HSE has progressed a range of measures to improve home care provision overall, to standardise services nationally and to promote quality and safety.  National guidelines setting out standard procedures for providers of home supports were introduced in 2011.  A procurement framework for home care services came into effect in 2012.  This requires service providers to meet defined minimum standards applied to services procured by the HSE.  The tender arrangements are reviewed regularly and the current arrangements which commenced on 1 September 2016 will run for a period of two years.  The Deputy will be aware that arrangements for home care have developed over the years with a significant local focus, and there is considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country.  There is a need for a uniform approach to assessment of need, and the HSE is in the process of introducing a single assessment tool across home care. The single assessment tool is a comprehensive IT-based assessment used to ensure that every person being assessed for support services has access to a standard and thorough assessment, regardless of where they live or who is doing the assessment.</p>  <p>  Home care is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs and within the overall available resources for home care and having regard to demand throughout the year.  Arrangements for home care have developed over the years with a significant local focus, and there is considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country.</p>  <p>  The programme for partnership Government includes commitments to increase funding for home support services, to improve these supports, to introduce a uniform home care service in order that all recipients can receive a quality support, seven days per week where possible, and to review the management, operation and funding of national home help services.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that the Government is committed to promoting care in the community for older people in order that they can continue to live in their homes for as long as possible.  On 6 July, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I announced the opening of a public consultation on home care services.  The purpose of this is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and health care workers. The Department wants to find out what people think about current home care services and would also like to hear the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  I strongly urge all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate it if Deputy O'Rourke would clarify one point.  When he talks about the services that have been allocated and not delivered, is he talking about private home care services or is it the HSE which is in charge?  I am concerned about that.</p></speech>

I want to highlight the issues to get better delivery.  The issues I am speaking about involve both the HSE and private companies.  The HSE is ultimately responsible.  I am concerned that there is no follow through to ensure there is a delivery of service.  That is the problem.  We cannot have accountability without that follow through.  If people are aware that they are accountable for having a service delivered and checks and balances are carried out to ensure the end user is getting the service that was awarded, it is only then we can ensure an improvement.  The only person who is important and relevant here is the end user.  We will not have an improvement if people believe there is no consequence for inaction and that the issue can simply be fudged.  That is the problem.  All the cases I highlighted to the Minister of State are individual cases where there are problems with the delivery of service, including with the assessment and with appropriate home care packages being put in place, agreement among the clinical and medical people, and the delivery of that service.  In the programme for Government it was identified that this is an area the Minister of State wants to improve</p><p>Despite the additional funding in several cases it has not improved over the past six to 12 months.</p> <p> The Minister of State might need to consider the direct funding model if there is a problem in delivering the service and the family or end user is suffering.  They may need direct funding to put the service in place that best suits the needs of their loved one, their time and flexibility.  That works well in other places.  The end user needs to be listened to because it is not a case of one size fits all.</p></speech>

His latter point is a kind of money follows the user approach so that the user can employ his or her home care with the same budget.</p>  <p>  I encourage the Deputy to encourage his constituents to avail of the public consultation because this is the first time the Department has assessed what is happening nationally.  While the objective is to bring about a better universal scheme that is accessible to all with equity and fairness at its heart it also gives us the chance to examine the existing scheme.  There is no consistent national regulation of the current scheme.  It would be deeply troubling if resources are being allocated and paid for but not delivered.  That is a management issue that I need to take up with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to ensure that people are getting at the very least the limited resources allocated to them.  People are not satisfied with the resources being allocated but they should at least get full value for what has been allocated to them.  If the Deputy has details of any particular case I would be very interested in following it up to see whether it is private home care or HSE care and what we can learn from that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned dementia.  I met with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health this morning which is working actively in this area and that ties in with supporting people with dementia in the home and having a dementia liaison person to assist them.  There is a lot to be done in this area and I am confident we can make progress working together.</p>  <p>  I intend to lead that from the front for as long as I am in this office to get a scheme up and down the country.  It could take up to two years to get the kind of scheme I want to see which gives everybody access to the home help they need but that is not a reason for us to take our eye off the ball in the intervening two years to ensure we do have full accountability for the existing service.  While it may not be perfect we have to ensure it is the best it can be. </p></speech>

That is why I am raising it today.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, for visiting the excellent facility in Beaufort in County Kerry.  I requested him at that time to do so and was very glad that he did.  He also called to other facilities in County Kerry.</p>  <p>  Students with profound special needs or requiring round the clock medical attention are being forced to miss days at St. Francis Special School in Beaufort, County Kerry as the HSE provides only general nursing hours there three days a week.  At least two students living in constant danger of medical emergencies cannot attend St. Francis Special School on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the absence of general nursing care.  Funded entirely by the Department of Education and Skills with St. John of God's as its trustees, St. Francis Special School is dependent on the HSE to provide the vital medical assistance its students need.  While many students benefit from individual nurses the general nursing service is crucial to the delivery of education at St. Francis Special School.  Currently, however, it is provided only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and staffed by two part-time nurses.  Parents are also seriously concerned about the loss of physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy hours that occurred under the HSE's reconfiguration plan.  They signed up to this in 2013 on the understanding that the service they were then giving would be fairer for all students in the mid-Kerry area, students in St. Francis Special School and those in mainstream schools with less profound needs.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that the absence of general nurses at St. Francis Special School on Tuesdays and Thursdays is rectified and that nurses are provided on these days.  Children should not have to remain at home on those days.  It is simply wrong.  I compliment the staff at the school from the bottom of my heart.  They do excellent work but they are not trained medical experts and can only do so much.  I ask the Minister of State please to ensure that on Tuesdays and Thursdays general nurses are provided for St. Francis Special School in Beaufort.  This is of vital and paramount importance.</p>  <p>  I want also to highlight the fact that the structure in Beaufort is coming under attack because of the policy on congregated settings adopted in 2011.  I have said before in the House that this policy should be changed because if new people are not allowed to enter the excellent facility at St. Mary of the Angels, whose campus includes St. Francis Special School, over time the facility will close.  That will also affect St. Francis Special School.  I have said on numerous occasions that one shoe does not fit all sizes.  The Government should change this policy to allow St. Mary of the Angels to take in admissions again because when a centre like that is closed by stealth, a centre of excellence is closed.  Beaufort and St. Francis Special School are centres of excellence.  The personnel, the management, teachers, nurses, the staff working in the kitchens and those taking care of the personal needs of the patients make it a real centre of excellence.  I would like the Government to acknowledge that and revisit the congregated settings and deal with the issue I have raised, to provide the necessary nursing care on the days when the nurses are absent.</p></speech>

I am aware that St. Francis Special School is situated on the grounds of St. Mary of the Angels and I understand that there are 55 children enrolled in the school with needs varying from moderate to severe.</p>  <p>  A new extension, opened in September 2015, facilitated some of the then existing classrooms to be converted into specialised physiotherapy, speech and language and occupational therapy facilities, including a dedicated art room.  This is very positive as it means that a multidisciplinary team on site has played a huge part in enabling each pupil to achieve his or her true potential.</p>  <p>  With regard to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I am aware that, in 2013, HSE Cork Kerry reconfigured children's disability services in Kerry to children's disability network teams with access based on need, in line with national policy.  I am advised by the HSE that the specific need within the school was recognised on foot of an assessment of need, which took place some 18 months ago.  The assessment was undertaken by the public health nursing service on which the existing resource provision of three days nursing has been based.  The current nursing arrangement has been facilitated from primary care services.</p>  <p>  A more recent assessment by the public health nursing service has indicated increased complexity of care needs for the children attending the school.  The initial recommendation was to increase the service from three to five days per week.  The HSE has informed me that a review of this assessment is under way to examine the additional level of resources that may be required to address these complex needs and to set out what the overall requirement will be.  It will also look at how the existing allocation of nursing support may be optimised to meet the changing needs of the children.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the concerns of parents whose children are unable to attend the school on a full-time basis.  I sincerely hope the HSE can progress this assessment as speedily as possible and find a resolution that will have a positive outcome for these children.  This Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that &euro;8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014 and 2015 to fund 200 additional posts to support the implementation of the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people under 18 years of age.  A further &euro;4 million in additional funding was provided for 75 therapy posts in 2016.</p></speech>

One family has paid &euro;400 per month for the last 20 years and is now being asked to pay &euro;195 on top of that, which will leave them struggling.  What will St. John of God's do if the family cannot pay?  They cannot tell their children to leave the facility.</p>  <p>  I would sincerely love to catch a hold of the person in the HSE who dreamt this whole thing up a number of years ago of using the word "reconfiguration" rather than the simple, ordinary and down-to-earth word "cut".  Any time the HSE has spoken about reconfiguring something, it means it is going to cut the service and its funding.  However, it does not use that ordinary common word.  Rather, it uses the highfalutin term "reconfiguration of services".  The person who first said that would want to be given a good shaking for ten minutes to bring him or her down to earth and to show that a reconfiguration is the same as a cut.  It is certainly not enhancing a service and it is doing nothing to improve things.  It is a cut.  A cut is a cut, not a reconfiguration.  It is not the Minister of State's fault.  I do not direct this at him.  I direct it at those hiding within the HSE who dreamt this up with their spin doctors a number of years ago.  They were allowed to get away with it by politicians in this House at the time who should now tell them that there is no such thing as reconfiguration.  It is a cut.  Those words are being used by the Minister of State here now because, quite simply, he was told to use them by the HSE.  The Minister of State and his colleagues should be telling the HSE that they never again want to see a memo from the HSE containing the word "reconfiguration" on it because it is rubbish.  The HSE should be told to stick it and change it to the word "cut".  At least then we could see exactly what is being said.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the Minister of State's response.  I have raised the issue with him and I give him a commitment that I will continue to raise it in the House to the best of my ability as it is right to do on behalf of the children and their parents and grandparents.</p></speech>

I must differ somewhat with him on the word "reconfiguration".  It does not always mean a cut.  One of the better examples of reconfiguration was the reconfiguration of cancer services in Ireland.  Everybody must accept that the reconfiguration and delivery of those services nationally was one of the more outstanding successes of politics and the HSE working together.  While it was difficult and a lot of people had to make a lot of difficult choices, in the fullness of time, which is the best place to be to judge, we see that it has been a reconfiguration story of which we can all be proud.  In respect of cancer services, it is something that has mattered a great deal to a lot of us on a personal level.  As such, I take issue with the Deputy notwithstanding his entitlement to his own opinion.  I do not agree that reconfiguration is always a bad word.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue, I have given the Deputy the best answer the HSE and I can provide.  The HSE has acknowledged that there is a need for additional nursing here and it is looking to see what level of resources are required.  I will ensure the HSE speeds up its assessment of the increased need and try to get this up and running for the children in that school.  It is the least they deserve.  I thank the Deputy and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

I very much hope he is aware of the issue of the many children throughout the country who are suffering from juvenile arthritis.  The need for these children to see a paediatric rheumatologist is extremely urgent.  As things stand, Ireland has the equivalent of 2.5 paediatric rheumatologists available whereas international best practice indicates that we ought to have six.  Children are routinely waiting for up to two years while in chronic pain without being dealt with or seen notwithstanding the fact that they ought to be monitored every three months after that.  I recently brought the Irish Children's Arthritis Network, a group of parents, to the House and we had the opportunity to meet the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McEntee, standing in for the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Unfortunately, little or nothing has happened on foot of that.  The HSE has given a response which, pathetically, refers to competing priorities.  If we are not prioritising the health of children, we have our priorities all wrong.</p>  <p>  The situation with juvenile arthritis is such that if these growing children are not seen and monitored at optimum levels, they will be left to take medications and drugs which are in fact biological agents with very serious and negative side effects.  As they are growing, the condition leads to skeletal deformity.  For our response as a nation to be to refer to competing priorities is just not good enough.  The 2.5 consultants are a half-time consultant in Temple Street and two consultants at Crumlin children's hospital.  That level of appointments is four below what it should.  We ought to have six nationally.  The consultants we have are saying they do not have the staff, the capacity or the resources to do what they as physicians know is international best practice.  It is what they want to do and cannot do but yet we are referring to competing priorities.</p>  <p>  The response from the HSE indicates that we are prioritising adult rheumatology services with the resources going in that direction.  While nobody wants to see those people suffer either, young and growing children should be the priority.  If they are not seen in a timely fashion and monitored in the way I have said, they will develop skeletal deformities and other problems.  If we are simply talking about pounds, shillings and pence, which we should not be, that will inevitably cost the State more in the longer term as larger and more significant surgical and other interventions and care will be required.  The State will be expected to provide that.</p>  <p>  There are 1,000 children nationally who are affected in this regard.  There will always be more as more are born.  It is in every county.  I think of a specific family in Grange, County Sligo.  My own cousin has a daughter who suffers from this.  I am very well briefed on the challenge.  While it is a case of loaves and fishes in the Department of Health to try to have enough resources to meet all demands and needs, there is no one alive, sick or healthy, who would not understand and commend us as a nation on prioritising children.  I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene and to seek immediately to employ additional paediatric rheumatologists to bring us up to six consultants.  We should then begin to provide outreach services in the larger university hospitals nationally to prevent so many children having to travel.  In the first instance, let us get these children seen, if necessary with the benefit of the national treatment purchase fund.</p></speech>

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common inflammatory disorder of childhood and I understand that there are more than 1,000 children under the age of 16 in Ireland with the condition.  Demand for this national service has grown dramatically in the last decade with patient numbers having increased by almost 400% since 2006.  Rheumatology continues to be one of the most rapidly growing services within Our Lady&rsquo;s Children's Hospital Crumlin and now accounts for the highest number of medical day-care patients seen at the hospital annually.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is aware that there are challenges in meeting the growing demand for services and that waiting lists for access to paediatric rheumatology services are a particular issue of concern.  The HSE is constantly working towards improving access to rheumatology services.  The Children's hospital group has confirmed that the two paediatric rheumatology consultants in Crumlin have been taken off the general medicine roster, which has facilitated a greater focus for them on rheumatology services.  While nurse recruitment remains a challenge for Crumlin, the theatre closure situation is slowly improving, which will have a positive impact on access to joint injections for Crumlin patients.</p><p> In terms of services at Temple Street hospital, I understand that a staff member has recently been accredited as an advanced nurse practitioner in pain and rheumatology and that the hospital intends to utilise this new role to develop a nurse-led clinic to run in parallel with its new patient clinics.  The need for a third rheumatologist post is acknowledged and paediatric rheumatology service development will be considered in the annual Estimates process in the context of competing priorities for limited service development funding.</p> <p> The development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and satellite centres provides an opportunity to progress operational integration of the three existing children&rsquo;s hospital rheumatology services and to plan for the appropriate provision of these services well in advance of the move to the new facilities.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide a wide range of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and hydrotherapy services to children with juvenile arthritis, with clinical examination rooms in the outpatient department and day beds in the day-care unit specifically available for rheumatology.  The national model of care for paediatric health care services recommends a hub-and-spoke model in the context of paediatric rheumatology.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will have a central role in the national model of care.  It is proposed that rheumatology consultants will provide outreach clinics to Cork, Galway and Limerick, providing greater local access to services for patients outside the Dublin area.</p> <p> Representatives from the Irish Children&rsquo;s Arthritis Network met the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in February to discuss services for people with juvenile arthritis.  This group also met the CEO of the children&rsquo;s hospital group in June to discuss current and future services.  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Health is also meeting representatives from Arthritis Ireland tomorrow to discuss paediatric rheumatology services.</p> <p> I assure the Deputy that the Department of Health is aware of the challenges facing children with juvenile arthritis in accessing rheumatology services and we are working with the HSE to bring about further service improvements as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It was I who arranged the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  In fact, it was to be with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris but it had to be cancelled at short notice as a result of the demands of the leadership campaign that was under way within Fine Gael at the time.  It was only when I demanded that alternative arrangements be made that then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, stepped in to listen to the concerns.  As I said, very little happened on the back of it.</p>  <p>  I will refer to a couple of things the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, said.  He indicated that rheumatology continues to be the most rapidly-growing service within Our Lady's Hospital.  That absolutely is not the case.  It might have the most rapidly-growing demand but, with two consultants there, we are not expanding the service.  We need to aspire to having six consultants in place.  The Minister of State mentioned that a third consultant may be considered under the Estimates process.  We need to push the bar higher.  Six are required.  Last month and, again, this month, people who are in the system and going for follow-up appointments have had scheduled appointments cancelled and put back until an unknown date in 2018.  These are growing children with, as I said, skeletal deformities and they continue to be obliged to take these biological agents that have very bad side-effects.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the new children's hospital.  For God's sake, when will that be built?  We really do not know.  The project is ten years in the making so far.  These sick children will be adults by the time it is built and the effects of not being seen in a timely fashion will have crystallised, so that is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicated that a hub-and-spoke is the way forward.  I agree.  At present, however, we do not have a hub.  How can we even dream to have a spoke without the optimum number of consultants and nursing staff in place?</p>  <p>  Finally, and this was really insulting, whoever wrote the Minister of State's reply did not realise that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I are from the north west.  The outreach services are to be provided in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The north west has been forgotten yet again.  Sometimes I feel that central government feels that the north west voted to leave the European Union and, indeed, the Republic of Ireland because, yet again and as usual, that corner of the country, which comprises 30% of our landmass and which has a population of 300,000, has been cast aside.  That is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicates that he can assure me that the Government is aware of the challenges.  We are all aware of the challenges.  The stones on the road are aware of the challenges.  When will we embrace some of the solutions that I am putting forward?</p></speech>

As he is aware, much of what is contained in the reply relates to the future.  I accept what the Deputy is saying on the development of a new children's hospital.  We have to be ambitious for that hospital and to ensure that we have the full complement and range of services that the children deserve.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with the particular issue the Deputy raised.  A good friend of mine suffered from the relevant condition for many years.  It is a very difficult illness to deal with and one that presents many challenges.  I accept the point the Deputy makes about the challenges it presents into older life and that it can cost an awful lot more in later life in light of the surgeries required if an early intervention is not made.  I also accept what the Deputy says about prioritising children.  I very much agree that we should be prioritising services for children, earlier interventions, etc.  The Deputy may rest assured that I will feed that back to the Minister and the Department, as well as his concerns about the fact that issues relating to the north west were not addressed in the reply.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200044#TT00400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak on the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017.  The fundamental premise of this Bill is that our party, Fianna F&aacute;il, believes that it is good social and economic policy to protect the family home.  We believe the State should support people who are making a genuine effort to face up to their responsibilities and should ensure it has a system that is fit for purpose and protects the family home.  We must recognise that there is still a significant problem with mortgage arrears and that the system must be improved.  For example, there are still more than 76,000 private dwelling home, PDH, or family home mortgages in arrears.  Of those, 41,000 are in arrears of a year or more.  The total debt in respect of those mortgages is approximately &euro;8.8 billion and the amount of actual arrears for mortgages in arrears of a year or more is approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  That is the scale of the problem.</p>  <p>  While some restructures are happening and some deals are being done, it is very inconsistent and patchy across the different institutions and, indeed, depends on who one might be dealing with within the institutions.  Many of those who oppose this Bill will say that the number of repossessions is low.  However, I point to the recent statistics from the Central Bank which show that in the first quarter of 2017 alone, legal proceedings were issued in respect of 1,645 cases.  I accept that the proceedings are issued, not concluded.  Nonetheless, it is the start of the process.  For every house or apartment that is repossessed by way of court order, many others are lost to the individual or the family by way of voluntary surrender or voluntary sale.  That is very common in our system.</p>  <p>  Of course, the ideal scenario is that an individual mortgage arrears case would be resolved by agreement between the lender and the borrower under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  That is happening in some cases, but certainly not in others.  Under the CCMA that has been established, the odds are stacked against the borrower.  It is the lender who makes the final decision as to whether a mortgage is sustainable and the lender makes the final decision on whether a mortgage holder is entitled to receive a restructuring offer under the terms of the code.  Where agreement cannot be reached, the State's solution is that people should engage with the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p><p>When the service was established under the 2012 legislation, Fianna F&aacute;il described the Government decision to give the banks a veto as a bad idea which would not work.  The then Government stated it would be unconstitutional not to give the banks such a veto.  Under pressure from my party and others, amending legislation was passed in 2015 to provide for an appeals mechanism to an insolvency court under certain criteria.  This system is simply not working, however.  I have spoken to a number of borrowers who have been caught up in the system, as well as personal insolvency practitioners who act independently rather than solely on behalf of the borrower.  They inform me that it can take up to and beyond one year to conclude a case.  They also note that the banks are providing significant resources to defend cases.  The result is that mortgage holders have been put on the never-never and left in limbo because it is not clear whether their cases will be resolved.</p> <p> The Minister may ask why cases should go this far.  The most recent statistics from the Insolvency Service of Ireland confirm that in the first quarter of 2017, 43% of applications for personal insolvency arrangements, which involve secured debt and typically mortgage debt, were unsuccessful because they were either rejected by the creditor by way of a vote against the arrangement or the protective certificate expired because it was not possible to reach a deal. </p> <p> There does not appear to be an end point in the current arrangement other than the loss of the home, whether through a court order, forced surrender or so-called voluntary sale.  We are proposing that an independent office in the Insolvency Service of Ireland have the final say on a proposal to restructure mortgage arrears involving the home of an individual or family.  This would be a fundamental reform of the current system, one which would remove the veto over personal insolvency arrangements and give individuals and families the real prospect of achieving the outcome they desire.</p> <p> The Bill is not a charter for chancers or people seeking to avoid their responsibilities.  Many important safeguards are built into its provisions and the independent office will have significant powers in this regard.  However, it provides a pathway to protect the family home and sets out a way in which the debt associated with the home can be prioritised.  Other indebtedness that an individual may have would be dealt with under the normal insolvency system. </p> <p> As I will wrap up the debate, I will cede time to my many colleagues who wish to contribute.  I look forward to the debate and call on Deputies across the House to support the Bill when the House divides on it tomorrow.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, six years later, this problem has not gone away.  As Deputy McGrath pointed out, 76,000 holders of mortgages on family homes are in significant mortgage arrears.  It is apparent that the problem has not been solved in the past six years because the Government has not attempted, let alone introduced, a radical solution.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the then Government did not oppose Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.  On the contrary, it commended him on the legislation and allowed it to pass Second Stage.  The body of the Bill included a proposal similar to the proposal in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill before us.  It featured a section dealing with the establishment of a mortgage resolution office and a further section dealing with the conditions for a mortgage resolution order.  Unfortunately, the substance of the Bill introduced six years ago must be reintroduced because there has not been a solution in the meantime.</p>  <p>  The reason I raise this issue is that I understand one argument the Government will make is that the Bill before us is unconstitutional.  If, as the Government claims, the Bill is unconstitutional, why was that point not made six years ago when the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Shatter, commended Deputy McGrath on his legislation and allowed it to proceed beyond Second Stage.</p>  <p>  The Constitution does not preclude the State from interfering in the property rights of individuals.  I have no doubt the Government will make an argument that this Bill could constitute an interference in the property rights of banks.  What that argument fails to recognise, however, is that the Constitution recognises that actions can be taken by the State to interfere with private property in circumstances where the common good requires it.  If ever there was an example of the common good requiring radical intervention, this is it.  When one considers the number of families who are stuck in mortgages and that Personal Insolvency Act introduced by the previous Government has had no real impact on the lives and problems of these individuals and families, one must note that radical surgery is required. </p>  <p>  I will give an example of how the State previously intervened and interfered in the property rights of individuals.  Subordinated bondholders were burned by the State because of legislation introduced in 2010.  There is, therefore, nothing to preclude the State from seeking to interfere in and diminish the property rights of individuals and corporations, provided this is done proportionately.  The Bill drafted by Deputy McGrath and introduced by my party provides this balance.</p>  <p>  It must be recognised that we are nearly eight years into this crisis and the Governments in power for the past six or seven years have not yet provided a solution to the problem.  Radical surgery is required and this Bill contains a radical proposal, which I urge all Members to support. </p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on his relentless focus on this issue and on bringing forward this significant measure which will help struggling families.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis rightly dominates this D&aacute;il and has dominated my work as a Deputy.  We must remember that thousands of families in County Wicklow are experiencing a housing crisis as they struggle, day in and day out, to keep a roof over their heads.  The modern social contract between the citizen and State is broken.  For too many Wicklow residents, the contract that ensured people could work towards owning a family home has turned into a nightmare with no end.  People whose mortgage repayments are in crisis are also suffering greatly as a result of the complete failure of the Government's housing policy.</p>  <p>  I regularly meet people who are literally trapped in their homes and unable to afford anything in life other than attempting to meet their mortgage repayments.  In many cases, food is provided by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul because nearly all family income is tied up in paying the mortgage.  These families deserve to know the State is on their side and a one-stop-shop will be established to work with them and their lender to put in place a restructured package that allows them to work to retain their homes.</p>  <p>  The Bill recognises that the current personal insolvency arrangements are not working.  In the first quarter of this year, 43% of applications for such an arrangement were unsuccessful because the lender did not consent to them.  The appeals process is placing additional stress on these families because the legal process can take up to a year to complete.  While the lender will have substantial legal support, families are left dangling as they face the nightmare of not knowing whether they will be able to keep their homes.</p>  <p>  An independent mortgage resolution office would mean people in such circumstances could have confidence that the office would make the final decision on mortgage restructuring.  The office will be tasked with providing a wide range of options to make the mortgage work for the family and lender.  I hope there will be widespread support for this practical proposal to help these families who are also a part of our housing crisis.</p></speech>

It was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath.  It is important that, as Members of the Oireachtas, we do everything in our power to protect people and allow them to stay in their family homes instead of seeing them evicted into homelessness.</p>  <p>  Families need support to remain in their homes.  Every Deputy deals on a daily or weekly basis with a number of people who have fallen into mortgage arrears, are dealing with banks or, in some instances, local authorities via shared ownership and are finding it difficult to reach a solution that would allow them to remain in their family homes.  The problem is that, when people enter into those discussions on maintaining the family home, they often just get distant responses and the banks are flippant and arrogant in how they deal with them.  Sometimes, banks are not willing to engage at all, preferring instead the heavy-handed approach of taking people to court for repossession.  We know the irony of that.  When people's homes are repossessed and they seek housing supports from local authorities, we know what the answer will be.  Due to the current crisis, there is no support.</p>  <p>  We must get real about this.  We need an independent office that can in the first instance assist families in dealing with mortgages and find a constructive pathway to deal with arrears so that people can remain in their homes.  There are different proposals and these can be considered constructively rather than in the negative and arrogant way that is currently being taken.  People being put outside their own front doors by banks and then going to local authorities to be put on the housing list and get social supports through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, or rent supplement is not a runner.  There are no properties for them to rent.  Even where there are properties, people find it difficult to pay their rents.</p>  <p>  I call on the Government to consider this Bill in a positive way and accept it as a means of addressing the issue.  Instead of the heavy-handed approach that we know from regular experience is being exercised by the banks, this Bill is about families being maintained in their homes so that they can continue existing in a proper environment.</p></speech>

There are many contributing factors.  Unfortunately, the State and the Government's response has not sought to reverse the trend.  The statistics are damning.  Waiting lists continue at an alarming level.  Homelessness continues to blight society.  Children continue to be dependent on emergency accommodation.  Efforts by the Government to address demand have failed in the absence of earnest efforts to address the issue of supply.  The problem of mortgage distress and arrears is undoubtedly contributing to those figures.  Efforts by the Government to date to address this have failed abysmally.</p>  <p>  From our own constituencies, we are well aware of the unfortunate statistics emanating from courts in respect of repossession cases.  We are well aware that many people find themselves without adequate representation to assist them in that process.  We are well aware that the banks' dominance in this scenario allows this situation to continue.  The failure of the Government to address that is something that we as an Opposition party have grappled with, which has led to this Bill.  It is a meaningful way of addressing the issue.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that, in its response to date, the Government has failed to recognise the Bill's significance and potential and claimed that it cannot proceed for constitutional reasons, in that it usurps the court system that deals with this area.  It is obvious to all and sundry that the way in which this matter is being dealt with is far from adequate and far from a society that seeks to help those who find themselves in this unfortunate situation.  Precedent has been set in how the Workplace Relations Commission can make its recommendations.  Setting up an independent mortgage resolution authority within existing processes would, on foot of a case that is presented to it, enable it to make recommendations that allow for fair and reasonable solutions without taking the side of the bank, which has been the case heretofore.  Mortgage-to-rent schemes, split mortgages and interest-only options would become real options with a statutory basis, which is not the case now.  If resolutions and recommendations had a statutory basis, cases could be removed from the court system, thereby allowing courts to get on with the job that would be expected of them in a normal society and democracy.</p>  <p>  I implore the Government to listen to the debate on this Bill.  A great deal of work has been put into it by Deputy Michael McGrath, who is our spokesperson for finance, Deputy O'Callaghan, who has a legal background and is our spokesperson for justice, and me in terms of housing.  Knowing the terrible blight that this situation has been on society, we are making meaningful proposals.  If the Government was serious and could recognise the potential of this D&aacute;il in its current configuration to produce solutions, it would engage with us on seeking to find solutions where it believes there are blockages in the proposals.  We can reach an understanding whereby we can put a procedure in place that is conscious of the predicament that people are in and of our responsibilities under the Constitution and ensures that, while the law is protected, people are given a fair opportunity to address the situation with meaningful proposals that have a statutory basis.</p></speech>

Nearly 17 or 18 months ago, we sat down for 80 days of Government formation talks.  The first issue that was agreed at those talks - the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, brought it to Revenue and it was given the green light - was for a one-stop-shop to be established for people whose homes were being repossessed and for legislation to be introduced so that people would be given the option of a split mortgage or a mortgage-to-rent scheme before a case could go to court.  Sadly, this has never been done.  Solving the problem is not complicated.  If these options were given to people before a case could go to court, many problems would be eliminated.</p>  <p>  A change to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Acts might be necessary so as to give courts more power.</p>  <p>  Our third option relates to housing agencies.  Vulture funds are buying large amounts of property from the banks.  We should have a housing agency and the banks should be prepared to sell it those houses at the same price.  We must remember that people may be caught in the middle of all of this who might not be eligible for social housing.</p>  <p>  This problem could be solved quickly if we wanted to solve it, but there is pressure.  When one tries to negotiate with a bank, one sees that pressure is being applied by Europe to solve this.  Basically, banks are just driving at people now.</p>  <p>  Besides the family home, we must also remember the small family businesses around the country.  The vultures are tackling the farming community.  They bought many loans at 40% and 50% and are seeking 100% profits on them.  That is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  This situation could be solved quickly were the will there.  This Bill is the way forward.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Deputy's genuine concerns about this issue and the positive intentions behind the Bill.  The remaining home mortgage arrears problem and the risk of repossession remain a major issue and a high priority for the Government as the Programme for a Partnership Government clearly underlines.  We have already taken extensive actions to address these issues.  Those actions are achieving practical results which have been demonstrated in the matter of reducing arrears and in helping to get sustainable solutions in place for distressed mortgage holders.  I will return to those later.</p><p>Further important Government measures to address these problems are continuing to come on stream.  I will mention these too.  Unfortunately, the Bill before us will not make a meaningful contribution to resolving these important problems.  It is an over-simplistic solution in this very complex area, which risks creating a range of serious and unintended negative effects, most importantly for distressed mortgage holders themselves.  The Bill is not fully thought out on issues of fundamental importance.  If implemented, it would be at risk of ongoing legal challenges.  More seriously, the Bill appears to be incompatible with the Constitution and, in light of the advice we have received from the Attorney General, there is a very high risk that it would attract constitutional challenge.  For these reasons, the Government will oppose the Bill.</p><p>I will turn first to the significant legal and constitutional problems raised by the Bill.  Essentially, what the Deputy is proposing is the creation of a new, independent, quasi-judicial body to be called the mortgage resolution office.  A financially distressed borrower who was in arrears on his or her home mortgage on or before 1 January 2017 would apply to this new office.  The office would have the power under the Bill to make a new form of order called a mortgage resolution order.  This would impose legally-binding changes to the terms of an existing mortgage.  Such changes could include: extending the term of the mortgage by up to 20 years; directing a change in the interest rate; imposing a reduction in the principal sum due under the mortgage; directing interest-only payments for up to four years; imposing a split mortgage with warehousing for up to ten years; and imposing a mortgage-to-rent solution or any other solution to the borrower's arrears that the office may consider appropriate.  An mortgage resolution order would also prevent a mortgagee or financial institution from issuing any new enforcement or repossession proceedings.  It is clear that these powers are extremely far-reaching, which was the intention.</p><p>The only appeal provided for under the Bill is, effectively, to a second newly-established quasi-judicial entity, namely, an appeals officer.  An appeals officer could refer a point of law arising before him or her to the High Court.  Under the Bill, there is no appeal to any court either against an mortgage resolution order made by the mortgage resolution office or against a decision by the appeals officer.  This is a fundamental flaw in the whole conception of the Bill and raises very serious constitutional and legal difficulties.  The Bill essentially seeks to give these two new quasi-judicial bodies, the mortgage resolution office and the appeals officer, extremely wide-ranging powers to intervene and change the vested constitutional and contractual legal obligations and the legal rights of private parties.  Such powers are exclusively reserved, as the Deputy will know, to the courts, under Article 34 of the Constitution as part of the administration of justice.  Following legal advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General, it is likely that the proposed far-reaching powers and discretions of these bodies would contravene Article 34.</p><p>The Bill seems to be based on legislation providing for a statutory scheme of grants in which State subsidies or payments are the only matter at issue, such as in respect of social welfare appeals or agriculture appeals.  The proposed mechanism of a quasi-judicial decision at first instance and on appeal could be suitable in that context.  That is wholly inappropriate in the context of this legislation.  Even if the Bill were fundamentally revised to provide for the proposed mortgage resolution orders to be made by a court rather than this quasi-judicial body, it would remain at high risk of constitutional challenge.  Such orders would intervene with the banks legal right to be repaid under a mortgage contract validly entered in with private parties.  These are protected vested property rights under Article 40 of the Constitution.  The constitutionality of proposals to impose mortgage resolution solutions has been extensively discussed by Government Departments and the Attorney General's office, not only in recent times but in recent years, as all Members are aware.  Any legislative interference with private property rights in this area seeking to achieve an objective of the common good still has to demonstrate clearly that it is a carefully balanced and strictly proportionate intervention which has taken full account of the respective rights and obligations of both parties.  The very cursory provision in this Bill falls far short of that standard.  </p><p>The Bill also has significant further legal defects.  Time will allow me to mention but a few.  The income, asset and debt levels required to qualify as a financially distressed borrower are not defined in the Bill.  It is questionable whether a Bill could constitutionally leave this key issue to be decided by a statutory instrument.  There is no provision for the mortgage resolution order to be varied if the borrower's financial situation changes, only for it to be terminated which may leave the borrower in a worse position than he might have been in before.  The new office is proposed to be located with the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  However, there are a number of conflicts between statutory functions of the latter and those proposed for the new office and these would likely to lead to ongoing operational problems of a serious nature.</p><p>In addition, the Bill raises significant practical problems.  I will give some examples.  While the Bill provides a mechanism intended to protect against enforcement or repossession of the home, it does not provide any protection against registration of a judgment mortgage against the home by a creditor other than the mortgage lender.  This creates a real risk that unsecured creditors would rush to register judgment mortgages against the home creating new problems for the distressed borrower.  A judgment mortgage is a court order and can only be varied or suspended by a court, not a quasi-judicial body.  Given its very considerable legal defects, the Bill is likely to give rise to a very high proportion of objections, appeals, legal challenges or views which would be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain.  The Bill only provides for a resolution of the borrower's mortgage arrears.  There is no provision for dealing with other debts or returning the borrower to solvency as would be done by way of a statutory solution under the personal insolvency Acts.  These issues were raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice who seemed to think they had been incorporated into this Bill already.  There is a risk that borrowers will opt for this new solution only to find themselves back in the frying pan for this reason.  The Bill risks delaying a debt or getting a comprehensive solution, getting some certainty and making that outcome more difficult to achieve.  I am also concerned the Bill could discourage financial institutions from new lending for house purchase purposes which would exert a negative impact on the recovering housing market.</p><p>I will now turn to the extensive measures already undertaken by the Government in this area which Deputy Cowen failed to acknowledge and the demonstrated and practical results in helping home owners in mortgage arrears.  Deputy O'Callaghan wonders what happened in the past six years so I will mention a few things.  Measures already introduced include: the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; the courts' power under section 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 to adjourn repossession proceedings so a borrower can explore whether personal insolvency can resolve his or her financial difficulties; the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, which removed the bank veto in personal insolvency cases by introducing a court power to review an unreasonable refusal by a creditor; the Abhaile mortgage resolution service set up to implement the first point in the programme for Government's commitment on mortgage arrears, providing free, independent, expert legal and financial advice and assistance via MABS to borrowers at risk of losing their homes; and the development of the MABS resource across the country, which is now integrated into the Abhaile scheme.</p><p>I acknowledge that mortgage arrears remain high but, despite what is suggested by some media reports and commentators, both home mortgage arrears and repossessions are falling significantly and have been doing so now for a sustained period.  Owner-occupier private dwelling house, PDH, mortgage accounts have been falling consistently for 15 consecutive quarters since their peak in September 2013.  All categories of PDH mortgage arrears are declining.  Even those in largest arrears, equivalent to over 720 payments, have now been declining steadily for seven consecutive quarters.  It should also be noted the Central Bank indicates the figure of 76,400 home mortgage accounts includes 26,500 restructured mortgage accounts where the remaining arrears are historic and the borrower is not at risk provided he or she meets the current terms of restructure.</p><p>We can see a clear impact of Government measures to help borrowers in home mortgage arrears to get solutions into place.  There is no room for complacency and there is much more to be done in that regard.  Important further measures already in train under the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness include recent and continuing changes to the mortgage-to-rent scheme to extend its availability particularly for borrowers in rural areas.</p><p>The House is well aware of the extent of complexity of the home mortgage arrears problem.  I am sure Deputy Michael McGrath and the authors of this legislation also acknowledge that.  This remains a priority for Government.  Arrears and repossessions are falling steeply but they are still too high.  We are determined to reduce them further.  We have taken action and we continue to take action.  Of course, we are open to looking at all constructive solutions and fully appreciate the genuine intent behind this legislation but it is fundamentally flawed.  It appears incompatible with the Constitution and risks adding problems to those already suffering the worst of arrears.  For these reasons, we cannot support it.</p></speech>

The Minister has given one excuse after another to leave things as they are.  I take a different approach.  I also took a different approach from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on the Anti-Evictions Bill, which both parties suggested was constitutionally flawed.  I believe it should proceed to Committee Stage where we can thrash those things out.  The Bill should be allowed to pass because of the numbers recited in the House by the Minister and by Deputy Michael McGrath, the Bill's sponsor, whom I commend on bring the legislation to the floor of the House.</p>  <p>  We are talking about close to 80,000 individuals, many of whom have been in arrears for a long time.  That we are debating tens of thousands of Irish citizens who are in long-term mortgage arrears nearly a decade after the crash is a clear reflection of the Government's inaction.  Deputy Michael McGrath referred to previous attempts by him and others to bring issues to the floor of the House to try to address this problem.  In 2013, I drafted legislation that would have provided greater protection in law to the family home.  Unfortunately at that time, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government decided to vote against it.</p>  <p>  We need new thinking and a new approach from Government.  I have long advocated for an independent office that would be able to impose decisions over the heads of the banks.  That is exactly what Deputy Michael McGrath has proposed - a new process within the insolvency service, a mortgage resolution office that would be empowered to put in place a mortgage resolution order designed to protect the family home in the insolvency process.</p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, a number of existing solutions could be offered based on such an order being made, including debt write-down, debt for equity, mortgage to rent and a number of others.  The Government is clearly and predictably setting its face against it.  It is about inaction as opposed to action.  We should deal with this on Committee Stage.  I have issues with the Bill.  I do not want to waste my time discussing something that is unconstitutional but let us get the advice from the counsel here in the office.  Let us hear from legal experts.  Let us carry out the pre-legislative scrutiny on this.  If need be, let us tweak it, amend it and reshape it in order that we have legislation that will give protection to those families currently facing the weight of the financial institutions that are trying to repossess their house by voluntary or involuntary action.</p>  <p>  What we have from Government is more and more promises.  The programme for Government promised to set up a special court to deal with mortgages.  Last week I got a response to a freedom of information request.  After a year and a half, there is not one piece of paper briefing the Minister on a special court to deal with mortgages, a key promise in the programme for Government.  There is no action on that and it will quietly be let go.  Based on the Minister for Finance's recently published brief, the Central Bank has not backed the plan to amend the code of conduct in order that lenders would have to offer more solutions.  Even the ideas that the Government came up with, which were done when it was under pressure trying to cobble together a minority Government, are being knocked back.</p>  <p>  What we have is same-as, plan A, the way it is.  The Government wants to leave it to the markets, leave it to the financial institutions and leave it to the vultures, which the former Minister for Finance believed played a very important part in the system.  Who are the prey of these vultures?  It is the 80,000 families who are in mortgage arrears.  They deserve to be front and centre in this political debate.  It is an issue that has not gone away and is not going away.  It needs action.</p>  <p>  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing this very important issue to the floor of the House again.  I pledge our support for it to go to pre-legislative scrutiny at which point we can start to take the politics out of it and start to do what is in the best interests of families and homeowners who are suffering the brunt of the financial institutions which want to take the rug from under them.</p></speech>

It seeks to establish a mortgage resolution office which would be empowered to put in place a mortgage resolution order designed to protect the family home in the insolvency process.</p><p>As of the end of March this year, 76,422 mortgages on principal dwelling homes were in arrears and 120,894 principal dwelling house mortgage accounts were restructured.  Such restructuring arrangements include a switch to an interest-only mortgage, a reduction in the payment amount, a temporary deferral payment, extending the term of the mortgage and capitalising arrears amounts and related interest.  In addition, lenders were in possession of 1,740 principal dwelling properties at the end of March 2017.  Some 370 properties were taken into possession by lenders during the first quarter of 2017; 142 were repossessed on foot of a court order and 228 voluntarily surrendered or abandoned.</p><p>This crisis has been trundling on for many years.  This Government and the previous Government have failed miserably to address the issue of distressed mortgages in any meaningful way.  Instead they have relied on the banks to sort out the problem in their own way, choosing to sell to vultures or repossess the homes as they please.  We do not need to look too far back to see just how despicably the banks have acted.  The scandalous <i>expos&eacute;</i>of how thousands of fixed-rate mortgage holders were deliberately kept in the dark by their bank regarding their entitlement to move or move back to the cheaper tracker-mortgage rate shows just how rotten things were.  The implications of this were huge with thousands of families struggling to pay the higher rate and many dozens of families losing their homes due to the excessive mortgage-repayment costs they faced.  That is only one example.</p><p>I recognise that some initiatives have been launched by Government but not all of them have been successful.  It is encouraging to note that more people are now using the insolvency process but for many families this is still an unattractive option as it does not guarantee retention of the family home.  Much more needs to be done.</p><p>The programme for Government made many promises pertaining to the protection of the family home, but concerns have now been flagged that some of the proposals are unlikely to happen.  This is an extremely worrying development.  For example, there was a commitment to introduce legislation that would:</p><blockquote>Establish a dedicated new court to sensitively and expeditiously handle mortgage arrears and other personal insolvency cases, including through imposing solutions, including those recommended by the new service.  The hearings of this court could be held in private if requested by the debtor. </blockquote><p>However, I understand that the Taoiseach confirmed to my colleague, An Teachta &Oacute; Dochartaigh, that there is no sign of the mortgages special court Bill-courts (mortgage arrears) Bill which has been on the legislative programme for a considerable time.  </p><p>I call on Government not to renege on its commitments.  Too many people have suffered and too many continue to suffer with the stress and fear of losing the roofs over their heads.  It is time for the Government to show some political will in this respect.  Action is needed now.</p></speech>

The programme for Government promised to do something to solve the problem but the Government has not solved the problem.</p><p>Yesterday in the High Court, the Master's list contained 101 loans for repossession, 70 of which were from AIB.  The latter is owned by the State.  I assume it is trying to clean up the mess before it is sold or whatever it is doing.  The Master of the High Court, Mr. Honohan, said some time ago that AIB should be sponsoring the court given that so much of its business is going through it.  That is a reflection of where matters stand because all of those people with family homes took out mortgages ten or 15 years ago in order to buy homes, get on with their lives and have a sense of a future.  The rug is being pulled out from under those people.  The reality is that no matter what we say, we have to do something to protect them and their futures.</p> <p> Another thing that happens is that loans are sold on the market to vulture funds.  The funds buy the loans, in most cases at a huge reduction.  I have come across that in my constituency and I know many others have seen it happen as well.  People have come to me who have made their mortgage repayments on time and who received letters indicating that their loans been sold.  If they ask if they could buy them back at the same knockdown price that is available to vulture funds, they are told they cannot.  Their offer is turned down.  That is something that must be examined.</p> <p> I have firm information that many of the loans being bought by the vulture funds are known to them in advance in terms of what the loan and property is like.  Their only intention is to sell the property and put the people living there out of their home.  We need to resolve those issues.  While the Bill goes some distance towards doing that, much more needs to be done.  The Government must get tough with the banks.  If we do not do that, we are letting the people down.  At the moment, everyone out there, including me, is paying a mortgage at approximately 3% above the average interest rate in the rest of Europe.  This means that during the lifetime of most people's mortgages, they will have paid the banks &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 more in interest than should have been the case and than they would have paid if they were living in France, Germany or any other country in Europe.  The banks in Europe are getting money from the European Central Bank, which is the same place the Irish banks get it, at practically 0% interest and yet they are screwing the Irish people when it comes to paying those loans.  Having come through the terrible days of the recession and seeing our children emigrate and everything else that we have gone through, it is obscene that we are still in a situation whereby the banks are in the driving seat.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the situation again, to support the Bill and to do more to ensure that Irish people can have a future, because that is what this is about.</p></speech>

I refer to women who have children and who have separated from former partners.  Many of them are struggling to pay the mortgage on their own and to keep the roof over their heads.  In most cases, they are not getting any support from their former partners or the fathers of their children.  Some of those women manage to cut deals with banks or mortgage providers but they often struggle to pay the agreed monthly repayment.  The banks say that they require two signatures on any deal they make.  One of the signatures must be that of the former partner.  In some cases, because of the poisonous relationship between the couple, the former partner withholds his signature on any new deal with the bank, which means that it cannot proceed.  The bank wants a deal and the mother and children want a deal but it is prevented by the former partner.  In such cases, the women and children will become homeless because there is no alternative accommodation.  It is really important that the Minister focus on that cohort of individuals who are being held to ransom through no fault of their own and are being forced into homelessness.</p>  <p>  I know of a particular woman who has struggled to pay a mortgage for the past five years on her own after she separated.  Her ex-husband paid nothing for many years and he filed for bankruptcy due to debts he had elsewhere.  His name was taken off the deeds of the house and replaced by that of the official signee in the bankruptcy process.  The woman was told her ex-husband would have nothing to do with the house ever again.  She has since remarried and she and her new husband are living in the house.  Just last week, however, that woman was told that, under Government legislation, her ex-husband, who has contributed nothing to the house for eight or nine years, will have his name put back on the deeds of the house and that she has no control over this whatsoever.  I cannot adequately describe the level of stress she is experiencing.  She is in a most vulnerable situation.  Her ex-husband could move back into the house.  He could possibly look to sell the house.  He could also possibly look for further loans and potentially use the house as collateral.</p></speech>

The family is doing its best to work with the bank to pay a certain amount to cover some of the capital and all of the interest relating to the loan yet the bank is offering them &euro;10,000 to get out of the house.  If the family was vulnerable and there was addiction to drugs, alcohol or gambling, there is no doubt that there would be a serious temptation on their part to accept the money.  However, they would be homeless in a number of months.  It is important that the Government focus on that issue too.</p></speech>

The housing crisis, the mortgage arrears crisis, the rental crisis and the homelessness crisis all revolve around that fact.  Even now, in the aftermath of the disaster that was inflicted, this Government does not want to stand up to the banks.  That is just putting it simply.</p>  <p>  If 80,000 people are in mortgage arrears and 33,000 of them are in arrears for two years or more and have the real prospect of losing their homes, the Government is willing to allow that to happen as long as we do not annoy the banks or upset somebody's notion of private property and the rights relating thereto.  I always wonder when reference is made to the Constitution and the protections relating to private property.  When we argued for rent controls, the Government said it could not be done.  Strangely enough, however, the Government - under a lot of pressure - brought in a very limited form of rent control at the end of last year.  Suddenly it could be done and no legal issues emerged.  I do not believe all that nonsense and much as I hold Fianna F&aacute;il responsible for getting us into this mess, I agree that the Bill should pass Second Stage because it is doing something that we proposed in an extensive series of amendments to the personal insolvency legislation when it was originally introduced, namely, that the Insolvency Service of Ireland should be allowed to enforce solutions for people in mortgage distress in order to ensure they do not lose their homes.</p><p>I am not sure if Fianna F&aacute;il voted with us when we put that forward.  I hope that they did, to show a little bit of consistency.  Our proposal was written out in great detail.  I wrote the amendments myself at great length.  Fine Gael would not do it then, however.</p> <p> It is all because Fine Gael wants to protect the banks.  That is the reality, with all the suffering that flows from it.  It is not just about the mortgage arrears crisis which this Bill deals with but also the wider housing crisis.  Worse than that, the Government is resurrecting the conditions that led to all this by allowing and facilitating the sale of vast amounts of property assets to vulture funds which are evicting people and gaining even greater control over property prices, rents and so on.  The Government is facilitating a worsening of the situation.  It beggars belief.  The least the Government could do is let this Bill, which is trying to address one aspect of it, go through Second Stage in order that we can discuss it.</p></speech>

She was about my age or slightly younger.  She was being harassed and harangued by the bank for the mortgage arrears in every way possible - emails, phone calls, and so on.  Despite all her explanations about the conditions that were giving rise to her inability to pay, the bank would not stop.  As a consequence, out of stress, her hair had fallen out even though she was a young woman, younger than I was.</p><p>It brought home to me the devastation wrought on people's lives by the behaviour of the banks in pursuing people in this manner and that of vulture funds in particular.  There was an article in <i>thejournal.ie </i>a few months ago which summed it up:</p><blockquote>It&rsquo;s the effect of the whole thing that has the biggest impact on your life.  It causes an awful lot of stress.  The thoughts that you are going to maybe lose your home.  It hangs over you.</blockquote><p>This is a consequence of Government policy.  It is also a consequence of Fianna F&aacute;il policy, going back, in terms of the creation of the bubble.</p><p>The guiding principle of the Government and of the establishment political parties in this country is to ensure the banks are returned to the private sector in order that they can be run for profit in the interests of big business, a process that is well under way.  Therefore, despite being in public ownership, they were given the green light to go after those in arrears with vigour.  Any rules to reign them in or temper their profit maximisation amounted to nothing more than more voluntary, light touch codes.  They were facilitated with the relaxation of the Central Bank mortgage arrears resolution process.  The green light was given to go ahead.  Added to that was the selling off of mortgage books, including residential mortgages, by publicly owned banks to vulture funds.</p><p>We now have 50,000 mortgages held by vulture funds, or 15% of the market.  These funds are not charitable institutions.  I remember the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, talking positively about the role of vultures in cleaning up the economy, etc.  They sum up capitalism, which is red in tooth and claw and merciless in terms of extracting every last single penny or cent of profit.  There is a couple with small arrears whose mortgage was passed to a vulture fund, again quoted in that article in <i>thejournal.ie</i>.  They say that:</p><blockquote>[Th]e vulture fund just keeps on grinding, and grinding and grinding away at you, because they know the ordinary husband and wife don&rsquo;t have the machinery to deal with it ... All they want is to see how many zeros they can add, all at the expense of a family ... They don&rsquo;t make phone calls, they don&rsquo;t do emails, they just keep sending threatening letters in the post.</blockquote><p>If we want to sum up modern-day capitalism and a modern-day banking system run for profit, that is what it is.</p><p>We are in favour of this Bill.  It would shift the balance slightly in favour of the householder and those who hold the mortgages, as opposed to the banks.  It would be a small counterweight.  Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would be completely dismissive of the constitutional argument.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  I would like to think I did my bit to uphold the Constitution.</p>  <p>  More needs to be done.  The vulture funds have to be stopped.  Their mortgage books should be brought into public ownership under compulsory purchase with the sale price as a maximum.  That was suggested by the Master of the High Court.  The sale of State shares in the banks must be halted.  It is a disgrace that it is going ahead in what is effectively a fire sale, handing the banks back to the private sector to pursue profit at the expense of householders and of the economy given the weight of mortgages on the economy as a whole.  Instead, let us use the banks as a public utility, democratically run, which, as part of their role, could write down mortgages to affordable levels.</p></speech>

For people in that situation, their whole demeanour is despair.  They are like ghosts.  They cannot deal with issues.  They close their windows and blinds during the day so no one from the bank can see into the house or see whether they are there.  Many of those who are suffering in this situation feel they are being followed.  They become seriously ill.  I have dealt with a number of households in this situation.  When we did manage to get deals for them like mortgage to rent, it was like a new person was walking in the door.  It was like seeing someone go through grief.</p>  <p>  We have to remember this when we are in discussions and debates.  We are not just talking about 80,000 mortgages in arrears or whatever.  We are talking about real people, real families, real children, trying to deal with probably the most horrendous situation they have ever faced.  These people did not find themselves in this situation because they put themselves in it.  They found themselves in the situation because they lost jobs, because of the crash, incomes went down and they could not afford to pay.</p>  <p>  I will always remember Deputy Joan Burton saying before the 2011 election that if she got into the D&aacute;il she would write down all the mortgage arrears like they did in Iceland.  It worked in Iceland.  They cut all the mortgages down to about 70% or whatever so that people could actually manage to pay them in a changed situation.  That should have been done here.  We gave the banks money for the loss they made on their mortgages and that.  The banks have gained an awful lot out of this.  The Government has supported the banks.  The last people who have been dealt a decent set of cards are those who found themselves in the situation through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  The ECB has instructed the banks to get rid of their distressed loans.  It could be that we will see many of these people facing eviction or notice to quit.  They will find themselves being handed a letter by a sheriff to say they no longer have a home and are to go to the local authority to put themselves on the housing list.  As has been mentioned already, this means nothing to people.  They are homeless.  Earlier, during Leaders' Questions, I made a point about the research study, Investing in the Right to a Home: Housing, HAPs and Hubs, which shows that the housing crisis has not peaked.  It will peak if these repossessions go ahead.  We will have thousands of families coming into homelessness over the next five years if we do not deal with it.</p>  <p>  I support the Bill in principle.  It is trying to deal with an issue and get a resolution for people in this situation.  However, I do not think it will work.  We have to look at the broader issue.  We know that at the moment, there are negotiations going on in respect of Irish mortgage holders with distressed loans from AIB.  They are talking about potentially getting 2,000 properties where the owner qualifies for mortgage to rent and a further 3,000 distressed mortgages that they could actually buy at the rate at which they wanted to sell them to vulture funds.  People would be able to pay back their mortgage according to their means.</p><p>Something like this has to be brought into account.  A similar Bill, the National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017, has gone through Second Stage in the Seanad.  I think it is supported by the Master of the High Court, Mr. Honohan.  Something of that nature, which takes in the broader sense of distress, needs to be considered.  We have proposed various types of resolutions in the D&aacute;il, but the Government just does not listen.</p> <p> If our economy is to move on, people have to be able to pay back what they can afford.  People in 2017 cannot afford to repay mortgages of 2008 levels.  The Minister should work with bodies like the Money and Advice Budgeting Service, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation and the housing bodies to put these structures in place quickly.  We have 12 to 15 months before we will see the banks and the vulture funds moving in heavily on people.  Not too many cases have been before the courts to date, but I think we will see many more over the coming period if a general resolution of this issue is not found.  I appeal to the Government to move on this issue.  I know the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is in talks with Dublin City Council.  The necessary structures need to be set up and need to get moving so that people can go to a one-stop-shop to resolve and deal with their issues with the banks.</p> <p> I would like to know why the housing bodies did not take 3,600 mortgages in respect of which agreement had been reached with the banks for them to go into mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Why are housing bodies refusing to take on mortgage-to-rent cases that have already been cleared through resolution?  I think that should be investigated.  It is an absolute disgrace that someone who has gone through the difficult process of getting some sort of mortgage-to-rent deal then finds that the housing bodies are not taking their mortgages on board.  I will leave it at that.  I ask the Minister to move on the issues I have raised, including the issue of the AIB mortgage holders, and look seriously at the Bill I have mentioned.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on the introduction of this Bill.  I know he has put a lot of work, energy and research into this legislation.  It is timely that it is before the House this evening.  I am supporting it wholeheartedly.  Any efforts in this area must be examined.  I note that Deputy Donnelly, rather than Deputy McGrath, is now present on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I hope the important Bill that Deputy McGuinness and I are trying to introduce, if the Ceann Comhairle - the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's boss - will leave us, will get support from all of Fianna F&aacute;il and not just from Deputy McGuinness.  A great deal of work has been put into the Bill in question, which has been prepared by Ed Honohan and many other distinguished people.</p>  <p>  We have a collective duty to try to ensure the people who have been terrorised and traumatised by this massive crisis can get some breathing space, some hope and some light at the end of the tunnel.  They need to live again.  As Deputy Joan Collins said, people did not bring this crisis on themselves.  They showed the courage and tenacity to house themselves by getting mortgages to buy houses or by securing planning permission and getting builders, thereby stimulating the economy.  They were prudent most of the time, although the banks sometimes gave them too much money.  Those who sought to house themselves were not like some people here who want everything for nothing and want to pay for nothing.  I refer to those who say "can't pay, won't pay".  The decent people I am talking about were stung when the economy crashed badly.</p>  <p>  We have been paralysed here.  We bailed out the banks.  I voted for the bank guarantee.  It was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life and I will regret it until the day I die.  We bailed out the banks, but now they are giving two fingers to families, insolvency practitioners and everybody else.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme has been an abject failure.  There are some very good points in this Bill.  We have had elections in the meantime.  Before one of them, Deputy Burton promised she would do what had been done in Iceland.  When she came in, she got frozen in ice and stuck to the seat.  She did nothing.  She was paralysed.  That is what it was all about.  We have too many promises.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well.  We need to get stuck in here.  We need to allow these people to live again by giving them some sort of help along the way.  These difficulties are causing all kinds of illness and family trauma, including marriage break-up and children in care.  If all of us who are here are worth our salt, we have to sort this out.  Someone has to put manners and respect on the lending institutions that were helped out.  All they see now is profit.  I learned today that an ex-Bank of Ireland man, who received big pensions and big pay-offs here, is making profit out of the miserable and unfortunate people of Africa.  I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath and the people who have helped him, including his staff who did the research.  I am supporting this Bill.  I hope the Government will give it a favourable response.</p></speech>

One of the saddest things I encounter at clinics is when young couples - the boy and the girl in the couple might come to see me together, or on his or her own - tell me they do not have &euro;10 or &euro;20 at the end of the week.  That is the difference between living and not living.  I know the Minister understands this problem because he deals with it himself.  I know he is not isolated from it.  One of the most awful things is that there was a bailout for every big person, but there was no bailout for young honest-to-God couples who borrowed money because they wanted to get on the property ladder.  They got their mortgages and did their best to provide houses and homes for themselves and their families.  If they borrowed &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 to buy the properties they are living in, they were encouraged to look for every penny of it.  The banks could not give them enough.  It is awful that many such people are now left struggling and barely living hand to mouth.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have to make provisions for young people in these circumstances.  We have to legislate and do anything and everything we can.  I do not care what it is.</p>  <p>  The big people who borrowed tens of millions have been sorted.  They went into bankruptcy and came out of it again.  If they have gone back working again, I wish them good luck with that.  I do not begrudge anybody anything.  I want to see the small person being sorted as well.  I want to see young couples being able to live.  People who are killing themselves working should be able to have a little disposable income at the end of the week.  This might involve meaningful and tangible debt resolution that will work having to be put properly in place.  I thank those who have been helping people with distressed mortgages all along.  Some of them have to charge a modest fee so they can try to assist young couples.  It is an important job.  When young couples ring me, come into my clinic or meet me somewhere to tell me their sad stories about how bad their finances are, many of them have written out in black and write the details of the costs that are making things so tight for them.  They have itemised how much it is costing them to educate their children or run their cars.  We have to be seen to do something tangible to help such people.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Michael McGrath again.  I wish them well with this Bill, which I fully support.</p></speech>

Even though it has been discussed all along the way since I first came up here 17 months ago, many people are still in a great deal of trouble.  One's home is one's castle, or it should be.  There is nothing wrong with Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal to set up an independent mortgage resolution office to give people someone independent to go to.  I have no problem in the world saying to the Minister that people have been blackguarded and are still being harassed.  Their phones are ringing early in the morning and late at night.  That is wrong.  I know it has happened.  It is still happening.</p><p>Very recently, a woman who had paid &euro;150,000 towards the mortgage on her house was still forced to leave it.  They did it by giving her &euro;20,000 to get out.  She goes around the town in Kerry and the homeless services are trying to fix her up.  She has two children who have been taken out of the school they are in.  They have no hope of getting back into that school and being with their friends again in the near future.</p> <p> I know another person who owed &euro;500,000 on a mortgage on both his house and his business together.  He has now found the money but the vulture fund to which the loan was sold will not agree to take the amount he owed.  That is wrong.  In another town, a woman and her four children are homeless because she and her husband broke up following the problems they had with their mortgage.  These are sad stories but they are honest-to-God true stories.</p> <p> The Minister said he was worried the banks might not lend to people applying for loans but he must think of the people who are in trouble first, because the banks have been looked after.  The Government owned practically all of one bank but got rid of it as if it was a hot potato.  This Bill is not a bad idea and if the Minister cannot agree all of it he should look at the good aspects of it.  MABS was the only service that could help people in trouble but, sadly, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, recently proposed to reduce the number of MABS offices, which is deplorable.</p> <p> There should be system for people who get into trouble in order that they can remain in their homes.  The local authorities could buy the house and rent it back to them but we must not continue to put people out on the side of the road.  Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill deserves more consideration.</p></speech>

I welcome the measures in the Bill, which go some way towards alleviating the mortgage crisis and offsetting the looming spectre of a new wave of homelessness caused by people facing repossessions of homes they simply cannot afford at this time.  It is hard to believe that, almost ten years after the property crash, we are still talking about this as a substantial issue.</p><p>The Bill makes provision for a number of potential remedies where mortgage holders find themselves in distress.  The NUI Maynooth report, published this morning, makes it clear that we have not yet reached the peak of the housing emergency and that things are likely to escalate over the next five years.  At a time when the Government response to the emergency is to try to portray family hubs as an attractive option, it is vital that measures to help stem further homelessness are embraced and encouraged.  While there will always be a limited number of cases where repossession is actually the best option for all parties, that is, in cases where things are and will continue to be simply unsustainable, for the most part it makes no sense to allow lenders to march people through the courts process in vast numbers every week and force them into homelessness.  Many cases simply require a bit of breathing space for people to get back on their feet following the recent years of austerity and job losses, while many others just need time to readjust to the change in circumstances.  We have all had experiences of people telling us they had experienced ill health or a family crisis that made it difficult for them to get back on their feet.  The Bill provides options which can become a lifeline for people who simply need a bit of breathing space.  There are good options, such as mortgage to rent, but it is incredibly difficult to get from A to Z in that scheme.</p><p>It makes no economic or social sense to turf people out of their homes when, given a bit of time, they can get themselves back on track or be assisted to do so.  The mortgage arrears crisis costs us either way.  If the system continues in its pursuit of repossession orders, society will pick up the cost because the people involved will not have the wherewithal to house themselves once they have lost their home.  Going back and looking for another mortgage is not going to be an option and we all know the length of the housing waiting list.  We either put in place the mechanisms to prevent, as far as practicable, the current practice of constant repossessions or we accept that we pay the price, both economically and societally, of forcing families into homelessness and children into hostels or hubs, with all the heartache and damage that causes to the individuals and to the social fabric of our country.  We already are seeing people going through physical and mental health problems with the stress they are constantly under and all Members can testify to that from the people they meet in our constituency offices.  The children or today's hubs are far more likely to be the disenchanted youth of tomorrow.  We are storing up problems for ourselves if we do not accept the entirety of the housing emergency.  It is not just about a roof over our heads - it is the social aspect too.</p><p>Far too many people pass through our offices who fail to get the solutions that are supposed to be there.  Others are simply looking for breathing space or are pleading with the lender for a little bit more time, only for it to get worse as house prices increase.  This cannot be tolerated in a civilised society and Government has a responsibility not to take a <i>laissez-faire</i>approach to this emergency but tackle it head on in a proactive and urgent fashion.  This Bill provides a mechanism to do that to some extent.  It is not complete but it is certainly very useful.  We have to get past the point of talking about this and actually do something about it and the Bill goes some way towards that.</p></speech>

The market has failed and failed disastrously.  The result is 91,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists and 21,000 families on housing assistance payments, all of which are living from hand to mouth and have not got a ha'penny left at the end of the week.  Thousands are homeless, including 2,700 children living in various forms of homeless accommodation, and we have the unseen homeless, the thousands of people who are couch-surfing or doubling up with friends or relatives.  There are 76,000 mortgages in arrears, 30,000 of which have been in arrears for two years or more.  The people in those cases got mortgages and fell into arrears through no fault of their own when they lost their job due to the recession.  They were cajoled into getting mortgages by the whole system, including the newspapers whose property supplements told them they had to get their foot on the housing ladder.  Now they find themselves in very serious financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  The first thing the Government and this country should do is stop making the position worse.</p><p>What I mean by that is they should stop adding to the problem.  The Government owns Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB and should immediately instruct those banks to stop repossessions and evictions.  No legislation is needed for this; all that is needed is a simple phone call from the Minister for Finance to tell these two banks which we own to stop evictions and repossessions.</p> <p> This would be a good start but we really need the declaration of a housing emergency in law.  Clause (a) of the Government's amendment, suggesting that the Bill might be unconstitutional, is to my mind disingenuous.  The previous Government introduced financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation and this Government extended it only a few weeks ago.  The FEMPI legislation interferes with property rights, and there is a provision in the Constitution which allows interference with property rights in emergency circumstances such as those we have now.  Public service pensions were cut and as those pensions have been noted and adjudicated on by the courts to be property rights, the Government has already interfered with property rights.  It can do so again and should do so immediately.  The declaration of such an emergency would ensure that the other banks could be stopped from repossessing and evicting people who, through no fault of their own, are in financial difficulties.</p> <p> I will briefly outline other measures that could be taken.  The Government could instruct the banks to operate the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The banks are still vetoing this scheme in a disgraceful fashion and that must be stopped.  We must also repeal the shameful provisions in recent legislation that enable vulture funds to evict sitting tenants if they can get 20% more in a sale price because of vacant possession.</p></speech>

With no disrespect to his good self for taking the time to be here, I wish the appropriate senior Minister were present.  It is a manifestation of the Government's lack of seriousness - and indeed, going back to 2011, that of the previous Government - on this very important issue.  I am quite proud to see this Bill before the House.  Listening to some of the commentary from colleagues in the House other than Government representation, I believe it will pass for a Second Reading.  This is vitally important.</p>  <p>  I first got involved in this issue when I established the Prevention of Family Home Repossessions Group in March 2010 and made a submission to the now deceased Hugh Cooney's expert group on mortgage arrears.  We also made proposals to the Oireachtas joint committee on finance at the time.  Many of those proposals are incorporated within this Bill in a streamlined approach to give people real options and put people at the centre of State policy on the family home.</p>  <p>  I find it reprehensible in the extreme that Government has the arrogance in its amendment to suggest that this legislation is in some way not compatible with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  This is fundamentally wrong, it is flawed and I cannot imagine that this advice came from the office of any learned Attorney General.  Rather, the default position when a Government does not like the idea of the Opposition bringing forward legislation that has the people central to its focus is to say it is incompatible with the Constitution of the State.  Article 41 of that very same Constitution, a copy of which I have to hand, states "The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law."  I put it to the Government's Attorney General, whoever is advising it or whoever is manufacturing the objection as being based on law and the Constitution to read this section of the Constitution.  The protection of the family supersedes all positive law.  Surely, a person's home is absolutely vital to upholding this provision of the Constitution.</p>  <p>  Thanks to many colleagues, particularly Deputy Michael McGrath, this Bill is what in effect is our party's fourth attempt to tackle this issue.  This day six years ago, 12 July 2011, I introduced the Family Home Bill in the Seanad, which, once again, the Government of the day, in the guise on that occasion of the then Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, said was unconstitutional, as per the Government's amendment today.  It is a pat on the back by which the Government says it likes the way we are doing things and it is good to have the opportunity to talk about these important issues.  This is rhetoric in the extreme and an insult to the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  When we were dealing with these issues after the crash, in 2008 and 2009, the nation was consumed with the phrase "the systemic nature of our banks".  This may well have been the case in the context of our economy but at what point will we acknowledge the systemic importance of our people to the nation?  That is what the Government then missed and what this Government is missing today.  In the Mortgage Resolution Bill 2013, dismissed-----</p></speech>

Government Members should cop themselves on and go down to a mortgage court any day of the week, wherever it is on, because they obviously have not been there.  I have, as many of my colleagues have, as a Deputy, not a solicitor.  I hope my experience in my profession has been helpful to the people I have met there.  What is going on in our mortgage courts day in, day out, every week in every county, is a shame and a national embarrassment.  Anyone can look up the list: there is not even any confidentiality regarding people's mortgage arrears problems.</p>  <p>  Like Deputy MacSharry, I, together with a former Fine Gael Deputy, Olwyn Enright, in 2009 prepared a report for the social protection committee on this issue as it was arising.  We tried to get implemented some of the recommendations we put forward then.  Brian Lenihan, God be good to him, tried to implement some of that report and other ideas that came forward in other reports before that Government left office.  Some of those ideas still have not been implemented at all.  One is mortgage to rent.  Mortgage to rent is the answer to a huge number of people's problems with mortgages.  There is a huge number of people out there for whom mortgage to rent is the easy and acceptable solution.  It would keep them in their homes as renters and save the State a fortune not spent rehousing them somewhere else.  We must get serious about mortgage to rent.  It does not exist in reality.  It is the answer.  The answer is in front of the Minister of State.  When we researched this in the social protection committee in 2010, it had already been operational in Scotland, so it is not a novel idea.  It has been called for in this country for years and Fine Gael has been completely deaf to it.  I urge Fine Gael Members to go to the mortgage courts, see the stress and worry on people's faces because of this and do something about it.  If the current Government cannot do something about it, another Government must take office to do it because Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently provided solutions, possibilities and hope to those who wish to remain in their homes.</p></speech>

It would also create balance for the first time between lenders and borrowers.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the huge work done by Deputy Michael McGrath on this Bill and to recognise the support from right across the Opposition benches for it.</p>  <p>  Some version of this Bill should have been put in place by the Fine Gael-Labour Government years ago.  I have raised that matter several times.  Deputy Michael McGrath raised it several times.  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised it several times.  This has been raised again and again and again.  Every time it has been raised, Fine Gael has put up the same defence, namely, that we cannot do this because we have to protect the private property rights of the banks.</p>  <p>  When the Government put its hands into people's private pension funds, what of the private property rights of the owners of those pension funds?  When the Government levied taxes upon taxes on people to recapitalise the banks, to pay the debts of the banks, what about the private property rights of the citizens then?  When the Government took the mortgages of homes of tens of thousands of Irish families and sold them to vulture funds from America that were not even paying any bloody taxes on their profits, what of the private property rights of those families?  When it came to the State bailing out the banks and paying down their debts,  there was no talk of private property rights.  When it came to delving into private pension funds there was no talk of private property rights.  When it came to selling Irish families down the river to foreign vulture funds there was no talk of private property rights.  God forbid that a piece of legislation would be introduced in this country that gave some rights to borrowers.  Suddenly, such a piece of legislation is against the Constitution.  We were unable to do anything for the past ten years because of the private property rights of the banks.  What is happening is outrageous and it must be stopped.</p>  <p>  The other spurious position put forward is that this would damage new lending.  As anyone involved in financial services knows, however, one of the things holding up lending is these legacy debts of the banks.  One of the things that is stopping that being cleared up is a decent process with balanced powers between borrowers and lenders.  In his rebuttal of the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, cited the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Fine Gael-Labour amended the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in 2015.  Section 115(A) of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 gives the courts today, under limited circumstances, the power to take away the bank veto, yet when it is proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, suddenly it cannot be done because it is repugnant to the Constitution.  Ten years after the mortgage crisis - every Deputy in this House has been dealing with individuals and families trying to hang on by their fingernails in the intervening period - it beggars belief that the Government maintains the line that it cannot remove the bank veto because of the private property rights of the banks.</p></speech>

I will make a few comments on the debate in a few moments.</p>  <p>  The Government is proposing that the House decline a Second Reading of the Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath because the approach proposed is over-simplistic and risks creating a range of serious negative effects for home owners in mortgage arrears.  The Bill is not fully thought out.  On fundamental issues it would create extensive legal uncertainty and lead to a higher risk of legal challenge, which does not serve anyone&rsquo;s interest.  The introduction of the proposed measures also risks discouraging financial institutions from lending for new home mortgages and negatively affecting our recovering house market and in particular first time buyers.  I appreciate, as does the Government, the genuine concerns that Deputy MIchael McGrath and others have in raising this very important issue.   We are fully aware of the stress experienced by families living with unsustainable mortgage arrears who want to pay their way and keep their homes.  We have all met people in that position.  That awareness underlies the raft of significant measures already taken by Government which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has already outlined, and a high priority is given to these issues in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully engaged, via a range of initiatives already in place and with more on the way, in helping home owners in mortgage arrears to engage with the range of free supports and expertise now available to them with a view to getting solutions in place and, wherever possible, keeping people in their homes.  The Bill fails to take into account the range and impact of measures already put in place by Government, including the end of the bank veto in personal insolvency cases, the significant increase in personal insolvency applications and the new Abhaile services to help those in arrears.  Take up is well ahead of expectations, and the data suggests that these measures are operating successfully.  We expect their impact to continue and to expand significantly over the coming months.  For example, a national information campaign to encourage further engagement with Abhaile and take-up of its services, focusing on the local level, is now being finalised and will be rolled out in the coming months.  This Bill would likely to have a negative effect on the success of measures already in place to help distressed home owners.</p>  <p>  Having considered the Bill, the Department of Social Protection and the Insolvency Service of Ireland - as well as my own Department - have warned that it would impose considerable strain on Abhaile, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and MABS and risks duplicating and greatly complicating their work without useful effect.  Specific concerns raised on the implications for budget and workload and the risk of multiple appeals and legal challenges include some very important differences between the Insolvency Service of Ireland's statutory objectives and those that would be set for the proposed mortgage resolution office by the Bill.  These appear problematic on an operational level.  Most of all these bodies are concerned that this Bill would damage the success of those measures in helping distressed borrowers.  The Minister has already referred to concerns that this Bill, unlike solutions available under the Personal Insolvency Acts, does not deal at all with an insolvent borrower's non-mortgage debts, including any judgment mortgages and risks moving the borrower from the frying pan and into the fire.</p>  <p>  Some of the figures cited on arrears and repossessions in the debate on the Bill give a somewhat distorted picture of the situation regarding repossessions.  That is important because it risks causing further unnecessary alarm for borrowers who want to engage.  Deputy Michael McGrath said earlier that 1,645 civil bill repossessions were issued in the first quarter of 2017.  I am told that the correct figure is 633 bills nationwide in the first quarter of 2017.  That is according to Courts Service figures.  This represents a drop of almost 60% from the rate at peak of the first quarter of 2015.  I want to put that on the record.  Deputy Pearse Doherty and Deputy Michael McGrath both referred to 76,000 to 80,000 home mortgages in arrears.  The Central Bank figure is 76,422 home mortgage accounts in arrears at the end of March 2017.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance indicates and the Central Bank states that there are an average of 1.3 accounts per mortgaged home.  Accordingly the number of homes in any level of mortgage arrears at the end of the first quarter of 2017 is approximately 59,000.  It is still an awful lot, but it is not 76,000 or 80,000.  The data simply does not support the persistent media claims of an impending tsunami of repossessions.  Court repossession statistics are falling steadily and significantly, whether we look at the issuing of new proceedings or the making of possession orders.</p>  <p>  We still have too many mortgage arrears cases, and action to reduce them remains a priority, but the progress made to date is very encouraging.  In stating this I am not by any means seeking to downplay the levels of stress and anxiety felt by people arising from court proceedings.  However, it is important to emphasise that it is absolutely not the case that all or most civil bills for possession issued will lead to possession orders being granted by the courts, or to a borrower who wishes to engage losing their home.  Lending institutions often issue civil bills for possession in an effort to seek engagement with borrowers who have not previously engaged with the lenders.  Very many of these actions result in further negotiations between borrower and bank, ending in an arrangement which allows a borrower to stay in his or her home. </p>  <p>  Mortgage to rent has been mentioned.  Work is continuing to implement further programme for Government commitments in this area.  Further measures being developed by Government include significant expansion of mortgage to rent.  This is a particularly invaluable initiative as it targets those home owners who do not have the financial capacity to support mortgage restructuring or a personal insolvency arrangement.  The review of the mortgage-to-rent scheme was a priority under Rebuilding Ireland and was published on 8 February 2017.  It identified a number of important reforms to make the mortgage to rent process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately more accessible to more households in mortgage distress.  The key changes to the scheme identified in the review include the introduction of flexibility in terms of the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual need of the household, with the property still being considered eligible.</p><p>The property price thresholds for eligibility under the scheme have been increased in line with the acquisition thresholds for social housing generally.  The threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow has been increased to &euro;365,000, while the threshold for an apartment or townhouse in these areas has been increased to &euro;310,000.  For the rest of the country the threshold for a house has been increased to &euro;280,000 and for an apartment and townhouse to &euro;210,000.  The most significant increases are in the more rural locations, which is consistent with market findings.  These thresholds will be subject to regular reviews taking account of the market at the time and will continue to remain in line with the acquisition thresholds for social housing generally.  A significant change is that the application by the borrower for social housing support will be made by the borrower to the local authority prior to submitting the mortgage-to-rent, MTR, application to the housing agency.  This change means that from an early stage, the borrower will know of social housing support, SHS, eligibility or not and if not eligible, will need to focus attention on other options to deal with their debt.  New property valuation procedures will be put in place.  A new communications protocol for MTR will be agreed and implemented to cover communications between all stakeholders and at all stages of the MTR process.  The process by which the necessary repairs to property are costed will also be revised to speed up the process of agreement between all parties.  Changes to the eligibility criteria and other process changes became effective on 27 March 2017 and are already delivering welcome results.  The other changes are being progressed actively.  </p> <p> It remains the Government's priority to ensure that repossession or other loss of the home is absolutely a last resort where all other avenues to resolve the arrears situation have been properly considered by the lender and been exhausted.  The Government is determined to ensure that help is available for home owners in mortgage arrears who want to engage in finding a sustainable solution to their financial difficulties and to continue its work in getting a range of sustainable solutions in place which can, wherever possible, keep people in their homes.  For the many and important reasons outlined earlier, however, I do not believe the proposals contained in Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill are the right solution nor that they would have a positive impact on the situation of the borrowers we are trying to help or the mortgage arrears problem or the housing market.  </p> <p> The number of owner-occupied mortgage accounts in any level of arrears has fallen from 141,639 at the peak in September 2013 to 76,422 at the end of the first quarter of 2017, a drop of almost half.  This is equivalent to an overall drop of approximately 109,000 mortgage homes in any level of arrears in September 2013 to approximately 58,786 at the end of March 2017.  The mortgage account statistics produced by the Central Bank include second mortgages on the same property.  The rule of thumb used by the Department of Finance is that the number of mortgage accounts is 1.3 times larger than the number of mortgaged properties.  The Central Bank also indicates that 120,894 private dwelling home, PDH, mortgage accounts have already been restructured and that overall, 87% of borrowers are meeting the terms of their restructure.  Some 447 applications have been made to the courts under the new personal insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 where creditors refuse a personal insolvency proposal by a borrower which is considered reasonable by the personal insolvency practitioner.  The review appears to be operating successfully and has already been interpreted and applied in several High Court judgments.</p> <p> Uptake on the Abhaile service is well ahead of expectations.  As of 7 July 2017, 8,034 vouchers for free financial legal advice from a personal insolvency practitioner, or a panel run by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, or a solicitor on a panel run by the Legal Aid Board, had been issued by the Abhaile service.  At the end of June 2017 the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, in-house mortgage debt advisers, who are now also part of Abhaile, had helped almost 4,000 borrowers and 1,300 borrowers facing repossession had been referred by MABS mentors for specialist help and advice.  Up to the end of August, Abhaile duty solicitors will have attended almost 500 repossession lists before the county registrar across the country to provide legal assistance to unrepresented borrowers wishing to engage with Abhaile.  Data collected on the 1,565 borrowers who consulted a personal insolvency practitioner under Abhaile indicate that the Abhaile service is reaching its main target group of those in the deepest arrears.  Insolvency Service statistics indicate that two thirds of the borrowers were in the deepest category of arrears exceeding 720 days payment.  For all these reasons the Government is opposing the Bill.  </p></speech>

This is one of the most important Bills that will be debated by this House in this or any term.  The Minister of State's contribution shows how detached the Government is from reality.  He talks about last resorts but unfortunately many people in family homes find themselves in the last resort and are being pushed out of their homes.</p><p>This Bill addresses an issue that is causing huge hardship and stress to thousands of families around the country.  A total of 33,000 mortgages on family homes are in arrears of more than two years and require a specific and measured approach if a resolution is to be found.  The banks have not been treating this problem with the urgency it deserves.  They have paid lip service for years to the issue while busily working themselves back into profit.</p><p>The ordinary people in this country bailed out the banks to the tune of billions of euro and suffered the austerity that followed.  We all believed that part of the bailout was the resolution of the mortgage arrears on family homes with the ultimate objective of keeping families in their homes in the majority of cases.  This did not happen and it is up to this D&aacute;il now to instruct the banks to make it happen and put the structures in place to ensure that it does.  That is what this Bill aims to do.</p><p>This Bill will introduce a mortgage resolution office with the power to make a mortgage resolution order that will be binding on both the lender and the bank, thereby removing the bank veto that has been shamelessly used by the banks to do nothing and maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  I also urge at this juncture that the courts would now temporarily postpone processing court orders on family homes where the lender is making an effort to engage with the bank and give time for a mortgage resolution office to bring a long-term solution to the problem and end the need for repossessions save in the most extreme cases.</p><p>The scandal of the unregulated vulture funds that own approximately 12,000 mortgages in this country must be addressed.  The stress and pressure being visited on families around the country by the representatives of these vulture funds is nothing short of a disgrace.  We must send a clear message out from here today that Ireland is no longer a soft touch for these profiteers and we will protect the homeowners of this country.  We reject the notion that the vultures picking over the carcass of the recession is somehow the natural order of things.  It is not and it will not be tolerated.</p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on his tireless and continuous work on this issue.  Under the current arrangements, there does not seem to be any end point for those in mortgage distress other than the loss of the family home by court order, forced surrender or the so-called voluntary sale.  This Bill proposes that an independent office would be established within the Insolvency Service that would have the final say in respect of the restructuring of mortgage arrears for a family or individual.  It would represent a fundamental change in our current system giving families and individuals some light at the end of the tunnel and the hope that they can enter an arrangement which is favourable to them.</p>  <p>  In the midst of this housing crisis we often get caught up with statistics and drift away from the very real anguish being experienced by the people on the ground in mortgage distress.  The current personal insolvency agreements are simply not working and I note 43% of applicants in the first quarter of this year were rejected because the lender failed to agree.</p>  <p>  We must offer people a pathway to repayment that is realistic and fair.  The establishment of this one-stop-shop to work between the lender and those in distress to put in place a realistic restructured payment package would offer tens of thousands of families some hope that they can retain their homes.  We are creating a vicious cycle by which people are being forced out the front door of their homes and into the front door of their local authority to seek a place on the social housing list for houses that are not there or social assistance through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or the housing assistance payment, HAP.  </p>  <p>  The Government should investigate the possibility of extending the terms and conditions of the mortgage-to-rent scheme to include local authorities.  The level of engagement from housing agencies is not sufficient in any way, shape or form.  I contacted several housing agencies and they all spoke poorly of the current parameters of the mortgage-to-rent scheme and had little interest in engaging with those in distress.  I rang the housing agencies to ask them to take people on in my constituency and they refused, saying they were not interested in the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The Minister of State should consider that and extend it to county councils such as Kilkenny County Council in my constituency, to enable us to have an input and help people in mortgage arrears.  </p></speech>

Currently it is 1 January 2015.  In other words, if a person fell into arrears only in the past two years there was no help for them or their struggling families.  People could not avail of an appeals route if their original offer was refused.</p><p>In addition, moving the date forward to 2017 also allows many struggling home owners who may have gone into arrears in the past two years to access the State's financial assistance scheme for financial advice from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and Abhaile.  The scheme allows those in mortgage arrears to get financial assistance to see the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and solicitors who will be able to advise them on their options.  A major issue is the valuation of the family home.  I welcome the Bill's attempt to reduce the bank's influence in valuing properties by introducing a new mortgage resolution office.  This rebalances the issue in favour of the home owner.  I commend the Bill.</p></speech>

It is instructive that not one Government backbencher came to the House to attend the debate, not to mind speak on it.  Not a single member of the famed Independent Alliance came to the Chamber to make a contribution or even observe the debate that was going on.  I have reached the conclusion that the Government is in denial.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, we had two robotic speeches.  They simply read out Civil Service scripts which seemed to have no meaning or understanding.</p></speech>

I quoted directly from the Central Bank's quarterly mortgage arrears statistics and referred to the commencement of legal proceedings in quarter 1, which was 1,645.  I did not mention anything about civil bills for repossession or Courts Service statistics.  The Minister of State did not know that because he was handed a script by the Civil Service, which seems to be the way the Government operates.</p>  <p>  The message from the Government tonight for the 33,000 mortgage account holders, who probably represent approximately 100,000 people, who are in arrears of two years or more is that those people are in very serious trouble.  There is a completely dysfunctional and unworkable mortgage-to-rent scheme, as Deputy Thomas Byrne correctly pointed out.  There is no safety net for them.  We have all had individual cases where people were taken up to the top of the hill by approved housing bodies, local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government only to have it flop at the last minute.  Repossession orders were put in place and the mortgage-to-rent scheme was pulled from underneath them.  Just over a year ago, the Government made promises.  That is why I was so interested that the Independent Alliance, which made great play at the time, did not even bother to show up.  Where is the new mortgage arrears court?  Not a single mention of it was made in 20 minutes of contributions from prepared scripts by either the Minister or the Minister of State.  Clearly, it is not going to happen.  It is not a Government priority.  There were references to the amendment of the code of conduct to place an obligation on lenders to provide a range of sustainable arrears solutions.  We have had no amendments whatsoever.</p>  <p>  The constitutionality of Bills seems now to have become a very elastic concept and a very convenient defence for Government which has no interest in supporting Opposition legislation.  The constitutional provision around property rights is not absolute.  The Constitution also provides for the common good and contains principles of social justice.  It refers to an "unjust attack".  It is very clear that property rights in the Constitution are conditional and by no means absolute.  In reality, deals put forward through the insolvency process are being rejected left, right and centre, including by banks in which the State continues to hold a very significant shareholding.  People are being forced, if they qualify, to go through an appeals mechanism which never seems to end.  Banks throw endless resources at that by way of barristers, the filing of affidavits and applications for adjournments.</p>  <p>  The Bill is not perfect but it is a genuine attempt by an Opposition party to address a huge issue in our society.  Nothing was said by any Minister in government tonight to give comfort to anyone caught in the mire of mortgage arrears.  I appreciate the support of others in the House and hope the Bill passes Second Stage tomorrow, proceeds to proper scrutiny and sees the light of day with its key provisions enacted as law.</p></speech>

I was proposing to the Minister of State that if we are to be serious about the development of the west, the Government should set up this new Department there.  We have waited for years for something to happen.  The Minister of State knows the people have lost patience.  Something needs to happen very quickly and we need action straight away.</p>  <p>  Banking services are one issue.  In Ballygar, Dunmore, Strokestown, Elphin and many other towns, Bank of Ireland is withdrawing services.  It is withdrawing counter services, which is a huge issue for Government.  The taxpayer bailed out the bank, the State holds 14% of its shares, but it is, frankly, uninterested in rural communities.  A number of business people in those towns have met me and told me, as the Minister of State knows well, that once a bank is taken out, the heart and soul of the town is gone.  That is what the people of Glenamaddy in County Galway tell me and will tell the Minister of State.  The Bank of Ireland is not going to pull back on this no matter how hard we fight it.  The question, therefore, is what the Government will do about community banking.  We need action here.  We need this to move forward.  We need to provide a banking service for the people in many of these towns.</p>  <p>  The lack of investment in the N4 and N5 projects for many years is deeply concerning.  Last year a number of very successful businesses in County Mayo met us in the Minister of State's town of Westport and had one clear message about the state of the national primary route, the N5.  They said their bosses in America and elsewhere were saying they could not continue to do business in Ireland unless the road network improved, in particular in the west.  The Minister of State must admit that when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power, a great deal of money was invested in roads and many improvements were made.  That stopped.  The excuse of the recession could be used for a few years, but there is now more money available.  We must see a plan in place for both the N4 and the N5.</p>  <p>  I turn to the issue of jobs.  We talk about balanced regional development, which was a major point in the programme for Government, but it is simply not happening.  When I go to Ballaghaderreen, Boyle and Roscommon town, I see no jobs being created by the Government.  There have been no visits to the county by the IDA.  No debate is going on to bring jobs to these regions.  Broadband was the subject of many promises.  Several deadlines have already been missed.  I will not go into that because I want to give my colleagues time.  Companies are crying out for better broadband.  A few months ago in my town, a firm the Minister of State knows well had to be bring its business to the town of Mullingar to email material to Sweden.  That is how bad it is.  We must deal with situations like that.</p>  <p>  In the previous Government, a number of Ministers did not like the idea of decentralisation to any other part of Ireland.  While there were difficulties in some parts of the country, decentralisation was generally a success.  It needs to be back on the agenda.</p><p> The revaluation of property is a massive problem.  The Minister knows it.  In many towns throughout the country, the revaluation of property is in some cases reducing the rates debt on a business but in many other cases it will put them out on the road.</p> <p> There is a huge number of issues.  Take towns such as Ballinasloe.  Galway city is bursting at the seams while Ballinasloe is barely holding on.  There is no development there.  Nothing is going on.  Why are we not suggesting or proposing to bring some businesses or Government services to towns such as Ballinasloe?</p> <p> I will now pass to my colleagues, Deputies Cassells, Aindrias Moynihan and Troy, as I do not want to take all of the time.</p></speech>

In his statement earlier today, the Minister said the Bill had just one purpose, which is to establish the Department and to confer a name.  However, it is so much more in terms of its resonance in every single aspect of rural life, for which the Minister has a huge gr&aacute; and appreciation.  I want to explore that here today.</p><p>There was a huge amount of debate earlier today on rural Ireland.  People spoke about attacks on rural Ireland and what needs to be done to save rural Ireland.  Listening to some of the contributions earlier this morning, there was a variance of views on how to accomplish what everyone was supposed to be talking about.  There was even a suggestion that we could save rural Ireland by building a stadium in the west of Ireland, as if one physical edifice would save it and that this would be all encompassing.  It missed the point totally.</p><p>I contributed to the Oireachtas committee on rural affairs when it came to Athboy where I have my constituency office.  We spoke about what was needed in terms of a strategic approach.  The national strategic planning framework is extremely important because of the focus on planning.  People think that my home county of Meath is a big and populated county where everything is going well and everything is great but we are living in a two-tier county.  All the development is happening in the south of the county on the Dublin border but the recent census figures show that there has been depopulation in the north of the county.  In the town of Oldcastle, one of the thriving market towns of the past 50 years, the most recent census figures show there was depopulation.  Everything that the Deputies in the Chamber are speaking about in terms of why services then go, whether they be banks or other commercial services, is determined by where the population centres are located.  My point is that if the planners, who nearly act like mini-gods, are given the opportunity and<i>carte blanche </i>to centre our populations in certain regions, it will put in train a scenario for years and decades to come in which these towns die because they are not being repopulated.  That is why I am adamant that if we do not get this particular national planning document right in terms of giving counties a chance to survive - and I mean the entire county and not just the greater Dublin area, which is where the focus seems to be - it will kill them in the years to come.  We have to give those counties an opportunity.</p><p>In terms of co-ordination of services, I recently met communities in Ballinabrackey and Castlejordan in the south of County Meath.  Those towns are right down on the border with County Offaly.  They could not be more isolated from my home town of Navan and it takes nearly an hour to get to them.  Their nearest Garda station is in Trim, which is 40 minutes away, yet one could cycle a bike to Rhode just across the county border.  They feel isolated in terms of the co-ordination of all State services, be they Garda, hospital or fire services.</p><p>Another aspect is child care.  It is a hot topic in this Chamber but it has an impact in respect of the Minister's Department as well in the context of supporting the existing facilities in our counties.  No disrespect to the services that are operating in the west - the best of luck to them - but when I consider counties such as County Leitrim, which is very well subsidised when it comes to the provision of child care services, and then consider my county, which has a population of 190,000, the capitation figures bear no resemblance in terms of the pressures that they are under.  We need to consider all these things in the whole and not just consider what are viewed as traditional rural counties.  As I said, we are now developing a two-tier county in my native county of Meath, where the provision of services in the north of the county is more aligned to that in Cavan.  Then we consider the south of the county, which is coming within the greater Dublin area.  It is not a healthy situation and we should not allow it to be fuelled or developed.  It is striking that there can be depopulation in what is supposedly one of the commuter counties.  The only thing that will address it is to make sure these counties are given a fair crack in this planning document.</p><p>If the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is allowed a free rein on this and unless the Minister's Department and other Departments place a heavy hand on it and say we want an Ireland that exists outside of the greater Dublin region or we will overheat it, we will kill all the services in the other areas.  The decisions that will be taken on this critical document could be the ones that kill communities and commercial services for years to come.  I appeal to the Minister not to let the Custom House have a free hand on this.  The county development plans have now become subservient to the regional plans and the regional plans will be subservient to this.  If the Custom House is allowed to run this through roughshod, it will kill the rural Ireland we all know and love and towns such as Oldcastle in County Meath will not have a chance because of these decisions.</p></speech>

In the interests of rural communities, we need his Department to be successful and to be able to take on the many challenges that rural communities are facing including issues such as the rural road network, which is crumbling in many places.  Will the Department be responsible for rural broadband, for example?  We need to see the national broadband programme advanced.  Rural communities are faced with declining services right across the board.  These include basic services such as access to general practitioners, while post offices, shops and petrol stations are being closed and schools are under pressure for teachers.  Will the new Department have ownership of or be in a position to deal with these issues?</p>  <p>  Will the Department take responsibility for rural enterprise and, for example, the Leader programme?  Many farmers such as beef and sheep farmers are struggling to make a living without direct payments.  Populations in rural areas are declining.  GAA clubs are struggling to put together teams and are being forced to amalgamate.  It is clear that there are many pressures on rural communities.  Will the Department have the responsibilities and the resources to take on these challenges?</p>  <p>  The last Government did away with the Department, which was fitting given its anti-rural Ireland bias.  It is good that there has been a reawakening or a Damascene conversion.  I hope that this is not just a token gesture and that there is substance behind it.  We have seen our fourth rural Ireland plan in 33 months and we need delivery on it in the interests of those communities.  We need the Department to take a leadership role and to implement the necessary actions.  Will these different responsibilities be transferred from the other Departments to that of the Minister or will they remain part of the current Departments with the Minister running between them trying to put a rural Ireland blas on each of the actions?</p>  <p>  Maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaolainne agus Gaeltachta, t&aacute; na Gaeltachta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la amuigh faoin tuath agus t&aacute;id ag brath go l&aacute;idir ar cheantair tuaithe a bheith beo agus br&iacute;omhar.

It is a positive development that there is a re-establishment of this Department.  It was a regressive and a wrong step by the previous Government to do away with a Department with responsibility for rural and community affairs.  Will the Department be adequately funded?  What will its budget be for the year?  Is it a simple matter of the Taoiseach having gone around to the various Departments, taking a bit from here, there and everywhere and putting it into the Minister's Department?  Will the Minister have real powers?  Will he be adequately funded?  Will he have control over broadband and mobile phone coverage?  If one drives around any parts of County Westmeath nowadays, the mobile phone coverage is worse than it was ten years ago.</p><p>We talk about the need to have broadband in rural communities, but in some of those communities, such as Loughnavalley and Ballynacargy, there are blackspots where telephone coverage drops every day.  The Minister must examine that.</p> <p> The post offices are another issue.  We are told the Minister walked away from having responsibility for the post office network because he did not see a future for it and did not want to be the bearer of bad news.  As a result of various Ministers shirking their responsibilities for the post office network over the past 12 months, we are now 12 months further on from putting in place a sustainable plan for the majority of our post offices.  The Irish Postmasters Union admits that, unfortunately, some post offices will close.  Bobby Kerr has also confirmed that.  However, a substantial sum of money must be invested to ensure others do not.  I urge the Minister to use his position to ensure the Kerr report is implemented in order that we have a sustainable network into the future.</p> <p> Commercial rates were mentioned earlier by other speakers.  They are not under the Minister's direct control.  However, we are discussing a sustainable rural community.  The Government launched the plan for revitalising rural Ireland in Ballymahon a number of months ago.  In that same week the revaluation of commercial rates was notified to the businesses of Longford and Westmeath.  People in Granard, Ballymahon, Moate, Mullingar, Ballynacargy, Castlepollard, Kilbeggan and elsewhere were notified of increases of up to 400%.  That is unsustainable and unreflective of the business they are doing in their respective businesses.  A pause button must be pressed.  We must state this will not take place and a new way of calculating rates will be introduced next year because people are worried they will be unable to pay their commercial rates.</p> <p> I will conclude with a question.  How will money be allocated?  I thank the Minister for supporting the provision of a playground in my old school in Ballynacargy recently.  It was fortunate to get it.  Another project in Westmeath was supported too.  I am told Westmeath got 20% of the funding that Mayo received.  The Minister is a good man for delivering funding to Mayo.  I say "well done", as the Minister is a constituency representative like the rest of us.  However, there is more than County Mayo in rural Ireland.  It also includes Longford, Westmeath, Roscommon and Meath.  Other Deputies have spoken about their respective constituencies.  We want to see fair play.  The Minister should not abuse his position for the betterment of his county.  Of course he wishes to invest in his county, but he should not do it to the detriment of every other county.  He should live up to the commitment given by the Independent Alliance to restore the local improvement schemes.  Two budgets have been produced but the local improvement schemes have not been restored.  The Minister must ensure they are restored in the forthcoming budget, because they are critical for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Being a west of Ireland man, I am delighted he has taken on this role.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Everyone knows we must revitalise rural Ireland.  As the economy begins to recover, we must ensure the benefits of that recovery are experienced by all our citizens, including people in rural Ireland.  We must ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach in delivering this.  As stated in the programme for Government, we must ensure balanced national development is achieved.  The means to achieve this is by creating sufficient scale in the west through the Atlantic economic corridor.  We must develop the necessary infrastructure to attract jobs and to create an environment whereby we can keep people living and working in their local towns and villages and on their family farms.  There must be a co-ordinated approach.  We must have what I describe as infrastructure-led development.  We must have proper road infrastructure, broadband, rail networks, airports, water, sewerage and rural transport.  They are all key components in the development of balanced growth.</p>  <p>  To achieve all this for rural Ireland, we must ensure rural Ireland remains at the top of the agenda.  In establishing a dedicated Department, we are not just paying lip service to this but beginning to keep rural Ireland at the top of the agenda.  We will now have a Minister who will have a dedicated team - a captain and a team - to lead rural Ireland to full recovery.  I live in Galway East in rural Ireland.  People are delighted to be living there and are very proud of their roots, but we wish to ensure more people can live there and that people who are suffering in overcrowded Dublin, as has been mentioned by other Deputies, are given an opportunity to live and work in rural Ireland as well as join our football and GAA clubs.  That will ensure rural Ireland is a vibrant place in which to live.</p>  <p>  Ireland is the talk of the world in terms of our green grass and scenery, but we must also ensure it is a place in which people can live in comfort.  I look forward to the establishment of this Department.  Since his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ring has brought a great deal of infrastructure and investment to rural Ireland.  He has done some of the job.  As an Independent Alliance Member, I am proud to be here and to be part of a Government that is bringing rural Ireland to the top of the agenda.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Ring, the best of luck and I look forward to working with him.  I realise there will be difficulties in trying to achieve everything we want to achieve, but working together as a team we will try to achieve it all.</p></speech>

However, we believe there would be better policy coherence by having rural and Gaeltacht development policy centred in one Department.  Therefore, we have tabled Committee Stage amendments to provide for adding the Gaeltacht portfolio to the new Department.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il established the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with the senior Minister having responsibility for rural affairs, the Gaeltacht and the islands.  However, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government abolished the Department in 2011 and, only after pressure, assigned rural affairs to a Minister of State.  The new Taoiseach has decided to break up the rural Department set up in 2016 by splitting rural development from the Gaeltacht and the islands and putting the portfolios into two Departments.  This is very poor judgment and illustrates the knowledge deficit of the new Taoiseach on rural Ireland.  Once more, it shows that Fine Gael does not understand the policy challenges facing rural parishes countrywide and continues to give preference to development in fewer locations.</p>  <p>  Representing the constituency of Waterford, I deal with rural and urban issues.  The difference between both are immense, given the difficulties with broadband, services, roads and isolation.  Rural Ireland has suffered profoundly.  Investment and job creation opportunities have been disproportionately focused on large urban areas.  The result has been the erosion of community life in rural areas as people are forced to relocate to support their families.  This in turn has put enormous pressure on housing in areas such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other areas of dense population.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has long recognised the need to revitalise rural Ireland.  This formed a key part of our general election manifesto and we focused on it during the talks to facilitate a minority Government.  The confidence and supply arrangement contains a clear commitment to develop new community development schemes for rural areas.  It is important this is acted on without delay.  The Government must make it attractive for people to live in small towns and villages.  I come from a small town with a population of approximately 2,000 people.  There must be investment in general practitioner services, rural schools, broadband and other key services.  In addition, the IDA must increase its efforts to attract jobs to rural areas, as this is the only way we can revitalise our towns and villages in the long run.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to building an Ireland for all, where the fruits of recovery are felt throughout the country and with more regional balance.</p><p>In the confidence and supply arrangement to facilitate a minority government, Fianna F&aacute;il extracted policy commitments on rural Ireland to be implemented over the Government's term.  We have been successful in having some of these commitments partially implemented, including the re-establishment of the CL&Aacute;R programme, expansion of the rural social scheme and reversal of the 2012-13 farm assist cuts.  Much more needs to be done, however. </p> <p> I will address the broadband issue first.  It is shocking that more than 500,000 rural households and businesses will have to wait until as late as 2024 for State intervention to deliver moderate speed broadband.  The national broadband plan was first launched in 2012 and the litmus test of its success will be what additional new funding will be ring-fenced for it.  It was interesting to note on the RTE programme, "Ear to the Ground", how a community in Clashmore came together as a result of the lack of broadband.  People in rural areas are sick of waiting for broadband.  A west Waterford community that tackled the issue head on believes it has stumbled on a blueprint that other communities could use to get connected.  West Waterford Community Broadband started in 2011 from an online conversation between a small number of local techies.  It is now a successful, locally run broadband scheme that is solving the connectivity issue for more than 100 families in the Clashmore and Kinsalebeg area of west Waterford and the number is growing.</p> <p> As a result of the community not having a clear vantage point to cover its scattered settlements, it was not well served by broadband services.  However, a committee did the research and its members climbed ladders.  Thanks to the arrival of increasingly powerful, cheap and relatively easy-to-use wireless technology, it started to make the connections that linked up the region and is now providing services equivalent in reliability and cost to those available in adjacent towns.  The scheme is working well and shows at first hand the versatility of people living in rural areas and community spirit coming to the fore.</p> <p> Security is also becoming an issue for rural dwellers and the West Waterford Community Broadband scheme has some users with dedicated cameras who issue email alerts when movement is detected by the cameras.  Initiated in response to the failure of a commercial provider in the area, the community-orientated service now aims to operate alongside other operators, providing a service to those who are not well served while maintaining choice.</p> <p> Another issue that rural dwellers are very concerned about is the closure of Garda stations in small towns and villages.  People miss the local garda, the comfort of knowing he or she is living in the area and interacting with him or her.  The closure of rural Garda stations has had a real impact on rural communities, with many people left isolated by the lack of a visible Garda presence in their towns and villages.  Again, communities have fought back by setting up community alert groups, working with the Garda and informing friends and neighbours of suspicious activities.  Restoring a strong Garda presence in rural Ireland must be a priority.</p> <p> Small rural schools need to be protected and nurtured.  All too often in small communities, the two or three-teacher school is the focus of the old community.  Parents were educated in these schools and want their children to be educated in the same school.  Pressure is too often put on families to enrol their children in more modern, larger and shinier schools with newer facilities such as interactive white boards and plenty of other supports.  However, in some cases the small village school is the hub of the community and we need to support such schools as much as we support other schools.</p> <p> The recent strike in Bus &Eacute;ireann brought into sharp focus the absolute dependency of rural areas on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  People living in Dublin and other cities are spoiled for choice.  They need only walk out their front door to find taxis, buses, bicycle lanes, the Luas or the DART.  This is not the case in rural Ireland where people are dependent on Bus &Eacute;ireann to attend hospital appointments, visit family and friends, shop and collect their pension on Thursday or Friday.  Fortunately, Local Link, a rural bus service, has stepped in and identified the gaps and routes not covered by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The quality of the service the organisation provides cannot be underestimated.  As a member of the board of Local Link in Waterford, I commend the drivers who operate the service.  They collect older people from their homes, often on laneways that are inaccessible to larger buses, and bring them home after a couple of hours.  They often carry passengers' shopping into their homes.  This is an example of the value of rural Ireland. </p> <p> Agriculture is the beating heart of rural Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to securing a fair price for farmers' products, ensuring the future of the family farm model and introducing a fair and transparent inspection regime.</p> <p> I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to his new role.  While Fine Gael has been great at talking the talk on supporting rural Ireland, the time for meaningful action is long overdue.  I hope this new Department, with the Minister at its helm, will start to deliver action and in that regard I wish the Minister the best of luck. </p></speech>

I am sure his knowledge of the current state of rural affairs will prove invaluable in his new role.  Alas, given the deliberations to date and being aware of the contents of the Bill, the Minister's duties, powers and budget are reminiscent of those of a junior Minister.  The Taoiseach is not taking seriously the Minister's portfolio.  Many more powers need to be assigned to the Department.</p><p>As a rural Deputy, I am aware of the deficits that are fast accruing in rural areas.  While the upkeep and sustainability of rural Ireland need not be solely dependent on substantial funding provided by central government, rural areas must be given their fair share of funding.  The Minister must acknowledge that prior to the abolition of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by the previous Government, the Department's annual budget had reached &euro;410 million.  While I accept that expenditure reductions became necessary in the intervening period, the substantial increase in Exchequer spending in recent years has not been reflected in a <i>pro rata</i>increase for the Department.  This is a reason to seriously doubt the Government's commitment to rural Ireland.</p><p>As I stated, deficits are fast accruing in rural areas.  One of the main reasons is the unfair competition from larger urban centres.  The common denominator is the roll-out of broadband services.  If broadband were rolled out to rural areas as quickly as it has been rolled out to cities and major towns, the sustainability of rural areas would improve and rural populations would increase.</p><p>Over the years, rural areas have lost post offices and creameries as a result of globalisation.  I will not make an issue of the closure of Garda barracks.  Rural areas want their community garda&iacute; back because they were not replaced when Garda barracks were closed.  Instead, more Garda patrols were provided and while I acknowledge that the availability of patrol cars is great, no one knows the garda&iacute; in them.  As the Minister has stated over the years, community garda&iacute; were good because they gathered knowledge, kept people in the community informed and kept people safe.</p><p>It is sad that local development companies have been shredded.  I served on the board of Ballyhoura Development, a local Leader company, for many years.  I saw the great work it did in a rural area where it funded enterprises and village projects.  Alas, other villages that are trying to catch up are finding there is no money available for village renewal and similar projects. </p><p>I ask the Minister to ensure his remit is broadened to make his role more powerful in order that he will have a say in other Departments which also have a role in rural affairs.  The Minister climbed the rungs of the ladder but the cart did not follow the horse.  The problem is that the cart has been left behind.  While I acknowledge his role and appreciate his elevation, the Minister has not been given the power and remit required to perform his functions to the best of his ability. </p></speech>

However, when one considers the portfolio the Taoiseach has decided to allocate to him, it is clear he would have more power if he were a Minister of State without portfolio floating around various Departments.  Henry Kissinger once asked who he should call when he wanted to call Europe because he did not know.  Who do I call when I want to talk about rural broadband?  Not the Minister, Deputy Ring.  Who do I call when I want to talk about rural post offices?</p><p>Not the Minister, Deputy Ring.  Who do I call when I want to talk about rural roads?  Not the Minister, Deputy Ring.  Who do I call when I want to talk about rural Garda stations?  Not the Minister, Deputy Ring.  Who do I call when I want to talk about most rural issues?  Not the Minister, Deputy Ring.  That is at the heart of our reservations about what the Taoiseach has decided to do.  This is a matter for him and the Government.  Presumably, it was not something to which the Minister adhered.  The Taoiseach decided it, but that is the problem.  As Deputy O'Keeffe stated, the Minister's portfolio is too narrow.  He has the smallest budget of all Departments and its work is confined to particular areas.  A significant opportunity to tell rural Ireland once and for all that its issues are being addressed properly has been lost because of a misunderstanding of what is required.</p> <p> This Department is just a hodge-podge of issues.  The Department's budget and the number of lines it will have are extremely small.  It will have the Leader programme and the Dormant Account Fund.  It might have the Western Development Commission.  It will have the town and village regeneration scheme, which is pitifully small.  The Department will have so little.  The Minister is not really the Minister for rural affairs.  He is the Minister for a small number of rural programmes.  That is the problem - the Minister does not have the necessary clout.  As another Deputy called it, he is the Minister for paper clips, or at least rural paper clips.  They literally are paper clips in the overall scheme of Government spending.  I mean no disrespect to Deputy Ring and we are delighted to see him at the Cabinet table.  I am sure that he will raise a voice, but when it comes to rural broadband, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has responsibility.  The same applies to post offices.  Famously, Deputy Ring did not want them.  All of these issues should be within one Department so that there can be coherence in strategy and someone to deal with those issues that affect rural Ireland and impact on people's lives.  Most people in rural Ireland will look at this and point out that they cannot avail of Leader funding, for example.  They need rural broadband, they need to use their post offices and they need to ring their local Garda stations but none of the areas that have been allocated to this portfolio apply to them.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's Committee Stage amendments will go some way towards addressing that issue, but there must be a broader vision.  The type of vision that Fianna F&aacute;il offered in the previous election, in fact.  I remember Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v enunciating it clearly on television during the little bit that I watched.  I believe that it was during a debate in County Mayo or somewhere like that.</p></speech>

I should know it - my wife is from near there.  We enunciated that vision of what rural Ireland should be and how Government policy should react to it.  After the election, it was the most fashionable item in political jargon.  Everyone was running around claiming to be for rural Ireland this and rural Ireland that, but when the time came, a hodge-podge of a Department that did not work was created.  Everything was put into it.  It is now being split, but it still will not work or address people's concerns and needs.  More work needs to be done.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, needs to make the case to the Taoiseach to change the set-up radically as regards how rural Ireland is dealt with at Government policy level because what is happening at the moment is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister personally.

We know him as someone who has a great commitment to his community in Mayo, the west coast and all parts of rural Ireland.  He is a tremendous worker on the ground and is well respected across party lines for that work and his delivery for constituents in Mayo.  He will do a wonderful job in the Cabinet.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, has done since May 2016.  I worked in that Department alongside the new Minister, Deputy Ring.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, worked hard on an array of responsibilities and has been the voice for rural Ireland in the Cabinet for the past year in the role that the new Minister will now play.</p>  <p>  Some Deputies discussed the abolition of the previous Department.  In 2011 and in light of the need to split the Department of Finance into two Departments and two Ministers, given the workload and the economic crisis that the country faced, and the Government's commitment to establish a new Department of children and youth affairs, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was subsumed into other Departments.  In 2016, I took part in the negotiations with Independent Deputies on the formation of the Government.  Some of them are present now.  We had long days in Government Buildings discussing a programme for Government.  Clearly, rural affairs and issues were to the fore in those talks and in the subsequent commitments in the programme for Government.  If the Minister and I are granted responsibility in the new Department, we will seek to implement that programme and ensure that we have the funding necessary to fulfil the commitments that were made as part of those discussions.</p>  <p>  Now that just one Minister is serving at the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, it is right that the opportunity be taken to put on a senior level a full Ministry of rural and community development.  That is what this is about, namely, ensuring that the Government puts its efforts into developing rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na ruda&iacute; deasa a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ar maidin maidir leis an r&oacute;l a bh&iacute; agam mar Aire St&aacute;it na Gaeltachta.

The Taoiseach also realigned Government committees; he has reduced the numbers and given them a broader reach.  That is reflective of the issue of rural Ireland.  While we will have commitments to rural Ireland in this Department, rural issues reach across every Department.  Every Department plays a role in regional and rural areas and every Department also plays a role in urban areas. <font color="#FF42F9"></font>The Taoiseach will be chairing those realigned committees and the Minister, Deputy Ring, will be sitting in on issues of rural affairs which will encompass issues of education and health and issues that come under the remit of other Departments.<br/><br/>The Minister pointed out earlier that all the responsibilities of this Department have not been fully finalised.  We know the nature of what we will be getting in this Department but more responsibilities may be transferred over time as things are sorted out.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is not practical, as some have suggested when talking about rural Garda stations for example, to have a Minister with responsibility for rural education, rural health, rural justice or rural transport.  There can be sections, but there has to be an overarching Ministry for justice, education, health and so on.  The role the Minister, Deputy Ring, and I will have will be predominantly in the responsibilities we are given but we will also have an overarching role as a voice in Cabinet to disagree with or fight against proposals that may come from other Departments.  We will also work with them to push forward the agenda within the Department.  I see the Minister, Deputy Ring, as having a key role as a voice in Cabinet and also within the committee structure to address the important issues that arise in rural areas, which we have all come across, in terms of regional balance.  It has been commented on and I agree with a lot of what has been said.  I have said this before when we have had debates.  A Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Kenny a number of months will go to committee and be discussed.  There was a lot of commonality that we agreed on in that situation.  I am sure the Minister will be participating in the committee discussions on that as they arise.</p></speech>

All Deputies in rural Ireland have the interest of rural Ireland at heart and none more so than the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring.  I appreciate that amendments have been tabled and there will be votes and all of that, but I hate to think there would be any delays in establishing this Department before the summer recess.  There is no point talking about not having funds for rural Ireland if we are going to stop a Ministry from being established for rural Ireland so we have the Minister there fighting over the summer for the budget to put in place for the plans we have.  There is scope in this D&aacute;il and new politics for suggestions to be made about things that can be done.  We are interested in hearing them.  We are interested in hearing any coherent arguments on what we can do to improve rural Ireland.  There is a lot going on in rural Ireland and much that is positive.  It has become fashionable for certain people to talk down rural Ireland and say it is in decline.  It is under pressure.  Many areas of the country are under pressure.  It is under pressure from urbanisation because 50% of the population lives in Leinster.  That did not happen overnight.  It did not happen in the past five years.  It has been happening continually.  It happens across the world where there is a change and where people move from rural to urban centres.  It is a pressure that many cities and countries face.  It is about ensuring we put in place the infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I agree with everyone who talks about the importance of broadband and how crucial it is.  It is great to see in my townland and many others in my parish of Moycullen that eir is rolling out broadband with a commitment to the Government contract; there will be State fines if it does not roll out broadband to 300,000 houses.  It is ongoing and extra customers are being connected to fibre broadband in homes in rural Ireland.  There are positive things taking place.  As Minister of State, the Minister said we should look at schemes such as local improvement schemes.  There have been reductions in roads budgets.  It came up during the Government formation talks and even though there have been increases in the last two budgets, road infrastructure for rural Ireland is under pressure and it needs more investment.  We will continue to fight for it and it will be one of the things we will be looking at.  </p>  <p>  I am looking forward to the challenges ahead and working with the Minister, Deputy Ring, and Government colleagues to push forward the case for rural Ireland.  I hope the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2017 will be progressed today through the House and through the Seanad tomorrow so we can get the Department established.  When we do that, we will see what extra functions, responsibilities and budgets we get to ensure we invest in improving the lives and opportunities of people in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

My experience since I came into the D&aacute;il tells me they will be passionate and fair to people.  While many of my comments might suggest I do not think that way, my heart is in rural Ireland and its community.</p>  <p>  The new Department of community and rural affairs is a positive move.  There is no doubt it is what I fought for as a community representative and as a person who worked my way up from the community to my local council and from my local council to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I always spoke about the desperate need for a stand-alone, senior Ministry for community and rural affairs.  My problem is the budget and the role of the Minister.  I am very worried that the budget will leave the Minister's hands tied.  We need to know the Minister's brief exactly.  There are huge issues of concern to rural Ireland.  I will touch on a number of issues where changes might be made.  Hopefully the Minister and Minister of State will have a say on these issues.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will be the Minister to lead a change from the current position we are in with the Leader programme.  The destruction the former Minister, Phil Hogan, caused to the Leader programme and to the community groups that were depending on Leader funding is quite unacceptable.  We have been in the new programme since 2014 and the changes we were all concerned about are coming to fruition.  There is little or no funding which causes devastation to rural communities.  I know plenty of rural communities in west Cork that have lost heavily.  We were unlucky enough to lose &euro;2.4 million in our budget in west Cork, undeservedly so because we had projects far in excess of &euro;2.4 million.  It cost organisations like the Ballydehob community hall which had new projects ready to roll.  Unfortunately, the projects all had to stop, leaving them with their plans in tatters.  The West Cork Development Partnership and probably other partnerships spent years developing west Cork and every bit of blackguarding that could have been done was used to get rid of them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200061#LLL01300"><p>Why was that?  I will tell the Minister why.  It is because they told the truth.  They said this new Leader programme would be a shambles and it is nothing short of a shambles.  The Minister has an opportunity to turn this around.  I do not think he can do so in this Leader programme.  The Minister can look at the future because this one is almost in tatters, so much so that we can say it is gone.</p><p> When negotiating the programme for Government, a senior Minister told me that if a Leader company were not willing to carry out Government policy, it would be punished and the ones in west County Cork certainly were.  It has been very costly to our community down there and we have yet to recover from that.  They had built many community projects and we were commended throughout Europe on the roll-out of our programme.  Sadly, that has been set to nothing because basically they were swept off.  The reason for that is that they stood up to the Government and said that the new Leader programme would be a shambles, and it turned out to be so.</p> <p> I hope the Minister will be strong enough to bring back the community voluntary forum, which is rarely mentioned here.  It was a great organisation from the ground up.  This was another casualty at the time of the Phil Hogan Bill to get rid of the bottom-up approach.  This is what the community voluntary forum did.  In west County Cork, two people were democratically elected from Bantry, Skibbereen, Bandon and Clonakilty, as would have been the case in every other county.  They brought forward issues of concern in their communities.  Assuming it is in the Minister's brief, I hope he takes the opportunity to overturn this decision.  He should bring back more of the ground-up approach.</p> <p> Does the Minister have the power to overturn the abolition of the town councils?  In the D&aacute;il recently, I mentioned Clonakilty which still continues the mayoral town council even though it was shut down as were the ones in Bandon, Skibbereen and Bantry.  Such communities should be commended on what they do.  We should be looking to put them back on the map again.  These were excellent working town councils that were pulled down.  I hope the Minister will consider overturning that decision.</p> <p> However, it is not all bad news in rural Ireland.  I do not want to paint that picture because many good things are being done but the community is driving that and is finding it increasingly difficult.  If the Minister is serious in his role, he will overturn some of these disastrous decisions that continue to cost communities dearly.</p> <p> Yesterday proved it is not all bad news.  Yesterday, I took time off from the D&aacute;il to go down to the Blue Horizon in Garretstown for the launch of a new bus service.  It is the first bus service for the people in Kinsale, Ballinspittle, Kilbrittain, Timoleague, Clonakilty, Butlerstown, Lislevane, Ring, Grange and Courtmacsherry.  This was funded by TII and while it might not come under the Minister's brief it is a great rural initiative.  All local tourism groups sat down with TII.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has to be commended on this also.  We now have a seven-day service running five times a day in an area never previously serviced by a bus.  There was great excitement with 100 people there in the middle of the day to welcome this new service.</p> <p> This is thanks to the TII and Local Link.  I believe Deputy Butler mentioned Local Link and I hope some of this comes under the Minister's brief.  An invaluable service is provided by bus drivers and the management of these companies as well as the volunteers on the boards.  I am a deputy chairperson and Neilie O'Leary is chairperson.  They are volunteers.  I never took anything for being on the board of Local Link because I know it delivered for rural communities.  I hope the Minister can further enhance that in his role.</p> <p> In order to measure an improvement in rural Ireland and whether things are turning around, we need to look at the census.  Sadly, when I look at the census, I do not see any improvement for rural communities.  The population in many parts of rural Ireland is still falling, spelling disaster for local GAA clubs which have to turn to neighbouring communities.  At one time they were massive opponents of each other and now they have to join hands to build clubs with sometimes two or three parishes together.  That indicates to the Minister the seriousness of the situation and the importance of the Ministry he holds.  I know he is passionate, but passion will not do because we need much more than passion to steer us through this.  We need more determination and someone to overturn some of the wrong decisions that were made.  It can be done.</p> <p> How can people say there is a recovery?  If there is, it is in Dublin at the expense of rural communities.  When the Exchequer got squeezed, rural Ireland was the first to suffer.  We know well why this happened.  We lost our banks.  We lost the bank in Schull-Ballydehob.  The nearest bank is 30 miles away which is an incredible inconvenience to any community.  How do we expect a recovery in a rural community if the vision it taken out of that community?  In the past few weeks we have been told that there will no longer be a counter service in Dunmanway, which is another kick in the teeth to rural Ireland.</p> <p> We lost our Garda stations.  I know Stepaside had the luck of a decision being overturned.  Maybe we can step aside and look at Goleen, Adrigole and Ballinspittle which had their Garda stations closed.  Goleen Garda station, which was the most south westerly in Ireland, is now gone.  We are worried about our post offices.  Will the Minister, Deputy Ring, be the person we should speak to about our post offices?  That is very much a rural issue.</p> <p> The embargo on local authority workers is a huge issue in rural Ireland and is costing rural communities.</p> <p> While I know the Minister, Deputy Ring, is not the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we have seen the way grain farmers have been treated.  This week they had a sit-in in Agriculture House.  We need a Minister such as the Minister, Deputy Ring, to stand up and fight around the Cabinet table.  I hope he can take that on.</p> <p> Everybody wants to talk about broadband.  In one community in Kinsale, 75 houses are without broadband, which is very unfair.  I ask the Minister, Deputy, Ring, to step up to the mark on broadband.  We are hearing further bad news on it.  We do not need to hear bad news; we need to hear positive news.  The only way to overturn that is to get the community involved in the roll-out of broadband.</p></speech>

If the Minister wants to get something done, he should get the communities involved in the roll-out.  It can come under the Leader programme, as is done in other European countries.  There are many other issues I could speak about here, including the cuts to the ambulance service that are affecting rural Ireland and the 24-hour accident and emergency department in Bantry hospital, but I have to give Deputy Harty his chance.  I am very sorry for cutting into his time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200062#MMM00400"><p>I welcome the creation of the new Department of rural and community affairs.  Following the negotiations on the programme for Government last year, the Rural Independent Group was very disappointed that we did not get an independent Department to look after rural affairs.  I am very happy that with the change of leadership there has been a change of attitude in that regard.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, is to be congratulated and he is a very appropriate person to look after such a Ministry.  He is embedded in rural Ireland and understands the difficulties, as we all do.</p>  <p>  I hope he gets an adequate budget.  I know he will have to fight hard to do so.  He will also have to fight hard to get proper responsibilities for his Department.  I hope other Departments do not land him with all the unpleasant elements they are trying to get rid of.  I hope he will be strong enough to resist that and take on proper rural and community development responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Some 60% of farmers in Ireland are over the age of 50 - one could almost quote the same statistic for GPs.  Certainly we have an ageing population in farming, which is the backbone of rural communities, towns and villages.  Teagasc has identified that 40% of farms will not be viable in the future, which is a huge problem for rural Ireland.  I hope the Minister will be able to address that and give supports to farmers so that they can continue to provide the unique quality food we produce.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have enough people who see a future in farming, which is a huge problem.  A large proportion of our young farmers will discontinue farming in the next decade.  We need farm diversification and innovation to give them the opportunity to continue farming in their communities.  We have a huge problem with rural depopulation, which has a significant impact on the services our small towns and villages have.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for taking the time to listen to me earlier.</p><p>I know he understood what I was saying.  Huge areas of rural Ireland are facing annihilation in the next generation unless we do something about it.  The census figures are quite frightening.  In County Clare, the population increased by a number of thousands but when one analyses that and drills down into it, one finds that the population in rural areas is declining rapidly.  People are moving into the county towns and moving out of the counties into larger urban areas.  Rural parts of rural counties are declining but the figure is hidden in the gross population of the county which might not be changing significantly.  People are moving into towns and out of rural communities.  That must be addressed.</p> <p> As I said to the Minister earlier, the movement of people from rural communities is putting pressure on urban areas.  Cities are bursting at the seams.  They do not have the services to deliver for the increased population.  I accept that jobs are being created in urban areas and people are moving there, but the services are not there to sustain the population so we really do need to have balanced regional development.  Rural depopulation is not just a problem for rural Ireland it is also a problem for urban Ireland.  I hope the Minister can get a handle on that.  I know that he realises rural Ireland has a lot to offer.  It just needs a little bit of support.  It is not looking for a handout; it is just looking for support for rural communities to maintain their services.</p> <p> I spoke to the Minister today about a rural population rejuvenation scheme.  I hope that is something we can develop in the future, whereby we can take people from high-pressure housing areas and relocate them on a voluntary basis if they wish to have a change in their quality of life.  It would allow people to move from a situation of endless housing lists in high pressure areas, out of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, and become part of a rural community, support rural communities and services and give them a better quality of life.  We propose that rural communities would come together to give supports to people not just to bring people to rural areas and abandon them, but to bring them to a receptive, rural community that would look after them and allow them to become part of the community, thereby supporting schools, post offices and services.</p> <p> Many speakers have mentioned broadband in the context of rural Ireland.  It is disappointing to see that the tendering process for broadband is now being put back until probably 2019.  That is a huge disappointment.  The mobile phone service in rural areas is appalling and the road structure is crumbling.  I know the Minister understands that as well as I do.  Rural transport services need to be supported and developed.  In County Clare, we have a wonderful service called Clare Bus.  It is part of the Irish Rural Link service.  It is a lifeline for people, especially those with disabilities, those who are disadvantaged and people who suffer from rural isolation.  It is a fantastic resource, but it needs to be supported so that the service can be developed to provide rural transport to other areas of the county and not just the north and east.  People are seeking to develop services but they do need infrastructural support.</p> <p> I will briefly refer to rural GPs.  The Minister would be disappointed if I did not.  I know he understands that medical services in rural areas are under severe pressure.  We need to stimulate the development of rural general practice and bring in a contract that is flexible, and which will attract people to work in rural Ireland.  This is not just a problem for rural Ireland; this is a problem being experienced throughout Europe.  There are innovative ways of dealing with all of those problems, including rural GP practices, that have been developed in Sweden, Scotland and in the west of France - all the areas where there are similar difficulties - to attract and maintain GPs in rural communities.</p> <p> We need to develop a community air ambulance service because of the difficulty in getting people in isolated areas urgently to hospitals.  A proposal has been put to Government to develop a community air ambulance service which would be deployed within minutes and would bring seriously ill people or those affected by trauma to their nearest casualty department in a matter of minutes as opposed to hours, which is the case currently when one must wait for an ambulance to collect the patient and then travel back to the hospital.  I know the Minister understands that as well.</p> <p> We need to support services such as local pharmacists, public health clinics and post offices, but I will not go into detail on post offices.  Rural schools and rural services must be sustained and developed.  The focus must be on retaining people who live in rural communities.</p> <p> We need to develop community housing services for rural people who live in isolated areas.  I know the Minister is familiar with the development in Mulranny.  We have a similar one in Kilmihil, which was stimulated by looking at Mulranny.  We need to look after elderly people and allow them to live out their lives within their community with support in community housing developments, which we must develop because there is such a huge demographic change in Ireland at the moment.  We cannot have people going into nursing homes unnecessarily and also blocking up hospital services.  We must be able to bring people back into the community as soon as the acute treatments are delivered in a hospital setting.</p> <p> Deputy Michael Collins referred to the Leader programme, which is a huge issue in rural Ireland.  The funding for the Leader programme has been cut and the bureaucracy that is developing is making it unworkable and unsustainable.  In County Clare, a total of &euro;6,000 has been allocated in the past year because the level of bureaucracy and audit activity has made the system unworkable.</p> <p> A cross-departmental approach is required for the new Department.  The Minister might act as a signpost for people in rural communities to access services from other Departments because a cross-party integrated approach is needed.</p></speech>

It is absolutely right in terms of the allocation of resources that the Government has decided to have a Minister for rural and community development.  It is one of the most important challenges for the country so it is appropriate that the area has a specific Minister in Cabinet and a Department to get it right.  All the other speakers are correct in their identification of the weaknesses and not having a budget ready and perhaps not having all the roles and powers clearly defined, but the Minister's job then has to be an important strategic one.  It must be to engage in the national capital plan immediately.  That is today's job.  It is not for tomorrow.  It is an immediate priority.  The Minister must be involved in the national planning framework.  That is today's work.  It is critical.  I reiterated on many occasions what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said previously that it is probably the most important project that this D&aacute;il has to get right in the long term.</p>  <p>  The Minister has a major role to play in the national climate dialogue which we need to start.  Rural Ireland will be at the forefront of the discussion and it will be to the great benefit or rural areas if we get that right.  Whatever about the Minister's budget and his direct powers over particular line functions or operations within the State, I encourage him to get involved at a strategic level and to make sure that there is a strategic vision for rural Ireland which is inputted into those big key strategic decisions we have to make.</p>  <p>  The Minister will not be surprised but some others might be, that my advice to him is to go green for rural Ireland.  It is the best bet and the best strategic future.  I wish to outline a few reasons that is the case.  People in rural Ireland and the Green Party have had differences in the past.  Sometimes we made the mistake that we could have done a bit more listening and a bit less talking down to people and not admitting we do not know everything.  On the other side people possibly mischaracterised us by saying all we were interested in was stag hunting and what not.  That is not a true and fair reflection of either side.  We need to start again.  I hope the Ministry will allow us to do that because in order to have a thriving, vibrant, culturally rich, dynamic rural Ireland, green is the way to go.  First, it is the way to go because in order to have a vibrant community one has to create wealth.  It cannot just work on the basis that there are resources in Dublin and that they are being diverted to rural areas.  There should not be a split between the development of cities and the development of rural areas.  The two can and must combine together.  It is a false divide.</p><p>It is said there is a divide between the Green Party and rural Ireland.  Those who pitch it as a divide between urban and rural Ireland are doing a huge disservice to both.  It is just not true.  Scratch a Dub and there will be a country person underneath the surface.  I was down in Kerry last Sunday and will be in Kilkenny on Monday.  I am off to Inishbofin in two weeks' time.</p></speech>

It is part of what I am.  I am a Dub but I am connected to rural Ireland in a way that is real.  We all are, and it would be foolish to make a false dichotomy.</p><p>The success of Dublin will help rural Ireland because it will give us resources that we can deploy.  However, rural Ireland has to stand on its own two feet and thrive.  We have to create wealth in whatever strategic direction we take to become really properly long-term sustainable.  The reason going green will be the path to success is that there are four areas of the rural economy which can thrive by doing so.  The first is the area of food and agriculture.  It has to be low carbon and it has to be sustainable.  We cannot abdicate.  We cannot have the rest of the world taking on this incredible, momentous challenge while Irish agriculture says: &quot;Sorry, count us out, we are an exception.  We do not have to have the same targets as other people.&quot;  That is not the clever way to go.</p><p>I met an interesting group of people in recent weeks.  They were over here looking at what is happening on the ground.  They were looking at farmers in the south east, in Kilkenny and Waterford, who are working with Glanbia in some of the latest farming practices.  They were dairy farmers but the practices could be applied to other types of farming.  They were absolutely green in their thinking.  These were top range farmers; these guys were precision farming.  They were really paying attention to grass growth, nutrients in the soil and the water system.  They were really scientific in terms of measuring every corner of every field to figure out what was happening in the field, when to cut, when not to cut.  They were reducing their inputs and getting better outputs.  The really attractive thing about it was that they were working collectively in teams of 15.  It was creating a local rural community of farmers talking to each other and sharing really precise information.  </p><p>There is a great green hero, a German SPD politician, Hermann Scheer, who was a champion of this whole new clean energy, low-carbon economy.  His book, <i>The Solar Economy</i>, written about 20 years ago, has as its absolute centre point the idea that the farmers are the front line.  They are the heroes in this transition that we have to make.  There is absolutely a bright economic future for Irish small family farms.  A friend of mine who works in this area goes off to China every now and then to look at what they are doing.  They have 15,000 to 20,000 cattle in one four-hectare lot.  The Danes, the Dutch and others have gone that route and it does not work because it is capital-intensive and the farmer is left with the vagaries of market changes and prices.  We should go for high precision, intense green farming and not just depend on the big international milk markets or try to compete against the Dutch or the New Zealanders, who trashed their country by taking the wrong, low-green or no-green route.  We should go the other way.  We go for high price, high quality, precision farming.  Dairy is particularly suitable and we can see where it is viable and there is a way forward.  It will be more difficult in beef, sheep and other areas, but there are other aspects of farming to which we can open up.  Horticulture will have a crucial role.  We need to start connecting Irish communities back to local farming so that we are not just buying all the &euro;0.39 squashes from Lidl every week or looking for whatever is the cheapest of the cheap.  We need to start valuing having connections between farmers and local communities across this island.  That is the way to go.</p><p>It is a future in which farmers are the heroes of the green movement because they are the ones who are keeping the carbon in the soil.  They are the ones who are providing flood management solutions.  Critically, the Minister should be working with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to ensure that they are the ones who get paid for protecting biodiversity.  This row over cutting hedges and hedgerows is nonsense - we should be seeing it as our strategic advantage that we have bird wildlife and protect biodiversity and treat the whole of our land in a really careful way.  All of us, rural and urban, have that in us.  </p><p>Going green in food and farming is what we need.  It also requires a certain intelligence in forestry.  We cannot cover the country in monoculture, clearfell, 35-year cycle coniferous forest.  We have already seen in places like Leitrim, Ballingeary, and C&uacute;il Aodha how people have said &quot;No&quot; to that.  They found the whole place was just getting covered in forest and getting blacked out.  That is not the way we want to go.  As part of this land management plan, we want to go for really high quality, continuous cover forestry, but unfortunately this takes a longer life cycle.  We are talking about a 70 or 80 year return rather than a 30 year return.  The price the farmer will get for timber in the end - it will be his children or grandchildren who will get it but we need to start thinking in this way - will be a multiple of what he would get for the low-quality timber from a fast cycle clearfell system.</p><p>Continuous cover forestry also creates a local environment that is wonderful.  This brings us to the second key wealth creating aspect of rural Ireland, namely, tourism.  They are all connected.  If we get this right in terms of protecting biodiversity, it will support tourism.  I know something about this.  I worked in the sector for 15 years and my whole life was bringing people around.  They came to Ireland for a sense of connection with something wonderful in our landscape as well as the welcome of the people.  I could see it and I could sense it.  I knew when it was working.  It was good for people's health and souls when they got to rural Ireland and had a sense of wonder about the place.  To get that, and to give and share it, we need to protect the wonder of the place.  It comes with continuous cover forestry in a way that it does not with the dense, dark, nothing-beneath-the-canopy forestry that we have planted to date.</p><p>In this national plan, which is for the Minister, Deputy Ring, to influence, we are going to have to look at large sections of the land which are not as high yielding in grass, particularly, and in agriculture.  We need to recognise that a large part of the north and west of the country is closer to parkland than intense agricultural land.  We should pay people for developing and protecting every aspect of that so that it becomes a greenway.  I see a potential greenway.  The Wild Atlantic Way is a greenway from top to bottom.  We should start connecting up all the greenways in a really ambitious, creative way so that one part of the country does not get ahead of the other.  Every part of needs to be included.  We need six greenways in Dublin.  I am campaigning for them at the moment.  We need the same in Connemara, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal and right the way up the north-west coast, down to the south-west coast and along the east coast as well.  Tourism is by nature a green industry.  People are not coming here to see motorways.  They are coming to see a boreen and a connection to their vision and image of Ireland, which we have to maintain and provide.  We should have high-quality infrastructure; let us not do all the branding around Origin Green but not actually deliver it.</p><p>The third area is energy.  This is where we will create employment for rural Ireland.  It is a different energy system.  It is a distributed system.  It is one in which rural Ireland has real potential.  We have an incredible growing climate.  We cannot use that growing material for burning in power stations but we can use some of the food plants for advanced combined heat and power, CHP.  We can get farming communities working together in a community way so that they are not only working out the precision management of their grass, but also how to share waste material and other resources to produce anaerobic digestion.  We must also work together so that there is community ownership of solar power, which is the next development.  Rather than the big solar farms, big developers, big money, quarry banks and whatnot coming in from Australia, pumping money into big projects - this is where the Minister, Deputy Ring, needs to work with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to deliver it - the first step is to get every one of those dairy farmers set up with solar panels on the barn, house or creamery roof so they are the ones who are starting to benefit from it.  They have demand for it straight away in their cooling systems.  </p><p>One-off housing in the country is going to be specifically fitted for this energy future.</p><p>One of the difficulties with an electric vehicle, to take that as an example, is how it can be facilitated in an apartment block or a row of terraced houses if there is no easy way to put in the grid connection.  Rural one-off houses are perfectly placed for us to fit in an electric vehicle.</p></speech>

They do not prove to be as economic.  The reason they are large is because that tends to be more economic.  They could be owned by the community.  Then we could start to make connections.  If people know that their electric cars are run from a windmill in their locality, they will start to make connections.</p></speech>

More rural houses should have electric car connections.  As electric vehicles start to be suitable for longer distances, their range will not be a problem.  If the oil-fired central heating in such houses were replaced with heat pumps and proper exterior insulation were put in place, and if the people in those houses were using electric vehicles, we would start to have high-quality housing that is part of the green solution.  We need to have that sort of ambition for every single Irish rural house.  Such houses should be properly insulated and should have electric vehicle charging points.  People living in one-off rural houses have to drive.  The electrical systems in such houses should be connected to the local power supply.  It is important for people to see their own local power supplies.  All of this is doable.  It is not pie in the sky.  It is already happening in smart countries that have a bit of strategic vision and leadership, which is what we need.</p>  <p>  The last, but not least, of the four areas in which employment can be created is in the digital transformation.  Everyone else has spoken about the need for broadband.  I might reflect on the other side of the equation, which is how that broadband should be used.  I was distraught last night when I heard the Minister, Deputy Naughten, say he does not want be involved in "another PPARS or another e-voting machine fiasco".  I do not know whether those words were written by the Department or by the Minister.  I fear they were written by the Department.  I suspect that people in the public administrative system have developed such a fear of any innovative digital application that the lesson is "whatever you do, do nothing".  Public servants are advised not to take any risks or chances with the development of the use and application of digital technologies.</p>  <p>  I knew the bank in Schull very well.  I knew the people who used to manage it.  I regret very much that it is gone.  I regret that the position is the same in Goleen, in all points in between and in pretty much most of west Cork.  We have to turn that terrible disadvantage into an advantage by developing new mobile banking applications and the latest and smartest modern technology to replace the old bricks-and-mortar system, which will not come back easily.  We have an opportunity to develop a really advanced financial and banking service for rural Ireland, probably through the post office system.  I would like it to be a public banking system.  I met people from the German Sparkasse group today.  They have been knocking on the door here for three years.  They have the most intelligent banking proposal going.  It is vital for the development of rural Ireland.  Its simple key premise, on which none of the other banks can deliver, is that the deposits raised in a certain region or local community should be reinvested and loaned into that same local area.  These guys are professional bankers.  They go back to the sort of banking I knew about, where the local manager had a good knowledge of his local people.  That sort of modern, inventive and innovative application, which is based on digital solutions, can help us to move to a public banking model with high technology capability.  It is well suited to the world we live in today.  Such strategic plans are needed.</p>  <p>  If the Minister, Deputy Ring, does one thing in his new job, which does not have a huge budget, he should take the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, aside and sit him down with the German bankers I have mentioned.  Their model can apply here.  Irish people like S&eacute;amus Boland of Irish Rural Link have been working with them for the past two or three years.  That one project alone would transform the rural economy.  I will explain how this can work.  It is important to appreciate that we are not just talking about rural areas; we are also talking about the development of towns.  Deputy Harty said that towns in County Clare are booming and doing well.  I would suggest that some are and some are not.  I know them reasonably well.  They are not doing as well as they could.  I will not refer to Gort because it is in County Galway.  Is Kilrush booming?  It is not.  We need Kilrush to thrive.  It is a beautiful town, with typically stunning 19th century architecture and a stunning location.  Why is it not thriving?  This is about the towns more than anything else.  If all of these digital systems are ultimately to thrive, towns like Kilrush need to have the best schools in the country.  I am sure Kilrush has one of the best schools in the country.  I have no knowledge of the school in question.</p>  <p>  Every one of the towns I am talking about needs to be a centre of excellence.  The children in those towns should go to the best educational establishments that can found.  A bit of scale is needed if that is to be possible.  Bigger schools give kids a certain chance.  They meet more people.  They have different subject choices.  There is more of a mix, which is something that is needed as part of the education system.  I think we need to get that right.  The towns of rural Ireland need to be developed.  We need to get people back living in the towns.  I understand that no one is living on Main Street in Schull.</p></speech>

It should be full of young people in cheap housing.  Last but not least, I want to echo what Deputy Collins said.  If the Minister does one other thing in addition to making changes with regard to public banking, I suggest he should grab the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, and not let him go until he agrees to the creation of district councils.  They could be voluntary.  I suggest the Clonakilty model should be applied across the whole country.  I do not know where the Clonakilty border stops.  There should probably be some border point between Clonakilty and Timoleague or Rosscarbery.  There should be no gaps.  We need to get away from the 19th century concept that the town stops on the edge of the town.  It does not.  The town probably stops five or seven miles out.  We should create district councils for every single town in the country.</p></speech>

This is doable.  It is up for play.  I ask the Minister to achieve two or three of the things I have suggested.  They do not require a budget.  They just require a bit of vision.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Eoghan Murphy, and others need to be convinced that this is the way to go.  If the Minister takes this approach, he will get widespread support in this House, particularly from the Green Party, which is all about the development of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's appointment and wish him well.  I know he is a rural Deputy.  He was very active when his constituency colleague was flying around the world doing business.  He was looking after the house at home, which is very important.  When the farmer goes to the mart, someone must look after the cattle and the sheep at home.  The Minister did this efficiently.  He was made fun of on &quot;Scrap Saturday&quot; and by Oliver Callan on many occasions, but he did what he needed to do.  He was there.  I heard about him from all the people in County Mayo.  Various people told me that he was always a ground worker.  I know he will fight in the Cabinet alongside his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne.</p><p>The members of the Rural Independent Group have met representatives of For&oacute;ige, which was on its knees three or four days ago.  I raised the matter here last week and I spoke to the Minister yesterday.  The Minister delivered in his current portfolio and I thank him for that.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis.  For&oacute;ige is a wonderful organisation that does the work we are talking about this evening throughout the country.</p><p>I was very disappointed when I read the script delivered by the Minister this morning.  He said that &quot;this Bill has just one purpose, to establish the new Department, confer a name upon the Department and to provide for a Minister who will be in charge of the Department&quot;.  One would think that such simple language could be understood by baby infants.  However, the next paragraph was worrying:</p><blockquote>It is important to note that the Bill does not confer any functions on the Department.  The new Department's functions are still being finalised and these will be transferred at the earliest opportunity following the enactment of the Bill.</blockquote><p>There lies the problem.  The Minister knows that I am very pro-life.  I will not get into that here.  When a couple is expecting a baby, it is lovely.  They find out whether it is a boy or a girl and they choose a name.  If the baby goes through the full gestation and is delivered safe and well, everyone is happy.  Then there is a christening.  When are we going to have the christening?  When are we going to hear about the other functions?  We are breaking up for the summer holidays on Friday.  We have no idea when this will happen.  Where is the commitment from the Government?</p><p>As my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and others have said, we made it clear at the Government formation talks that a full Minister - an Aire for rural Ireland - was very important to us.  It was talked about, as other people have said.  The media ran with stories on it.  We were very disappointed when we got the hind tit, if the Chair will excuse the language.  She knows what a hind tit is.  A cow has four tits.  It might have a hind tit.  It could be a dry one as well.  We would call that a d&uacute;id&iacute;n.  It would be useless.  It was a hind tit Department.  That is what it was.</p></speech>

However, it has no budget.  It has a name, but it has had no launch or christening.  That will not even be considered.  I am worried that this is tokenism on the part of the Minister.  We fought hard for this.  We were promised one thing by the Taoiseach during the talks.</p><p>We were promised that this Government would be different.  He could not form a Government and has retired, God be with him.  He said he would change the permanent government, the Civil Service, and make it reflective of the new politics.  He did not do that and it seems it cannot be done.  I hope the new Minister does it.  I hope he brings in hand-picked people who are prepared to do the stuff for Ireland, not talk about it.</p> <p> Deputy Eamon Ryan had a conversion regarding rural Ireland a few weeks ago when he met farmers.  He should know that the vast majority of farmers are good farmers.  They mind the land and husband it well, as they do the environment.  I served in government with the Deputy when they took away our car parking at the back of this building and now we cannot park anywhere.  They put grass on it and we have to pay a fortune to rent a space.  I would not mind if they had put sheep or goats on it but it is grass, which has to be mowed and maintained.  These are silly things.  When I brought forward a proposal for a water recycling project in rural national schools using roof water for toilets and washing the yards, the former Minister, John Gormley, would not hear of it.  This was a simple project.  A very innovative group came to me and said they could put such systems in schools for approximately &euro;12,000 and it would have given a great education to children in the school, but he was more worried about stag hunting and other things.  One day I said to him he would stop the cat chasing the mouse.  That Government became silly.  Projects could have been done but were not and they have not been done yet.  We need to educate our young people, though they will educate us anyway because they are good on the environment and with issues like litter and Tidy Towns, etc.  We should not be talking about bringing water to Dublin when 48% of it is leaking from pipes.  That is another attack on rural Ireland.  We take everything from rural Ireland and give the rubbish dumps back to it.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke about moving the Red Cow to Skellig Michael but we have to do something about it.  We need a road project to sort it out.</p> <p> We must let the permanent government know that rural Ireland exists.  We are a proud, vibrant people but we cannot take any more knocks.  We have been knocked and kicked and bureaucracy has strangled us.  We are like a man who has fallen into the water and cannot swim out - I cannot swim, by the way - because bureaucracy is dragging us down in every area.  Deputy Ryan said he was all for building houses in rural Ireland but I did not find that when he was in government.  I welcome his conversion because we have to build houses in rural Ireland.  I have dozens of young couples who want to build houses on farmers' lands and have bought sites.  They have the money and the courage, the vision and the passion to settle down and have a family and their own home but they cannot get planning permission and people are going to the cities where people are forced to sleep in little hovels.</p> <p> The policies are there but the planners are getting more powerful all the time so nothing can be delivered.  The Minister has to bring in his own doers, of which there are some in the Civil Service.  We had the voting machines and other scandals, other hare-brained ideas from experts which I railed against at the time.  When their expert proposals flop, however, they are not heard of.  As Deputy Collins said, one should always ask the community or a busy person, a duine gn&oacute;thach.  If one wants something done in Ireland, one should ask the community and voluntary associations, which I am proud of and all of which I can list - from Canon Hayes of Muintir na T&iacute;re to the ICA, from which 55 good women are coming tomorrow to visit our Parliament.  We must try to keep the work they do and the values they instil because they hold things together.</p> <p> There is also the scaremongering about, and attacks on, the church on account of the baptism rule.  The Government has failed utterly to provide enough places but it suits it and others in here to attack the church on account of the baptism rule.  It is a fallacy peddled here and by people in the right-wing liberal media.  It is fashionable to bash the church but we did not build enough schools.  There are playschools and na&iacute;onra&iacute;.  I was chairman of a committee that set up a na&iacute;onra, which is still employing 21 people and looks after families from 20 or 30 miles away.  It is a voluntary company limited by guarantee and we went through hoops to get funding from Pobal.</p> <p> This Government has no real interest in rural Ireland and the Bill has serious deficiencies.  The Minister might address concerns about whether the North-South bodies, the Gaeltacht, the rural social scheme, T&uacute;s, farm assist and rural transport will come under his remit.  Will they or will they not?  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  Will we have a bus?  What will we have?  It is all a fiction.  The Government announced it in a blaze of glory but there is nothing.  The Minister is busy in his constituency but I do not know what he will do in the portfolio.  Will he have an office or a secretary?  Will he have anything to do until the statutory instruments or ministerial orders are moved.  We are buying a pig in a poke.  It is like buying a lucky bag in a shop when we were ladeens, buachaill&iacute;.  We were glad if we got something good but disappointed if we got an old tumbler or something.  The Bill is nothing but a sop to appease the people of rural Ireland and to pull the wool over their eyes.  The wool has been pulled up now, though, and they found the Government out after the actions of the former Minister, Big Phil the Destroyer, who is now off on a rich pension in Europe or playing golf in Kerry.</p></speech>

He destroyed town councils, urban councils and borough councils and bulldozed our two communities together in Tipperary by merging two constituencies into one.  Tipperary was divided by the British because they could not rule us and we were unruly.  We are a proud people and are not looking for anything with a b&eacute;al bocht but we want to be allowed to breathe.  The Government destroyed the Leader programme - a fine model which was set up all over Europe.  It was the envy of Europe and a model everyone wanted to use but the Minister's colleague, the former Taoiseach, told me there was trouble in the Leader programme in Mayo.  There may have been one or two bits of trouble but not with the vast majority of programmes.  They were all volunteers, as Deputy Collins said.  I was an initiator of the rural transport scheme in Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary and I never took a cent for going to meetings, nor did any other board member.  They are still doing it and I salute them and the other volunteers who are running this country.</p>  <p>  The Government destroyed the Leader programme and not a cent was spent on it because the county councils wanted it.  They are now seen as the regulatory authority but they should never have got Leader because Leader was a bottom-up scheme.  The people le ch&eacute;ile, the duine &oacute;g and the duine aosta everywhere, worked hard.  They had the ideas, the passion and the vision and did not want to be stifled by the county council taking over the Leader programme, but nothing is happening now.  I often stood in fields and villages and 7.30 a.m or 10.30 p.m. with Leader officials but one would be a long time waiting to get a council official in a field or an office, even at 8 o'clock in the morning or 4.30 p.m.  The Government hijacked it and banjaxed the programme.  Now the wheels have fallen off the wagon and nothing is happening in Leader.</p>  <p>  There is a flight of GPs, such as Deputy Harty, and a problematic age profile but the Government is not looking.  There is a 40-year old GP contract but the Government will not renegotiate it, instead expecting people to work in Dickensian buildings and with little or no support.  I salute the GPs.  We opposed the scheme for free GP services for children aged under six in Tipperary because we predicted it would cause bedlam and there has been a 40% increase in people going to the GP.  It is not because they are really sick but because they can get the service for free and that is silly.  Nothing is free.</p>  <p>  They community air ambulance was a fabulous community group which wanted to help bring people to hospital, to prevent cases such as that of the poor unfortunate man from Waterford who was being driven to hospital but died in an ambulance in Dungarvan on the way to Cork.  We have a community air ambulance scheme but the HSE does not want it as it is an irritant.  The Government forced through the children's hospital in Dublin and it was a monumental scandal to build a hospital in that location when there was a magnificent site on the M50 which would have allowed people from all over the country to have access.  The decision will haunt us all for the rest of our lives.</p>  <p>  The Government is trying to stop people supporting themselves.  They might not see it but the hands of bureaucracy are like the handlebars of a bike - one needs a hammer and a chisel to get them off.  I am tired of saying that.  I have no disrespect for the officials who are here and I thank them for being patient with us as we rush this stuff through before we go out, but the permanent government has to be dealt with.</p><p>The Taoiseach promised that, but it has not happened and it must happen.</p> <p> The Government has a rural action plan in respect of which 4,000 projects have been submitted by communities, only 40 of which will be allowed to proceed.  The former Taoiseach announced this in Glenamaddy or Longford somewhere.  He talked about this road and that road.  I said it was like the four roads of Glenamaddy with Big Tom but we had no guitar and no song because we had no money.  People have filled out these application forms and gone through the first selection process, the expression of interest process and reams and reams and there is nothing to give them.  The money the Government allocated for the 4,000 projects would not buy a stamp.  These people want to do it.  The Tidy Towns groups all applied, delivering local development companies into small villages, all accountable to Big Brother and the men watching them.  We spent two hours one night at a Ring a Link rural transport meeting trying to account for a &euro;20 underspend.  That is with the arduous rules and regulations regarding accountability, and rightly so.  There is no fraud or misappropriation of funds going on there but there may be with the big boys, the banks, even the charities - the whole lot of it.  I saw one of our retired bankers today in the paper.  He is now terrorising the people in a different country, in Africa, laughing all the way to the bank.  We see this every day of the week.  The people who want to do the work will not be left to do it.  The Government is like the dog in the manger.  They will do the work but the Government will not let them do it.  The Minister knows this well and I do not want to be critical of him.</p> <p> I do not even want to go near broadband because I am a very good friend and colleague of the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  However, I believe he is sadly being deluded and codded because broadband has got worse.  We hear of so many houses a minute getting fibre broadband.  I do not know how many minutes there are in a year but that is a lot of houses.  I have been sick of announcements here since the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, of which I was a member, then the Labour-Fine Gael coalition and now this Government.  Announcements and timelines are given.  I do not know why the Ministers come in here and read them out because they know they are all dubious and con jobs.  We are told Eir and some other company are getting the work.  Let the community people do it.  They will do it honestly, quickly and, as I said, fairly.  It is not fair that people have no broadband, whether it be a student doing his CAO or a farmer trying to claim his single farm payment.</p> <p> Regarding the mobile phone service, when I came to the D&aacute;il ten years ago I could get on the phone in my village and stay on it the whole time until I got up to the D&aacute;il.  Now I cannot.  It has got worse and worse but we are being peddled the story that everything is so good and so rosy.</p> <p> As I said, the Tidy Towns groups do work and have initiatives.  If the Minister gets the reins, the money and the portfolio, I know he will do the work.  However, I have a funny feeling that perhaps someone did not want him to get into the Cabinet.  I wish him well on his appointment as a full member of the Cabinet but he will be like an empty vessel, unfortunately.  I do not say that disparagingly to him because I respect his enthusiasm and work rate, but it will not happen for rural Ireland.  Perhaps he will change things with the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, beside him, and I hope the Ministers from the Independent Alliance will support him.  However, as I said about the situation regarding the voluntary housing associations, we have a huge housing crisis that is increasing and we are talking about reports and quarterly reports.  I am sick and tired of it.  Tipperary County Council did not build a house last year in the middle of a crisis with 3,000 people approved and about another 8,000 applying.  What has gone wrong?  Big Brother is stifling us all, herding us all into cities and bigger cities.</p> <p> I heard a constituency colleague of the Acting Chairman's, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, talking about Galway this morning.  There is traffic chaos given the facilities and everything else going to Galway.  I met the head of IDA Ireland in Washington, the night before St. Patrick's Day this year.  He told me that IDA Ireland cannot get a company to go anywhere in Ireland now except Dublin.  It is hard enough to get companies to come to Ireland at all.  It is policy after policy for the permanent governments and then we had IDA Ireland and the other group that was set up all over the country, ConnectIreland, which is doing great work again.  It started with a voluntary seed - a small acorn into an oak tree grows - and it was doing great work.  IDA Ireland got corporatism and now the scheme it delivered is gone.  It was given an old patch.  IDA Ireland said it was doing this work as it was its area, but now the scheme is gone.  It brought jobs to Tipperary, Galway, west Cork, Kerry and everywhere else and had more coming.  We raised this here with the Minister and in the deputation.</p> <p> I know of a company called SNC-Lavalin Group that took over a fabulous company in Clonmel called MF Kent.  This happened with other companies in Tipperary.  They get taken over.  There is no one watching it, whether the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission or anyone else.  They are letting these multibillion-dollar companies come in and hijack and banjax things and treat workers appallingly in Clonmel.  I will not stray into it but this is happening again with another multibillion-dollar company taking over another company, and there were only 40 jobs left in Clonmel.  Kentz, formerly MF Kent, employed 15,000 people and I salute Frank Kent for setting it up.  It had world recognition and these cowboy outfits have now taken it over.  They have been run out of several countries.  I could read the details of this into the record but I will not.  They are involved in huge lawsuits and have been banned from government contracts and we let them come in here.  They took over JS Atkins for &pound;2.1 billion only two weeks ago and they are destroying our workers here.  They have no respect for the workers in Clonmel who have given the service.</p> <p> This has happened across the board.  We talk about our big conglomerates and the Kerry Groups and Glanbias and so on.  All is not so healthy there.  Kerry Group was not half anxious to come up when it got the invitation and leave where it was in Kerry, where it started.  All is not wonderful in the capital or in these big companies.  As I said, we should support the local small business man and the people who want to build their own houses.</p> <p> The Government should give some substance and support to the GPs who are the first port of call.  We have trolley crisis after trolley crisis.  If the GPs are gone, the trolley crises are ten times worse.  One need not be a rocket scientist to guess this one, but I do not know what has gone on with the permanent government and the Ministers and taoisigh who are afraid to tackle it.  It must be tackled.  The permanent government must become the public servants they are being paid to be, allow the public to get the services and not treat people like peasants, giving them crumbs from the table.  We want justice in rural Ireland, we want fairness, we are not the b&eacute;al bocht, we want the respect we deserve and we want to be able to live and thrive.  The communities, GAA clubs, soccer clubs, all the other different clubs and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann will all make the communities viable.</p> <p> We are destroying our pubs with the attack on them by the new law.  I know many in Cabinet are against it.  I got a text tonight saying they are all being whipped into vote for it.  All the legislation that is passed, including the Minister, Deputy Ross's, legislation, which he is passionate about, and I respect him for that, must be rural-proofed because we are stifling and killing-----</p></speech>

I think most Deputies have the best interests of rural Ireland at heart and see the merits in setting up a dedicated Department to progress the social and economic development of rural Ireland, as well as supporting both rural and urban communities through the community development division of the new Department.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill we are debating is to establish a new Department of State.  The Bill is standard legislation in this regard.  The detail of the functions of the Department will be addressed through a transfer of functions order.  Work is ongoing on the transfer of functions from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  There are a small number of areas still under discussion between the relevant Ministers and Secretaries General, but the first transfer of functions orders will be brought to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies have expressed views about specific functions they believe should transfer to the new Department of Rural and Community Development.  I appreciate why they might hold these views, but the fact of the matter is that rural and community development is the responsibility of many Departments and the impact can be all the better for a multi-departmental approach.  It is better for the Ministers with policy responsibility and expertise in particular areas to apply their policies to the benefit of rural Ireland, whether that be in respect of housing, jobs, roads or services.  Just as the Government tackled the jobs crisis on a whole-of-Government basis through the Action Plan for Jobs, we need every Department to play its part in helping revitalise rural Ireland.  We need key economic Departments such as Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and Transport, Tourism and Sport to be full and active participants in supporting rural Ireland and supporting community development.</p>  <p>  My role will be to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken across Government.  I will be the voice for rural Ireland at the Cabinet table and will make other Departments accountable for their actions regarding rural Ireland.  The new Department of Rural and Community Development will have a strong policy focus in its own right and will work closely across the Government system to ensure that other Departments' policies are rural-proofed.</p><p>This is what the action plan for rural development is about.  That is why it is different from what has been tried previously.  I assure the Deputies that I will be seeking to increase the funding available for rural Ireland in the 2018 budget.  Issues such as broadband, infrastructure and jobs are the key priorities for rural Ireland, and need investment.  There are other things that we can do that are not dependent on money to make a lasting impact on rural Ireland.  For example, my officials have started work on developing a new policy for social enterprise.  This is something that has been sorely absent up to now, but my officials have already started on the process, in consultation with the social enterprise sector. </p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised a number of points which I would like to respond to on the subject of Leader.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the programme.  Every Deputy here today raised the issue of the Leader programme.  I want to see the programme implemented as effectively and as efficiently as possible, and I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed regarding some of the administrative procedures related to the programme.  On 17 May, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, hosted a forum with participants from all of the local action groups and the local development companies delivering Leader to explore the issues of concern to them and to identify potential solutions aimed at streamlining the current procedures.  As a result of that consultation process, we have been in touch with all of the local action groups and local development companies to update them on 31 improvements that we intend to make to improve the administrative process under Leader.  On the basis of the administrative changes being introduced and the progress now being made by the local action groups, I anticipate a significant increase in project approvals and payments under Leader over the coming months.  </p> <p> On the issue of regional development, I believe that strong regions provide the basis for improving economic opportunities and job creation in rural areas.  My Department will continue to support regional development and to deliver the regional initiatives it has been involved in to date.  These include working with the Western Development Commission to support the economic development of the western region, progressing the Atlantic economic corridor proposal with key stakeholders, working with local authorities to facilitate the preparations for the roll-out of the national broadband plan, and to improve mobile phone services throughout the regions.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the new national planning framework and with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to the regional action plans for jobs.  </p> <p> With regard to the Western Development Commission, one of the first things I intend to do once the new Department is established is to appoint a new board and to give them a clear mandate to work together and to co-operate with other key agencies to support the development of the western region.  A priority for the incoming board will be to appoint a new CEO.  I have received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make this appointment, but it is the board&rsquo;s function to arrange the recruitment of that person and I hope they will do it quickly.  I also want to clarify a point about the Western Development Commission&rsquo;s budget.  The commission was allocated an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding for 2016 and 2017, but was restricted under its legislation as to how that could be spent.  I secured additional current funding for the Western Development Commission at the end of 2016 to conduct some additional work for the Department.  </p> <p> I assure Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that my new Department is also active in the area of North-South co-operation.  I will be involved in the North-South Ministerial Council set up under the Good Friday Agreement and officials from my Department will also participate on the steering committee on cross-Border rural development, SCCBRD, where there is regular and ongoing contact between officials on both sides of the Border.  </p> <p> I compliment all the Deputies today who raised many rural issues.  I have been given the responsibility for rural economic development, and I will do my best.  It is a great honour to be in the Cabinet.  I have a very difficult job to do, but I intend to do that job.  I intend to work with all of the Deputies in this House, to listen to their views and to do whatever I can at Cabinet level to make sure that rural Ireland gets its fair share of the national cake.  Of course there are many difficulties out there, but there are many positive things happening in rural Ireland as well.  There are many very bright young people who are working very hard and are setting up businesses.  They are people who want some support.  There are many small businesses.  If they got a little support from the local authorities and Government, they would be able to employ many more people.  It is my job as Minister to make sure that every Government Department is rural-proofed, and I will do that. </p> <p> The Deputies raised many issues, and we have many issues.  I am will not be able to resolve every single issue that was raised here today, but I certainly will be there at Government level to support and make sure that Ministers are listening and that the Government will provide the necessary funding to do what needed to be done.  Dr. Carty has said that we have to try to get people back living in rural Ireland.  That is why when I came in as Minister of State that I re-introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised it today.  He set up that scheme, but it had not operated for many years.  I re-introduced that scheme.  The rural recreation scheme, the town and village scheme, and many other schemes have to be looked at to see what we can do to assist and help rural communities.  That is my job, and I will do it.  I want to get the approval of the House today so that I can sit down with Government to get my orders and make sure I can carry out whatever responsibility I have.  I will discuss it at committee and the D&aacute;il, and do whatever we can do together to try and revitalise rural Ireland.  That is my job and the job of the Deputies present here.  Working together I believe that we can have a better rural Ireland.</p></speech>

It is easy to get confused on certain Bills, but it is very important that we hold a very simple yardstick up to anything to do with Bills, whether it comes from the Government or the Opposition, and that yardstick should be to ask if it will benefit people or not.  If this yardstick is used for this Bill, it is clear that the creation of this Department will benefit people, especially people in rural areas.  It is very important to do that.  It will also benefit the areas of arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, because that Department was a mish-mash of a Department in reality, and separation will mean that it is possible for different Ministers to focus properly on particular issues.  </p><p>It is important to note that if this Bill does not pass today it is likely that it will be October before the particular Department will be up and running.  I do not believe that it will be useful for us to go back to our own communities and explain that we prevented a Department from being up and running until next October.  Notwithstanding that, very valid questions have been asked over the past number of minutes, including what functions are to be delivered to this Department and when those functions will be delivered, and what other steps are necessary for this Department to get up and running.  Are statutory instruments necessary?  Are ministerial orders necessary?  When exactly will people be able to contact the Department and actually see that it is functioning?</p><p>On the specifics of the amendments we have tabled, the reason I included "regional" in the title of the proposed Department is that regional concerns differ from rural concerns.  There can be a rural area three miles outside Navan and that is in the greater Dublin area.  Regional concerns, the fact that there is a two-tier society, and population decline in counties such as Mayo and Donegal, are different concerns.  Their concerns centre on the fact that the urban areas in those locations are not functioning properly and cannot compete with Dublin's growth.  Most young families today, which need two jobs to survive, are being forced to locate in large cities, especially on the east coast.  They do not have a choice if they want to get two jobs that would cover all their expenses.  As a result the population on the east coast is getting younger while on the west coast it is getting older.  That is why I believe it is necessary for this Department to focus on regional issues.  Both issues are connected but they are different. </p> <p> The third title I seek to include in this Department addresses the all-island spatial regional development plan.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Ring, will function under the cross-Border ministerial forum but we have not shifted one iota since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  That is a long time ago and we are still functioning on that basis.  We are asking in this amendment that we take a step further than that and include in the title of a Department within this State an objective that we organise the infrastructure, the population, the economy, and the services of this island on an all-island basis.  That invisible line is so disastrous for the communities living along the Border and will cause many problems in the run up to Brexit that I suggest we develop our infrastructure and spatial development on an all-island basis.  That is why I seek to have this in here and ask the Minister to include it in the title. </p></speech>

Chuir s&eacute; iontas orm go raibh deifir air an Roinn a bhun&uacute;, is cuma c&eacute; na c&uacute;ins&iacute; n&oacute; c&eacute; na c&uacute;raim&iacute; n&oacute; c&eacute; chomh dona agus a bheidh an Roinn sin ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na fabhbanna at&aacute; ann.  Cuireann s&eacute; an-iontas go deo orm go nd&eacute;arfadh ball Sinn F&eacute;in &eacute; sin mar creideann an p&aacute;irt&iacute; sin - agus b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an ceart aige - gur fearr Tuaisceart &Eacute;ireann a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il gan Rialtas ar bith n&aacute; drochmhargadh a dh&eacute;anamh.  In ionad Feidhmeannais a thabhairt isteach agus comhr&eacute;iteach a dh&eacute;anamh leis an DUP t&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in ag seasamh taobh amuigh agus ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il c&uacute;pla St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;seach agus air&iacute; &oacute; th&iacute;r iasachta leis an &aacute;it a riaradh.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin iontas orm mar sh&iacute;llfe&aacute; go n-aont&oacute;dh an Teachta liom go nd&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; ciall cinnti&uacute; go mbeadh na cumhachta&iacute; cearta ag an Aire, Teachta Ring.  T&aacute; cro&iacute; an Aire san &aacute;it ceart, n&iacute; sh&eacute;anfainn &eacute; sin, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; in aghaidh c&oacute;rais mh&oacute;r mhillteach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo ar eolas agam.  </p>  <p>  T&aacute; roinnt figi&uacute;ir&iacute; agam anseo.  T&aacute; an m&eacute;id ollcaiteachais at&aacute; ar an Rialtas anois thart ar 5% taobh thiar den caiteachas i 2010.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il go bhfuil an caiteachas ar fhorbairt r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach agus tuaithe 20% n&iacute;os l&uacute; agus go bhfuil caiteachas ar ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; pobail 42% n&iacute;os l&uacute;.  Mar sin, is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil aon tosa&iacute;ocht &aacute; thabhairt ag an Rialtas san ioml&aacute;n do na gn&oacute;tha&iacute; seo agus go bhfuil ruda&iacute; eile n&iacute;os tabhachta&iacute; d&oacute; n&aacute; gn&oacute;tha&iacute; tuaithe agus r&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha.  </p>  <p>  Is aisteach go bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in ag &uacute;s&aacute;id arg&oacute;int amh&aacute;in &oacute; Thuaidh nach &uacute;s&aacute;ideann s&eacute; &oacute; Dheas - gur fearr fanacht agus margadh maith a dh&eacute;anamh, n&aacute; deifir a dh&eacute;anamh agus drochmhargadh a dh&eacute;anamh.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag breathn&uacute; ar an leas&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; mholadh ag baill de Shinn F&eacute;in &oacute; thaobh uile-&Eacute;ireann de, sh&iacute;lfe&aacute; go mbreathn&oacute;id&iacute;s ar seo ar bhonn uile-&Eacute;ireann agus go nd&eacute;arfaid&iacute;s d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d go bhfuil an cur chuige at&aacute; ceart sa Tuaisceart chomh ciallmhar c&eacute;anna &oacute; Dheas, fi&uacute; go bhfuil an c&aacute;s seo neamhc&oacute;s&uacute;il &oacute; ch&aacute;s an Tuaiscirt.  &Oacute; Thuaidh, nuair nach bhfuil aon Rialtas ann, tugtar forl&aacute;mhas do dream seachtrach taobh amuigh den t&iacute;r.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ring, might remember many years ago when I was the Minister and he was a backbench Deputy I met him coming across the "Bridge of Sighs" between here and Government Buildings and I said things were bad in Achill and Mayo and he said "Yes".  Then I said things were very depressed and he said "Yes". </p></speech>

We think they were all started during our time by the way.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, kept saying how depressed things were and I said that if it was that bad, it would be great that people were moving out.  No one would want to live in an area like that.  I did not believe that, however.  I said that, in fact, living in Connemara was a great thing.  It is a fantastic community and if it got fair play, it would be the best place in the world.  Despite the lack of infrastructure, we have developed fantastic industries.  I said we needed to take a more positive view and I am delighted the Minister listened to me and has now adopted a very positive view.</p> <p> I remember going down to Ballycroy one night.  I do not think the Minister was there.  There were about 300 people in a hall.</p></speech>

Much to my embarrassment, they insisted on giving me a full dinner first.  I said I would go out and talk to the people first. They are hospitable people, they all stayed and we had a very interesting night.  I remember saying to them that night that compared to some urban areas, life was actually good in Ballycroy.  I agree with that but we also need to provide basic services, including broadband.</p>  <p>  I would like to think that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n takes his amendment about an all-Ireland approach seriously.  If he did, he could have made the simple proposal that the Minister, Deputy Ring, would persuade the Taoiseach to put the three all-Ireland bodies that used to be in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in this new Department.  When I was there, Foras na Gaeilge, An Foras hUltaise and Waterways Ireland were all under the remit of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It was unique as a Department to have three all-Ireland bodies.  It was fantastic.  As any of the Deputy's colleagues in the North will know, I spent a great deal of time in the Six Counties visiting all of the communities, nationalist and unionist.  I operated on an all-Ireland basis and provided Exchequer funds to schools and ruda&iacute; cult&uacute;rtha eile.  I have always believed that actions are more important than words.  If Sinn F&eacute;in was really interested in an all-Ireland approach, it would be pressing very hard for those functions to transfer to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ring.  If not in name, it would in fact be working on an all-Ireland basis.</p>  <p>  Turning to my amendments, during the period from 2002 to 2011, rural affairs, the Gaeltacht and the islands were the responsibility of the same Department, which created a good synergy.  Labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; faoi na hoile&aacute;in i dtosach.  Nach bhfuil s&eacute; aisteach go bhfuil c&uacute;ram na n-oile&aacute;in ag dul a bheith scoilte amach, scartha amach agus deighilte amach &oacute; c&uacute;ram tuaithe?  M&aacute; t&aacute; &aacute;iteanna ar bith in &Eacute;irinn a bhfuil tuath&uacute;&iacute;l, n&oacute; amuigh faoin tuath, is iad na hoile&aacute;in iad.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith ciallmhar go mbeid&iacute;s istigh i Roinn amh&aacute;in le gn&oacute;tha&iacute; tuaithe n&oacute; forbairt tuaithe.  N&iacute; bheidh aon fhadhb maidir leis an aireacht St&aacute;it d&aacute; nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; bheidh le dh&eacute;anamh ag an Taoiseach ach a r&aacute; i mbun cruinni&uacute; Rialtais go mbeidh c&uacute;raim&iacute; idir-Ranna ag an tAire St&aacute;it, Teachta McHugh.  N&iacute;l  aon fhadhb.  Rinneadh &eacute; seo m&iacute;le uair.  N&iacute; g&aacute; d&oacute; ach teacht os comhair na D&aacute;la agus beidh na c&uacute;raim&iacute; ann.

T&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair &eacute; sin a thuiscint.  </p>  <p>  T&aacute; an fhadhb ch&eacute;anna leis an nGaeltacht, taobh amuigh de Ghaeltacht Chathair na Gaillimhe.  I ndair&iacute;re is beag an Ghaeltacht at&aacute; sa chathair fi&uacute; go n-ainmn&iacute;tear mar Ghaeltacht &iacute;.  Nuair a the&iacute;tear don Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta, Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; R&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta is beag an pl&eacute; at&aacute; ann faoin Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe sa gciall ina thuigtear Gaeltacht.  Is cuimhin liom a bheith ag canbhaise&aacute;il istigh i dT&iacute;r Oile&aacute;in, east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta i nGaillimh.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag dul &oacute; theach go teach.  T&aacute; T&iacute;r Oile&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht agus d&uacute;radh liom i gceann de na tithe go raibh fear as an nGaeltacht ina ch&oacute;na&iacute; sa ch&eacute;ad teach eile.

N&iacute; bhfaca siad iad f&eacute;in mar dhaoine a raibh c&oacute;na&iacute; orthu sa Ghaeltacht.  N&iacute;lim cinnte go bhfuil a fhios ag formh&oacute;r an phobail sin go bhfuil c&oacute;na&iacute; orthu sa Ghaeltacht.  </p>  <p>  Maidir leis na Gaeltachta&iacute; mar a thuigimid na Gaeltachta&iacute; - na Gaeltachta&iacute; a bh&iacute; i gceist go mbeadh siad sainaitheanta sa mBille a thug an t-iarAire, -Dinny McGinley, isteach - is ceantair tuaithe iad.  T&aacute; fadhbanna fisici&uacute;la sa Ghaeltacht. N&iacute; cheist teanga amh&aacute;in &iacute; an Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; imirce go m&oacute;r i gceist.  T&aacute; easpa bunstrucht&uacute;r go m&oacute;r i gceist.  Mar sin, ritheann s&eacute; le r&eacute;as&uacute;n go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht, mar aonad t&iacute;reola&iacute;och, sa Roinn c&eacute;anna le forbairt tuaithe agus go mbeadh an tAire c&eacute;anna &oacute;s a gcinn.  Mar sin, t&aacute;imid ag moladh go n-athr&oacute;fa&iacute; teideal na Roinne.  T&aacute;imid ag moladh go dtabharfaidh isteach an Ghaeltacht sna hoile&aacute;in agus go tabharfaidh t&eacute;agar don Roinn.  </p>  <p>  Ar&iacute;s, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag breathn&uacute; ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; agus is eol don Aire St&aacute;it, muna bhfaighidh s&eacute; ach c&uacute;raim&iacute; tuaithe, c&uacute;raim&iacute; pobail agus c&uacute;raim&iacute; r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach - agus glacaim leis go bhfaighfidh s&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; r&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha fi&uacute; nach bhfuil iad luaite sa teideal -  beidh thart ar &euro;60 milli&uacute;n euro ag an Roinn nua.  Sa bhliain deireadh ina raibh mise mar Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta bh&iacute; &euro;418 milli&uacute;n faoi mo sti&uacute;radh.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach ag bord an Rialtais.  N&aacute; habair liom nach nd&eacute;anann cisti&uacute; na Roinne aon difr&iacute;ocht.  Is an-&aacute;it &eacute; a bheith mar Aire, ach beidh an Teachta Ring in ann rud e&iacute;gin i bhfad n&iacute;os foirfe a dh&eacute;anamh faoin rud at&aacute; faoina ch&uacute;ram f&eacute;in.  </p>  <p>  Ceann de na f&aacute;thanna gur buna&iacute;odh an sc&eacute;im CL&Aacute;R mar a bhuna&iacute;odh &eacute;, nuair a bhuna&iacute;odh &eacute; don ch&eacute;ad uair, n&aacute; an smaoineamh c&eacute;anna a bh&iacute; taobh thiar an RAPID programme sa gcathair.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&iacute;reach mar at&aacute; an jab a tugadh don Aire.  Bh&iacute; muid ceaptha chun fadhbanna na gcathracha a leigheas - bochtanas agus na ceantair f&iacute;orbhocht sna cathracha - tr&iacute; chomhchoist&iacute; de Ranna St&aacute;it a thabhairt le ch&eacute;ile agus an tAire ag imirt tionchar orthu.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; liom f&eacute;in, mura mbeinn an t-airgead agam chun dul i ngleic le sin, n&iacute; bheidh in ann tionchar a imirt.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh airgead uaim.  Sti&uacute;r m&eacute; &euro;20 mili&uacute;n.  Cheap m&eacute; go mbeinn in ann tionchar a imirt ar Air&iacute; eile d&aacute; mbeinn in ann a r&aacute; go bhfuil mo chuid den airgead agam agus a fhiafra&iacute; c&aacute; bhfuil cuid an Aire eile.  Is as an gcoincheap sin a bhuna&iacute;odh CL&Aacute;R.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an-mheas ag an Aire ar an sc&eacute;im CL&Aacute;R.  N&iacute;lim l&aacute;ns&aacute;sta leis an gcaoi ina bhfuil s&eacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; meicn&iacute;ocht an sc&eacute;im, ach t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil meas aige ar an sc&eacute;im agus go dtuigeann s&eacute; go dtugann s&eacute; cumhacht d&oacute;.  Tugann s&eacute; deis d&oacute; dul ag Air&iacute; eile agus a r&aacute; go cuirfidh s&eacute; euro ar f&aacute;il m&aacute; chuireann an Aire eile &euro;3 no &euro;10 ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire an sc&eacute;im sin a oibri&uacute;, ach muna bhfuil an t-airgead aige n&iacute; bheidh s&eacute; in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Leis an smaoineamh seo, beidh s&eacute; in ann an-tionchar a imirt tr&iacute; rural-proofing.</p><p>Gheobhaidh an tAire amach, mar a dh&eacute;antar le chuile proofing at&aacute; ar na meamraim Rialtais, go scr&iacute;ofar, m&aacute; t&aacute; siad &aacute; scr&iacute;obh, c&eacute;ard a tharl&oacute;idh nuair a bheidh s&eacute; scr&iacute;ofa.  Th&iacute;os in &iacute;ochtar, beidh liosta ceisteanna.  An bhfuil s&eacute; f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte &oacute; thaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; cothromais gn&eacute;is?  An bhfuil s&eacute; f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte &oacute; thaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; bochtanais?  N&iacute; chuirfidh siad aon athr&uacute; ar an meamram, ach d&eacute;arfaidh siad nach mbaineann s&eacute; leis seo n&oacute; go mbaineann.  N&iacute; bhfuair an tAire agus n&iacute; fhaca s&eacute; agus n&iacute; fheicfidh s&eacute; aon mheamram ag teacht ar aghaidh.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh rud faoi scola&iacute;ochta n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scoileanna, d&eacute;arfaidh siad go bhfuil leas scoileanna na t&iacute;re ar fad agus mar sin de chun tairbhe i gceantair tuaithe.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil d&oacute;thain r&aacute;ite agam.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag moladh go nglacfar leis na leasuithe at&aacute; curtha s&iacute;os agus go n-athr&oacute;far teideal na Roinne.

Bh&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad amendment from Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n ar pholasa&iacute; Uile-&Eacute;ireann and an all-Ireland policy.  We heard from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that in former times in the Department a number of these areas were together and that there was much cross-Border and all-island activity.  Many efforts were made, including by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  He might have been late for that meeting, but he was often late for meetings.  However, he was always listening with a cluas m&oacute;r that was oscailte &iacute; gcona&iacute; and he was ag obair go cruaidh ar fad.  I often waited for him too, but it was worth waiting for him.  I hope the Minister will be worth waiting for too.  I genuinely wish him well with his portfolio.  I will give praise where it is due, but I see the vagaries in this.  This amendment will not deal with them.  It is a case of how long is a piece of string.  One thinks of the adage, d&uacute;irt bean liom go d&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i go raibh fear i dTiobraid &Aacute;rann a bhfuil p&oacute;ca ina l&eacute;ine aige.   In English, a woman told me that a woman told her that there was a man in Tipperary with a pocket on his shirt.  The Minister has no pockets.  This is like a shroud.  The Minister has no money, no budget and no portfolio.  In his reply on Second Stage, and I am not sure of the exact words he used, he did not give any dates and referred to as soon as he could.  I accept his bona fides, but I am used to the permanent government being slow to allow people in rural Ireland to have their fair share of the cake, nothing more.  It is not the b&eacute;al bocht, just a fair slice.  It might not be fully fair, but it should be a reasonable amount.  We will make good use of it.  Let the communities and groups make use of it, because they will.  Allow them to do the work.  As I said a number of times earlier, n&iacute;l neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p>  <p>  With regard to the other amendments, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said that during his time in Government rural affairs, the Gaeltacht and na hoile&aacute;in were all together in a single portfolio.  Too much chopping and changing makes matters hard to bed down.  It can be difficult for groups to engage.  There should be a one-stop-shop in the Minister's Department, when he gets it, which people, communities and organisations can contact so they are not going ar fud na t&iacute;re, &oacute; &aacute;it go h&aacute;it and &oacute; bhaile go baile, as we were obliged to do with the Department for the environment in respect of voluntary housing, as I mentioned earlier.  Voluntary housing groups were doing great back in the 2000s when there was a one-stop-shop.  However, the Department got jealous of the success of these people who were embarrassing it so it set up seven regional offices where one had to go with a proposal.  They were all over the country, ar fud na t&iacute;re.  It is like IDA Ireland being covetous of ConnectIreland.</p>  <p>  There must be a one-stop-shop, direct communication and clarity.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle said when I finished my contribution on Second Stage that my points were succinct and to the point.  All of them might not have been, but we need clarity.  Communities and groups are waiting long enough for it.  After the last election Fine Gael was badly bruised and it had to form a minority Government with the supply and confidence arrangement with Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Rural Independent Group fought hard for a Department for rural affairs, but we did not get it.  As I told the Minister, we got the hind teat of the b&oacute; bhocht, or the poor cow.  It could not even be milked because it was a hind teat of the Department.  I accept that the Minister will crack the whip when he gets his portfolio and into the saddle, but there must be rural proofing from all the other Departments and Ministers.  There must be cohesion.  We cannot go around in circles and not get anywhere.  This Department is needed.  It is a pity it is the second last day of this session.  It is also late in the night and many of us might wish to go elsewhere and leave this, but we are here to support the amendments.  I compliment na Teachta&iacute; T&oacute;ib&iacute;n agus &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v agus gabhaim comhghairdeachas leo for tabling these amendments in order that we could have this debate.</p></speech>

While I cannot accept the amendments, I assure the Deputy that the new Department will be very active on North-South co-operation.  Under the North-South Ministerial Council set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the lead Department with regard to the agriculture sector, which also includes rural development.  My Department will play a role in co-operation on agriculture and rural development issues, including ministerial involvement in the meetings.  Officials from my Department will also participate on the steering committee on cross-Border rural development, where there is regular and ongoing contact between officials on both sides of the Border.</p>  <p>  Another promising area of cross-Border activity is the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, where my Department will also be represented.  That was established towards the end of 2016 by the chief executive officers of Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council with the aim of progressing economic and social development on a regional basis across the north west.</p>  <p>  Strong regions provide the basis for improving economic opportunities and job creation in rural areas.  While the term "regional" does not feature in the title of the new Department, there will be a strong regional dimension to its work.  My Department will continue to support regional development and to deliver the regional initiatives that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been involved in to date.  These include working with the Western Development Commission to support the economic development of the western region, progressing the Atlantic economic corridor proposals with key stakeholders and working with local authorities to facilitate preparations for the roll-out of the national broadband plan and improving mobile telephone services throughout the region.</p>  <p>  The amendment tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v proposes to change the name of the Department to the Department of rural, community and Gaeltacht development.  I cannot accept the amendment.  However, I wish to make the following points.  On 14 May 2017, when the Taoiseach announced the new Government he assigned responsibility for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht to the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, was assigned the role of Chief Whip and Minister of State with responsibility for promoting the learning and use of Irish, both within and outside the Gaeltacht.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is providing a voice at the Cabinet for our first national language.  A delegation of functions order has already been made assigning functions relating to the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the islands to the Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, under the aegis of the Department of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has already signalled that she intends to rename the reconfigurated Department as the Department of culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht and the order to give effect to the change has been prepared.  In drawing up the configuration of the new Department, the Taoiseach signalled a new emphasis that will be attached to the promotion of culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht and the newly-reconfigured Department will have a budget to match this emphasis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-12a.828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071200072#WWW00200"><p>I listened with interest to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I also listened to the Minister's explanation as to why he could not accept my amendment.  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said it was impractical to have a delay.  This is different from what happens in the HSE.  I have been extremely critical of the constant changes in management, structures and so forth that take place in the HSE because the same managers are not left in the same place.  However, what I am proposing does not involve any of that.  When the name of the Department changed from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it did not make any difference from a management point of view.  As the Ministers of State, Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne and Joe McHugh, know, all of the staff dealing with the islands and the Gaeltacht are located in the office in Na Forbacha under the sti&uacute;th&oacute;ir Aodh&aacute;in Mac Cormaic, fear an-bhre&aacute;.  If one were to move it from one Department to another, it would simply be moved, including the few staff in Gaoth Dobhair.  There is nobody left in County Kerry, unfortunately, which is a terrible tragedy.  The Department with responsibility for the Gaeltacht used to have an office in Tralee to serve the Gaeltachts in counties Kerry, Cork and Waterford, but it was closed.  However, such offices would simply be transferred and the only difference one would see is that there would be a different Secretary General - there would be a different Secretary General because they change all the time - and a different Minister.  In this case, there would not be a different Minister because the Taoiseach would simply state the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, would now be Minister of State at Roinn an Taoisigh, the Chief Whip and the Minister of State at the Department with responsibility for rural, community and Gaeltacht development.  That is all that would have to be done.</p>  <p>  Of course, there would be new delegated functions, but this is done all the time.  It would not be a big deal.  The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, would have to make a minor adjustment to her title, but that would make it easier to say it.  Adjustments to ministerial titles happen all the time.  I believe they happen too frequently and unnecessarily.  We did it too and I often wondered if it was worthwhile.  It was not very expensive to do it, but such adjustments were a nuisance.  People get used to calling something by whatever it is called and just when they are getting used to a new name, it changes and becomes an acronym and so forth.  However, there would be no practical difficulty if one knows, as I do in this case, the reality of the structures we are discussing and how simple it would be.  The arguments the Minister makes do not hold water.</p>  <p>  The 20,000 native speakers in the Gaeltacht were mentioned.  The number had risen in the inter-census period between 2006 and 2011, but it dropped quite significantly throughout the country from 2011.  In addition, the number of people who said they knew Irish dropped.  One has to look to Government policies for the reason that happened.  From a linguistic point of view and considering the small size of the Gaeltachts, the reality is that the Gaeltacht has been amazingly resilient.  Professor Brian &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v carried out an accurate and deep analysis of the figures in 1950.  He wrote some papers that were published in a booklet entitled, Irish Dialects and Irish-Speaking Districts.  It was probably the first attempt to establish what the figures were.  Until then people were asked in the census if they knew Irish.  That gives a figure for the number who say they know Irish but not for the number who speak it every day.</p><p>He had a complicated, comprehensive and detailed way of analysing how many people in the Gaeltacht were speaking Irish.  Based on the 1948 census, he arrived at a figure of between 30,000 and 33,000 in 1950.  When one considers the widespread emigration from rural areas in the 1950s and socio-economic changes such as people moving into the Gaeltacht for reasons of marriage and so on, it is amazing from a linguistic point of view and a credit to the State that these p&oacute;ca&iacute; beaga - all the Gaeltacht areas are small, isolated pockets, even the Connemara Gaeltacht - have survived.</p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated he is in a hurry to get the Department up and running as otherwise nothing will happen.  Again, the Deputy does not understand the structure of government here.  Unlike in the northern part of our country, every section of every Department is under some Minister every day of the year, even in interregnum periods.  This is not only a question of money, but also one of powers and function.  That is what I am fighting about, although money obviously goes with powers and functions.  If a decision was taken to delay this change with a view to having a proper Department established and the Minister were to hold out for the proper price, as one would do at a fair - we are talking a great deal about cows tonight - the two existing Departments with responsibilities would, in the meantime, have an obligation to ensure progress was made as quickly as possible.  As a Cabinet Minister, the Minister would also have an input into both Departments.  In the arrangement I am suggesting, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, would transfer with the Department and could bang away as good as ever in the existing Department until the function was transferred. </p></speech>

I notice that we are getting very fussy late in the night about procedure.  When we entered this D&aacute;il, I believed that there was a procedure whereby, when Bills would be published, their heads would first go to the committees and that we would not bring Bills to the House and take all Stages in one go.  This is the most extraordinary situation.  On Sunday after the match, I went to my office in Galway and went through the large amount of paperwork that I had, including my diary for the week.  I started examining carefully what the week's business was, as I tend to do and as I am sure the Whip will be glad to hear, to find out that there was the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill.  When I decided to check what it was, I found out that it had not even been published yet.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach announced this the day that he told the House that he would change the Departments.  Surely to God it did not take four weeks to write three lines of a Bill, most of which is repetitive.</p></speech>

He has an understanding of how rural Ireland works.  The Government is setting up a new Department to represent and put rural Ireland at the Cabinet table.  Maybe Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v does not like that, but I am delighted that the Taoiseach has selected a Minister.  The Deputy should be delighted that the Gaeltacht Department will not be represented by one Minister, but by two ministerial members at the Cabinet table.  The Deputy would love to be that Minister and he would be delighted to be there.  While he was there, I praised him for some of the work that he did and criticised him for other work that he did, but at least I was fair and honest.</p>  <p>  This Bill is about setting up a Department.  I will tell Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the Order of Business.  He knows how the House works better than anyone.  This was agreed at the Business Committee last week.  It is a small Bill.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is a good Irish speaker, as is Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I do not speak Irish.  I was not as lucky and as privileged as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I came from a big family.  In the summer, I could not go to the Gaeltacht.  I had to go out and work.  I make no apologies for that.</p></speech>

This debate was not about the Irish language or the Gaeltacht.  It was about setting up a new Department.  I just want to put that on the record loud and clear.</p><p>I am proud to have been born and reared in rural Ireland.  I have never used it as a holiday home.</p><p>I have always lived in rural Ireland.  I understand the problems of rural Ireland.  I do the best I can with my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputy Kyne and Deputy McHugh, and my colleagues here who represent rural constituencies.  This legislation is about setting up a Department that is badly wanted.  I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for his co-operation.  We need to get this legislation through.  I want to get into the Seanad tomorrow.  With the support of the House tonight, we might get into the Seanad tomorrow.  We might have this Department up and running so I can come back to the D&aacute;il and tell it what functions I have, what delegation orders I have and what funding I am getting from Government.  I need time to get in to deal with the Minister for Finance to make sure I have a proper budget in place, that I have a proper Department set up and that I have a proper team put in place.  That is what this legislation is about.  It is not major legislation.  It is three-line or four-line legislation.  I hope we get it through the Seanad tomorrow. </p></speech>

We are in extreme crisis in this country with regard to the two tier society we have.  We have a spatial distribution of enterprise and population that is way out of kilter.  It is hurting rural Ireland badly and Dublin city too.  There is poverty in both areas due to the fact there is imbalance in the development of our country.  It always amazes me the level of energy we seem to put into the hijinks of parliamentary activities in the D&aacute;il when we should be putting the same level of energy into trying to fix the problems affecting the people we are supposed to be representing.  This Bill is a very small step towards the possibility of helping those people.  The idea of putting it on the long finger makes absolutely no sense.  I will press my amendment.</p></speech>

I accept that it was not the Minister's fault that it was introduced in this way.  We have the usual end-of-term madness, of which I thought we had got rid in the reform of the Oireachtas.  I thought there was a new dispensation - new politics - but I regret that that does not seem to be the case.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister well in his new Department.  We have known each other for a long time.  We have often worked together in good spirit, but there have been other times when we have disagreed.  Politics in this country would become very unhealthy if we all agreed with each other all the time.  I have never questioned the Minister's sincerity and whether he knew the Irish language.  I am one of the few in this country who believe it is people's absolute right not to know Irish and that they should not have to apologise for it.  I have also been vehemently strong in insisting on the right of Irish speakers to use the language and not have to apologise for speaking it.  I accept that I was fortunate to learn Irish, despite the fact that I was from Dublin.  By the way, I never stayed in holiday homes in rural Ireland and hope the Minister will correct what he said.  I hope he will apologise for the inference that I had some connection with a holiday home in rural Ireland; I never had.  At 23 years of age, I moved to the Gaeltacht to work there by choice.  Just because I come from the city, I do not think I should be looked down on by rural people.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we will have many differences in the times ahead.  We have had many debates during the years in this House.  I also accept his contribution to rural Ireland.  When he was a Minister, his heart was in the right place.  Many years ago he had responsibility for the areas covered by the new Department and I certainly supported him on rural issues.  I hope he will give me the same support in coming years in what I propose to do.  He will not agree with everything, but we will debate it n the House and at the committee.</p>  <p>  I thank my officials who have worked long and late on the Bill for their support and co-operation.  I also thank the House for its support.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his co-operation as it has been a long day, but I suppose everybody's heart is in the right place.</p>  <p>  We have many problems in rural Ireland with which we need to deal, but there are many positive things happening.  There are many people living and working in rural Ireland who want to stay there.  That is why the Taoiseach chose me to be a member of the Cabinet.  The Department is being set up in order that we can try to ensure rural Ireland will get its fair share of the national cake.</p></speech>

I think most of us are anxious that we do not make a decision within 25 minutes, rather we should actually refer the motion back to a committee which would take the time to look at it in some detail.

The subsequent advice and recommendation received from the Defence Forces general staff was that we should participate in Operation Sophia, the UN-mandated EU naval operation in the southern central Mediterranean.  Yesterday, this recommendation was approved by the Government and today I am asking D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to complete the triple lock and approve participation in this UN-mandated mission.</p>  <p>  In commending the motion to the D&aacute;il I will first provide Members with some general information on the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in the Mediterranean, called Operation Sophia.  I will also provide the House with some further information on our current bilateral humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Operation Pontus, and then briefly outline why we propose that Ireland join the Operation Sophia mission at this time.</p>  <p>  The EU Common Security and Defence Policy naval operation, Operation Sophia, was launched at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 22 June 2015.  Operation Sophia's mission is to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers.  The objectives of the operation are not only to disrupt the activities of smugglers and traffickers, but also to prevent further loss of life at sea and reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants by countering and challenging the criminal organisations engaged in such activities.</p>  <p>  The migration crisis in the southern central Mediterranean continues to be critical and is expected to deteriorate further during the summer months.  The UN Migration Agency has reported that 95,768 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in the first six months of 2017, with almost 85% of them arriving in Italy.</p><p>There have been 2,169 deaths recorded in this period.  Libya is the main country of departure for more than 90% of migrants.  Operation Sophia is one element of a comprehensive approach to addressing the crisis.  The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan coastguard and navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 2292.  That imposes an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related materiel into that country.</p> <p> With regard to disrupting the people smuggling and trafficking operations in the Mediterranean, Operation Sophia is being implemented in a number of phases.  The first phase, to support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law, is complete.  The mission is currently at phase 2, part (i) and involves the targeting, seizure and diversion of the vessels of human smugglers and traffickers on the high seas.  There are no proposals currently to move to the next phase - phase 2, part (ii).  Moving to this phase, which relates to operating within Libyan territorial waters, requires a further UN Security Council resolution and-or the consent of the coastal state.  Similarly, there are no proposals to move to the third phase which would involve taking all necessary measures against vessels including disposal or rendering them inoperable.</p> <p> Ireland will only participate in those aspects of Operation Sophia which are authorised in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, and in this regard, Ireland will declare caveats to that effect should the D&aacute;il approve this motion.  I understand that some have concerns about participating in this mission but I reassure the House that this is part of a comprehensive EU response that is addressing the causes and not just the symptoms of the crisis.  Irish troops are contributing to the EU's efforts as part of EUTM in Mali.  The EU also has a training mission in Somalia and EUFOR in Chad, where we led and had troops previously.  All of those are Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, missions with a UN mandate.</p> <p> The EU's recent strategic review confirms that Operation Sophia has played a critically important role in collecting and analysing relevant data, and helped the EU better understand how trafficking networks operate.  It recommends that Operation Sophia continues to enhance its focus on maritime security operations, including information sharing, training Libyan authorities and supporting the establishment of a monitoring network.</p> <p> I wish to restate that Ireland is fully supportive of the comprehensive EU approach to the migration crisis including the current deployment and Operation Sophia.  Ireland contributes to its costs through the financing structures of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.  In April 2017, the Government, for the third year, approved the return of a Naval Service vessel to the Mediterranean to undertake humanitarian search and rescue tasks as part of a bilateral arrangement with the Italian authorities.  Overall, more than 16,800 migrants have been rescued since Irish Naval Service vessels deployed in the Mediterranean; demonstrating clearly the value of Ireland's response to the migration crisis.  The Government is very proud of the Naval Service and all of the crews who have participated in the mission.  On behalf of the Government, I am now seeking D&aacute;il approval to arrange for the transfer of the existing Naval Service deployment in the Mediterranean to the EU Common Security and Defence Policy mission, EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia.  Transferring to Operation Sophia would result in the redeployment of Irish Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue operations, to primarily security and interception operations.  The Naval Service vessel would, however, continue to be available to respond to requests from the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre or other relevant authority, in terms of any vessels at risk in its area of operation.  While the focus of Operation Sophia is primarily on security and interception operations, more than 36,600 persons have been rescued by vessels operating under this mission since October 2015.</p> <p> I also wish to highlight that it is the duty of all maritime ships, including Naval Service vessels, to render assistance to other vessels in distress in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Operation Sophia was launched in June 2015 as part of the EU's broader action to provide a comprehensive response to the global migration and refugee crisis and to encourage a democratic, stable and prosperous Libya.  It specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers' business model.  It has so far contributed to the apprehension of 109 suspected smugglers and traffickers and removed approximately 440 boats from criminal organisations' availability.</p> <p> Additionally, since October 2016 Operation Sophia has been mandated to participate in the training of the Libyan navy and Libyan coastguard and to the implementation of the United Nations arms embargo off the coast of Libya.  The processing of migrants in accordance with international law and respect for human rights is a fundamental aspect of Operation Sophia.  Accordingly, very close working arrangements with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration have been put in place both in planning, training and conduct of the operation.</p> <p> There are specific benefits for Ireland in joining Operation Sophia.  Having a single ship on its own in the Mediterranean gives rise to certain risks which would not be there if we were part of a broader multilateral operation.  Under Operation Sophia, we will be contributing to a mission in which 25 other member states are participating, and the Naval Service will have access to air support and intelligence reports which will enhance the security of deployed personnel and assets.  In addition to our contribution to the humanitarian effort in the Mediterranean to date, Ireland will now be making a contribution to addressing some of the root causes of migration and human trafficking.  There will be a more proactive role for the Naval Service, in that it will be authorised to seize the boats of smugglers on the high seas and destroy them so they cannot be used again in such a way.  The sharing of intelligence with other EU naval forces will also be an important aspect of the mission and will assist with addressing the complex issue of illegal migration.</p> <p> Participation in Operation Sophia will help to build Naval Service professional capacity across a range of skills and enhance capability in relation to interoperability with other international naval forces.</p></speech>

I believe that Ireland joining with the 25 other member states already contributing to Operation Sophia is a positive gesture and one which I wholeheartedly support.  A redeployment of a Naval Service vessel to support EU efforts to disrupt the practices of those illegal and criminal elements engaged in people trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable populations would contribute to countering the risk to life posed to migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean in unsafe and unseaworthy vessels.  In essence, if the international community can disrupt the actions of criminal networks engaged in the exploitation of migrants, then the migrants will not be put at risk of putting to sea in unseaworthy vessels in dangerous conditions.  I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the motion is coming to the House on the advice and recommendation of the Defence Forces and is fully supported by them.  Operation Sophia is part of a wider EU response to the migration crisis and we fully support that.</p>  <p>  It is worth remembering that Ireland only operates in UN-mandated missions and Operation Sophia is UN mandated by two UN Security Council resolutions.  We have a triple lock system in place in this country, which we value, with good reason.  Getting the approval of this House is the last step in the process.  The triple lock is a testament to our properly functioning democracy.</p>  <p>  We know that currently the Naval Service is participating in a bilateral arrangement facilitated by the Italian authorities named Operation Pontus, which is a search and rescue operation.  To date, the Irish Naval Service has rescued some 17,000 migrants in the Mediterranean, for which I thank them.  It is work which the Irish people are immensely proud of.</p>  <p>  While Operation Sophia does not have a specific search and rescue role as part of its mandate, such a role is a mandatory requirement on naval vessels deployed in the region under the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea so we can be assured that this important work will still continue.</p><p>Our Naval Service will be actively involved in disrupting the people smuggling and trafficking operations of criminal gangs in the Mediterranean, and will contribute to the implementation of the UN arms embargo.  It will identify, capture and dispose of vessels being used to smuggle and traffic people.  The key to the operation is to disrupt the activities of smugglers and traffickers in order to save lives.  A priority for our Naval Service will be ultimately to reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants by countering and challenging the criminal organisations engaged in such activities.</p> <p> Our Naval Service has done a fantastic job in its search and rescue efforts to date but we have to address the reason people need rescuing in the first place.  If we can help to disrupt smugglers and stop these criminals in their tracks, we must do so.  We cannot just accept that smuggling and trafficking is taking place and just pick up the bodies in the wreckage left behind.  We must work with our European neighbours and stop this happening.</p> <p> The question is being asked as to what the benefits are to Ireland in participating in this mission.  What are the benefits to our Defence Forces, in particular our Naval Service?  In my view, this is not about how this benefits us, rather it is about responding to an international migration crisis that we have an obligation to address.  We are part of an international community and this is not a problem we can shake off and suggest other countries take up the work.  We will be working closely with 25 other EU member states, several of which are neutral like ourselves, and fulfilling our duty as members of the European Union.</p> <p> There are also practical reasons for joining Operation Sophia if we wish to continue our work in the Mediterranean.  First, we do not want to be operating in the Mediterranean on a solo mission.  Integrated efforts with our EU neighbours is the only way to participate effectively.  In practical terms, participation in larger integrated search missions rather than on an isolated basis would allow refuelling and resupply at sea, as well as integration with air support such as medevac, offering greater protection to our troops.  I also note that the non-political Irish Maritime Forum, which is represented by professionals with a wide range of experience in the maritime domain, has written to the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Taoiseach saying it is time the Naval Service switched to operating under EUNAVFOR MED.  Irish Maritime Forum spokesman James Robinson, a former senior Naval Service officer, said that in the wake of Brexit, Ireland needs to strengthen her ties with the remaining EU member states and I agree.  Mr. Robinson said that joining Operation Sophia would demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to European co-operation to the nations whose understanding and assistance we will need when Brexit negotiations get under way in earnest.  He also said that Ireland is notable by her absence and this absence misses an important opportunity to garner diplomatic credits from the other 25 contributing EU member states as opposed to Italy alone.  It is my understanding that the Italians want the criminal human trafficking addressed at source and do not wish to be simply a drop-off destination, especially in the absence of EU burden sharing.  I can fully understand their frustration; they are doing more than their fair share in responding to this crisis.</p> <p> A criticism of Operation Sophia - I am referring specifically to the House of Lords report issued yesterday - is that not enough has been done on tackling criminal human trafficking, and that what has been done to date, namely, impounding 452 larger vessels and seeing 110 traffickers imprisoned, has diverted traffic to smaller, more vulnerable craft with consequent increased risk of deaths at sea.  It is interesting that while the House of Lords report says that Operation Sophia has failed to meet the objective of its mandate to disrupt the business model of people smuggling, it has been a humanitarian success.  It Is also worth noting that the House of Lords report cannot be viewed outside internal UK Brexit politics.</p> <p> Irish interests in Operation Sophia include that it will provide better security for Irish naval operations in the Mediterranean.  It will give greater humanitarian task effectiveness.  It will allow for improved training and experience for our Naval Service in what would be their first multinational security operation, thereby increasing scope for future deployments.  It would be a more cost effective engagement for the Irish taxpayer, assuming that there would be better supports within Operation Sophia than are possible in a unilateral mission.  With Brexit, Ireland has a visible and direct interest in demonstrating greater EU solidarity.  This is a high-profile Irish contribution.  We would be committing a seventh vessel to the current complement of six.  Ireland would be actively fulfilling two UN Security Council resolutions to which we are not currently contributing at all.</p> <p> I have been contacted by a number of NGOs and advocacy groups who have raised what I consider to be very genuine concerns in respect of Operation Sophia and our proposed participation.  I note in particular correspondence received from Amnesty International, Oxfam, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Irish Refugee Council.  I assure those groups that I have heard what they have said and have considered the points raised against our participation.  The decision to support the motion was not taken lightly and I genuinely believe it to be the right decision, having considered all arguments and information available to me.  The argument has been made that we should continue in a search and rescue role only and that this is the best use of Irish resources to save lives.  My view, however, is that we must address the problem at source and, as I said earlier, there is a reason people need to be rescued.  This is the problem we need to solve.  Granted, the best outcome would be to solve the issue as to why people are leaving their country in the first instance but we need to do all we can to stop smugglers and traffickers who are buying and selling human beings, torturing them and profiting from their misery.  This has to be stopped.</p> <p> A solely humanitarian role in my view is not sustainable in the short to medium term, particularly in light of the Italian position.  In the absence of efforts to tackle criminal human trafficking, the humanitarian crisis can only grow and worsen.  We cannot forget that this trafficking also entails forced labour and prostitution.  How can we stand by and allow this continue and do nothing?  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian efforts are strengthened and better secured within a multilateral mission.  We do better with a collective force and we will continue in our rescue role as mandated by the UN Law of the Sea.  It is not a case of either-or humanitarian versus security operations - we have to do both.  In respect of allegations of a possible mission creep, there will be no mission creep to phase 2 or 3 as this requires, for the EU and not just Ireland, a UN Security Council resolution and agreement with Libyan authorities and, on our side, agreement at EU Council level.  There are checks and balances in place and I am satisfied with them.  </p> <p> It is impossible to judge how much worse the migrant flows would have been, and the scale of additional deaths, in the absence of Operation Sophia.  We cannot know this so I do not accept suggestions that the operation has made matters worse.  Operation Sophia has directly saved nearly 34,000 lives since its commencement - more than the number rescued by NGOs themselves, which is about 30,000.  I very much commend the work of NGOs in this area.  Irish engagement will reinforce the humanitarian side of the EU&rsquo;s mission with substantial field experience, and potentially rebalance it.</p> <p> I fully trust our Defence Forces and Naval Service in their judgment that we should participate in this mission.  I fully appreciate that they have given this great consideration and do not think they took the decision lightly to advise participation in the mission.  It is, and has always been, their key objective to protect and save lives while they operate in the Mediterranean.  I have full confidence that in participating in this new mission with our European colleagues, the Irish Naval Service will play a vital role in addressing the migration crisis and aiding in the UN humanitarian effort to save lives.  This is ultimately what the operation is about.  It is naive to think that we can simply engage in a search and rescue operation on the outskirts of Operation Sophia while looking in at our other European colleagues as they do the work in which we should be participating.  It is not okay to simply accept that trafficking and smuggling of human beings will just continue on the basis that if we try to get involved, we could make matters worse.  We have to try to stop this.  It is simply not okay to go around afterwards and clean up the mess they have left.  When we consider that 25 other EU member states are currently participating, I see no reason that we should not participate also.  We are part of the European and the international community.  This is a migration crisis to which we must fully respond as best we can.  In that light, I am pleased to pledge Fianna F&aacute;il support for the motion.</p></speech>

It is a purely humanitarian search and rescue operation which, over the past two years, has seen the Irish naval personnel rescue almost 16,000 people.  The Naval Service's extraordinary and heroic efforts are a source of national pride and I wish to reiterate our unequivocal support for the important role it is playing.  I also acknowledge the Trojan work the NGOs are doing in saving lives in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Today's motion, however, seeks to alter the remit of the Naval Service by signing up to an EU military mission, EUNAVFOR MED.  It sounds great.  The EU navy force for the Mediterranean, or Operation Sophia which, while UN mandated, is being carried out under the guise of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.  This will change utterly the role of the Irish Naval Service in the Mediterranean from rescuing migrants from drowning to a more offensive role of intercepting and arresting people-trafficking criminals, smugglers and militias and destroying their boats.  Such a fundamental change in the nature of the Naval Service's operations in the Mediterranean is also a fundamental change in Irish foreign and military policy and it deserves more than the measly 40-minute debate that was initially scheduled, or indeed the 80 minutes that have now been set aside.  I urge all parties, including the Government and its Independent partners, to support our amendment to the motion, which proposes that the taking of a vote on this motion should be deferred until the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence has considered it.</p></speech>
