    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100003#A00200"><p>It is my duty as an opposition spokesperson to raise the issue of health services and the dire straits in which the services being provided across the country or not being provided are.  We now have a situation where community, hospital, primary care and mental health care services across the country are simply not able to cope with the demand.  Some 7,781 admitted patients were on trolleys in the month of August alone.  That is up 27%.  There were over 440 people on trolleys in our emergency departments yesterday, admittedly down today to 345, but still an extraordinary figure for this time of the year.  Over 65,000 people were treated on trolleys during the first six months of 2017.  By any credible stretch of the imagination, the T&aacute;naiste now has to accept that this Government, despite giving itself applause and claps on the back about the biggest budget it has provided for the health  care services, is not providing the health care services that are required.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that this Government has been lethargic, at best, in trying to deal with the challenges in the health care services, and primarily in the acute hospital setting?  We now have a situation where, week on week, we have record after record being broken with regard to overcrowding in our emergency departments and the number of people in outpatient and inpatient services is now nearly at 700,000.  Our acute hospital system is in crisis.  Couple that with challenges in primary care and we are going to have a winter in which there will be an awful lot of pressure on our emergency departments.  Elderly people in particular will be waiting inordinate periods to be admitted to hospital.  Is it now time for the Government to accept that its winter-proofing systems that have been in place for the last number of years have been an abject failure and that it requires a hands-on approach from the Minister and Government along with the Department of Health to deal with these challenges?  I do not think it is good enough for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and others to stand up and say they are providing the largest budget in the history of the State for health care.  If they are, they are failing, because it is simply not providing the services that are needed and required across the major areas, namely, the acute, primary, community care and mental health areas.  By any credible yardstick, this Government's health system or health services are failing on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that there needs to be a refocusing by the Minister for Health and the Government to prioritise the key areas of the acute hospital, the emergency departments and our primary care setting to ensure that, come the winter, we will not have hundreds of people on a daily basis in our emergency departments across the country, and primarily elderly people, which seems to be the case at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1289" speakername="Pat Gallagher" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100004#B00100"><p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for observing the time.  He has set an example for others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100004#B00200"><p>The Government is focusing on the priority areas in health.  For example, reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of the Government's key priorities.  It is for that reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in the budget, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the Minister for Health, as the Deputy will be aware, asked the HSE to develop waiting list action plans for 2017 in the areas of inpatient care, which the Deputy mentioned, and also scoliosis and outpatient services.  The inpatient, the day-case and the outpatient plans focus on reducing the number of patients who are waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and day-case treatment or for an outpatient appointment by the end of October.</p>  <p>  Working very closely with the HSE, the NTPF has been implementing waiting list initiatives to provide treatment for those who are waiting longest on the inpatient day-case waiting list.  The August 2017 day-case and inpatient waiting list figures which were published at the beginning of September show that the total number of patients waiting has fallen by over 2,000.  Every case of a person waiting is one too many but the Government is focusing on the range of initiatives which are making a difference and will make a difference in the long term.  These include, of course, the bed capacity review which is really important and the GP contract so that we can have more focus on primary care centres.</p>  <p>  Let me give Deputy Kelleher the statistics.  Some 23,000 patients have come off the inpatient day-case waiting list and over 81,900 patients have come off the outpatient waiting list.  Also, 237 scoliosis surgeries have taken place.  The NTPF is rolling out the day-case initiative as well.  That is focused on those waiting longest for day-case treatment.  Right now, 2,000 patients have accepted an offer of treatment from the NTPF.  All those initiatives are beginning to have the kind of impact we want to see.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher also mentioned the winter initiative.  There is a range of initiatives to deal with the very real increase in referrals that takes place in the winter period.  Following on from last year's winter initiative plan, the HSE, in conjunction with the Department of Health, developed a roadmap for improving the patient experience and to reduce the number of patients waiting for admission on trolleys in order to provide a better response.  Each of the hospital groups has been working to progress a very proactive integrated approach around winter resilience planning for 2017-2018 to ensure that specific plans are in place for those predictable peaks of pressure that the Deputy has spoken about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100004#B00300"><p>The day-case reductions are because of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the intervention which is part of the supply and confidence arrangement.  That is one part of policy that is working.  Unfortunately, it was a policy the Government did not want to pursue, but it is there.  It is proof that if there are imaginative ways, issues can be addressed.  When one looks at the day-case waiting list, there is a reduction solely because of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The difficulties are in the emergency departments on a continual basis.  The reason I raise this is we are now in September and if the trends continue, we will have significant problems in December, January and February - during the winter months.  We know that but there is little being done to address these particular pressure points.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste can talk about the overall budget but I refer specifically to emergency departments, the acute hospitals and primary care.  We now have a situation where the primary care services across the country simply cannot cope.  The idea that one would get an appointment the same day with one's local GP is now a thing of the past.  They are overwhelmed and under-resourced.  If the T&aacute;naiste could, she might just revisit the two issues of addressing the pressure points in the acute emergency departments and to try to come up with imaginative solutions to support primary care, primarily the GPs, so that they do not have to refer patients to hospitals as much as they are forced to at present due to lack of resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100004#B00400"><p>I repeat that the development of new primary care health centres is a priority for the Government.  As Deputy Kelleher will be aware, funding has been allocated.  The Deputy will have seen the centres that have already opened.</p><p>Clearly, that has to be a huge part of the focus in making sure there are appropriate referrals to emergency departments.  The renegotiation of the GP contract is a key part of dealing with the pressures that are very evident in GP practices throughout the country.  Attracting and retaining staff in GP practices must also be a focus in order to ensure we will have local primary care centres.  There is an absolute focus on the development and opening of new primary care centres throughout the country to deal with the pressures.  Appropriate referral is obviously one of the key parts, but there are also the initiatives that have been taken in different hospitals.  I point to what is happening in Beaumont Hospital as an example in that regard.  It is very clear that there are hospitals which are dealing with the huge pressures they are under by developing new systems of management.  They have also been given extra resources.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100005#C00300"><p>As ever.</p>  <p>  We are three weeks away from the announcement of budget 2018 which represents a real opportunity to deliver for citizens who are struggling to get by and build a life for their families but all of the signals from the Government and the Taoiseach are that they are going to pass up on this opportunity.  Instead of focusing on the crises in the health service and the provision of housing, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are engaging in a sham fight over how best to introduce unaffordable and reckless tax cuts.  It is the same old Fine Gael backed by the same old Fianna F&aacute;il.  We all know that the best way to give a break to those struggling to make ends meet, pay rent and keep a roof over their heads is not to give a tax break to put a few measly euro back in their pockets, a few measly euro that would do precious little to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis that is ruining so many lives.  It is very clear that the best way to give low and middle income workers a break is by building decent public services.  It is done by investing in the health system, delivering social and affordable homes at a level which matches the scale of the housing emergency and ensuring those with disabilities can access proper and dedicated services.  </p>  <p>  A responsible Government would reject the policies that have led to the decimation of essential services.  An irresponsible Government is one that opts to make tax cuts when public services are crumbling and people are suffering.  This is not just auction politics but also short-sighted and destructive politics.  The Government is so deluded and out of touch that it believes this is its route to electoral success.  It is about trying to buy votes.  However, the people whom the Government is trying to buy off will not be bought off so cheaply.  It has it wrong again.  Frankly, it is incredible that tax cuts versus investment in public services is even a matter of debate.  The facts on the ground, in communities and our families, should have settled that argument already.  The vast majority have had their fill of auction politics.  They want and demand decent public services, for which they are crying out.  They want children out of hotel rooms and in homes.  They want patients off trolleys and waiting lists.  They want to have the opportunity to buy their own homes.  </p>  <p>  Given the limited fiscal space, will the Government make the necessary investment in public services or will it insist on tax cuts that would further decimate the State's ability to respond to these crises?  It cannot do both.  Choosing tax cuts over investment in public services in the budget will give the clearest evidence yet that the Taoiseach, much like his predecessor, is not serious about tackling the issues which are impacting on the lives of ordinary people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100005#C00400"><p>The first thing we want to do is make sure we continue the economic progress the country has seen.  In the very first instance we have the capital which is provided by the Government.  We have taxpayers who are paying tax and because it has been managed properly, we are now in a position to invest in services, contrary to the position inherited by the previous Government three or four years ago when there was no money available to spend on services.</p><p>We have come full circle and are investing again in the services people need.  We can do this because we have an economy that is growing and developing and because there is capital to invest.  There has been substantial investment by the Government in the development of public services, including health and education services and housing, and that will continue next year.  We have prioritised large budgets for the provision of housing and health services.  There are many challenges, but we have the capital to invest which was not available previously and we will invest it in a prudent way.  We will also balance the books, which is important because we want to be able to continue to substantially increase budgets in the years ahead.  </p> <p> As I said, we will continue to invest wisely in capital projects that are needed in the provision of services; in targeted income supports, as was done in budget 2017, as well as in supporting the vulnerable and increasing the budget substantially for disability and mental health services.  We will also continue the process of tax reductions.  There would not be money to spend on services if people were not going out to work.  It is the people's money that we are spending on all of these services and they also deserve support.  As I said, we will continue the process of tax reductions.  We will also help businesses and families to plan for the future, which is important.</p> <p> We will set out our key budgetary objectives and publish a national planning framework and the ten-year capital plan, all of which will give certainty and the people can have confidence that the investment in services will continue.  That will be the focus.  It will be comprehensive and involve a 4.5% increase in the capital budget for next year which will lead to the investment people want to see in all public services.  We will favour expenditure increases over tax reductions by at least a ratio of 2:1 in line with A Programme for a Partnership Government and the confidence and supply arrangement.</p></speech>

I do not think even she is convinced by the flawed and almost perverse argument she has presented.  The people who go out to work and pay their taxes are also the ones who are casualties of the lack of investment in housing and health, child care and many other services.  They are not two competing realities.  They are one and the same and what they are telling us - I imagine they are also telling members of the Government this, unless they are living in a different or parallel universe - is that they are not prepared to tolerate any longer a position where there are more than 600,000 people on waiting lists for medical procedures; record numbers on hospital trolleys; people are unable to afford to pay their rent and people will never be able to aspire to home ownership.  They are the tax paying, working people it seems the Government will insult in the budget with &euro;1 or, if it goes along with its friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, &euro;1.50 a week or a little more according to its plan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100007#E00600"><p>Continuing the T&aacute;naiste's theme of financial prudence and reasonableness, Government sources have indicated that a salary of up to &euro;300,000 is being considered for the next Garda Commissioner.  To say the least, this is well in excess of the current salary of &euro;180,000 for the post which most people would consider a high one.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to think seriously about this proposal.  I particularly ask her to consider whether, if it was agreed, it would exacerbate the debate about high pay levels in the public service and impact on public sector pay policy generally at a particularly delicate time.</p>  <p>  There is no current review of top level pay in the public sector.  The priority, rightly in my view, is the unwinding of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation rather than a special top level salary increase.  The current salary for the position of Garda Commissioner of &euro;180,409 is graded at general secretary level 3, while the top level service payable to anybody in the public service is currently &euro;190,000, which is the salary the most senior Secretaries General and the Taoiseach enjoy.  If the salary for the next Garda Commissioner was increased substantially in the way that has been suggested, it is certain that the Judiciary would demand a similar increase for the Chief Justice or members of the Supreme Court and that would spread across the ranks of the senior Civil Service.  The ripple effect would continue across all grades.  For example, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has argued that the recruitment difficulties for nurses can only be adequately addressed through pay.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has made much the same point about vacancies both at consultancy level and in general practice.  The Government has already committed to a review of recruitment in the health sector.  Conceding an increase of this magnitude to the new Garda Commissioner would completely undermine arguments that might be made for all the other sectors who are in a queue to have significant pay increases. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I agreed two years ago that a new method of pay and conditions for senior officeholders would be put in place.  I did so in response to calls for pay increases from the Judiciary at the time, which the T&aacute;naiste will well remember.  I did so deliberately to ensure that no one individual or cohort would be able to unravel public pay policy.  Will the T&aacute;naiste advise whether the Government has now abandoned the commitment to a structured mechanism in deciding public pay at top level in the public service?  Can she set out clearly for the D&aacute;il the Government's approach to top level pay?</p></speech>

It is primarily the job of the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service, PAS, working together to find the best candidate for that job.  The Deputy quoted a salary figure, but certainly there is no decision by the Government regarding that figure, regardless of what reports may have indicated in that respect.  Clearly, the issue of recruiting the very best candidate is important and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is also examining the kinds of skills that are needed to run a large-scale, 21st century policing service, and it will be giving the Minister for Justice and Equality its views on that.</p><p> The Deputy referred to structured mechanisms.  The best structured mechanism recently was the agreement on public sector pay.  There is no question of abandoning the structured mechanisms that we have.  However, there is an issue with some jobs and there is some flexibility to attract the right candidate, whether that is to run aspects of our health service or other areas.  That will always be dealt with in a careful away.  I take the Deputy's point about the danger of setting precedents and changing the approach to top level pay in the Civil Service and elsewhere but, clearly, there are recruitment difficulties, about which every Member will be well aware, given the competition for people.  More and more we are seeing gaps in services because of the difficulties in recruitment.  This issue needs to be considered because we want the very best people to run our services.  The Deputy quoted one arena where, clearly, that is very important but there are others as well.</p> <p> The structured mechanisms are important in terms of the review of top level pay.  We have to accept that there are difficulties increasingly in filling some senior management posts.  We all want better management, whether it is in health or housing or a range of other areas.  This is an issue which the Government will consider carefully in each instance but clearly, there is a broader approach, which the Deputy has outlined, and there is no intention to depart from that.</p></speech>

I hope the T&aacute;naiste regards that all senior management roles should require that skill set.  I am no wiser about the general approach and I am even more concerned because the T&aacute;naiste said the Government will consider the issue in each case.  Is it, therefore, a matter for the head of the HSE or the Chief Justice or the head of any service to make a business case for a salary level or is there is a coherent approach to top level pay?  Will a new review of top level pay be instituted?  Will that come after the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation?  The House needs to know clearly what is the Government approach to the issue of public sector pay, particularly when the current pay round negotiated with public sector unions has not been signed by off by so many public sector workers.</p></speech>

I also said that there are difficulties in recruitment and that, on occasion, these may lead to a decision in specific circumstances where the issue of pay may have to be reconsidered but the overall approach is absolutely one of a system being in place under an agreement that is being implemented in respect of top level pay.</p>  <p>  I will have to revert to the Deputy regarding a review of top level pay.</p></speech>

He was homeless and sleeping in a tent with his partner in Bray over the weekend.  This is the third rough sleeper found dead in the past number of weeks.  I do not know the exact circumstances of this personal, human tragedy for this man and his family but it cannot be anything other than a shameful stain on this State that yet another person was living in a tent ill and was then found dead by his partner.</p><p>This has happened time and again in recent weeks against the background of an absolutely shameful housing and homelessness emergency.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look urgently at the circumstances surrounding how this could possibly have happened.  I must also ask her and her Government colleagues to reconsider the decision of the Government to vote against the Bill which proposes that we insert a right to housing into the Constitution.  That vote will be taken in a short while.  I simply cannot understand it.  I listened with dismay to the Taoiseach yesterday afternoon and afterwards the Minister and the Minister of State explain, or, more correctly, fail to explain why the Government would not listen to the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Children's Rights Alliance and all of the non-governmental organisations dealing on the front line with people who find themselves in these tragic positions.  They have stated we should insert a right to housing into the Constitution, but the Government plans to bury that proposal which was supported by 84% at the Constitutional Convention in 2014.  It wishes to "further consider" the matter, but people cannot even agree on what committee should consider it.  The Government indicates that it should be the finance committee; Deputy Barry Cowen has argued that it should be the housing committee, while Deputy Marc MacSharry has indicated that it should be the justice committee.  It sounds to me like they want the issue to be buried in any committee instead of agreeing to the proposal and inserting a right to housing into the Constitution.  It is shameful.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to seriously reconsider this decision and send a signal from the D&aacute;il today that human beings living in this state have a right to be housed in dignified, affordable accommodation and not be forced into the tragic circumstances in which so many find themselves.</p></speech>

It is because we believe people have a right to housing that we are taking the range of actions outlined last night in the House by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, with reference to the Bill.  The recommendation from the Government is that the matter should be referred to the finance committee for further discussion on the approach to be taken.</p>  <p>  Taking the key point about providing housing for individuals, that is clearly what the Government wants to and is determined to do.  It is why the budget is what it is, with billions of euro to be allocated in the next few years.  It is why the budget to tackle homelessness has doubled since 2014, rightly so.  It will be more than &euro;100 million.  The Department and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, are working very closely with all of the voluntary housing agencies.  The vast majority of the recommendations they have made to the Government are being implemented.  That is what they will state about the approach taken to dealing with homelessness.  They are supplying many of the extra emergency beds which are now available and which will be made available in the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  We have also taken the decision to establish family hubs on a short-term basis in order that families and children can be in better accommodation, with more support services to help them than they would have in emergency hotel or hostel accommodation which is seen as a temporary solution until social housing comes on stream.  The Deputy knows that there will be over 21,000 new builds next year, of which, as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, a quarter will be social houses.  We will also focus on affordable housing, although clearly that will not happen overnight.  We will use every resource we possibly can to meet the housing needs of the people.  It is a priority on which the Minister is absolutely focused.  Every action that can be taken to help people is being taken.  That is why 80 people per day are being given a housing solution to meet unmet housing needs.  We must remember that that is happening also.</p></speech>

The number of homeless people and the number of families and children in need of housing have gotten worse rather than better and the tragic deaths of people sleeping rough on the streets continue.  Why would a proposal to enshrine the right to housing as a basic human right be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach three years after the Constitutional Convention said that it should be put in the Constitution?  Perhaps the motive was revealed when I asked the Taoiseach yesterday why the Government is not supporting that proposal and he said he did not believe that everyone should be housed for free.  What on earth was the Taoiseach talking about?  Who is housed for free in this State?  Does that statement not reveal a deep-seated prejudice against people who rely on social housing and would pay their rent but cannot get social housing because the State fails to provide it?   Is that the real reason the problem is not being solved?</p></speech>

When does the Government expect to see this advanced?  Many towns outside Dublin are trying to share in the recovery experienced in the capital.  I see this particularly in my home town, Navan, where the archaic system is thwarting any entrepreneurs trying to grow their businesses.  When will it be considered and advanced?  Does the T&aacute;naiste think it right that in the past year business contributions to the running of local councils have increased to &euro;1.5 billion, 36% of the income up from 29% in 2010 because councils are forced to increase rates due to rising costs.</p></speech>

I will not delay on this and I will not fire Scuds left, right and centre, but this is very revealing.  In 2012, &euro;4.57 million was returned to the HSE from County Roscommon.  In 2013, a sum of &euro;6.9 million was returned to the HSE and in 2014 a sum of &euro;6.19 million was returned.  This amounts to more than &euro;17 million.  The report revealed that people died in the county.  There are heartbroken families.  Recently, a woman sat in my clinic and cried.</p></speech>

The Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is on the long list.  The Government had given some indication that it would legislate for the prohibition of micro-plastics in that Bill.  I would like the Government to clarify when it will legislate for that.  I have a Bill that is due before committee.  The ten-week window has long since passed.

There still should be a system whereby there is a full examination of the various employments individuals were in over their working life span.  That enabled the Department to make a determination that if persons did not have contributions to show for that period, they were accredited with the contributions and, as a result, were able to qualify for a higher rate pension.  I have raised this in the House, although not the Minister or her predecessor, but over the years, that there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the relevant section to go back and include all of the employments that persons might have held to determine whether or not contributions were due arising from those employments.  In some cases, even in a reply to parliamentary question, the follow-up does not specifically deal in detail with the situation.  There have been instances in the past where up to ten contributions have been discovered, albeit late in the day, they have been brought to the attention of the relevant section and, subsequently, the individual applicant has been able to avail of the benefit of those contributions.</p>  <p>  We had a discussion last night about fraud and alleged fraud, etc., and I want to deal with it in some detail.  Of course, we need to be always conscious not to give the impression that the House in any way encourages fraud but there is always the question that payments, inadvertently, because they are made directly into a bank account, post office savings account or whatever nowadays as it is beneficial in terms of efficiency, do not always carry with them the information made available to the section - the information may not have been carried forward from the section or transferred to the relevant person who is responsible - with the result that the person's payment continued when he or she did not have an entitlement.  That needs to be streamlined somewhat in an effort to ensure that recipients are not faced with a bill for an overpayment through no fault of their own.  It is important because in some cases it can cause quite an amount of hardship afterwards when the individual is faced with this request for repayment.  Of course, the applicant will be aggrieved because he or she did not cause the problem in the first place.</p>  <p>  There are a number of issues I will address in the remaining minute and a half.  There will be an opportunity to look in detail at the issues that need to be dealt with in quite an amount of the social welfare legislation and to look at anomalies and to deal with them because they have been in need of review and revision for some time.  There are many traps whereby people are excluded from the system.  I do not want go into any great deal on it because I hope to deal with it again under a different heading.  I refer to the question of the spouse or partner who, even though he or she worked to a considerable extent in a business and made a major contribution, does not qualify for a non-contributory pension at all because his or her spouse may have a private pension.</p><p>There is a need to review those particular glitches which cause problems for some people of pension age.  At a vulnerable time in their lives, such people need a bit of reassurance and I hope the Minister will be able to take the opportunity to evaluate the position and address those issues.</p></speech>

The ambition set out by the Taoiseach to double Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025 reflects the scale and the complexity of the challenges we face in the years ahead.  These include Brexit related challenges but also those from growing protectionism internationally, the need to continue the fight for justice, peace, equality and for sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Our response includes the further diversification of our markets for trade and investment and the building of alliances to underpin the rules based international trading system that has served smaller countries like Ireland so well.  It must also include a renewed commitment to the fight against global poverty and hunger, protecting human rights, and to United Nations peacekeeping efforts.  Now, more than ever, Ireland needs a strong voice internationally to promote our values and interests.  We are determined to play our part in support of multilateralism at this time of significant global instability, as reflected in our candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2021/2022.</p>  <p>  Following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has begun to examine options to expand significantly our footprint and influence internationally, in consultation with other Departments and agencies.  This includes augmenting our existing diplomatic presence overseas as well as, in some cases, opening new missions where most impactful.  At the same time we have to ensure that the vital service and policy supports at headquarters are up to the task.  Any additional expenditure must be consistent with value for money principles and provide clear benefits for the State.</p>  <p>  Decisions will also be guided by Ireland Connected, the trade and investment strategy launched last March.  This whole-of-Government framework provides direction for trade and investment priorities to 2025.  At its heart is the need for policy alignment, co-ordinated action and complementarity in delivering our goals.

With all due respect, I know the Minister of State is stepping in for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, today but the response she has given is pretty much the same response I received to a parliamentary question last week.  I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a commitment to increase our diplomatic and business footprint across the world.  Currently we have 61 embassies, seven multilateral missions and 11 consulate generals.  We have just over 80 offices across the world and the Taoiseach has said that he wants to double that.  If we double that, we will have 160 offices.  What plans have actually been put in place?  What costings have been done?  Are there any priorities and if so, where?  He said that the time span runs to 2025.  When will we see the first new embassies open?  I very much fear that this is just another one of Leo Varadkar's announcements, made for publicity.  He was in Canada with his friend and he announced that he was going to double our global footprint.  We have asked several serious questions.  While we welcome the announcement, we are trying to get a handle on whether there is anything behind this but in this instance, there does not appear to be.  I want to know what meetings have taken place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Have we any draft plan?  Will the Minister be submitting a plan to the foreign affairs committee or to this House for discussion?  When will the first new embassies actually open?</p></speech>

We have 961 diplomatic staff employed abroad and have relations with 178 different countries.  When the Taoiseach speaks about doubling our footprint, that does not necessarily mean doubling the number of offices or doubling the budget.  It is about ensuring that what we have currently is working and that we can make things work more efficiently.  For example, in a city where we have four or five different offices operating in four or five different buildings, we might be able to make that work better by bringing everybody together and making sure they are connected properly.</p>  <p>  In terms of the time frame and making that work, the Department is currently working on a review of what we currently have, what is working and what is not, as well as examining where we can expand our footprint.  We expect the initial report to be published by November.  I am not sure whether that would go directly to a committee or whether it would be published by the Minister himself, but we should see the initial report by November.</p></speech>

In any person's language, doubling is doubling and it is as simple as that.  We lag behind comparable European countries like Denmark or Belgium in terms of the size of our network of embassies.  When we heard the Taoiseach's announcement, it was something that we welcomed but now we are hearing that doubling does not necessarily mean that.  It might mean a consolidation, using offices differently and so on.  What I would really like to know is whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was actually made aware in advance that the Taoiseach was going to make the announcement, given that it has massive implications for his Department.  Is work underway to identify regions, countries or markets for Ireland to expand into?  Have additional resources been allocated for next year to start this doubling of the footprint?  The response from the Minister of State today tells me that there is nothing behind this announcement.  That is not a great surprise, I might add but if the Taoiseach and the Government are committing to expanding the diplomatic footprint, they must do it and show us the plan.  They cannot just announce it when they are abroad to make themselves look good in front of another prime minister.  This is too serious.  Ireland needs to look further afield, particularly with Brexit happening.  We need to be looking at new markets and I would welcome that but we need concrete answers.</p></speech>

We need to promote our own interests proactively on the international stage, particularly in the context of Brexit.  The Taoiseach has spoken very openly about the possibility of offices in New Zealand, Vancouver and Mumbai, to name but a few.  We cannot get into the specifics at the moment because we do not yet know the locations for new missions.  These locations will be identified on the basis of where they will have the greatest impact and the greatest potential to deliver in terms of the State's economic and political interests.  There will obviously be some element of additional cost involved and that will have to be discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A plan is being put in place.  A review is underway at the moment and the Minister will be able to announce the initial stages of that review by November.</p></speech>

What progress has been made and in what areas?  What challenges still present in terms of issues that relate to Ireland?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-21a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092100018#R02000"><p>Obviously, we had quite an indepth discussion on this earlier this morning, during which we also heard the personal views of Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, MEP.  That said, I will outline the current position.  There have been three rounds of negotiations to date, with the most recent round concluding on 31 August.  As this is the first phase of negotiations, and in line with the agreed sequencing, the focus has been on the withdrawal issues of citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement, other more technical separation issues and the issues unique to Ireland.  Both the EU and UK have used these early rounds of negotiations to clarify their respective positions, highlighting the areas of agreement and divergence.</p><p>Discussions on several issues have been reasonably constructive to date, with some progress being made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and the other separation issues.  However, it is clear that difficult and complex issues remain, above all in regard to the financial settlement.  It is the area in which the least amount of progress has been made.  Although the UK has accepted that it will have financial obligations to honour on its departure, it has not yet advanced a more concrete position on the issue and has argued that its obligations are moral, not legal. </p> <p> It is imperative that sufficient progress is made on this issue, as well as on all of the other withdrawal issues, in order for the European Council to be able to make a decision regarding the opening of parallel discussions on the framework for future relations.  It will be in the second phase that trade and sectoral issues, including the question of transitional arrangements, will be discussed.  Given that these issues are of crucial importance to Ireland and our economy, the Government wants to see phase 2 begin as quickly as possible.  However, unless the UK demonstrates greater and more constructive engagement on these issues in the next two rounds of negotiations, it is unlikely that the European Council on 19-20 October will be in a position to decide on whether sufficient progress has been achieved in the first phase of the negotiations.  The Deputy will be aware that the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, will give a speech tomorrow.  While we can speculate as to what might be in that speech it is not until it has been made that we will be able to work out what implications it will have on the negotiations due to commence next week.</p></speech>

There is a focus on Ireland now because it is one of the three areas that forms part of the current negotiations, namely, the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland.  The Minister of State has rightly recognised that there has been positive movement on citizens' rights.  There may be an announcement tomorrow by Prime Minister May in respect of the financial settlement or the divorce obligations, as they are named by the European Union.  If that happens, it is possible that Ireland will fall down the pecking order in terms of priorities because the discussion will then move towards trade and the broader issue of trade between Europe and the United Kingdom.  This will present challenges and so we need to get as many concessions now as we possibly can in respect of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the Commission's paper in respect of Ireland in terms of its reference to protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the unique circumstances for Ireland.  Earlier today, we heard Mr. Verhofstadt say that the North should remain in the customs union but that is not the position of the British Government.  What we need to hear from the Irish Government is that it fully supports this and that it is a red line issue.  Whatever about the European Commission and others, this must be a red line issue such that the Irish Government will ensure it will not sign up to it, and in fact will use its veto, if necessary, to ensure that the North does not withdraw from the customs union and that we get full protections for the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

We are very appreciative of the level of support that the task force and our partners have shown for Ireland's unique concerns.  Mr. Barnier, following his meeting with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on 4 September reiterated that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are the EU&rsquo;s interests.  The Irish Government has clearly stated that any return to a hard border or physical border for the island of Ireland would be detrimental.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been working very closely with Mr Barnier and his team to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s position is fully reflected in the negotiations.  As this process continues and irrespective of what is announced in the statement tomorrow by Prime Minister May, we will continue to engage closely with them in the weeks and months ahead.  Our officials are engaged on a daily basis with Mr. Barnier and his task force team.  Our aim is to ensure that Ireland's priorities are front and centre in the negotiations.  It is clear, following on from the first round of negotiations and the publication of a paper around dialogue between North and South of this island, that the manner in which we are proceeding is working.  We will continue to engage in that way. </p></speech>

What we are trying to work out is what will be the end game.  In other words, what will be in the withdrawal agreement.  For Ireland, it is a red line that the North remains in the customs union because if it does not then we will be dealing with a border and an EU frontier on the island of Ireland and all talk of open borders and frictionless borders becomes a nonsense.  This must be a red line issue for Ireland.  Will the Minister of State confirm that this is also a red line issue for the Government?</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a proposal that the only way to protect the Good Friday Agreement in its entirety is to incorporate it as a protocol into the withdrawal agreement.  This means that the Good Friday Agreement would have full legal protection and remain within the European Union and thereby citizens in the North would have access to the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights.  We cannot cherry-pick the Good Friday Agreement and so it must, in its entirety, be incorporated as a protocol attached to the withdrawal agreement.  Is this also the position of the Irish Government and is it an issue it will press with the Commission? </p></speech>

That said, the Government would prefer if the UK remained within the European Union and that it would remain in the Single Market and the customs union.  Following on our meeting earlier in this Chamber it is clear that the most positive outcome would be for Northern Ireland and the UK to have the closest possible relationship to their current relationship, which would include the UK remaining within the customs union and Single Market.  We cannot make that decision for the UK.  It is a decision it will have to take itself.  However, the UK has again stated that it is committed to maintaining the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  In terms of imaginative solutions, at this moment in time this seems like the most practical solution to make sure that we maintain the peace that, as stated this morning by Mr. Verhofstadt, is so fragile. </p></speech>

What contingency plans does the Government have in place across any or all of the Departments specifically to deal with a no deal or disorderly exit of the UK from the EU?</p></reply>

A failure to reach such an agreement, resulting in a disorderly withdrawal, would, I believe and I think we all believe is now universally accepted including in the UK, be hugely damaging for the UK and for the EU, most particularly Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is therefore incumbent on all sides to act responsibly and to approach the negotiations in a constructive, positive and ambitious frame of mind, with a willingness to compromise. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus is on working with our EU partners and the EU institutions to ensure that the negotiations proceed in a positive manner, with a view to making sufficient progress on the withdrawal issues so that we can move on to discussing in parallel the future EU-UK relationship, including as regards trade.  The need for effective transitional arrangements is also now very broadly understood. </p>  <p>  At a national level, the Government&rsquo;s National Risk Assessment 2017, which was published by the Department of the Taoiseach on 29 August following a public consultation, acknowledges the significance of risk arising from Brexit and that Brexit represents an overarching challenge that could have far-reaching impacts on nearly all aspects of national life.  It identifies areas where Brexit poses a specific risk, particularly in relation to the economy.  The national risk assessment provides a systematic overview of strategic risks facing the country and is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management that is already conducted within Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  As a priority, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I continue to work with colleagues across Government to deepen our understanding of the exact consequences of the range of different scenarios.  These scenarios include one where no agreement is reached. </p>  <p>  By agreement between the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, new cross-departmental co-ordination structures, chaired at very senior level by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are being put in place and will be fully operational next week.  One of the top priorities will be to develop and pull together the work already done on the effects of a disorderly Brexit and what steps could be taken in response.</p></speech>

What I have taken from it is that there are no contingency plans in place but there are groups meeting for the first time next week to put them in place.</p><p>While that is better than nothing - it is better that these groups are meeting than not meeting - the Brexit vote took place over a year ago and the idea that Government and official committees would start meeting in late September 2017 to begin planning contingencies is appalling.  We have heard from the Government the repeated phrase that Brexit has not happened yet, but for anyone trading with the United Kingdom it has happened.  Am I right in surmising that there are no contingency plans in place and that the committees will start meeting about contingency plans next week?  If that is the case, when will the House expect to see draft contingency plans for discussion?</p></speech>

Very shortly after the referendum last year, the Department of the Taoiseach convened essentially a Cabinet of Ministers and cross-departmental officials to discuss the possible implications, examine how we can mitigate the impact of Brexit, and what the challenges will be within individual Departments but also to consider the possible advantages, if there are any, in that regard.  Only last week, the Deputy attended a new stakeholder forum, which is clearly cross-departmental, cross-industry and, importantly, cross-party to make sure that the work that has been done by the various industries, Government agencies and by Departments comes together, that we work together, share and speak with one voice.  At that meeting it was clear that we are all on the same page.</p>  <p>  Regarding the putting of structures in place, last year budget 2017 allowed for certain factors with respect to this year's budget, most significantly in the agricultural sector but also in other areas.  Budget 2018, which will be announced in a few weeks, will certainly contain elements that will support the effects being experienced currently and what effects might come down the road depending on the type of outcome we will have from Brexit. </p></speech>

We should have contingency plans because we do not know what will happen, but we do not have them in place.  I will give the Minister of State a brief example.  I met the British under-aecretary for energy last week in London and he told me that Irish officials in the Department with responsibility for energy have been told not to engage with their British counterparts on developing a contingency plan for energy.  As matters stand, if we reach a no-deal situation in 18 months' time, there is no legal framework by which the British can sell us energy, which means the lights would go off in Ireland.  We need a contingency plan.  We need a legal agreement in place, which the officials would have examined and the politicians would have reviewed and debated that provides that if we hit a worse case scenario where Britain tumbles out of the EU and there is no agreement on a single energy market that we can take out an agreement we have put in place in order that the lights can stay on here.  That is what is at stake here.  When can we expect to see some of this?  Does the Minister of State agree that our officials need to engage with their UK counterparts to start putting emergency legal frameworks and contingency plans in place?</p></speech>

The Deputy pointed to the energy sector.  Energy is a core sectoral policy domain of the European Union.  It is one of the key links between Ireland and the UK.  To focus on Ireland's energy needs in this context, it poses particular challenges with Brexit on the horizon.  We have set out four key energy priorities in regard to Brexit - first, maintaining trade and secure supplies of energy between the UK and member states; second, maintaining the single electricity market across the Island of Ireland; third, accommodating Ireland's ability to meet the EU obligations; and, fourth, supporting energy infrastructure.  Each Department is examining what the possible challenges will be coming down the line, what the implications will be with a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit and no Brexit, and what possible actions will need to be taken and put in to place.  All that work has been done.  Departments have not been sitting on their hands waiting to see whether we will have a hard Brexit.  While some of those have not come together in the current format in terms of next week, a great deal of work has already been done, and, in that respect, I believe, it is a matter of joining up the dots.</p></speech>

The Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Rakhine State, in particular the ongoing violence which has been taking place following the attacks which were undertaken by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army militants on 25 August.  The excessive response by the security forces in response to these attacks is deeply troubling.  It is critical that an immediate end should be brought to the violence in Rakhine State.  It has led to a severe humanitarian crisis both within Myanmar, and across the border in Bangladesh, which is seeking to manage the humanitarian needs of well over 400,000 refugees.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, issued a statement on 15 September in which he called on the security forces to de-escalate the situation, to respect international human rights law, and to ensure the protection of all civilians in the affected area.  Along with other EU member states, Ireland has consistently urged the Government of Myanmar to restore access to Rakhine State by humanitarian actors and media organisations.  We have also called on the Government of Myanmar to allow access to the UN fact-finding mission to the country. </p>  <p>  Going beyond this immediate crisis, it is clear that there is a need to comprehensively tackle the long-standing drivers of the tensions which have existed in Rakhine State against the Rohingya community.  In this context, Ireland urges the Government of Myanmar to take forward the recommendations which have been set out by the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission on Rakhine State as soon as possible.  These measures provide the strongest path forward for the long-term peace and development for all communities in the region.</p></speech>

To describe what is happening as excessive violence by the Myanmar state is a significant understatement.  What is happening appears to be ethnic cleansing carried out by the Myanmar military in collusion with Buddhist chauvinist mobs.  The consequences are very shocking.  More than 400,000 have fled in the last month into neighbouring Bangladesh and 20,000 are being forced to leave each day, according to the International Organization for Migration.  UNICEF has stated that 250,000 children have left Myanmar in the last month, and that is on top of the broader repression and oppression over the Rohingya people.</p>  <p>  Real questions have to be asked and a light shone on the role of Aung San Suu Kyi in this.  She is portrayed in sections of media of being stuck between a rock and a hard place.  In reality, she has been covering up for these brutal acts by the Myanmar state.  She was the one who coined the term "fake rape" to describe the violence against women that was taking place from those linked to that state.</p></speech>

Ireland absolutely supports the democratic transition which is currently under way in Myanmar following the elections in 2015.  It is important we address the root causes of the issues in the Rakhine State.  That is fundamental to ensuring the peace and the socio-economic development for all the communities in the region.  As a Government, we very much welcome the commitment that the State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, has made in dealing with the root causes of the problems facing the region through the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  In terms of what we are doing in this regard, on 15 September the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, issued a statement again in which he expressed deep concern about the situation.  The Government is also raising concerns through our bilateral contacts with the Government of Myanmar via our participation at the EU and the UN.  Ireland's embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar, is monitoring the situation closely and the ambassador there has raised our concerns again and again regarding the situation in the Rakhine State with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs during a visit to the country in January.  We are keeping in close communication in respect of what is happening.</p></speech>

They are a severely oppressed ethnic minority and they are not recognised as such, unlike 135 recognised ethnic groups in Myanmar.  They have been denied citizenship under the 1982 law.  The government presents them as having come from Bangladesh, despite being a traditional, long-standing element of what was formerly Burmese society.  Unfortunately, Aung San Suu Kyi got the votes of ethnic minorities and those who hoped for a break from the old military rule but she has been completely incorporated into a crony capitalist, military system with the increasing dominance of China.  The Government should support the call for her Nobel Peace Prize and for the freedom of the city of Dublin to be taken from her.  I support those on Dublin City Council who are trying to do that.</p></speech>

We very much welcome the government's announcement on 12 September of the formation of the implementation committee to take this forward.  When the time comes, it is critical that the refugees and many of those to whom the Deputy referred who have fled their homes in the Rakhine State are also allowed to return.  The Government has called on the government of Myanmar to end its discriminatory policies and practices towards the Rohingya people and to take comprehensive steps to address the root causes of the situation.  We in Ireland understand that building peace and trust takes time and we are particularly aware that respect for human rights and access to livelihoods for all these communities is central to enabling long-term peace and stability.</p></speech>

I am aware of reports of appalling conditions currently faced by migrants in Libya.</p>  <p>  The security situation in Libya is fragile, and the government has only partial control of the territory, which limits the capacity of the international community to ensure accountability in response to reports of abuses.</p>  <p>  At the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, Ireland expressed deep concern at the conditions experienced by migrants in detention centres in Libya.  EU Foreign Ministers adopted Council conclusions in July, which urge the Libyan authorities to improve humanitarian access to and conditions in detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention.</p>  <p>  The EU has a number of initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants in Libya, in particular inside detention centres.  The EU also supports the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration, IOM, to ensure that there are adequate reception facilities for migrants.  The EU also provides training and other support to enhance the border management capacities of the Libyan authorities.  Total EU support to these initiatives amounts to &euro;182 million.</p>  <p>  Bringing real improvements to the situation of migrants in Libya will require restoration of political stability, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country.  Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p>  <p>  The fight to reduce poverty in countries of origin, which is one of the main drivers of large irregular migratory flows, remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.</p></speech>

I tabled a Topical Issue matter on this a few months ago and the then Minister said the EU would closely monitor the migrant issue because it recognised the difficulties on the ground.  Months later, the horror continues, as documented in a recent report by Amnesty International and by medical teams from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, who are telling us about cases of torture, sexual violence and rape, forced labour and extortion.  The EU, therefore, is not meeting its international obligations, which are to protect and to assist people in need.  European policy is exposing refugees and migrants to awful conditions and violations in these detention centres.  At the next FAC, will Ireland be a voice advocating a review of this policy of containment?</p></speech>

People are making huge profits from smuggling and we need to this be brought under greater control.  The EU has a number of initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya, in particular inside detention centres.  It also provides training, including in international humanitarian law and rights and gender issues, and other support to enhance the border management capacities of the Libyan authorities.  The Union also supports the work of the UNHCR and the IOM.  Of the &euro;182 million provided for migration-related projects, Ireland has provided &euro;9.5 million to support the International Committee of the Red Cross this year.  Ireland is very much supportive of the measures that are being put in place.  However, the most important step in ensuring better conditions for migrants in Libya is the formation of a functioning government, which can restore order in the country.  Through the EU, Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p></speech>

There is also a need for monitoring of the training of the coast guard personnel in order that we know exactly what work they are doing because there have been difficulties in this regard as well.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding, according to a reply I received some time ago, &euro;90 million was provided for the protection of migrants; &euro;4.8 million for protection activities; and &euro;42 million for socioeconomic development at municipal and local government level.  This was on top of an earlier &euro;120 million allocation.  There is a need for an exact breakdown of where that money is going because the Amnesty International report and the MSF medical teams are telling us that the horror is continuing and these detention centres are not the answer.</p></speech>

Given the particularly difficult situation in Libya, the monitoring and evaluation of programmes is very much subject to a number of other measures regarding good delivery and proper reporting.  These include the fact that beyond the obligation of partner organisations to report regularly on the implementation of the projects the Deputy mentioned, third party monitoring will also be conducted.  In addition, the European Commission can conduct additional<i>ad ho</i>c monitoring and should conditions on the ground not allow for proper implementation, further measures can be taken, including the suspension of programme activities.  These are being closely monitored but I share the Deputy's concerns.  People are experiencing horrendous conditions and others are making huge profits from the situation the Libyan government finds itself in.  We will do everything we can to work with the government to make sure a stable government is in place and to ensure we continue to support and provide aid.  I will get the breakdown for the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Ireland enjoys a close relationship with Spain.  These relations are deeper and more textured than simply involving periodic government-to-government relations or developing trade ties or occasional encounters at multilateral events.  Our close friendship has at its heart an empathy which is nurtured by generations of contacts between our peoples and what happens in Spain is of great interest to our Spanish friends in the society we represent.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the recent developments in Spain regarding Catalonia.  Constitutional and political arrangements in any country of the European Union are matters to be determined by their own citizens through their own democratic institutions in adherence with the rule of law.

It is the democratically elected regional government of Catalonia that has called the referendum which is a democratic act.  In Catalonia the vast majority of people from all backgrounds - measured at over 80% in a recent opinion poll - support the calling of the referendum.  That is unlike the example in the North, where the legacy of the Troubles remains and sectarian divisions between the two communities are predominant.  This is essentially a question of democracy and the right of the people to decide.  The Spanish state is made up of many nationalities and the question is whether the Irish Government stands with the European Union in supporting the horrific anti-democratic repression that is taking place; it is occupation and a denial of the democratic right of the people in Catalonia.  Does the Irish Government side with those who seek to exercise that democratic right?</p></speech>

We allowed the Scottish people and the referendum system decide.  As I stated earlier in the House in reply to a parliamentary question, the Government's position is that the constitutional and political arrangements in any country of the European Union are matters to be determined by citizens through their own democratic institutions and in adherence with the rule of law.  I have stated that what happens in Spain is very much of interest to us, but the issues in hand are domestic; therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on matters internal to Spain.</p></speech>

I am calling on it to recognise that the people have the right to decide and that the referendum should go ahead without horrific repression by the Spanish state that is seeking to shut it down.  There are coercive elements in the Spanish state constitution such as Article 155 which denies the national and democratic rights of the people.  We stand with our brothers and sisters in our sister organisations in the Spanish state and Catalonia for the unity of working people in Catalonia and people across the Spanish state in defence of democratic and national rights.  We stand against the right-wing and repressive Rajoy government.  This is about ordinary people on the ground and those who are struggling.  They are building a major school student strike on 28 September and dockers have rightly refused to assist police boats in Barcelona port.  Others are pushing for a one-day general strike in Catalonia and the Spanish state to defend the democratic rights under threat.</p></speech>

The British Government has on three occasions ignored the unanimous requests of Members of a sovereign parliament.  I appeal to the Minister of State and her colleagues in government to pursue again as strongly as possible with the British Government, particularly the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Foreign Secretary, the argument that the least they could do to try to see justice achieved for so many victims is ensure an independent, international judicial figure would have access to all files and papers on those awful atrocities.</p></reply>

Dealing with long outstanding issues related to the legacies of the conflict in Northern Ireland is of the utmost importance to the Government.  A Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This year 17 May marked the 43rd anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which saw the biggest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  Deputy Charles Flanagan who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade participated on behalf of the Government in the commemoration ceremony that day and in addressing the commemoration ceremony he reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s determination to continue and complete our efforts to seek the truth of those awful events of 17 May 1974.</p>  <p>  The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  The motions call on the British Government to allow access, as correctly noted by the Deputy, by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of the all-party D&aacute;il motions and has consistently raised the matter with the British Government.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has spoken directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, about the matter and is actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on it, as are officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  The Minister has also advised the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and this House and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and will pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by the Deputy and the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

She referred to the former Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, with whom I had much engagement and his officials on this issue which I have already mentioned it to the new Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I hope we can maintain that contact and dialogue which are representative of views in this House.</p><p>The Minister of State has correctly indicated that the motions were approved unanimously in the House in 2008, 2011 and 2016.  They referred to the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay's Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of S&eacute;amus Ludlow in County Louth.  As we know, nobody has been brought to justice for committing these desperate atrocities.  The Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, a loyalist group, claimed responsibility for the bombings, but there are credible allegations that elements of the British security forces colluded with it in the bombings.  Anne Cadwallader in her book, <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>, refers to 120 murders committed by loyalist paramilitaries and indicates that clear evidence is available that some of them were armed from Ulster Defence Regiment depots.</p><p>It is utterly reprehensible and unacceptable that the British Government will not heed the unanimous motions passed in this House and sovereign parliament.  We are asking it to release the files and papers to an independent and international judicial figure who could carry out some work and conduct some research.  It is deplorable, as the Minister of State and all of the rest of us in the House know, that the families who have suffered so much for so long are seeing no justice in the case.  I ask the Minister of State to bring the message to her Government colleagues that we want this matter to be prioritised in negotiations with the British Government.  I know many of the victims, people who were injured.  The way they have been treated by the British Government and its agencies during the years has been reprehensible.</p></speech>

There have been several appalling cases from the Troubles where truth and justice were secured only after decade-long campaigns by the victims, their families, civil society and government.  That should not be the case and families should not be put through that, in particular for decades.</p>  <p>  I wish to restate the Government's absolute commitment to doing this and ensuring that there is justice for the Dublin-Monaghan bombing campaign.  That is reflected in the programme for Government and in the Government's consistent action and engagement on the matter.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has said that he will continue to press the matter with party leaders and cross-party groups.  Senior officials from the Irish and British Governments have been mandated to explore options to find a way forward on the issue.  That work is continuing.  They are working diligently to try to ensure that an end is reached.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Government, I reiterate our full commitment to getting a resolution to the issue.</p></speech>

It was a trip that some of them had been making for over a decade.  By 5.30 a.m. that morning, four of those people - Elaine Daly, Stephen McCloskey, Joan Nolan and Fidelma Bonass - had been deported on spurious grounds of preventing illegal immigration and a danger to public safety.  That is an outrage and I ask what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing in this regard.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was notified immediately by one of the individuals and we have since received letters from each of them about the incident.  The leader of the group has led study groups to the West Bank for over ten years, involving a total of 17 tour groups and over 400 people.  These groups met a range of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs and other interlocutors and studied issues on the ground relating to the occupation of the West Bank.  As usual, she had advised the Department of the dates and itinerary of the tour in advance so that our missions would be aware of a large group of citizens touring the area.</p>  <p>  No detailed reason for refusing admission to Israel was given to them other than a generic explanation that it was for immigration reasons and, in the case of the leader, Ms Daly, also because of unspecified public security, public safety or public order considerations. Thirty-three of the group entered Israel but unfortunately these four people were deported.</p>  <p>  No report or allegation has ever been made to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of any legitimate concerns about the activities of these study groups.  The group leader has also stated that she has never taken part in any demonstration in Palestine, nor have any of the groups' programmes included attendance at a demonstration. </p>  <p>  Without a more specific explanation, it is difficult not to conclude that the exclusion of these persons is part of the ongoing effort to suppress scrutiny and criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank. </p>  <p>   The Ambassador in Tel Aviv has called to the Israeli Foreign Minister and requested an explanation for this action.  We are awaiting a response and I will ensure that the Deputy and the persons concerned are notified when we hear more.  It is currently a Jewish high holiday so there is a delay in that process but as soon a response is received Deputy Daly and the individuals concerned will be informed.</p></reply>

I strongly echo her comments that the only conclusion that can be drawn from the order was that it was an attempt by the Israeli state to avoid scrutiny of its activities in the West Bank.  I reiterate that the group leader, my sister, is non-political and has never been involved in any political party, although that would not be a reason to exclude her, and has never attended any protest.  She is the only Irish person to have been honoured with an honorary citizenship of Bethlehem for her work, which involves inviting people to go to the West Bank to see what goes on there and to meet Israelis and Palestinians.</p>  <p>  Of the others who were deported, Stephen McCloskey is a director of an NGO in Belfast on educational and global studies who has published many articles and has been to Gaza many times.  Joan Nolan has been to Palestine eight times.  She is a community activist who does voluntary work and is non-political.  Fidelma Bonass has brought Palestinian cultural groups to Ireland.  It is an outrage that they were treated like this.  It is a trip they make every year.  Plans were made to take time off work and give up their valuable holidays in order to bring support, money to the local economy and products, clothes and assistance to women's and children's groups in Palestine.  I hope the Department follows up on this issue.</p></speech>

It may be that the refusal was on foot of legislation enacted earlier this year which provided for admission to be refused to any person who has advocated or is a member of a group which has advocated a policy of boycott in relation to Israel or Israeli settlements in Palestine, known as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, BDS, movement.  All four of the individuals were asked about alleged previous attendance at a demonstration in Palestine.  However, I am not sure that either explanation was justified.  I am happy to restate that the Government is not aware of any concerns about the actions of the individuals or their group such as could form a legitimate basis for concern or exclusion.  We must first allow the Israeli authorities to respond to our inquiry before commenting definitively but it does not currently appear that there was any legitimate reason for those persons' expulsion.</p></speech>

I am very glad to hear that.  I hope that is followed through because I am satisfied there will not be any contradictory evidence that would legitimately prohibit these people from visiting the West Bank.  If one considers that this is how Irish citizens with valid Irish passports are treated for supposed immigration offences, it gives one an idea of the daily struggle that Palestinian citizens suffer in that region at the hand of the Israeli state.  To scream and shout at a man and three mature women - I hope they are not insulted by that categorisation - who have never been involved in any difficulty before is outrageous.</p>  <p>  The work those people have done is very important.  As the Minister of State said, over 400 Irish people have taken part in those visits with no agenda other than for people to see the situation in Palestine with their own eyes.  I hope that when a response comes from the Israeli authorities it can be followed up because it is interesting that hundreds of Israelis get visas to come and work in this State every year and they are not treated in that manner.  It was disgraceful.</p></speech>

I offer my support and that of Fianna F&aacute;il for what has been outlined by Deputy Daly.  When I was contacted by two of those affected, who are constituents of mine, I contacted Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on foreign affairs, who in turn contacted the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the ambassador.</p>  <p>  Human rights and their infringement have to be hugely important for all Members.  It is unacceptable that these four people who have given so much time to support Palestinians and make the world aware of the problems there were deported.  I have been to Palestine and Israel.  It is very important that the message of what is happening in Palestine gets out to the world.  The four people that were deported have been doing a huge service for us all.</p>  <p>  Approximately 25 years ago I organised for a group of young people from Kildare to go to Northern Ireland to see the unionist and nationalist traditions and areas.  I was reminded of that when Ms Elaine Daly contacted me in regard to her deportation.  I could have been stopped from going into Northern Ireland because I had organised that fact-finding mission.

As a Government, however, we need to closely observe what has happened here and the fact they are possibly pursuing a more aggressive policy on deportations.  This impacts on the four individuals now.  They may apply to return to Israel in the future but we expect that they would be excluded again.</p>  <p>  Looking at the bigger picture, this Government has on several occasions commented on its concern about increasing moves to hinder the work of Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organisations, NGOs, the presence of international NGO workers and even international parliamentary and ministerial visits to parts of the West Bank and Gaza.  A state which can stand over its actions needs do none of these things.  When we get a response outlining the reason for this we will respond to these individuals.</p></speech>

Ireland will be the 16th country in the world, and the 12th EU member state, to adopt a national plan on business and human rights.  The publication of the national plan meets a commitment made by the previous Government in June 2014 to give effect to the UN guiding principles on business and human rights which were adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2011.  The guiding principles are a globally recognised framework which outline the roles of states and businesses in protecting human rights<font color="#004080"> </font>as well as providing for access to remedy when they are breached.</p><p>The national plan being launched is the result of a collaborative effort, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and involving extensive consultations with business, civil society organisations and other Departments and agencies.  Its goal is to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas by all Irish business enterprises.  It brings together two of our national priorities: our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and to being one of the best countries in the world in which to do business.  The implementation of the actions identified in the national plan will be a collective endeavour.  In this regard, several actions will be assigned to <font color="#004080">a </font>business and human rights implementation group to be established comprising representatives from Government, the business community and civil society.</p></reply>

The working outline was produced in 2015 and last year it was said it would appear in the first quarter of 2017.  I hope it happens as the Minister of State says it will.</p>  <p>  We know it is important because it will implement the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.  We have seen many examples of violations of human rights in order to facilitate multinational companies, violations on the part of some governments with the displacement of people and land grabs.  The Rana Plaza disaster was caused by the desire for greater profits, faster turnaround times and cutting corners.  It is vital to have this report.  Many submissions were made by organisations in Ireland with a lot of recommendations but that was a few years ago.  The political landscape has changed, legislation has been introduced, and there is the problem of Brexit.  Maybe there is a way in which those recommendations could be updated, not that anybody wants another consultation process but because it has been so long in coming there is a need to facilitate the voices of those who made submissions which may need to be reconsidered to ensure they are relevant today. </p></speech>

It began at the Department's annual NGO forum on human rights in November 2014 and continued as further consultations took place throughout 2015.  This included workshops with business and civil society representatives.  In February 2015 following the public consultation it received over 30 submissions which had to be addressed.  Based on these inputs a working outline of Ireland's national plan was published in December 2015.  Written submissions on the working outline were received and further consultations took place last year and early into this year.  The presentation on the final draft of the plan was made to a meeting of the interdepartmental committee on human rights in May 2017 and all relevant Departments and agencies were given the opportunity to submit comments and observations prior to the submission by Government.  There has been a lengthy process and individuals have had the opportunity to have their say.  It is important now that it is published.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has committed to publishing it in the coming weeks.  We hope to stick to that deadline.</p></speech>

It was recognised in the working outline how important it was to have legal remedies for those who suffer human rights violations in business.

It is, however, fair to say that many people in this country and around the world were delighted that his campaign was vindicated, he was found not guilty earlier this week.  Unfortunately, of the 500 or so involved with him in the mass trial, up to 300 were jailed for varying lengths of time.  My question is to know what the Government's plans are to get Ibrahim home as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This young man's name, Ibrahim Halawa, has been cleared and his innocence confirmed.</p>  <p>  This Irish citizen has been deprived of his liberty for four years, and he has endured great hardship and distress.  He has missed out on family celebrations, weddings of his siblings and births of nephews and nieces.  When he should have been studying and planning his future in Dublin, he was a teenager locked in a prison cell in Cairo.  </p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute today to this extraordinary young man for his maturity, his strength of character and his resilience.  </p>  <p>  I would like also to pay tribute to his family for their relentless support of their son and brother throughout the past four years.  Their dignity and tenacity have been an inspiration.  </p>  <p>  The Government's priority now is to support this young citizen and his family in every way that we can in order to ensure that he is able to return home to his family and friends in Dublin as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  There are some practical procedures and formalities to be gone through in Egypt before he is able to fly back to Dublin, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our embassy team will be assisting and supporting him and his family to work through these processes and to make the necessary arrangements so that he gets home as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  It is also appropriate today that I acknowledge the very significant efforts made on this young man's behalf by Members on all sides of this House, and also by fellow public representatives in the Seanad, the European Parliament and councils around the country over the past four years, and not least the Ceann Comhairle and the all-party and all-group delegation that went to Cairo in January to advocate for his release.</p>  <p>  I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts made on his behalf over the past four years by the staff at our embassy in Cairo and in the consular unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></reply>

He has had four years of his life stolen from him without any evidence against him, something which became apparent when the trial began.  This raises the question of what he was doing on trial in the first place and how he could have been incarcerated for four years.  The greatest credit goes to his sisters and family for their tireless, relentless, heroic campaigning on his behalf and also to Ibrahim himself for enduring the hardship and suffering.  I also commend the diplomatic staff who assisted him.  There is no doubt about the hard work they did and it is to the credit of this House that there was unanimity in seeking Ibrahim's release.</p>  <p>  There are many issues which need to be addressed beyond this but throughout this case, there has been minority-led but a vocal and quite filthy racist campaign against Ibrahim Halawa, recycling many of the lies and justifications that the Egyptian regime itself might have used for his imprisonment.  It is important for us to condemn those in strident terms.  He is an Irish citizen.  He is innocent.  He is not a terrorist.  He was just someone involved in a peaceful protest but whether he was Irish or not, regardless of his religious faith, colour or anything, no one should have been subjected to what he was subjected to by the Egyptian regime.</p></speech>

Under the Ceann Comhairle's guidance, a number of us, including Deputy Paul Murphy, travelled to Cairo to meet with Ibrahim in January this year.  That initiative was taken by the Ceann Comhairle and his regular contact with the Egyptian Embassy in Dublin kept up the pressure in the case.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that four years is a long time.  There were always questions about what evidence was there.  I am delighted that Ibrahim Halawa has been acquitted.  The Taoiseach has said that every assistance will be given to return Ibrahim home as soon as possible.  Has the Minister of State an update regarding when he might be released and returned home?</p>  <p>  It is important at times like this to acknowledge how hard our diplomatic team in Cairo under our former ambassador to Egypt, Mr. Damien Cole, and our new ambassador, Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Regan, and Shane Gleeson worked.  They worked assiduously in the background, although there were points when many of us questioned how good the diplomatic effort was and what was going on there.  I know they spent a considerable amount of time on this case which they were so committed to.  They deserve all our credit.  We must pay particular credit his sisters, Somia and Fatima, who are the two sisters I know, and his family.  We need to get him home as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  To reinforce Deputy Boyd Barrett's remarks, there are still people out there, and I have received phone calls from some of them, who question what this case is about and ask if we are sure about this campaign.  Ibrahim is an Irish citizen.  His background should not matter.  He has been acquitted.  He is not a terrorist, and we always knew that.  People who do not accept that should really ask questions of themselves.</p></speech>

There were ten engagements with the Taoiseach at presidential level, 20 direct engagements at foreign ministry level and we had up to 40 members of staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade working on this case at any given time and around 20,000 person-hours were spent on this case.  A significant amount of effort and work was put into this case.</p>  <p>  Ibrahim Halawa's name has been cleared, his innocence confirmed and the most important thing now is that he returns home.  Unfortunately, we cannot say when precisely he will return to Dublin.  The Egyptian courts require a number of procedures, formalities and administration which all the defendants, of which there are 453, must go through.  Our priority is that he will be in a position to return home to Dublin with minimum delay and we have done everything at this stage that we can.  Our embassy has prepared and issued a new passport for him and we are trying to address the practicalities relating to his departure from Egypt, including those relating to his immigration status.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach are personally being briefed and updated on developments and stand ready to intervene directly if there is any sense of unreasonable delay regarding his release or his clearance to leave Egypt.</p></speech>

He only participated in a protest.  For him to withstand that is impressive and a testament to him.  It should serve to raise interest in Irish society on repression and the oppression that exists in Egypt under el-Sisi and to raise a wider interest in that.</p>  <p>  I want to add my congratulations to those who drove the campaign.  I agree with the remarks about everyone in the diplomatic service who we met there and congratulate them, the various public representatives and the different campaigning organisations.  Above all the family and the sisters drove this and refused to give up.  Many people have campaigned on small issues and given up after a month, two months or six months, but to fight on such an issue, to face an Egyptian state which seemed unmovable, to continue to fight and to raise the matter in every way possible, deserves full credit as does Ibrahim.</p></speech>

The Government remains absolutely committed to achieving relief for the undocumented Irish, as well as to facilitating greater pathways for legal migration to the United States.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the US will continue to take every opportunity to raise the immigration issue in their contacts with the US authorities.  We also work closely with Irish community organisations on this issue.  Our embassy in Washington DC and our six consulates in the US are in regular contact with Irish immigration centres on a range of issues, including providing support to undocumented Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government provides substantial funding each year through the emigrant support programme, ESP, to Irish community organisations and emigrant welfare projects in the US, and in particular to the Irish immigration centres.</p><p>Last year these projects received &euro;1.4 million in emigrant support programme funding.<br/><br/>Legal advice on the implications of policy developments for undocumented Irish citizens in the US, funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has been disseminated by immigration centres in the United States and is available online.  We should not, however, underestimate the size of the challenge.  This policy area has been a deeply divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with a problem which directly affects over 11 million people.<br/><br/>The Government has always tried to work with both parties in a bipartisan way to address our longstanding concerns and this continues to be our approach.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in New York this week, where he will meet representatives of the four Irish immigration centres in the region and a representative of the US-wide Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers.  The Minister will also meet a senior State Department official, and will use that opportunity to once again impress on the US administration the importance the Irish Government attaches to a resolution of the plight of the undocumented Irish.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The Minister will also travel to Washington DC next month for high-level meetings with members of Congress.  The plight of the undocumented Irish will be on the agenda for these meetings.  In addition, the Taoiseach raised the issue when he spoke with President Trump by phone shortly after taking office.<br/><br/>The recent appointment by the Taoiseach of Deputy John Deasy as the Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress to work for the undocumented Irish was an important statement of our intent and seriousness on this issue.  Deputy Deasy has made two substantive visits since his appointment - one at the end of July and the other at the beginning of September.  In Washington DC, he met senior political contacts from both sides of the aisle and has engaged with Irish community and political representatives in New York and Boston.  He remains in continuing contact with the embassy in Washington and with officials of the Departments of the Taoiseach and of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<br/><br/>In light of all this activity, I can, therefore, assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our affected citizens in the US.</p></reply>

In light of the most recent deportations from the United States, and the attack on sanctuary cities by President Trump and others in his Cabinet, the Irish community there, particularly those who are undocumented, are very fearful.  I have welcomed the appointment of Deputy Deasy.  He is a person with experience in the United States.</p>  <p>  We must look at a fresh approach to this.  We must put options and proposals to the US administration and look at it on a bilateral basis.  These are measures we proposed previously when we were in Washington.  We should not give up just because there is a new President who is on record as being very firmly against emigration.  We need to redouble our efforts.  I congratulate the new ambassador, H.E. Dan Mulhall, on his appointment to Washington DC, and I hope he will keep this at the top of his agenda.  There must be a pathway to legal migration and we can find it.  We are consistently told about the high standing Ireland has in the United States and we need to see some action in this regard.  I hope the Department looks at a fresh approach and will give options to the US and proposals to its administration on how we might move towards resolving the matter.</p></speech>

When the Taoiseach spoke to President Trump this was an issue he raised.  As the Deputy mentioned, the appointment of Deputy Deasy is significant.  He has already made two substantive visits since his appointment.  One of them was at the end of July and one was at the beginning of September.  He has met senior political contacts from both sides of the aisle.  He has engaged with the Irish community and political representatives in New York and Boston, and he remains in continued contact with the embassy in Washington and officials at the Department of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The ongoing presence of Irish Ministers and officials and their engagement means this very much firmly remains on the agenda.</p>  <p>  What the Department is doing at present for the undocumented is also important, and given what has happened in the past year with the election of a new President there was renewed fear among those living there.  One of the embassy's immediate priorities is to ensure undocumented citizens and their families have access to clear and accurate information on possible changes that may happen or that they might expect to impact them.  To this end, additional funding has been made available to the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers to produce a fact sheet to ensure citizens are accurately informed of the recent changes in US immigration law and how they might be affected.  Obviously, they are staying in touch with their local consulate and immigration centre to ensure that where necessary they can consult with an immigration lawyer on their particular circumstances.</p></speech>

I hope he is being given the resources to back up his efforts.  One glaring issue we need to deal with is consistent engagement between the Oireachtas and the House of Representatives and the Senate in the United States.  This was a criticism levelled at us a number of years ago.  The last time the foreign affairs committee went to Washington DC was six years ago.  There is a peer to peer gap with regard to building up the Irish caucus in the House of Representatives and the Senate.  This is not something that can be done purely by diplomats or our embassy.  It is always done better between peers, namely, the elected members of two sovereign parliaments.  Not enough of this is happening.  It cannot just be left to Ministers.  It needs a concerted effort by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to look at how we can keep this at the top of the US legislators' agenda also.</p></speech>

He will work closely with, and will be supported by, the recently appointed Irish ambassador to the United States, H.E. Dan Mulhall, as well as the embassy of Ireland in Washington DC and our consulates throughout the United States.  The Deputy is right to state this will not happen just through meetings and the more contacts and communications we can build up the more we can press this issue.  We do not know the exact number of Irish people there, but we know this is something that impacts thousands of Irish people and it is a priority for the Irish Government.</p></speech>

This includes the attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, and the excessive actions which the Myanmar security forces have undertaken in response.  It is imperative that an end is brought to this violence.  I reiterate that it is essential that any further security operations carried out by the security forces in Myanmar are in line with international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  The reports of human rights violations by the security forces in Rakhine State are deeply troubling.  Along with other EU member states, Ireland has supported the establishment and extension of the mandate of a UN fact finding mission in order to establish the facts of the situation on the ground.  During an interactive dialogue at the Human Rights Council on 19 September, we continued to urge the Government of Myanmar to enable access to the team and to co-operate fully with it.  The Government is raising its concerns through our bilateral contacts with the Government of Myanmar and in the context of our EU membership.  Ireland's embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar-Burma, is monitoring the situation closely.  Ireland fully aligns with recent statements by High Representative Vice-President Mogherini, in which she called for an end to the violence and for humanitarian access to be brought to those in need.  The concerns of the EU have also been expressed directly to the Government of Myanmar.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is liaising closely with other EU partners at official level in Brussels, Yangon and UN fora to contribute to the EU response to this issue.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland continues to monitor this protracted humanitarian situation closely and may allocate additional humanitarian assistance in the coming months, in line with humanitarian needs.</p></speech>

This issue is not something that started only three or four weeks ago.  We know it has been going on for centuries.  The Rohingya are not recognised and are treated in a disgraceful way.  Since 2012, when the violence started, 500,000 Rohingya people were already in Bangladesh. This is on top of the 400,000 who moved over the border in the past two weeks.  Why do we supply Myanmar with humanitarian assistance to aid the people of Rakhine, including the Rohingya community, when they are being treated like this?  Why is the Government supplying guns to the Myanmar generals and army?  We should call for this to be stopped.  Does the Minister of State, the Minister and their party support the call for the freedom of Dublin city to be stripped from Aung San Suu Kyi?</p></speech>
