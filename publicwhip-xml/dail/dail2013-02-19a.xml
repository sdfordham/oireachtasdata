    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900004#B00100"><p>This question relates to the Government's shareholding in Aer Lingus and its strategic value.  The Government retained a minority stake of 25.1% in Aer Lingus in the initial public offering of shares in the group in 2006 primarily to protect what were perceived to be the State's strategic aviation interests at that time.  However, the importance of the Government's minority stake, particularly in the context of the Heathrow slots, has changed over time.  Developments such as the dissolution of the employee share ownership trust, ESOT, have had an impact.  Also, the Government shareholding is not sufficient on its own to block the sale or lease of Heathrow slots by Aer Lingus.  In terms of connectivity, while Heathrow remains very important for Ireland, there are now a wider range of connectivity options available through other hubs, including Schiphol, Frankfurt, Paris, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p><p>  However, there are still strategic issues to be considered in the context of Aer Lingus and the services it provides.  For example, following detailed consideration, the Government decided that it would not be prepared to support the most recent Ryanair offer for Aer Lingus on the basis that it would have a significant negative impact on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market.  The offer is currently being examined by the European Commissioner under the EU merger control rules and, notwithstanding recent media reports, the Government awaits the Commission's formal decision which we expect in the coming weeks.</p><p>  The Government has made it clear that it plans to sell its shareholding in Aer Lingus at the right time, for the right price and under the right conditions.  This position remains with respect to the above matter and is unchanged, and it is subject to ongoing consideration within Government.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900004#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is the first time I have heard a representative of this Government accept that there are strategic issues in regard to the ownership of Aer Lingus and, in particular, the Minister has identified competition connectivity and employment in the State.  He seems to have cast aside, to some extent, the issue of the Heathrow slots and he believes that the Government is not in a position to prevent a sale or lease,  and perhaps that is right, although I would argue that by retaining Aer Lingus in its current format the chances are much better that the slots will be deployed for the use of the Irish people, will provide access and the appropriate level of connectivity following from that.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to reflect to some extent on what the Irish Exporters Association said last year.  It said, &quot;The strategic importance of the Aer Lingus cargo facility for high-tech and life science exporters has not been given enough consideration by the Government&quot;.  The Minister will be aware that Aer Lingus flights carry about 52% of the value of our exports and about 43% of all imports from the United States.  Any changed ownership that might see a level of diminution of the current connectivity that Aer Lingus provides to the United States-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900004#B00500"><p>could put at risk the &euro;18 billion of pharmaceutical and medical technology that are exported by air freight to the US and around &euro;4.5 billion of high tech imports required for a wide range of manufacturing companies in this country.  Taking that into account and the fact that so much of our future potential growth is based around our exports sector and around direct access to key markets from a tourism development point of view, would the Minister not consider that the Government should review the entire strategic importance of Aer Lingus as the enabler for both of those sectors?</p><p>He should be in a position to change his policy so that he sends a very clear message to the market that he wishes Aer Lingus to exist as it currently is, as an independent operator.  It is very clear from the airline consolidation that is taking place in Europe and the United States that we cannot guarantee what the future ownership will be if we divest the current level of shareholding.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Ryanair, though some other guise, could find a way to take the assets of Aer Lingus in some secondary deal.  Does the Minister agree that now is the time to have a fundamental review that gives some standing and future prospect to the retention of Aer Lingus as an independent operator?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900005#C00200"><p>There are strategic issues involved and cargo is certainly one of them.  I met the Irish Exporters Association on a number of occasions and discussed that very point.  The association is also represented on the T&aacute;naiste's export trade council, so I meet its members from time to time in that forum.  Almost all airlines, other than Ryanair, provide cargo services and it was its intention and remains its intention, if it gains control of Aer Lingus, to continue to carry cargo because it is profitable.</p><p>  On the issue of the Heathrow slots we cannot, on our own, block the sale or lease of those.  There is nothing stopping Aer Lingus from turning around the slots itself and using them to fly London transatlantic.  It could do that if it so wished.  The other point to remember is that the slots can be forfeited.  If Aer Lingus does not use them, it loses them.  The airline does not own them as some may think; it just has rights over them.  It is also worth pointing out that even if the Government stake is disposed of, the Government remains an interested party when it comes to any takeover attempt and can still be in a position to make its views known to the European Commission.  Any merger or acquisition which has a European dimension remains notifiable to the European Commission under the 2004 mergers regulations.  Therefore, even if the State was not a shareholder, the Commission would still examine any competition issues if a merger was proposed.  In addition, we would be able to make our views known.</p></speech>

A critical analysis of the marketplace must be conducted to determine the potential risks of Aer Lingus falling into the wrong hands and the very considerable impact that would have on this country.  The Minister must determine how best he can use his current shareholding to continue to provide the benefits on which our tourism and export sectors are so dependent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900005#C00400"><p>That analysis is under way and is being done by the NewERA unit on behalf of the Department and the Government.  Aer Lingus is a very good company and is very profitable.  In fairness to the management and staff, they have made a huge contribution in recent years to turning the company around.  It is a company I want to see continue to grow and be successful.  To date, the Government's shareholding has largely been passive and Aer Lingus has shrunk its business to become more profitable.  A lot of the expansion in which the company is currently engaged is actually outside of Ireland.  It is expanding within the United Kingdom and, more recently, between Spain and the United States.  If the Government was to take a more active shareholding role, it would want to know what Aer Lingus would do in return for that, in terms of developing its business and reopening connections that existed in the past.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900005#C00600"><p>The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012, published last December, is a major step in the process of implementing the recommendations of the taxi regulation review report published earlier last year.   In line with the recommendations of the review report, the Bill restates and strengthens the proportionality of the existing legislative provision for mandatory disqualification of persons convicted of serious criminal offences from operating in the industry.  The provisions of the Bill will ensure those with convictions on indictment for the most serious of violent crimes will be excluded from the industry.  The specification of offences to which mandatory disqualification applies is based on the principle of ensuring the welfare and the safety of passengers, particularly in situations where a passenger is travelling alone in a taxi.   Because of the serious consequences of mandatory disqualification it can only be applied in narrowly defined circumstances relating to very serious crimes.</p><p>Furthermore there are inbuilt safeguards in the Bill to ensure that the effect is not disproportionate.  Specifically, there is a right of appeal under which the appropriate court can review a range of matters pertinent to the suitability of the appellant to be a taxi driver. </p><p> The Bill was the subject of consultation with Government Departments including the Department of Justice and Equality prior to its publication in December of last year.  In addition, there was a representative of that Department on the taxi regulation review group.  During the course of preparation of the review group report on the Bill the issue of the Good Friday Agreement did not receive any special attention.</p><p> I do not consider that it would be appropriate to include any particular reference to that agreement in the Bill.  The question of whether any measures relating to former prisoners should be provided for in law in arising from the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement is one that extends beyond the specific issue of taxi licences. The Minister for Justice and Equality recently introduced the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 which has been passed by the Seanad and is now to come before this House.  That Bill provides a more appropriate context for consideration of issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement.  To my knowledge, however, no amendments relating to the Good Friday Agreement were proposed in the Seanad. </p><p> In any event, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Bill are fair and balanced.  Under the appeal procedure provided for in the Bill,  the courts can determine if there are mitigating circumstances such that mandatory disqualification should not apply in a particular case.  </p><p> The courts are the best placed to make the kinds of judgements required which would have to be assessed on a case by case individual basis. </p></reply>

New taxi regulations could result in the disqualification or suspension of drivers who have convictions relating to the conflict between republicans and the British State on this island.  It is recognised that this conflict was a special circumstance and that those who received convictions in the course of the conflict should not be treated as common criminals.  There are, currently, drivers who were convicted of offences covered by Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill who have been operating licences without any issue for years.  These convictions were directly related to their involvement in the conflict and this is recognised in a number of international agreements signed by the State, including the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>  Legislation retrospectively affecting an individual's rights, which in this case would be to disqualify a licensed taxi driver who may have relied on these rights by investing in his taxi or leaving another job to become a taxi driver, would be disproportionate and repugnant to the Constitution.</p></speech>

In the case of Cox <i>v</i>. Ireland, the Supreme Court considered section 34 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 which provides that a State employee who is convicted of a scheduled offence in the Special Criminal Court shall forfeit pension, superannuation allowance and gratuity earned for service done before the conviction.  The Supreme Court determined that while the State was entitled to take into consideration the public interest of peace and order, section 34 was disproportionate as it bore no relation to any question of public peace.</p></speech>

This is Question Time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900006#D00600"><p>I will come back and ask a number of questions.</p><p>  Has the Minister of State looked at the Bill properly?  Sinn F&eacute;in have sought legal advice and we believe it is unconstitutional.  What legal proofing did the Minister do of the Bill?  The Minister of State mentioned the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Government signed the Good Friday Agreement but the Bill puts disproportionate pressure on families who are affected by the agreement.  This should be taken into account in any consideration of offences. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900006#D00700"><p>I thank Deputy Ellis, who has raised this issue on previous occasions.  The Bill is proportionate.  I have suggested to the Deputy previously that he raise the issue in the context of other legislation.  He asks if we have rigorously checked the legality of the Bill.  Of course we have.  The Attorney General went through the legislation and is satisfied with its drafting, the manner in which it has been presented and, in particular, its proportionality.</p><p>I also point out that the Department of Justice and Equality was represented on the taxi review committee that made the provisions that are now being enacted.</p><p> Simply put, we must get to the stage where we are confident that anyone driving a taxi should be allowed to be behind the wheel of a taxi.  Everyone would agree with that and I certainly believe it.  We acknowledge the majority of taxi drivers are hardworking, decent, honourable people but it is amazing the number of people who have come to me to say they cannot understand how someone with a serious conviction could be allowed to get a licence.  That is not acceptable.  They should not be allowed to get a licence.  I do not care if they claim to be reformed after any serious conviction, a person cannot and should not have a licence to drive a taxi if he has a conviction for murder, terrorism or serious sexual crime.  It is as simple as that and the House should support that fully.</p></speech>

That should be binding.  This is putting serious pressure on people who have been in the taxi industry for many years.</p><p>  The fact the Minister of State is looking at this retrospectively is the problem.  I understand the point about serious convictions but we are talking about a certain section of people and we have moved forward.  What is the Minister of State trying to do?  Does he want to turn the clock back and throw people out on the streets after they have signed up to an agreement, many of them doing so at great personal risk?  On the basis of the Minister of State's remarks, I would not be in this House because I was involved in the conflict.  There have been others, including in the Labour Party, in the same boat.  It is unfair and I will give the Minister of State the legal advice I received on this.</p></speech>

I stand over the reason for the retrospective nature of these provisions.  There are people driving taxis in this country who should not be behind the wheel of a taxi.  It is simple as that and needs no further explanation.  That is why the legislation must be retrospective.  No one in this House with a loved one would be happy for him or her to get into a taxi driven by someone with a serious conviction, be it for murder, terrorism or sexual assault.  I want to put an end to that and I want the support of the House while doing so.  This cannot continue.</p></speech>

So far, 47 projects have been completed and 11 other projects are at various stages of development.</p><p>  The current round of the programme was closed to new applicants on 31 July 2000.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the programme.  It is incorrect to say that funding for swimming pools has been suspended.  Last year, &euro;7.7 million was paid out in respect of swimming pools and &euro;5.6 million is available this year, all of which is expected to be paid out to grantees.</p><p>  Since 2005, three projects have been added to the list of pools under the programme.  In 2005 &euro;3.8 million was allocated where a local authority swimming pool in Monaghan had to close for safety reasons, and Monaghan was the only county in the country without a local authority pool.  In 2006, a special Estimates allocation of &euro;300,000 was made by the Minister for Finance towards the refurbishment of the swimming pool at St Joseph's School for Deaf Boys in Dublin, and in 2010 the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport approved a grant of &euro;648,000 towards the refurbishment of the de Paul Swimming Pool, operated by the Daughters of Charity, in Dublin. This grant was subsequently increased to &euro;948,000.  The latter two pools are in the Dublin City Council area. </p><p>  On the possible withdrawal of grants, I am conscious that local authorities, like all other organisations, have been facing financial difficulties in recent years and my Department is trying to afford them every opportunity to draw down this funding, within the terms and conditions of the programme.  Of course these grants cannot remain open indefinitely and I would urge the relevant local authorities to progress their projects as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

There were at least four locations - south Dublin, Wexford, Wicklow and Kerry - which put in for four.  To the best of my knowledge, four have been built in three of those four locations.  Five or six locations got three pools.  Kildare, foolishly, put in for two.</p><p>  When the review was done in 2007, there was a comparison made with Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Northern Ireland has one pool for every 32,000 of population, Scotland has one for every 15,000 of population and the aim in Ireland was to get one for every 58,000 of population.</p></speech>

Is that still an aim?  I am being parochial about this.  Kildare has one pool for every 105,000 of population, which is more than double the target.  Is there any prospect of funding becoming available for such a location, where there is a population that is large enough to support a pool and where it would be financially viable?  Will the Minister of State insist on a use-or-lose-it clause at any point in the case of local authorities that cannot come up with the matching funding?</p></speech>

It is a long time since these grants were allocated in 2000.  Some of the local authorities have approached us because it is taking a long time.  Matching funding is difficult to get at present.  There are also technical difficulties.  At the same time, I have written to the local authorities.  It is something I must look at because we cannot continue where there are places, such the Deputy's area, that are looking for a pool.</p><p>  As I stated in my reply, we had 58 projects, 47 are completed and 11 are still outstanding.  At some stage I must make a decision and state that they will get a short time period to draw down the funds or we must close them down.  Then I will have to see what I can do to allow others make applications for a new scheme.</p><p>  There is not a great rush.  The only local authority looking for funding for a swimming pool is the Deputy's local authority in the case of her area.  There are some local authorities that even tell me they do not want to go ahead with the project and some of them have withdrawn on the basis that they cannot come up with the matching funding.</p></speech>

The people in my area ask me where is their swimming pool and I tend to tell them it is in south Dublin, Wicklow or Kerry.  Certainly, it is not where they want it to be.</p></speech>

In that regard, I introduced a scheme last year and we allocated funding to 56 pools.  It was for a number of pools throughout the country in financial difficulty because the local authority could not heat them and because of the energy wastage involved.  In my opinion, it was the best scheme I introduced in the Department since I came into office.  I visited Sligo, Ballina, Donegal and Galway.</p><p>Every one of them tells me that but for the grant aid that we provided to upgrade their energy efficiency and make them wheelchair accessible many of these pools would have closed.  The big problem we have is with the existing pools - they are not able to run them or fund them.  The fuel prices are creating great difficulty in heating them.  Regarding the scheme, I will need to put pressure on the remaining local authorities to either get in or get out.  I will then have to see if I can find some funding to allow in some other counties with a need for swimming pools.</p></speech>

In the past two years almost &euro;385 million has been invested in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and further investment of over &euro;130 million will take place this year.  The overall investment in railway safety is in excess of &euro;1.5 billion since 1999 when the railway safety programme commenced.  There has also been significant investment in rolling stock, on upgrading the Kildare route and opening new routes such as Cork commuter route, Navan phase 1 and phase 1 of the western rail corridor. </p><p>  The investment regime for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for 2014 is being reviewed having regard to the anticipated completion of the railway safety programme by the end of 2013 and new EU-mandated infrastructure management contract requirements, allied to the need to ensure value for money in the spending of constrained Exchequer funding.  It is envisaged that from 2014 onwards investment in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will concentrate on maintaining and renewing a fit-for-purpose rail network, augmented by some targeted investment enhancements which will be limited due to the overall level of resources available for transport investment up to 2016.</p><p>  On 24 July 2012 the Government decided to provide additional PSO funding of &euro;36 million to CIE companies.  This brought the total subvention paid to CIE in 2012 to &euro;278 million, of which &euro;166.4 million was paid to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  CIE is progressing a five-year business plan to address the underlying financial challenges facing CIE so that the CIE's rail and bus services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively over the plan period.</p></reply>

From various media reports at the end of last year and early this year he will be aware of the very serious funding crisis in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  How does he expect Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to come through that particular difficulty?  He identified the need for and the House supported the provision of in excess of &euro;35 million last year, much of which was required to resolve Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's day-to-day funding issues.  A voluntary severance programme was intended to reduce costs.  However, part of that had to be delayed because the company was not in a cash position to meet the demands entailed.  The firm required an extra &euro;16 million just to pay the day-to-day expenses.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had a very serious cash crisis last year.  We gave the Minister of State a period of time to resolve it.  What progress has been made on that?  Is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann now on a viable financial footing as we head into another difficult year?</p></speech>

Further financing was required in 2012 to fund the voluntary severance scheme and the sale of non-core assets such as a Spencer Dock property, which was central to that.  The issue of voluntary severance is serious because as that is rolled out we will gain continued savings through the years.  CIE has put in place a five-year business plan, a large proportion of which relates to Irish Rail.  It has sought to secure additional banking facilities in 2013, through an NPRF loan.</p><p>They are looking at various other ways of executing the business plan to ensure the efficiencies necessary in Irish Rail over the next five years can be achieved.  Following successful negotiations with Irish Rail &euro;11 million per annum has been saved and a great deal of progress in terms of services for passengers has been made.  It is hoped this, in tandem with the business plan, will result in an increase in passenger numbers and an improvement in the company's balance sheet.</p></speech>

Access to banking facilities in 2013 is important.  The Deputy will be aware that the legislation dealing with borrowings by CIE was recently passed by this House, which legislation provided additional elasticity in this regard.  A plan is being executed to ensure that service provision is improved, leading to an increase in passenger numbers and reducing the need for finance into the future.  An increase in passenger numbers over the five years of the business plan will help to improve the company's balance sheet.</p></speech>

Of the &euro;31 million allocated under the 2012 programme, 41%, or &euro;12.6 million, was allocated to projects in designated disadvantaged areas.</p><p>  When the 2012 programme was advertised my Department issued a detailed guide to filling out the application form which set out the Department's minimum requirements.  Regrettably, the applications referred to by the Deputy did not meet these requirements and hence were deemed invalid and could not be considered for funding.</p><p>  The first application referred to was in respect of a project costing &euro;1.05 million and did not include a feasibility study, which is a requirement under the programme for projects costing more than &euro;700,000.  In addition, the estimate provided by the quantity surveyor did not provide details of the works to be carried out.  The other two applications were invalid for the following three reasons: the applicants did not provide the Department with evidence of title to the property to be used for the project; an acceptable quotation was not provided; and the application form did not include an original signature as required.</p><p>  A letter setting out the reason the applications were deemed invalid has been sent to the applicants.

The fact that these are public facilities makes them of high value to the local community.  A variety of clubs and sporting organisations in the area use the facilities on a weekly basis for boxing, soccer and Gaelic games.  The local community works tirelessly with Dublin City Council and sporting clubs in the area in an effort to secure funding for the various projects.  Furthermore, despite that this area of Dublin is one of low socioeconomic status and is densely populated it has only one youth centre and three community centres.  Sporting organisations, clubs and young people in the area are highly dependent on over-used and badly in need of repair sporting facilities.</p><p>  Is the Minister of State aware that Brickfield Park is the only public park of its size in the entire Inchicore-Drimnagh area?</p><p>Is the Minister of State aware the local community groups and sporting clubs wanted to submit two separate funding applications under the sports capital programme, one for an all-weather pitch and another for draining at Brickfield Park, but in an attempt to maximise success Dublin City Council decided to submit the drainage application only?

I reduced the local contribution which must be made in disadvantaged and CL&Aacute;R areas.  I did everything in my power to target funding to disadvantaged areas, but the criteria had to be met.  To be fair to the officials, when they sent out the criteria for the programme they also offered clubs and organisations a service whereby they could telephone the office in Killarney to speak to officials and go through the applications prior to their submission.  The officials were prepared to do this.  Every effort was made to make it easy for organisations because most of them work in a voluntary capacity.  I respect this which is why I reduced the contribution required from disadvantaged and CL&Aacute;R areas and tried to make it easier.  I was delighted that for the first time in ten years more than 40% of the allocation went to disadvantaged areas.  I stated before the allocations were made that I wanted to target disadvantaged areas and I did so.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.68.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900011#J01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 132, 158, 168, 180, 801 and 802 together.</p><p>   It is almost like Taoiseach's questions, with all of the questions being taken together.</p><p>  These questions relate to the maintenance and repair of the network of national, regional and local roads.  The protection of the existing investment in the Irish national, regional and local roads network is the first priority of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on roads.  Exchequer-funded roads improvements, where they occur, will focus on safety works or access to industrial estates and similar facilities.</p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, Ireland has an extensive road network.  The network consists of approximately 98,000 km of road which represents two and a half times the EU average in terms of kilometres per head of population.  We have a lot of roads for our population.  Obviously, the maintenance and improvement of this extensive network of roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.</p><p>  Given the financial position that this Government inherited from the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years, and there will be further reductions in the future.</p><p> From a peak in 2007, when there were grants of &euro;363 million towards the maintenance and restoration of national, regional and local roads, this has fallen to &euro;232 million in 2013.  On the other hand, the output we are achieving for the available funding is being improved by the use of new technology and initiatives.  While these are significant reductions in expenditure, it is worth noting that neither of the two main Opposition parties provided for increased roads spending in their pre-budget submissions, which they published last December, so neither can credibly call for more spending on roads this year.</p><p> Over &euro;52 million has been allocated by the NRA to local authorities for minor realignment upgrade projects and road pavement improvement works on national roads across the country in 2013.  Construction work will continue on 17 schemes this year, selected by the NRA under its work programme and a further 25 projects are being brought through the planning process.</p><p> As regards regional and local roads it is important to note that the role of Exchequer grants in this area is to supplement the local authorities' spending in this area.  The contribution made by individual local authorities, which are after all the roads authorities in law, has fallen in recent years both in real and percentage terms.  In 2008, local authorities contributed &euro;406 million towards expenditure on their own regional and local roads representing 40% of total spend; this had fallen to an estimated &euro;175 million or 32% by last year.  There is considerable disparity between what individual local authorities will contribute from their own resources towards roads, with some local authorities contributing as little as 8% to the total cost of road maintenance and restoration, while others provide more than two thirds of total funding from their own funds.</p><p> It is most disingenuous for some local authorities to complain about reductions in Government grants when they have reduced their own contribution by a greater proportion or make little contribution at all.  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, regional and local roads funding has been directed towards the maintenance and repair of regional and local roads, and low cost safety works.  This will remain the position in coming years and, unfortunately, this will have implications for the development of new roads schemes.</p><p> Furthermore, I am aware that many local authorities have expressed a desire to have greater flexibility in the manner in which they expend their allocations.  My Department is open to such suggestions provided it is done in a prudent fashion and can be clearly measured.</p></reply>

I wish to bring a couple of issues to the Minister's attention.  First, I acknowledge his efforts and those of his Department last year to rebalance the allocation to Cork County Council, which has the single largest road network in Ireland.  Despite our calls in previous years to have such a rebalance undertaken, it was brought about last year.  I wish to thank the Minister and his Department for that.</p><p>  Is the Minister willing for his Department to be more flexible in the allocation of funding and to allow councils more flexibility in how moneys are allocated?  In west Cork, a lot of money is going into the regional and national road networks, but very little into local and tertiary roads.  Further discretion should be allowed to local area offices.  Is the Minister willing for his Department to engage in that process?</p><p>  Is the Minister aware that in some councils, to which his Department is allocating tens of millions of euro, payroll costs account for up to 62% of the moneys involved?  I have analysed this matter and private contractors tell me that their payroll costs are in the region of 18% to 20%.  Is the Minister aware of this information and, if so, will he comment on it?</p></speech>

My Department has received a proposal from one local authority and my officials are due to meet with the City and County Managers' Association to see if that can be progressed in the coming weeks.  However, I want to be sure that the money actually goes into roads and does not end up being diverted into something else.</p><p>  While it might be tempting to use all the money to patch up potholes, thus fixing the roads for a few months or a year, that is not the best way to do it long-term.  We do need to strengthen the roads and restore them so that they can last for ten or 20 years.  We want to be sure that does happen.</p><p>  There is a new pilot scheme which the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, has devised and is heading up with county managers.  It is a new community involvement scheme and local authorities will be able to bid for funds for that quite soon.</p><p>Flexibility is something the Government wants to assist local authorities with and allow them to do, provided it can be sure the money goes into roads and the work done is measured.</p></speech>

Members received a small history lesson from the Minister on the difficulty he faces based on who caused all the problems.  He then suggested that somehow the county councils should provide more money.  Never having served on a county council but having a keen understanding of what goes on there, I remind the Minister they are under significant pressure.  Their other income streams are severely curtailed, including development levies, which would have provided them with moneys in the past.  Similarly, they are finding it very difficult to collect rates and there have been significant reductions to the block grant.  Consequently, it is disingenuous to somehow suggest it is a devolved responsibility the local authority should find the methodology to resolve.</p><p>  The Minister must fight his case much more vociferously when it comes to the next round of Estimates.  I also suggest that Ireland is in a different financial position in light of the Government's negotiation with the ECB.  The Government has trumpeted the fact that an additional &euro;1 billion is available this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, can confirm the T&aacute;naiste was clear yesterday when he indicated the deal that was done of course would have an impact on budgetary measures.  I argue that an appropriate and sufficient road network is an integral part of the recovery of the State.  As the Minister is aware, it has a stimulus effect in the construction sector through the provision and creation of jobs but more particularly in the continued effort to make roads and the driving and passage thereon more safe.  There has been a blip in this regard in recent days and weeks and while I do not wish to characterise this in any way as having been as a result of changes in road patterns or profiles, it reminds Members of the necessity for a continuous focus on road safety.</p></speech>

It would be a highly retrograde step if we were to allow the road network to deteriorate back to its former state and the only way one can avoid this is by continuing to invest in it and to not allow the state of the surface revert to the position it reached in the past.  More money is now available to the Government as a result of the &euro;1 billion that has been saved and the Minister should make his pitch for whatever amount of that he can ultimately achieve.  The Minister's own quiet way of negotiation could and hopefully will lead to success in that regard.</p></speech>

Central government also is under a lot of pressure and I find it a little disingenuous of local authorities to point the finger at central government, which perhaps has cut its allocation by 20% or 30%, when the local authorities actually have cut their own by 60%.  It is interesting to observe the wide variation among local authorities in quite similar counties as to how much they do or do not put into roads.  It also is important to bear in mind that 85% of motor tax goes to local authorities, some of it through my Department, which must be spent on roads and some through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which they are not obliged to spend on roads.  It is interesting to see how little of the latter local authorities choose to spend on roads.</p><p>  As for the &euro;1 billion, that amount is being saved every year for at least the next ten years as a result of the elimination of the promissory notes.  That is &euro;1 billion less that the Government must borrow and not &euro;1 billion more that the Government has to spend.  There is a very big difference and I would hate to see this country revert so quickly to that Charlie McCreevy way of thinking.  His way of thinking, which is the reason we are in this current mess, is &quot;When I have it, I spend it&quot;.  However, the Government does not want to be in a position whereby it states that as it is not obliged to borrow it, it will spend it.  It is too soon to talk about the next budget, as there are a lot of moving parts.  For example, Departments overspent by &euro;1 billion last year and were that to happen again, the aforementioned &euro;1 billion will have been eliminated.  The Government must achieve &euro;300 million in savings targets from the Croke Park extension alone this year.  In addition, the Government does not know whether the growth targets will be achieved this year.  Consequently, it is too soon to start spending that billion euro at this point.</p><p>However, if money or a capital stimulus becomes available, I have many projects that are ready and the ones I can move on the quickest relate to road maintenance and minor works.  I heard Jack O'Connor, one of the SIPTU leaders, talking earlier about a public private partnership or off balance sheet stimulus.  That would be attractive but anyone who has been involved in a PPP knows it takes two to four years to bring them to fruition by the time a consortium is brought together and so on.  We need a stimulus now or next year, not in four year's time and that is why I would prefer an Exchequer stimulus rather than an off balance sheet stimulus, but that is contingent on the budgetary position looking better at the end of the year and it is too soon to start considering that now.</p></speech>

The Estimates and the budget were prepared on the basis of the capacity the Government had to borrow.  The Government should borrow that &euro;1 billion because it will form part of what the Minister's colleague's friend, Jack O'Connor, has been saying.  I listened with interest to him earlier.  While he believes our capacity to borrow on the markets has improved, I am not sure the Government will be able to borrow to the extent that the Labour Party's friends in the unions seem to suggest.  They mentioned &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion using a multiplier effect.  Perhaps we will hear more detail from Mr. O'Connor and the Labour Party in the coming weeks about how that will work.  However, I would support a targeted and well thought out stimulus programme within our overall budgetary framework.  The deal the Government has done provides that and, therefore, the Minister must fight for his portion of that to deal with road maintenance.  There are new projects that would be nice to start but let us try to maintain what we have in the interim.  Let us take out the bottlenecks on some regional and local roads, which are creating significant blockages and leading to road fatalities.  Accidents will accumulate as a result.  I urge the Minister to continue to fight for his portion of the funds in that regard.</p></speech>

My experience is that Dublin City Council, DCC, is tailoring all projects as much it can, including roads projects.</p><p>  I refer to the A5 project, which the Minister said would be funded in 2014.  If money became available, is there any way that project could be considered?  It is an important project for the north west and it would be the final piece in the jigsaw of linking up the road system, because there have been massive improvements.</p><p>  With regard to local authority funding, ramps are also a major problem because many substandard ramps were built.  Money was provided by the Department but there are a huge number of them throughout the State and should additional money become available, it could be used for this purpose.  The DCC has to maintain so many of them that additional money is needed.  I do not know whether new capital projects will come on stream this year but if so, a number of projects could be examined.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that, given he said that there might be flexibility.</p></speech>

They used to provide 40% of the cost but that has fallen to 32%.  Local authorities are, therefore, cutting their funding faster than the Government is cutting their grants.</p><p>  If additional money becomes available, we could easily put another &euro;100 million into road maintenance, &euro;100 million into the small NRA schemes that I would like to go ahead with, and probably between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million into new road, tourism and sports projects.</p><p>That is all we would be able to spend.  I would love to receive further funding as it would be preferable to pursuing public private partnership projects which take two, three or four years to complete and do not provide good value in the long term.  As I stated, it is not necessarily the case that &euro;1 billion has become available.  We must meet our growth targets and, unlike last year, all Departments must come in on budget and without an overspend this year.  In addition, we must also deliver &euro;300 million in savings, the figure under discussion in the Croke Park talks.  Given that the &euro;1 billion is not available to spend just yet, we should not go down that road.</p><p> Deputy Ellis is correct that a number of ramps, especially in Dublin, were badly constructed and are in very poor condition.  Fingal County Council has been allocated &euro;100,000 to address the issue, with similar amounts allocated to other counties.  This funding will not be sufficient, however.  If additional money was available, I would happily give it to the local authorities and they would happily receive it.</p><p> The Government has committed &pound;25 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively, to the A5 road project.  The elements of the project north of the Border are not proceeding owing to a judicial challenge.  This matter must be dealt with and the project needs to start before we can offer more money.</p></speech>

The statutory responsibility for the collection and analysis of structured information on road traffic collisions lies with the Road Safety Authority.  That analysis is published annually in the authority's facts book, Road Collision Facts.  While 2012 figures are still being analysed, I understand the analysis for 2011 is being finalised and will be available shortly.  In the interim, the most recently published edition of Road Collision Facts is in respect of 2010 and is available on the authority's website <i><i>www.rsa.ie</i></i>.  This publication also provides details on collisions in previous years.</p><p><br />  Since 2007, there has been a considerable reduction in road fatalities.  In 2012, we had the lowest annual deaths on record at 162.  This compared with 186 in 2011, 212 in 2010, 238 in 2009, 279 in 2008 and 338 in 2007.  The figure for 2002 was 376.  However, while there has been considerable progress over the past five years, we cannot be complacent.  Thirty-one lives have been lost this year on the roads, an increase of 13 from the same period last year.  I have discussed these recent events with the Road Safety Authority and it is too early in the year to detect any definite trends.  We will continue to monitor the position closely and it is important that all road users take care.</p><p><br />  The Road Safety Authority is finalising a new road safety strategy for the period from 2013 to 2020, which, subject to Government approval, I intend to launch formally next month.  The aim of the strategy, as with all previous strategies, will be to save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions on our roads.</p></reply>

While one death on the roads is a death too many, we are on the right track.  I am concerned, however, about what appears to be a spike in road traffic fatalities so far this year.  This emerging trend should serve as a wake-up call for those involved with the road safety strategy and, in that regard, I welcome the Minister's statement that it is proposed to implement a new strategy.</p><p>  When does the Minister expect the Road Safety Authority to publish a breakdown of the figures on road deaths for 2011 and 2012?  Could new software or systems be introduced to speed up the publication of figures on road traffic collisions and fatalities, especially the latter?  I presume the same template is used to present the figures every year.  As far as I could ascertain from the 2010 figures, they do not include information on cases involving driver fatigue.  It should be possible to extract figures on the distance road users have travelled prior to a collision.  While this information may not be available in all cases, it would be helpful to have such figures included in the annual reports of the Road Safety Authority as they would indicate the extent to which driver fatigue was a factor in accidents.</p><p>  I note from the 2010 figures that the majority of accidents involving fatalities occurred in dry conditions and on straight stretches of road.  This is an extraordinary statistic.  Fatigue is a major issue.</p></speech>

This year's figures to date are a cause for great concern, in that the number of road fatalities has increased significantly.  However, it is important that we not read too much into this increase.  When I first took up office in March 2011, the first quarter indicated an increase in road fatalities.  By the end of the year, though, 2011 had become the safest year on record.  It is important that we not read too much into monthly or quarterly statistics.</p><p>  We need good road behaviour and enforcement.  The latter is important but difficult, given the reducing Garda numbers.  We will have the detailed breakdown of the 2011 figures soon, although those for 2012 might take a further year.  Sometimes, this process gets held up because of coroners' cases.  For example, suicides in cars can be reclassified.  It can take time to analyse the statistics.</p><p>  To answer Deputy Harrington's valid question on fatigue, I do not know.  I will undertake to seek a reply for him from the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I would also like to know the answer.  Fatigue may be difficult to prove after the fact, which is not necessarily the case with other causes.</p></speech>

If we are to tackle the safety figures, we need to know the reasons.  Fatigue is one such reason, but another reason for single vehicle accidents is linked to a different strategy, namely, our suicide strategy.  That there may be a link is regrettable.  That the evidence is only anecdotal is a pity.  The RSA's figures make no reference to this link.  Perhaps something could be done about this.</p></speech>

All over the country, people are driven berserk when they turn off national primary roads onto tertiary roads on which grass is growing up through the middle and where the first thing they see are poles bearing 80 km/h signs.  The RSA will point out that this is not the desired speed, but the maximum allowable speed.  However, major problems are being caused because roads are being assigned speed limits for which they are unfit.  Local authorities have the option of examining such limits, but it is a cumbersome process, is taking too long and is doing road users a disservice.  Is there a way to shorten the process?</p><p>  Deputy Harrington raised a point.  Aside from road fatalities, could the categories of injury be broken down?  A road accident that sees no fatalities can still cause destruction, in that people can be left paralysed or seriously injured.  If the RSA, in conjunction with the hospitals, including the National Rehabilitation Hospital, could be encouraged to produce the relevant figures, it would act as a stimulus for the road safety programme.</p></speech>

In total, 3,237 drivers with learner permits were involved in one form of collision or another in 2012.  This is an important element to be addressed and I would appreciate the Minister's opinions on it.</p></speech>

Its information is dependent on the performance of its drivers and whether its machines are working properly and are at the right angles.  We have been approached by a number of its drivers who are unhappy with their work practices and conditions.  Aside from their employer's poor treatment of them, they are also concerned that recordings are sometimes being used even after they have told the company that the recordings are not fit for purpose.  When they check to see whether the recordings have been used, they find that they have been thrown into the mix even though the machines were not working properly on the days in question.  People are being caught for speeding despite this.</p></speech>

Against the backdrop of the fact that the Minister has allowed the function to be outsourced currently to the GoSafe operation, what safeguards does the Department have in place?  Does he consider a role for the Road Safety Authority in terms of liaising with GoSafe?  The validity of the information is absolutely dependent on the human input of the driver who sets up the machine.  We are aware that the conditions in which the workers operate are in breach of serious amounts of legislation in terms of health and safety and the working time Act, which undermines the validity of the information they collect.  Will the Minister consider having someone in his Department link in with the operation to monitor it?  I accept it is under the control of the Garda to an extent but there must be an independent role for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Speeding and ticket fixing would have an impact on the control of speeding.  An investigation is currently under way by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Has the Minister had any input or received any feedback on it?</p></speech>

I have seen and taken part in the road safety campaign for secondary schools that has taken place in The Helix on a number of occasions.  It is a tremendous initiative, one that if we continue and bolster and perhaps make part of the syllabus within secondary schools would be very much welcomed in terms of addressing the ongoing battle to reduce road fatalities.</p></speech>

It is clear there will be a reduction in Garda numbers and speed checks are carried out by the Garda in addition to those that are done privately.  Will the traffic corps be maintained at its current level?</p><p>  I carried out an analysis on the number of speed cameras and discovered that the one hot-spot in the country in which one would be more likely to get penalty points for speeding was between the Red Cow roundabout and the Kildare county boundary where the road, which is segregated, has three lanes.  Perhaps the distribution of cameras could be examined as well.</p></speech>

A number of them are for the Minister for Justice and Equality and I do not wish to answer questions on his behalf.  I will be liaising with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the road safety strategy, which will be signed off by the whole Government, not just my Department.  We have a Cabinet sub-committee on road safety which includes the Garda and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I understand that it is their intention to maintain the traffic corps at a similar level to the situation currently.  The fact that there will be fewer garda&iacute; in stations and more out in cars will assist with that.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Clare Daly&rsquo;s question, I have no news on the report on the ticket fixing or squaring scandal but I look forward to seeing the report.  It is something in which I have a great interest.  My understanding is that the GoSafe vans are contacted by the Garda.  That is the first I have heard of the issues raised by the Deputy.  I have not heard of such complaints from staff but I will ask the RSA to examine the situation and see whether issues arise in terms of GoSafe vans.  It is important that people trust the system and that it has integrity.  I will undertake to ask the RSA to examine the issue.</p><p>  In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s question on the category of injuries, it is intended to do that.  I have appointed to the board of the RSA the head consultant in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The situation is complicated because even in medicine there is not a clear classification of injuries but it is something we want to include in the new strategy, in order that it is not just about fatalities but about life-changing injuries and how they impact on people.</p><p>  We are doing a speed limit review at the moment.  I have the draft of it.  One of its recommendations speaks to what the Deputy said and suggests that the 80 km speed limit signs on tertiary roads and boreens effectively act as a target and not as a limit.  The suggestion being made is that we remove them altogether or replace them with the previous delimiter signs which the Deputy may recall with the white circle and the grey stripe through it.  I will consult with the Oireachtas committee on the report but I personally think it would probably be the right thing to do on the basis that people are treating the limit as a target rather than as a speed limit.  It would be better if the signs were not there or if we had a delimiter sign instead.</p></speech>

A number of credit unions had fixed-term deposits with IBRC, which were due to be repaid in September of this year.  As a result of the decision to liquidate the IBRC, many credit unions will suffer huge losses.  Sources within the credit union movement say the losses could be as high as &euro;17 million for credit unions across the county.  It would be an incredible situation if that were the case.</p><p>  We were told much work went into the preparation of the legislation some time ago.  Was the Taoiseach aware of the level of implication for the credit union movement or that there would be this consequence for credit unions as a result of the decision to liquidate the IBRC?  Why did the Government not consider making special provision for credit unions when preparing to take the decision?  The losses involved will at a minimum wipe out any shareholder dividends credit union members could have anticipated in 2013 and 2014, and worse, unfortunately, may have an impact on the stability of some of the credit unions concerned.</p><p>  Could the Taoiseach clarify the situation and what he intends to do?  He promised before the election to burn senior bank bondholders, which did not happen.  He did not do that and now we are in a situation where credit unions - the banks of ordinary people - have essentially been burned as a direct consequence of the decision taken by the Government.  It seems that this is the only instance in the eurozone to date where depositors have taken a direct hit as a result of the decision to liquidate IBRC in the manner decided by the Government.  It is wrong and something must be done about it.</p></speech>

He is also aware that &euro;15 billion worth of bondholders have been burned already.  Normal deposits are guaranteed here.  It is impossible to distinguish between guaranteed and unguaranteed.  The liquidator must find out the facts of what is involved.</p><p>In regard to credit unions, I am not aware at this time of the extent of deposits lodged by any credit unions in IBRC.  Clearly, the examination of the liquidator will bring that to light in due course.  The question of what the extent of that liability might or might not be remains to be seen and, if that is the case, that is a matter that must be examined in respect of any funding that might be available for credit unions, but it is impossible to distinguish between depositors here.  Normal deposits are guaranteed but I cannot tell the Deputy at this stage to what extent, if any, credit unions have been involved here.</p></speech>

We were told that this legislation was prepared as far back as November and was just ready to be revealed to the House.  The use of phrases such as "normal deposits" does not stand up.  If one looks at the prospectus alone, the position is clear.  They were offered 100% capital security at maturity through an eight year, three month, fixed-term deposit facility.  There was never any indication that they would be burned as a result of any action by Government.</p><p>  I find it extraordinary what the Taoiseach is saying in this respect.  In the drafting of the legislation there must have been people who went through the implications of the legislation in terms of upon whom it would impact.  It was not a secret to anyone in the Department of Finance, the NTMA or anywhere else that the credit unions had deposits with Anglo Irish Bank, subsequently IBRC.  Surely the implications of the liquidation would have been spelt out to the Taoiseach before he and the Minister brought the legislation to the House.  I find it incredible that the Taoiseach is saying he is not aware of this.  This is a very serious situation for the credit unions concerned.  The chatter around the credit union movement is that they are talking about &euro;17 million as an estimate in this respect and it might be higher or lower than that.  I asked the Taoiseach initially whether he was aware of this and he said he was not, which I find incredible.  What does he intend to do to support the credit union movement as a result of this very significant hit?</p></speech>

I took note that the Government gave notice of compulsory redundancies in the public sector at the beginning of those negotiations and then the Taoiseach gave notice that he would legislate for pay cuts.  He must know this is not the way to engage in good faith.  Lower and middle income public sector workers have seen their pay significantly reduced between pay cuts and the Fianna F&aacute;il pension levy, and there are now two, or perhaps even three, tiers of pay for workers doing exactly the same job.  That is the type of inequality the Taoiseach is now deepening within the public sector.  Public sector workers are generally working harder, longer and for less money, particularly those at the front line who have seen their numbers reduced during the past two years.  By contrast, and here is the rub, those at the top have been protected.  Bonanza pay and pensions remain in place-----</p></speech>

There is no question of the Government focusing particularly on one sector here.  This is an overall wage negotiation between Government and public service workers and, from that point of view, we have set our course here to rectify our public financial problems.

There is nothing fair about those in the upper echelons of the public service having such big salaries while all the time those in the lower echelons are subjected to cuts to pay and to these negotiations where the Government has already set out its objective - if it does not get its way in these talks - of bringing in its own diktats.  We think that negotiations on increased flexibility are fair enough but they must be done in the context of the contribution of the work that rank and file public servants are doing and have done in tackling this crisis.  Attacking pay from the bottom up is not a reform and it is certainly not fair.  Senior managers and officeholders, like the Taoiseach, are paid more than their European counterparts.</p><p>When the Prime Minister of France was elected he took a pay cut, voluntarily, of 30%.  The Taoiseach took a pay cut of 6%.  He cannot say that nurses, garda&iacute;, fire officers, teachers and others who provide a very valuable service need to contribute more than those at the top while those at the top continue to be protected.  In his own Department, two special advisers are paid &euro;168,000 and in the Department of Social Protection, the special adviser is paid &euro;127,000.  That is the nub of my question - how can the Taoiseach credibly call for cuts in the negotiations while those at the upper level continue to have lavish pay and pension rights which are protected by the Government?</p></speech>

I ask the Taoiseach and his colleagues to listen to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, refuses to listen to them and demonises them, saying that the GRA has "form".  This is different and anyone who watched the rally last night could clearly see the frustration on the faces of all of the front-line staff, including nurses and garda&iacute;, at the constant erosion of their salaries and payment levels and the lack of support for them in going about their duties and providing us with the safety we enjoy.  It behoves all of us in this House to support the front-line workers in their duties, which are very serious.  There is a very thin line between law and order and mayhem.</p><p>  I ask the Taoiseach to respond to issues raised by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are outside of the Croke Park extension negotiations and they feel the proposed cuts are a breach of the original agreement.  I ask the Taoiseach to insist that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has respect for the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and offers words of support and commendation to them, especially at this grave time, with them having lost one of their colleagues so tragically  in County Louth recently.  He must listen to the words of the passionate Father Cusack, who made eminent sense.  He was not talking from any pulpit but was speaking the plain language of the ordinary people who have fear in their eyes.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that there are some cuts to free legal aid and that the approach is balanced and not all on the side of the criminals.

What the Commissioner is telling the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality is totally at variance with what we all of us are hearing on a daily basis.  The GRA is urgently requesting a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and wants him to outline how he is going to support his force.  The Taoiseach is saying one thing here and another thing elsewhere.  He and some of his Ministers have said that they will legislate to cut garda allowances if the cuts  are not accepted in the Croke Park talks.  Is that the way to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I think not.  </p></speech>

However, I believe a concerted political solution is still required.  I remain deeply concerned at the street violence in parts of Belfast since late last year, the attacks on members of the PSNI including the attempted murder of police officers and the widespread attempts to intimidate public representatives and their families.</p><p>  The Government has no closer political relationship than with the Northern Ireland Executive.  That is reflected in the fact that we have had more meetings with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive over the past year than at any other time since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Let me repeat that for Deputy Martin.</p></reply>

As I have previously stated we will continue to work closely with the British Government and with political representatives in Northern Ireland to identify ways to help to address not just the current crisis but its underlying causes.   In this regard the T&aacute;naiste is in regular contact with political leaders in the North.  At his most recent meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, on 11 February they agreed to continue working together to support the parties in Northern Ireland in addressing both the underlying and immediate causes of the violence seen in recent months on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  They also urged strong support for the PSNI and the Parades Commission as the summer loyalist marching season approaches.</p><p>  When he last met the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister he made clear that the Government will provide all support necessary for Executive Ministers and local politicians to find solutions to the current situation.  This is about building relationships between communities which have been divided for so long, which takes courage and persistence.  It also requires respect and tolerance for different traditions to achieve consensus, often around the difficult issues of flags and symbols.  It is also about equality and a determination to end ongoing sectarianism which persists despite all our best efforts.</p><p>  Let me again emphasise that security and co-operation on the island has never been stronger.  This was discussed when I met on 18 January with David Ford, Northern Ireland Minister for Justice and leader of the Alliance Party, some of whose members were targeted by loyalist groups in the aftermath of the decision by Belfast City Council.</p><p>  The violence that we have witnessed is of broad concern across society, including business and industry who are rightly concerned about the negative impact at home and the damaged reputation abroad.  The British Government shares our concern regarding the violence and the consequential damage to Northern Ireland's international reputation and the cost to local business and tourism prospects.  The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want to see an end to street violence.  The violent protests and riots have caused major damage to community relations, severely curtailed economic activity in the pre-Christmas period and conveyed a deeply negative impression of Northern Ireland to international audiences, countering the positive campaigns to attract tourism and investment and potentially undermining the gains from last year's positive events.  All of that potential should not be lost due to the actions of a small number of determined individuals or groups.</p><p>  This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response. I hope that party leaders in Northern Ireland will shortly agree on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols.  Moving forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism have such a crucial</p><p>role.  As I have already said the Government is ready to support the Executive and political leadership in Northern Ireland in whatever way we can.</p><p>  There has been valuable progress in co-operation through the North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South implementation bodies. The institutional framework of the NSMC is robust and works well.  The meetings are always positive as we continue to seek ways of developing North-South co-operation across a range of agreed areas to the mutual benefit of all the people on this island.  The joint communiques that issue following each plenary meeting only give a sense and summary of the real engagement that takes place.  I would, of course, like to see more progress being made.  There is greater room for further co-operation. However, I am satisfied that continual progress is being made through the programme of ministerial meetings that takes place between plenary sessions.</p><p>  Across a range of issues, the NSMC is facilitating economic and social sector activities on a cross-Border, all-island basis.  Ministers have reiterated their commitment to practical co-operation on economic co-operation and to explore areas where potential cost savings might be achieved.  The potential benefits of developing markets for both jurisdictions has been recognised.</p><p>  In the area of transport, Ministers have agreed on a detailed timetable for the drafting, passage and enactment of parallel legislation, North and South, by 31 December 2014 to allow the mutual recognition of penalty points across Ireland.  In the tourism area, Tourism Ireland is currently rolling out major promotional campaigns for The Gathering Ireland 2013 and the UK City of Culture 2013, which is Derry.</p><p>  InterTradelreland has introduced two new programmes Challenge and Elevate which support SMEs and micro businesses to grow and develop through innovation and exporting against difficult market conditions in both jurisdictions.  They have also overseen an increase of over 50% in European funding for research and development for the period from November 2011 to July 2012 for North-South projects.</p><p>  In the field of environment, work has now commenced on the repatriation of illegally dumped waste at a further two sites in County Tyrone.  Education is a sector of great promise.  Among the joint work being undertaken is a joint attitudinal survey to inform cross-Border pupil movement and school planning and liaison between the two teaching councils with the objective of facilitating full mobility of teachers across both jurisdictions.  In health, there is ongoing collaboration on minimum unit price for alcohol and proposals for a North-South alcohol forum to develop strategies in both jurisdictions on alcohol misuse.  Planning is well advanced for the establishment of a radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin.  Construction will commence this year with the unit being operational in 2016.  </p><p>  Both the Irish and the British Government remain strongly committed to improving economic ties on the island of Ireland also.  The joint statement signed last March between Prime Minister Cameron and I envisages a comprehensive programme of engagement between the two administrations, including close bilateral engagement between respective departments and regular meetings at Secretary General-Permanent Secretary level.</p><p>  A series of bilateral meetings have taken place across a range of policy areas since then.  A plenary meeting of Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries took place in November in London and considered progress to date, mapped out future work as well as looking ahead to the annual review summit in 2013.  The joint economic study currently underway also takes into account the North-South dimension of the all-island and east-west relationship.  The main findings emerging from the study will also inform the summit meeting in March with Prime Minister Cameron.  While the agenda has yet to be formalised we will also be discussing the developments in the North as well as other issues.</p><p>  I met for over an hour with the SDLP in Government Buildings last Thursday.  In the words of Alasdair McDonnell, MLA, our discussions were honest, positive and constructive and we covered a range of issues across the political spectrum including the forthcoming parades season.</p><p>I listened very carefully to what he and his colleagues had to say in the aftermath of the recent protests and disturbances and to their assessment of how the Executive is functioning under these pressures.  We jointly spoke of the challenges and opportunities for the island at this current time.</p><p> I reassured him of my intention to continue to work together with the British Government as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  I also said that at my meeting with Prime Minister Cameron in London next month we will discuss these issues, as well as advancing the ambitions of the Good Friday Agreement.  This combined effort, along with the support of our friends in the US, including President Obama and his Administration, is aimed at ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all.  We are nearly 15 years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and we need to get beyond difficulties such as contentious parades.  I want to assist the Northern Ireland Executive in its efforts to grow the economy and improve social conditions for all communities there and along the Border counties.</p><p> Finally, I briefed the SDLP on our successful efforts to secure &euro;150 million for a PEACE IV programme, as well as our co-operation with the North on Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  The PEACE IV programme was signed off during the discussions on the MFF at the recent meeting in Brussels.  I want to look at ways in which strengthening North-South relations can reap economic rewards.  The SDLP will also meet the T&aacute;naiste later this week and I welcome this renewed focus between us.</p></speech>

The disturbances over the flag issue should serve as a major wake-up call for everyone that all is not well.  Added to that are the ongoing efforts of criminal dissident elements who are trying to organise and perpetrate violence against the security forces and individuals.  The evidence shows significant elements of the community in Northern Ireland are still excluded.</p><p>  Many people look at the parties in power in the Executive and see partisan interests triumphing.  There is no sense of a cross-party approach on some of the core issues facing the North, and that has been the case for some time.  The work of promoting development and directly combating sectarianism has not been done with the required urgency.  Something new is needed.  Previous Governments worked very hard to win this peace and put in enormous efforts with parties to bring it about.  Those hard-won gains could dissipate if something new and fresh is not developed now and if greater urgency is not shown in addressing communal exclusion and sectarianism and the gap between communities from different traditions.</p><p>  The recent disturbances and increased activity by criminal elements show the need to give peace, reconciliation and development the same priority the Taoiseach's predecessors gave them.  I am not talking about set-piece meetings or summits, I am talking about deep engagement with the issues and communities involved.  There has not been a proper governmental response to the disturbances and the related issues.  I have not seen any extra initiatives over and above what has happened to date to tackle the entrenched communal divide on the streets.  Is the Taoiseach proposing in partnership with the British Government and the parties any fresh initiative over and above the ongoing meetings that are part of the institutional arrangements?  What does he intend to do to respond to the present situation?  Specifically, will the Taoiseach give a commitment to convene a special summit with all the political parties in the North to deal with these issues and chart out a pathway that de-escalates tensions and gives new energy to anti-sectarian initiatives?</p><p>  This is more than contact, we need a new initiative here on a scale which may require investment but that will have a long-term impact, particularly for communities where there is significant social and economic under-provision and deprivation.  Some of those communities are becoming fertile ground for those who wish to exploit these issues to cause violence and stir up sectarianism, exacerbating the existing divide.</p></speech>

Clearly we are not happy about the situation when there were riots before and after Christmas with disruption, injury and threats to PSNI officers, along with the acquisition and discovery of rocket launchers here in the South for use by dissident groups in Northern Ireland with potentially lethal consequences.  That is why we had direct discussions with President Van Rompuy of the Council on the PEACE IV initiative, including funding of &euro;150 million, not an insignificant amount, and how to use it effectively to continue the work many community groups on both sides of the divide have been involved in over recent years.</p><p>  There has been a lot of interaction between the Oireachtas and the Assembly and the Government and Downing Street.  I will speak with Prime Minister Cameron about this early in March when I visit there, both to review the strategic partnership agreement we signed on behalf of the Government and people last year and to focus on the question of Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Deputy Martin is aware the G8 conference will take place in June in Fermanagh and there is an opportunity during the preparations for that to also discuss the possibility of doing some things differently in Northern Ireland.  Clearly, it is vital that we continue to work in co-operation with the PSNI to deal with cross-Border terrorism.  That is why I will raise the reports that Britain wants to pull out of the justice arrangements at European Union level with Prime Minister Cameron.  This would have particular consequences when it comes to dealing with crime and criminal activities across Ireland.  I intend to spend some of the time in discussions with the British Prime Minister on his own personal involvement in the activities in Northern Ireland, what we can do here to continue the high level of ministerial activity that takes place and see how best we can use our experience in Northern Ireland to predict the sore points and how we can then deal with issues surrounding contentious parades with the Parades Commission.  We can then concentrate on moving beyond that to economic arguments about the fostering and development of investment in Northern Ireland, where the answer is for the creation of jobs leading to careers in business.</p><p>  I intend to spend a portion of my discussions with the British Prime Minister concentrating on those areas and will follow through with direct ministerial contact where it is appropriate.</p></speech>

The leaders came together in the middle of the riots to put together a community response and to ask disparate groups on the streets to desist from continuous rioting.  It would be only right and proper to discuss this at prime ministerial level to see how both Governments might approach this and whether the suggestion made by Deputy Martin is of any value.  I got a particular insight from the leader of the SDLP, Alasdair McDonnell, MLA, about the SDLP view of the workings of the Executive and Assembly and issues that must be focused on as a priority.</p><p>It might be better to meet individual leaders in the first instance to see where is the range of where we might be able to assist.</p><p> I hope that the PEACE IV allocation can be used, as the Deputy stated, in a different and possibly new way, with greater beneficial impact for everybody.</p></speech>

I made the same criticism of the previous Government.  I understand how the affairs of this State can keep a government so busy, especially with the economic situation, but the Taoiseach last week correctly highlighted the need to nurture the peace process and not to take it for granted.  Therefore, there is a big onus on the Government both to raise it with the British Government and show leadership on these matters.</p><p>  There are outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  We do not have a bill of rights, which is part of the Good Friday Agreement, and neither do we have a charter of rights, which is also part of a recommendation for the all-island dispensation.  We do not have acht na Gaeilge.  I attended two events yesterday, the first of which was just outside Maghera in County Derry, at Carntogher, a wonderful development for the Irish language community.  The other, last night in Newry, was at Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail, a new building which is a hub for the Irish language.  However, we still do not have what the Good Friday Agreement promised us.  Therefore, there is ongoing work.</p><p>  I want to raise two questions.  Last week, an all-party delegation from here visited Maghaberry prison and also the city hospital to meet Ms Marian Price.  An Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh was my party's representative on that delegation and I have asked him to give the Taoiseach a report on it because there are issues of concern.</p><p>  The biggest issue at present surrounds the continued imprisonment of Ms Marian Price and a man called Mr. Martin Corey.  They are held without charge or trial.  There is no due process whatsoever.  I raised this with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and I gave him a doctor's report on Ms Price's health.  The delegation found her very ill.  Obviously, she is also grieving for her sister, Dolours, who died just a short time ago.  She is confined.  The Government needs to raise these issues.  I would like to know when was the last time the matter was raised and whether the Government will unequivocally call for the release of these two individuals.</p><p>  On the big issue of the ongoing situation on the streets of Belfast, the vast majority of the people of Belfast are opposed to what is happening.  Those who are fomenting the violence and the protests are a very small minority and they are persons who either fear change or who are exploiting those who are afraid of change.  There needs to be an unequivocal message from all the political leaders in the North that this must stop.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Backing Belfast campaign which is doing its best to bring people back into the city with all sorts of innovative ideas.  I acknowledge the support of the Government, the Mayor of Dublin and the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for this campaign.  The only way we will change these folks who are very sectarian - sectarianism is a scourge on this island, particularly in the North - is if we change the political conditions in which they live, and we will only do that if there is a strategic approach to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the ongoing development and nurturing of the peace process.</p><p>  Specifically, I ask the Taoiseach to give us an update on the Government's position on the continued incarceration of Ms Price and Mr. Corey and ask him to do his level best to have these two individuals released.</p></speech>

I commend the business people and the retailers in Belfast on the extraordinary resilience they showed in the face of all those riots and their efforts to continue to say to people that they are welcome to Belfast and that it is a city where they can have good business engagement.  I hope, following the period of calm, that does not return and Northern Ireland business, in particular, Belfast business, is allowed continue to progress as it has done for quite a number of years.</p><p>  I answered on the bill of rights previously.  This is part of the Good Friday Agreement but it is a case for the Northern Ireland parties to come forward with their proposals.  When they do, we would be happy to engage with them.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, we would be anxious to see the agreement, of which that is part, implemented in full but the piece of the jigsaw that is missing is the proposals for this from the Northern Ireland parties.</p><p>  I am aware that an all-party delegation visited Maghaberry prison and met and spoke to Ms Marian Price.  This is a difficult situation.  It is not easy to decide what is the best thing to do.  I look forward to hearing the report of the all-party committee.  I hope to have that soon so that I can both read it and raise the matter directly with the British Prime Minister when I discuss Northern Ireland issues with him when I have the opportunity to meet him in early March.  Obviously, it is a matter of concern but one hears different options that should be available here.  I am aware of the circumstances of Ms Price going back into Maghaberry and of the medical reports regarding her state of health.  I look forward to getting the report from the committee shortly and I have undertaken to discuss that as part of my discussions with the British Prime Minister on Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach stated he met the SDLP.  My party has met with that party and others.  There is a view that the meeting of the five parties has not quite produced the results or achieved anything in the aftermath of the disturbances.  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a view that it needs a governmental initiative with the parties to really take stock.  What has occurred is a wake-up call.  Some parties in the North certainly would welcome a governmental response to the issue.  That is why I have asked if the Taoiseach would consider convening a meeting with the British Prime Minister and the five main parties to discuss the fallout of what has happened, to chart a way forward, and to give fresh impetus and a sense of urgency to the issue.  Time is of the essence.  In the course of this year, over and above the traditional marching season, we will have other commemorations and we are leading into a period of significant historic commemorations which have the potential to be exploited by those who would like to do so.  I put it to the Taoiseach that such is an initiative he should consider.  I ask that he give serious consideration to convening such a summit.</p></speech>

As I stated, in approximately three weeks I will have the opportunity to discuss these matters directly with the British Prime Minister.  At that level, if we have the opportunity to consider any new initiative, that is the place to do it.  If, arising from that, it was deemed appropriate to try to get all the groups together, it is certainly something that could be considered.  I am not sure there is anything new in that but it might bring a collective focus on issues that might be tackled.</p><p>  As we approach the beginning of the marching season, on the questions of the parades and of the PSNI, I am somewhat concerned at the level of activity in dissident groups.  The detection by the Garda recently of the find here in the Republic was, to put it mildly, disturbing.</p><p>These are issues I want to discuss with the British Prime Minister and I will be happy to report to the House following our discussions about that.  I will take into account what the Deputy said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900023#V00200"><p>Let us talk about what is happening on the ground up there.  When the two British soldiers were killed and when the two PSNI officers were separately killed, the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, came out and stood shoulder to shoulder with the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, and the Chief Constable of the PSNI.  He made it clear that it was unacceptable, that those days were done and that everybody had to come out and support the peace process.  The difficulty is that elements of unionism have not been as forthright as that in this situation.  They have their own reasons for that and I am being very measured in how I put this.  The five political leaders did not meet, as we know.  I know the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, relatively well and he has his own reasons for all of this.  He has a slightly different position and, unfortunately, that feeds into what is happening on the ground.  What is happening in the ground is significant because it is blatantly sectarian.  An Irish League soccer match over the weekend between two local teams, Crusaders and Cliftonville, had to be called off because these protesters went directly to that ground to foment sectarian trouble.  Great credit is due to the two clubs which showed real anti-sectarianism by bringing all their supporters together.  Unfortunately, sport suffered.  Similarly protesters are quite blatantly and deliberately going to the Short Strand.</p><p>  We all think of the marching season as a summer spectacle, but it is going to start at the end of this month and will again go to areas that are vulnerable.  There is urgency about dealing with this and there is a need to work intelligently with the leaders of unionism and all of those great Unionists who do not want anything to do with this.  Regardless of the position they have on the flag issue, they are certainly opposed to what is happening in terms of the violence and sectarianism.</p><p>  On the issue of Ms Marian Price, the Taoiseach said it is difficult to know what to do.  There is a straightforward rule.  If a citizen is to be accused of an offence, that citizen should be brought forward and subjected to due process - sin &eacute;.  Ms Marian Price has not been subjected to due process.  Whatever has been said against her has been said in secret - she cannot even hear it.  It is back to the old days of internment, commissions and all the rest of it.  I spent one and a half years in prison - in both a prison ship and in a cage - on that basis.  It is easy to know what to do, with respect.  If they want to keep these individuals in prison, let them go through due process or let the rest of us demand that they be released forthwith.</p></speech>

Obviously as leader of the Alliance Party he gave me some insights into the impact on the streets and the homes, and the sectarianism that erupted from disparate groups both before and after Christmas.  This is an issue about which we need to be concerned not only because of the advent of the marching season, but also the centenary commemorations that are beginning.  Nobody wants to have these disrupted or hijacked for particular causes.  Everybody recognises that because these things will be commemorated by particular groups, organisations or individuals, they should be done in a comprehensive and sensitive fashion.</p><p>  The view of the all-party Oireachtas committee is important in the case of Ms Marian Price.  I have had different comments in regard to the robustness of her state of health at the moment, which is an issue that needs to be considered.  I am anxious to get the report from the Oireachtas committee quickly.  As I said, I hope to raise this issue directly with the British Prime Minister when I meet him in a few weeks' time.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.221.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900023#V01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 23, inclusive, together.</p><p>  I attended the meeting of the European Council on 22 and 23 November which aimed to reach agreement on the multiannual financial framework.  Following productive discussions, it was decided that a little more time was needed to bring positions closer together and that, while we would maintain intensive contacts, we would return to the matter at a later time.</p><p>  While I did not circulate any papers at the November European Council, in my bilateral contacts with President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, and in the meeting proper, I set out very clearly Irish concerns and priorities concerning the MFF.  I subsequently followed up on a number of points in writing with President Van Rompuy. </p><p>  I am happy to report to the House that the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework were finalised at the meeting of the European Council on 7 and 8 February.  As I stated to the House last week, I believe the deal is a good one for Ireland and for Europe, one that fully protects our vital national interests - including in providing for a strong CAP - and recognises the impact of the economic crisis on this country through special allocations to the BMW region and under rural development funding.  In addition, Ireland will be able to access a new &euro;6 billion fund to tackle youth unemployment.</p><p>  The February European Council also adopted substantial conclusions on trade.  Leaders agreed that the immediate priority must be to develop our bilateral trade agenda.  The Irish Presidency had already set out an ambitious agenda in that regard, prioritising negotiations that provide the most benefit in terms of growth and job creation.  In that respect, progressing the EU-US trade relationship is a particular priority. </p><p>  In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama provided a significant impetus when he announced that talks would be launched on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  This was followed the next day by a joint statement from President Obama and Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso in which they undertook to initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch the negotiations.  This is a very significant development.  Let me assure the House that Ireland, as Council President, we will spare no effort to make the maximum possible progress on this issue during the rest of our term, with a particular focus on securing a negotiating mandate within the Council.</p><p>  I attended the meeting of the European Council on 13 and 14 December in Brussels.  As I have already made a statement to the House on this meeting, I will merely give a summary of its proceedings.  Discussions focussed on President Van Rompuy's final report on strengthening economic and monetary union, and good progress was made on a number of fronts, including banking union.  Building on an agreement in ECOFIN on the eve of the summit, the European Council called for early agreement with the parliament on the single supervisory mechanism.  That work is now well under way.  Establishment of the SSM will pave the way for possible recapitalisation of banks by the ESM, and the European Council called for an operational framework for this to be agreed as soon as possible.</p><p>  The December European Council also agreed conclusions on the annual growth survey and the European semester process, the Single Market and unemployment, including the adoption of the youth guarantee in early 2013.  In addition, the European Council asked the High Representative to prepare for a discussion of the Union's Common Security and Defence Policy in December 2013.  We also had a discussion on Syria.</p><p>  I am responsible before the House in respect of my role as a member of the European Council.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade retains overall ministerial responsibility for the co-ordination of EU affairs.  Parliamentary questions on European matters are answered on that basis.</p><p>  The next meeting of the European Council is scheduled for 14 and 15 March.  The draft agenda for that meeting will focus on concluding the first phase of the European semester process and, in that context, the state of implementation of the compact for growth and jobs.

Were the Taoiseach to do so, questions could be progressed much quicker than is currently the case.  For example, we are nearing the end of February and are only now dealing with questions in regard to the December summit.</p><p>  The Taoiseach referred in his reply to individual developments within the Union.  What is Ireland's policy in regard to the development of the European Union?  The work being undertaken by Mr. Van Rompuy is about setting the pathway for a different type of Union.  There is no doubt the Union will face major issues in the coming years.  A new treaty is to be discussed.  What is the Taoiseach's view on the British Tory Party seeking to roll back 30 years of development in the Union and his position on the demands of the British Government as articulated by the Tory Party Leader and Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron?  The difference between the speed of developments within the eurozone as opposed to the broader Union is becoming clear.  What is our position on this?  The future of the Union is at this point in time being defined.  What is the Government's position on all of this?  Where does it stand in relation to the proposals for different levels of integration with the European Union?  Also, what new reforms does the Taoiseach support in the context of the European Union?  Given the relocation of the EU division from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of the Taoiseach, these basic questions on EU policy fall to the Taoiseach to answer and give some direction on.</p><p>  There has been a huge gap in terms of Ireland's position on the future evolution of the European Union given all that has happened in the past two to three years and the perspectives emanating from different member states.  Ireland should at the very least develop a position on these fundamental issues.  Also, the Oireachtas should debate these issues.  An opportunity should be provided for the Oireachtas to debate either a White Paper or Green Paper on future European Union integration, the development of the Union and all institutions of the Union, including the European Central Bank.</p><p>  Mr. Jacques Delors, a founder of the European Central Bank, accepts that the treaty provisions regarding the European Central Bank should be changed.  Does the Irish Government support changes to the statute of the European Central Bank and how it operates?  The banking union referred to by the Taoiseach is not in accordance with the original vision of a banking union.  It is clear there will be no common resolution of the regime or deposit insurance and that a number, if not most, banks will escape common regulation.  Many banks, in particular German banks, are resiling on the need, as first articulated and repeated at the June summit, for a banking union.</p><p>  On the broader issue, what is the Government's policy on the European Union over the next number of years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900024#W01000"><p>As I have outlined on many occasions at the European Council, European Parliament and other meetings Ireland supports the development of the Union to its full potential, including the development of the Single Market and digital market.  We need to develop the unconcluded agreements on trade with Canada and the Far East and to implement the framework agreement on EU-US trade which, as the Deputy will be aware, have the potential to create almost 2 million jobs and to increase the economies of the Union by at least 2%.</p><p>  On the Government's view of the Union, the founding principles of the European Union are that big countries work with small countries, a demonstration of which is the assistance currently being provided to governments working in challenging circumstances as committed to by Europe.  The more one helps oneself the greater the demonstration of assistance.  After 40 years, Ireland remains a recipient country from the Union.  We would like to believe that in time and with proper competency Ireland could be a net contributor to the European Union.  This requires us to develop our economy and sort out our problems, thus proving we can be, like other countries, competent, competitive and attractive in terms of location for investment, thus giving our people the opportunity to give vent to their flair and creativity.</p><p>  I have answered the question about Britain on a number of occasions.  The Prime Minister has set out his stall in terms of the repatriation of certain powers from Europe and his view of the British people having an opportunity to decide by way of referendum in 2017 whether Britain should be part or not of Europe.  Ireland has been closely aligned with Britain for many years in terms of trade, business and so on.  We do not want to disrupt this.  The Deputy will be aware that the verdict of the fiscal responsibility referendum was 60:40 in favour of the euro and eurozone from an Irish point of view.  The European Union would regard the tradition of Britain being the driver of the Single Market as important.  The European Union and Leaders regard Britain as an important element of a new emerging Europe.  It is important to reflect again that 90% of the world's trade over the next ten years will take place outside the European Union.  For this reason, I would like to see European Union leaders begin to focus on the real priorities such as the implementation of a eurogrid in terms of energy.  We are currently losing out in the context of the increasing independence of the United States in terms of energy capacity from shale, gas, oil and so on, which means that costs for major investments in the United States have and will continue to drop and will increase in Europe as a consequence.  This is not good.  We also need to take account of the aging society in many European Union countries and how we propose to deal with it in terms of the provision of services.</p><p>  The European Union comprises the largest collection of well developed economies.  There is no reason we cannot bring this to a new level with the second greatest economic block in terms of the United States and all it yields.  Through Ireland's presidency of the European Council we are trying to make an effective impact across a thousand different fields for the good of the Union, which also helps us.  As an exporting country, we need to be lean and competitive and to be able to export quality goods worth &euro;500 million into that market.  It is important to note that the new Europe will have to take interest in what is happening across the Mediterranean in North Africa and the Middle East.  This is an issue on which Europe needs to reflect carefully.  It is also important to note that many countries in North Africa are growing by 5%, 6% and 7%, which presents trading opportunities for a country like Ireland.</p><p>  In the context of the Union as we know it, we are not reaching our potential because of the struggle and challenge faced by many countries in the eurozone and Europe as a whole.  As a Union with a population of 500 million people we have enormous potential to increase that.  We support enlargement.</p><p>Croatia expects to join on 1 July.  I have had meetings and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has been to all of the applicant countries, from Montenegro to Serbia and everywhere else, which want to make a case for joining the European Union once they can comply with all of the conditions required.  This is our position on Britain and generally in so far as the Union is concerned.</p><p> Through the chairmanship of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, we have allowed the financial transaction tax to go to a working group with enhanced co-operation.  While we disagree with this we have not held it up because more than 11 countries support it.  Banking union is one area where the finance Ministers were in a position to make a recommendation on time.  Following the decision of 29 June, a single supervisory mechanism architecture was established prior to Christmas and approved by the Ministers on the day before the European Council meeting where it was also approved.  It is now a part of the discussions which apply.  It is expected the architecture for banking union and the single supervisory mechanism should be in place by June, and I hope it is, but I cannot see it being effective or implemented until late this year or, more than likely, 2014.  The discussions taking place on the possibility of the ESM being allowed to recapitalise banks is part of these discussions and a working group is being established to consider the principle of extending the maturity dates which applied to Greece so they are also applicable to Portugal and Ireland.  They will report back in March.  If it is accepted it is of potential benefit to the country.</p><p> The programme of the Presidency is to deal with approval by the European Parliament of the multi-annual financial framework.  I was to have a meeting this morning in Brussels with President Barroso and President Schulz at 7 a.m. but it was not possible for President Schulz to attend so it has been postponed.  We have a responsibility to engage with the various sectors in the European Parliament to get this through, as consensus is required under the Lisbon treaty.  Reform of the CAP is of direct interest to us.  Ireland is working with our counterparts on 70 pieces of legislation to run an effective Presidency over the course of the next three to four months.  It is a very packed agenda.</p><p> I see a real necessity for leaders to focus on the bigger picture in a global sense so that Europe has the potential to play its real part.  Given the amount of trade taking place outside the borders of the European Union we have a major challenge ahead of us but also huge potential if we have the political will and agreement to get our affairs working as we all know they can.</p></speech>

The way they are now grouped is better and I thank the Taoiseach for this and I welcome it.  We should continue to examine ways we can get the most benefit from Questions to the Taoiseach.  Since the budget was announced in December we have had the deal with the ECB on the promissory note.  Prior to the budget we had the June announcement and the Government's claims the objective of separating bank debt from sovereign debt had been put together.  Last week, bank debt was converted into sovereign debt which strikes me as being a very big contradiction.  What is the status of the Eurogroup's decision of last June given what occurred at the most recent summit?  I stated at the time the Taoiseach was overselling the June deal and I made the same point with regard to the recent promissory note arrangement.</p><p>  On the day the deal was agreed we were told by Government spokespersons it would mean a &euro;1 billion saving.  The big question for most citizens is what does this mean to them.  SIPTU has called for the money to be invested in a job creation stimulus.  Will it be used for job creation or to lessen the burden of austerity?  Will the Government be able to do away with the property tax?  Will child benefit or carer's allowance be restored?  What will happen with regard to the &euro;1 billion which the Taoiseach states has been saved?  What progress can be made in the short term given the Taoiseach's claims about the deal?  What is the status of last June's decision to separate banking and sovereign debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900025#X00300"><p>There are already indications that the deal on the IBRC which the Taoiseach trumpeted as historic will face objections from Germany in particular and possibly elsewhere, and that the Government will not be allowed to in any way attempt to use the claimed savings to the State of &euro;1 billion next year and &euro;1 billion the year after to pull back or alleviate in any way the austerity which has been imposed or which the Government plans to impose under troika arrangements or as conditions or targets of the fiscal treaty.  Has this been indicated to the Taoiseach?  Was it indicated at the December summit?  Will our EU so-called "partners", particularly Germany, prevent the Government passing on any benefit of the supposedly historic deal on Anglo Irish Bank to citizens who are being hammered with austerity?  Will the Taoiseach clarify this?  If this is not the case will the Taoiseach clarify precisely what benefits can be passed on to ordinary citizens to alleviate the burden of cuts and austerity, or using the extra savings the Taoiseach claims to have as a result of the deal for financing a stimulus jobs programme or a programme of economic growth?  The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, is now discussing possible legal problems with the IBRC deal, and even the possibility of legal action being taken if the deal breaches ECB rules on monetary financing.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether this was discussed with him previously?  Was it signalled this might happen?  Did the Taoiseach fully proof the deal to ensure it would withstand any such legal challenges from the ECB or any other quarter in terms of its legality under ECB or European regulations?</p></speech>

Deputy Adams asked about the status of the European Council decision of 29 June.  It is as it was.  The decision was to break the vicious circle between sovereign and bank debt, taking into account the particular analysis of the well-performing programme in Ireland, that equal cases would receive equal treatment, and that following this the architecture of the single supervisory mechanism would be set in place.  These discussions are under way.  The decision of the European Council stands and has not been changed or revoked.  It is now being followed through.</p><p>In regard to when that will apply, it would be great if they could agree on the architecture for the single supervisory mechanism by June.  Obviously, however, it will be the back end of this year or into next year before those complex discussions can conclude.  Separate from that, if the question of the extension of the maturity applied to Greece is applicable to Portugal, which tabled this, and to Ireland it would be to our benefit as well.</p><p> With regard to the sum of &euro;1 billion being saved, this also goes into the question raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We have set out our stall as a country that is in a programme with the troika to get our deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015.  The borrowing requirement is &euro;12 billion this year, &euro;9 billion next year and &euro;5 billion in 2015.  There is no question but that these are challenging times.  However, this is about rectifying fundamental problems in our public finances and the economy to get to a point where we can start recruitment programmes again in a more structured way to deal with front-line services.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, who referred to this at the economic affairs committee of the European Parliament yesterday.  It is fair to say that since the decision was made, the IBRC has been liquidated, the promissory notes have been replaced by long-term bonds, the first repayment is not due until 2038, Standard &amp; Poor's has changed its view of the country, Irish Life has been sold today - which gives back over &euro;1 billion to the people in respect of what was put in there - and Facebook has announced extra jobs.</p><p> I can confirm that the line of investment in here continues to be very strong.  Hopefully, in due course, the bank guarantee will go, which will allow banks to be out in the markets themselves.  That will also allow greater flexibility for credit to be available for lending to small and medium enterprises which are the backbone of future growth in the economy.</p><p> As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, we are only in February.  We have set out the budgetary programme for 2013, which is challenging for a number of Departments, but it has to be achieved.  As we move through the year towards the back end, the Government will set out its position in so far as the budget for 2014 is concerned.</p></speech>

It is an extraordinary situation that we will be commencing the Finance Bill at about 9.45 p.m.  By my calculation, all the significant speeches by the Minister and the spokespersons will take us through to about 11.45 p.m.  This is not emergency legislation.  There is nothing of huge consequence in the Finance Bill itself.  I do not mean that in a negative way, it is just that nothing is required to be passed by midnight.  I know the Bill will also be discussed on Thursday.  To be frank, the Finance Bill should be discussed in broad daylight and should be given a reasonable timescale.  It does not have to finish on Thursday.  In previous years, Finance Bills went on longer.  I do not understand what the rush is.  I certainly think that it is not good for Parliament that the very first consideration of the Finance Bill would be at 9.45 p.m. right through to midnight.  I just do not see why.  It is almost reminiscent of December when we are rushing things thought prior to the Christmas break.  We are now in springtime and I do not see the necessity for this.  I think it is wrong for Parliament.  The Finance Bill is important legislation that deserves its proper priority space within the scheduling of the House's business.  In addition, the contributions of Members should get as full exposure as possible.  I hope the Taoiseach is not guillotining the Bill, although it seems that he will on Thursday.  That is something to which we would be very much opposed.</p></speech>

According to the<i> Irish Independent</i>, 600 appeals were filed in 2012, which is double the number filed in 2007.  What does the Government intend to do to respond to this situation in the context of the courts Bill?  Is consideration being given to appointing a new court of appeal, which would require a referendum, to which, I understand, the Government is committed?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that a referendum will take place?  When does he expect the publication of the courts Bill?</p><p><br />  While welcoming the sale of Irish Life to Great-West Lifeco's subsidiary, Canada Life (Ireland), 2,200 employees will be wondering about their fate in terms of security of tenure and employment?

It is highly relevant given that the Minister of State is visiting Kinvara today to launch a CoderDojo club.  Approximately 4,000 young people are involved in CoderDojo, which emerged as a result of a deficiency in science and computer science subjects in the education system.  I welcome the emphasis on the STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - subjects in the new junior certificate cycle and the introduction of standardised testing for the science subjects from 2016 onwards.</p><p>  The rationale for science is that it contributes to a balanced and broad educational experience for students, extending their experience at primary level.  It is concerned with the development of scientific, literacy and associated science process skills and an appreciation of the impact science has on our lives and the environment.  In an era of rapid scientific and technological change, the study of science is fundamental to the development of the confidence required to deal with the opportunities and challenges such changes present in a wide variety of personal and social contexts.  </p><p>  In 2006, Dr. Carol Gibbons, a former deputy chief scientific adviser, stated that we must foster and grow an interest in science at a very early age.  Dr. Gibbons is now senior investment adviser at Enterprise Ireland and her statement remains relevant.  In my area, the Kerry Group is generating technology jobs and Intel and Hewlett Packard are major employers. </p><p>Sadly, many of these companies have difficulty in finding Irish people with the relevant qualifications to take up positions.  This issue has arisen at the jobs committee in terms of accelerating the processing of work visa applications for people at that level.</p><p> Ireland is unique among 21 countries in that science is not compulsory at junior cycle level.  Students in Irish schools receive a lower proportion of teaching in science, approximately 8%, compared with the EU and OECD average of 12%.  As with mathematics, it has been reported that fewer than 30% of teachers who teach a scientific subject have a degree in that subject.  Many schools lack adequate laboratory facilities, as a result of which there is a tendency to reduce the amount of science taught.</p><p> I welcome many of the changes to the junior cycle.  In driving our economy in a new direction, though, our emphasis will be on educations based around science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects.  Making science a compulsory subject for everyone will be vital.  Will this idea form part of the Minister's proposals on a new junior cycle?</p></speech>

The implementation will begin on a phased basis in 2014.  The cohort of young people entering first year in September 2014 will be the first to partake.  All of the existing subjects, including science, will continue to be available.  All students will be required to experience 24 statements of essential learning as part of their junior cycle programmes.  These statements describe what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle, having fully engaged with and participated in the junior cycle programme of their schools.  Irish, except where there is an exemption, English and mathematics will remain core full subjects.</p><p>  One of the 24 statements of learning refers clearly to science when it states, &quot;values the role and contribution of science and technology to society, and their personal, social and global importance&quot;.  Furthermore, science is also recognised in the junior cycle framework as having a key role in a number of other statements of learning.  From 2016 onwards, there will be a standardised test for all second year students in science.  This gives a particular importance to science in the framework.  Schools will also have the option of providing locally developed short courses of 100 hours, supported by exemplars developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  However, it will be a matter for schools to determine from the range of subjects and short courses on offer how these statements of learning will be met.</p><p>  Overall, my Department is in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the school's discretion and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.  Schools are best placed to identify the needs of their students.  The junior cycle framework gives them the flexibility to meet their students' needs in the most appropriate way.</p><p>  Currently, science is not a compulsory subject in the junior cycle.  However, the overwhelming majority of students, some 88%, opt to take it.  The specifications for science are being developed by the NCCA.  The new specifications will be implemented in schools from 2015.  We know that there will be a greater emphasis on school work than heretofore.  In the recast junior cycle syllabus, some 40% of the marks will be awarded for the second component, that is, work in the classroom, and only 60% for the final exam.  This will allow students and their instructors to engage to a greater extent in practical learning.  Hopefully, it will encourage more students to continue their science and maths studies into the senior cycle and beyond.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the three core subjects, those being, Irish, English and mathematics.  I have a problem with Irish being a core subject.  It only seems to be so because the universities have set it as an entry requirement.  Science is of more relevance and importance.</p><p>  I am concerned that schools will be given the flexibility to decide on what subjects to provide.  Science costs more and requires laboratories if it is to maintained as a core subject.  A number of parents have approached me with concerns that their children, who will be starting the new cycle in 2014, might not be offered science because the number of classes that their schools can teach will be limited.</p><p>  Another problem is teachers, in that we do not have enough.  This problem dates back to the Celtic tiger era when many people did not take scientific subjects.</p><p>  I would love to see science as a core subject.  If we are to drive our economy, it will be through maths, English and science.  These will help us to extricate ourselves from this situation.</p></speech>

At one point, we were going to restrict the number of subjects that could be done in the new junior cycle to eight, of which three would be the core subjects.  In reality, almost 90% of young people are taking science.  Making it compulsory would run into the difficulties to which the Deputy referred, since some small post-primary schools of 200 plus pupils would not have the resources or facilities to provide the course.  The level of uptake is high at 88%.</p><p>  Giving schools and pupils the choice to run their junior cycle in the revised system of ten subjects rather than eight, which was the original thinking, plus the specific breakdown of subjects that might replace a course, will provide some flexibility.  I hope that, as we move forward, science will become embedded and will be regarded for all intents and purposes as a core subject along with the others.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1040" speakername="Michael Kitt" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900030#CC00600"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for his attendance.  I raised this issue with him previously by way of a question on the yellow flag programme.  I will explain, for while the Minister knows the House might not.</p><p><br />  The yellow flag programme is described as a &quot;progressive equality and diversity initiative for primary and secondary schools&quot; that &quot;promotes and supports an environment for interculturalism.&quot;  Through a co-operative approach involving students, staff and management, it is possible to consider issues of diversity and equality.  These should not be seen as school subjects.  Rather, they should be taken outside the school setting, as they affect everyone's life.</p><p><br />  We are all familiar with the green schools project.  In parallel with that environmental programme, the yellow flag programme is a practical scheme with an award as an incentive.  Following completion of the eight steps involved and an external assessment, a school is awarded the yellow flag in recognition of its work in promoting diversity and inclusion.</p><p><br />  When I raised this issue last December, the Minister replied:<blockquote>My Department has not provided support for the programme referred to by the Deputy, which I understand was run as a pilot project in some schools.  In view of the current economic climate, funding for new programmes, including this programme, cannot be considered at this time.</blockquote>I was disappointed by the Minister's answer, as the programme would not be expensive.  The Minister might inform me of the situation, but I hope that the pilot scheme has been successful.  As the Traveller movement has stated, there is a great need for diversity among teachers and for additional anti-racism training at the colleges of education.  The teaching practice programme should send a message of diversity in the education system.</p><p><br />  Gaelscoil Riabhach in Loughrea, County Galway, has a yellow flag.  Nationally, 26 schools are working on the green flag scheme and 30 have been awarded it, including Gaelscoil Riabhach.  Thirteen schools are working towards the yellow flag, including St. Patrick's boys' national school in Tuam, County Galway.</p><p><br />  I hope that we can make more progress.</p><p>I am worried that the Children's Rights Alliance has awarded the Government an E grade for its unsatisfactory performance on issues affecting Traveller children.  Likewise, any cutbacks to education should not affect Traveller children in the education system because it would only reinforce and condemn another generation of young Traveller children to exclusion and marginalisation.  I hope the Minister will examine the issue again.  The yellow flag programme is worthwhile and perhaps the Department might be able to support it.</p></speech>

The programme works through a model based on eight practical steps which allows schools to apply the steps to the day-to-day running of the school.  The yellow flag programme is a practical scheme with an award incentive.  Following completion of the eight steps and external assessment of the school, it is awarded its yellow flag in recognition of its work in promoting diversity and inclusion.</p><p>  The programme operates through a co-operative approach of students, staff, management, parents and wider community groups so that issues of diversity and equality are not merely seen as school subjects but can be understood and taken outside the school setting into everyone's personal lives, creating an environment for inclusion with a long-term impact on wider society.  The yellow flag programme was initially piloted in four schools, two primary and two secondary, in 2008 to 2009.  A further 17 schools in Dublin, Wicklow, Clare, Galway, Louth, Meath, Kerry and Limerick have been included in the programme.</p><p>  The yellow flag programme is a private initiative supported by philanthropic funding.  It is not funded by the Department.  I am pleased to say that the authors of the yellow flag programme, the Irish Traveller Movement, were consulted on the development of the anti-bullying action plan which I launched recently.  The ITM made a comprehensive submission and also met the anti-bullying working group to outline the particular issues that arise for children from the Traveller community who experience bullying at school and the role of the yellow flag programme in addressing the issues.  The action plan report recognised that while bullying can happen to anyone, some groups are particularly at risk.  A number of submissions to the working group focused specifically on vulnerable groups including children and young people from the Traveller community.  The working group recommended that the definition of bullying in the new national procedures for schools should include a specific reference to identity-based bullying and that all grounds of harassment under the Equal Status Acts should be listed in anti-bullying policies - gender, including transgender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.</p><p>  The popularity of the yellow flag programme means that it clearly strikes a chord with schools who wish to develop inclusive and respectful school communities.  I hope it will be possible for the Irish Traveller Movement to continue to make it available to schools.  At the very least I hope that some best practice and learning in this important area can be extracted from its use to date for wider use.</p></speech>

I am especially pleased that he mentioned the anti-bullying policy developed by the Department.  He is correct to state that an issue arose about identity-based bullying.  That has been raised by many interested parties, in particular by the Irish Traveller Movement.  I hope the Department will support the initiative to tackle identity-based bullying.  One way of doing so is the yellow flag programme although I am not sure where the funding will come from if we are depending on the philanthropic sector.  The yellow flag programme should be supported in the same way as the green flag scheme for the environment, which has been supported by local authorities and the Department.</p><p>  The bottom line is that schools have changed and different challenges and issues face them.  We must move to deal with them.  I hope it will be the case that the rights of ethnic minorities will be dealt with by the Government at a later stage.  The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance award of an E grade to the Government suggests we face a serious challenge.  I hope the Minister will deal with the issues confronting schools.  Different issues face schools currently and significant challenges arise with the diverse school population.</p></speech>

He has had a particular interest in it for some time and I welcome the fact that he has raised it again today.  However, we do not have the additional resources that are necessary.  We have focused in a major way on bullying in the school place, both within the classroom and outside and within the entire school community.  The guidelines on bullying within the Department of Education and Skills were last examined in 1993 and 20 years later we have focused on the manifestation of bullying in all of its current forms, including identity bullying and specifically in the context of Travellers being bullied or harassed because of their identity and special ethnic background.</p><p>  What the Deputy has raised is constructive.  Discrimination, bullying and ostracisation are in a related space to bullying, as defined within the new guidelines on bullying.  The guidelines have been made available to various groups and through the Irish Traveller Movement I urge them to utilise that particular vehicle which is being funded.  I have allocated &euro;500,000 to promote the guidelines in various forms.  I ask Deputy Kitt and the Irish Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance to align the new guidelines with the yellow flag programme to achieve the same outcome and desired results he has brought to the attention of the House.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, for attending to respond to the issue I raise.  Most of my constituents, as with the vast majority of constituents, are decent law-abiding citizens.  They pay their car taxes and property taxes.  They are paying an ever-increasing array of taxes which the majority of them have no difficulty with and are happy to so do.  However, they are asking a legitimate question of their elected representatives, namely, what are they getting in return.  There is only so much one can say about righting the wrongs of the past and explaining to them that it is a case of putting on the green jersey.  People in my constituency do not make a lot of demands on their elected representatives, and most of the demands they make are reasonable.  One issue that is important and is always contentious in west Cork is the road network people have to travel every day.  It is a large tract of land with a large road network and people are constantly challenged by the conditions they must endure.  That has been particularly exacerbated in the past 12 months.  The Minister will be aware of the crumbling road network as he recently visited the constituency.  We are grateful for the visit.  I do not refer lightly to the crumbling road network.  I do not wish to be populist or to overly play my hand.</p><p><br />  The road network is crumbling for a number of reasons.  They include the inclement weather and the challenging flood events we have had in recent years.  There has been a significant reduction in the overall amount of funding for roads.  The most important factor has been the lack of maintenance for a number of decades.  Water has simply not been removed from roads.  I am not an engineer and do not have an engineering background but it is not rocket science to realise that if water is left on the road, it will increase the challenge to maintain the road.  When driving on the roads, one can see the floods of water washing the roads away before one's eyes.  It is disheartening.</p><p><br />  I am a big fan of the old adage that if one always does what one always did, then one will always get what one always got.  I call for a root and branch review of how the tens of millions of euro the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport allocates to Cork County Council on an annual basis is spent.  The Department must show leadership.  I am aware the reduction in funding being allocated to roads is primarily as a result of the reduction in the finances of the council.  I acknowledge the rebalancing the Department brought last year to the overall funding for Cork County Council which brought it more in line with funding for other counties<i> pro rata </i>on the basis of size and the length of road network.  That is much appreciated.</p><p>I am not here to look for another &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million because I live in the real world and I know that we will not get that kind of money.  We must be much more clever about how we use the moneys we have.  I plead with the Minister to instruct his officials to engage with councils and to have a root and branch reform of how these moneys are spent and of how we can maintain our road network.  We must go back to basics: we must clear the waterways, remove water from the roads and in that way allow the roads to be strengthened.  If that were to be forthcoming from the Minister's Department, I would be very appreciative.</p><p> During the past three years I have worked to have a scheme established and I made several pleas to the previous Administration in this respect.  I use this opportunity to renew my plea to the Minister to support me in my efforts to get a scheme up and running.  I would ideally like a pilot scheme that would allow unemployed people to assist on road maintenance work to be run in county Cork.  Dozens of people have approached and pleaded with me in my constituency office to establish such a scheme.  These are people who are long-term unemployed who do not want to be sitting at home and would love to contribute to the overall benefit of the community.  I hope the Minister would consider establishing such a scheme in due course along with the re-organisation and a reappraisal of how the money allocated to councils is being spent on the roads.</p></speech>

The House will be aware that the issue of the maintenance and upkeep of regional and local roads was the subject of oral questions earlier today and I dealt with many of the issues and circumstances surrounding this issue then.</p><p><br />  As with any debate on the matter of the roads network, be they regional, local or national, the House will be familiar with the qualifying preamble.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p><br />  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA.  Its budget for improvement and maintenance works on national roads is &#8364;318 million for 2013.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources, which are supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p><br />  I announced the 2013 regional and local road grant allocations on 25 January this year.  A total of &#8364;348 million is being provided under the regional and local roads investment programme this year and, from that allocation, Cork County Council is being provided with more than &#8364;39.7 million.</p><p><i></i>The level of grants allocated to individual local authorities is determined having regard to a number of factors.  These include the total funds available in a particular year, eligibility criteria for the different road grant schemes, road pavement conditions, length of road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities.  In determining the annual grant allocations, the overall objective remains to supplement the resources provided by each local authority in a fair and appropriate manner.</p><p><br />  Ireland has a uniquely extensive road network.  There are approximately 98,000 kilometres of road in the network which represents two and a half times the EU average in terms of kilometres per head of population.  The maintenance and improvement of this extensive network of roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.</p><p><br />  The devolution of control of regional and local roads is very important.  With the vast network of roads serving very disparate needs from small farmers to large multinationals, a one size fits all based regional and local roads maintenance regime would not be appropriate in my view.  I believe that the decisions should be made locally by local public representatives.</p><p><br />  Given the current financial position, the main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years.  There have been very large reductions in roads expenditure during the past number of years and there will be further reductions in the future.  In 2007 the grants from my Department stood at &#8364;363 million and that fell to &#8364;232 million this year.</p><p><br />  It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement councils like Cork County Council in their spending.  The contribution made by Cork County Council, which is the road authority for the area, has fallen in recent years in both real and percentage terms.  In 2007, Cork County Council provided &#8364;30 million in own resources for expenditure on regional and local roads, representing 34% of the total amount spent on roads in the county in 2007.  This own resources expenditure has dropped to &#8364;9.4 million or 18% of the total expenditure with the State providing &#8364;43.7 million in 2012.  This contribution of 18% does not compare favourably with other large counties.  Kerry, for example, provides 30% and Meath provides 34%.</p><p><br />  I appreciate that many local authorities are in a position where they are trying to implement savings.  However, I think that for some local authorities to complain about reductions in Government grants or to seek additional funding is missing the point when they, at the same time, have reduced their own contributions by a greater proportion.  I appreciate that the Deputy has not called for additional funding in this regard.</p><p><br />  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that is required.  My Department and local authorities are working closely together to develop new, more efficient ways of delivering the best outputs with the funding available to them.  Given the likely squeeze on Exchequer funding, this concentration on efficiency is essential to ensure that we achieve the best outturns for the limited money available.</p><p><br />  I wish to mention two further points.  Among the things being done is &quot;map road&quot;, which is an IT based system, where all the roads and all the road works that are done all over the country are essentially mapped online and that will allow us to use this system much more efficiently in the years ahead.</p></speech>

We would be delighted with any additional funding that would be made available to Cork County Council.  On a serious note, we are borrowing billions as a nation every day to provide a whole array of public services.  This is about menu options and about our priorities.  If the Minister were to ask the people in west Cork what is a priority for them, they would say that roads are top priority for them.  I am not coming in here every day looking for something else: that is how the people there genuinely feel.  They are entitled to have good roads.  The county has been neglected for decades in the national spend on roads.  The Minister's Department has an increasing responsibility to ensure the money that is allocated is being spent wisely.  Information I received recently showed that up to 65% of the money being allocated by the Minister's Department is being spent on payroll when private contractors could carry out a similar type works for up to 18% to 20% less.  We have a responsibility to examine how the money is being spent.  It is time the Department took a more hands on approach with the councils to see what is happening on the ground.  The allocation of the money is one thing but that in itself is not enough.</p><p>  Will the Minister confirm if he would be willing to consider supporting a pilot programme I mentioned being carried out in the county of Cork?  It would allow for engagement with his Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Burton.  I have spoken to them and to their officials to try to progress a scheme that would allow unemployed people to assist on road maintenance works under the auspices of Cork County Council.  I will meet the director of services in the council on Friday.  I will also meet those in the farm relief services as they will have an input in organising the voluntary contribution of people in this respect.  I ask the Minister to confirm if his Department would be willing to support a pilot project being carried out by Cork County Council that could be then replicated throughout the country.</p></speech>

I would be very supportive of a scheme that would allow people who are currently unemployed to be taken on by local authorities to do outdoor work.  I know the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government have done some work on that already and certainly my Department stands ready and willing to assist in that.  If the pilot programme is in Cork, I would be happy for that to be the case but the lead has to come from Minister, Deputy Hogan, who is responsible for local authorities, and the Minister, Deputy Burton, who is responsible for social protection.  Certainly, my Department is willing and ready to assist in any scheme like that.  It is a good idea but there are issues that would have to be addressed around employment rights and so on and they need to be taken into account.</p><p>  The reality of the situation is that we probably now spend only about 60% of what is required to maintain the roads to the standard that we should maintain them.  Taking the money spent by councils and by central Government together, it is only about 60% of what is required.  What we have done, as a Government and as a society, is decided that we will prioritise pensions, public sector pay and benefits over infrastructure and that is starting to show.  It is showing in our roads, our schools, the lack of primary care centres and the lack of child care facilities but it was not always that way.  If we look back to the 1990s about 3% of the entire Government budget went on transport.  During the boom period when we were building all the motorways, the percentage increased to about 5% but it has now decreased to around 2%.  As a proportion of the national budget, we have never spent less on transport and it is starting to show.  It is showing across our infrastructure in general because we as a society have decided that we will have pay, pension and welfare rates that are much higher than countries of a similar wealth.  That is starting to show in our roads, schools and infrastructure.  It is an area about which we as a society need to have a debate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1032" speakername="Joan Collins" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900033#FF00100"><p>I wished to raise this matter because it is becoming a more prevalent issue in my day-to-day work in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, where much of the housing stock is of a certain age.  It may also be related to climate change and changes in our weather patterns.  In St. Teresa's Gardens and other large local authority flat complexes there are also issues of mould, dampness and condensation.</p><p>  It has come to my attention that when a council house becomes &quot;void&quot;, or vacant, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding to bring that house up to an acceptable building energy rating, BER, standard.  However, sitting tenants cannot access any of that money.  Tenants are also advised that the carrying out of repairs due to condensation is their responsibility, but that is not what I am talking about here.  My concern is about the insulation of homes and the anomaly I have discovered is like a form of apartheid, whereby a council tenant cannot apply for a grant but a private home owner with a mortgage can.  Furthermore, the local authority cannot apply for a grant on behalf of a sitting tenant.</p><p>  A climate change Bill is being prepared at present and there have been discussions on a national policy to reduce fuel emissions and the use of fossil fuels and so forth.  At the same time, in one of the largest housing stocks in the country, namely, local authority housing, tenants cannot access insulation.  Many tenants are not in a position to get loans from their credit unions to carry out such work because money is so scarce.  This is an issue that could be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming climate change Bill.  We could allow the local authorities to apply for grants for insulating homes or, ideally, there should be a national programme of public works for all council housing, public buildings, schools and so forth.  The DEIS school in Bluebell, for example, is crying out for insulation because of the amount of heat being lost from the building.</p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to give her opinion as to whether an insulation programme could feed into the climate change legislation.  Is there a basis for changing the current legislation to allow either council tenants or local authorities to access grants for insulation?  Are there any plans in the pipeline in the Department to upgrade local authority houses with sitting tenants?</p><p>  On a separate matter, Deputy Jim Daly raised the issue of unemployed people doing outdoor local authority work.  If Deputy Daly is sitting twiddling his thumbs any day, perhaps he should make himself available because he is already getting well paid.  If there is work to be done, it should be paid for.</p></speech>

Given the constraints on capital budgets across all areas of the public service, my Department is now placing greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement programmes to improve living conditions and comfort levels for tenants.  The enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department.</p><p>  As Deputy Collins has said, the grants under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland scheme are for private houses only and fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  In the past, funding for housing maintenance programmes was provided from the local authority's own internal capital receipts.  However, with the decline in internal capital receipts, funding has been provided from my Department for the retrofitting and improvement of the housing stock, particularly with regard to energy efficiency measures.  Under my Department's social housing investment programme, local authorities are allocated funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.  The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building.  Again, as Deputy Collins has pointed out, over the past two years, the retrofitting measure focused on improvement works to vacant houses, known as &quot;voids&quot;, with the objective of returning as many as possible of these dwellings to productive use and combating dereliction and associated anti-social behaviour.  Over that period some &euro;52.5 million was recouped to local authorities in respect of improvements carried out to 4,774 dwellings.  Deputy Collins is correct that these were &quot;voids&quot; and were not occupied houses.</p><p>  I am currently reviewing the terms of the energy retrofitting measure for 2013 to target grants at those older houses and apartments which lack adequate insulation and draught proofing.  Local authorities should pay particular attention to dwellings which accommodate older people and people with disabilities.  My Department will issue revised guidelines to local authorities in the context of the capital allocations under the housing programme for 2013.  Work is under way in this regard and my Department requested local authorities to submit details of their capital requirements under the various measures within the housing programme.  This information is being assessed at present and I intend to advise individual authorities of their capital allocations as soon as possible.</p><p>  The retrofitting programme offers a very practical and cost-effective way for local authorities to improve the standard of their housing stock.  The programme brings immediate as well as long-term benefits for the community as a whole in terms of sustaining and creating jobs and delivering a greener Ireland for the future.  The programme also reduces peoples' energy bills, which is a very important consideration.</p><p>  It is clear to me that we need better information to give sharper focus to the overall national improvement works programme and to better target resources at areas which will give the best return on the investment made.  My Department, in conjunction with the local authorities, has now commenced an audit of the 130,000 social housing units.  Over time, this will build up a comprehensive profile of the stock and enable the compilation of planned housing maintenance programmes locally and the development of targeted strategies to address deficiencies in terms of thermal efficiency and so forth.  Next year, I intend to use the results of the audit to inform the capital allocations to local authorities.</p><p>  In the last two years the emphasis was on vacant houses with the objective of getting them back into use.  I have specifically asked that now we focus on occupied houses.  In many cases tenants have been in place for a long time and have maintained their homes as best they can but they have serious problems with dampness and so forth.  Once again, I thank Deputy Collins for raising this issue.</p></speech>

This is an area that needs to be addressed urgently.  I know of a young woman with two children who moved into her house in Drimnagh in 2010, just after the BER rating system was introduced.  Almost every week she has to wash down the walls on the ground floor of her house to remove mould.  Her young children had to move out of the house over the Christmas period because it was in such a bad state.  The response from the council has been to advise her to open windows, open vents and not to dry clothes indoors.  She is doing all of that but the same thing keeps happening.  She is caught in a bind because she cannot get a grant to insulate her home to prevent the dampness.  She is getting no assistance from the council in this regard and has reached a point where she does not even consider it a home anymore.  I know of another family who have been living in Pim Street in Pimlico for four years who have the same problem with mould.  They are constantly wiping down the walls, using chemicals to remove the mould but it keeps returning.  It is going onto their bedclothes, mattresses and is becoming a nightmare for them.</p><p>  There is no recognition on the part of the local authorities that there is a problem.  I contacted the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to see if there is a list of complaints made about mould but was told there was no list.  There must be a list because complaints are being made every day of the week.  The person in Pim Street to whom I referred has been making complaints for the last two years.  There is something wrong somewhere.</p><p>  A root and branch analysis is required to identify where the problems are and then they should be addressed.  Next year is too long to wait for some people.  Is there some way, in the short term, that tenants can access grants?</p></speech>

We have asked the local authorities to do that.  This year I hope to be able to divert to occupied houses some of the money that would have been used for "voids".  I also hope to develop programmes with the information we are gathering from the local authorities.  It could be very cost-effective if, for example, there were a number of houses in a particular area and a single contract could cover the work on them.  That could save a lot of money.  The point about households saving money on fuel costs is also very important.  A lot of the older local authority houses have very low BER ratings and are very energy inefficient.  If we can improve them significantly, that will save money for householders as well.  Like Deputy Collins, I have been shown many photographs of houses with serious mould which is very difficult to live with.  People paint their houses but must do so again within a very short period of time.  It is a genuine issue that we will address as best we can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900034#HH00200"><p>I begin by thanking Dr. Martin McAleese and his team for their excellent work on this report.  I thank, equally, the women who met with them to assist in its compilation.  I also thank the religious orders who co-operated fully with Dr. McAleese.  Together, they have helped provide Ireland with a document of truth.</p><p><br />  The Magdalen laundries have cast a long shadow over Irish life and over our sense of who we are.  It is just two weeks since we received this report, the first ever detailed report into the State&#8217;s involvement in the Magdalen laundries.  It shines a bright and necessary light on a dark chapter of Ireland&#8217;s history. </p><p><br />  On coming to office the Government was determined to investigate the facts of the State&#8217;s involvement.  The Government was adamant that these ageing and elderly women would get the compassion and the recognition for which they have fought for so long, deserved so deeply and had, until now, been so abjectly denied.  For 90 years Ireland subjected these women and their experience to a profound and studied indifference.  I was determined because of this that the Government, and this D&aacute;il, would take the necessary time not just to commission the report but to study it and, having done so, to reflect on its findings.  I believe that was the best way to formulate a plan and strategy that would help us make amends for the State&#8217;s role in the hurt of these extraordinary women.    </p><p><br />  I am glad that so many of the women themselves agreed with that approach, and I am glad this time of reflection gave me the chance to do the most important thing of all, which was too meet personally with the Magdalen women and to sit down with them face to face to listen to their stories.  It was a humbling and inspiring experience.</p><p><br />  Today, as their Taoiseach, I am privileged to welcome some of these women to this House, many of whom have travelled long distances to be here.  I welcome every one of them to their national Parliament, to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  What we discuss today is their<b></b>story.  What we address today is how they took this country&#8217;s terrible secret and made it their own, burying it and carrying it in their hearts here at home or with them to England, Canada, America and Australia on behalf of Ireland and the Irish people.  From this moment on they need carry it no more, because today we take it back.  Today, we acknowledge the role of the State in their ordeal. </p><p><br />  We now know that the State itself was directly involved in over a quarter of all admissions to the Magdalen laundries, be it through the social services, reformatories, psychiatric institutions, county homes, the prison and probation service and industrial schools.  We have, in fact, decided to include all the Magdalen women in our response, regardless of how they were admitted.  </p><p><br />  Dr. McAleese set out to investigate five areas in particular: the routes by which the women entered the laundries; regulations of the workplace and State inspections; State funding of and financial assistance to the laundries; the routes by which the girls and women left the laundries; and death registrations, burials and exhumations.  In all five areas there was found to be direct State involvement. </p><p><br />  As I read this report and as I listened to these women, it struck me that for generations Ireland had created a particular portrait of itself as a good living and God fearing nation.  Through this and other reports we know this flattering self-portrait is fictitious. </p><p><br />  It would be easy to explain away all that happened and all we did with those great moral and social salves of &quot;the culture back then&quot;, &quot;the order of the day&quot; and &quot;the terrible times that were in it&quot;.  By any standards it was a cruel, pitiless Ireland distinctly lacking in a quality of mercy.  That much is clear, both from the pages of the report, and from the stories of the women I met.  As I sat with these women as they told their stories it was clear that while every woman&#8217;s story was different each of them shared a particular experience of a particular Ireland that was judgmental, intolerant, petty and prim. </p><p><br />  In the laundries themselves some women spent week, others months, more of them years, but the thread that ran through their many stories was a palpable sense of suffocation, not just physical in that they were incarcerated but psychological, spiritual and social.  Their stories were enriched by an astonishing vividness of recall of situation and circumstance.</p><p><br />  Here are some of the things I read in the report and they said directly to me:<blockquote>The work was so hard, the regime was cruel.  I felt all alone, nobody wanted me.  They sent me because they thought I was going to a good school.  I seen these older people beside me, I used cry myself to sleep.  I was bold, I wasn&#8217;t going to school.  I was locked up ... I thought I would never get out.  We had to sew at night ... even when we were sick.  I heard a radio sometimes in the distance.  We were not allowed to talk to each other.  Your letters were checked.  I was so short I needed a stool to put washing in.  The noise was desperate.  I thought I would go mad from the silence.  The heat was unbelievable.  I broke a cup once and had to wear it hanging around my neck for three days.  I felt always tired, always wet, always humiliated.  My father came for me after three months but I was too ashamed to go home.  I never saw my Mam again; she died while I was in there.</blockquote></p><p> The Magdalen women might have been told that they were washing away a wrong or a sin, but we know now and to our shame they were only ever scrubbing away our nation&rsquo;s shadow.  Today, just as the State accepts its direct involvement in the Magdalen laundries, society, too, has its responsibility.  I believe I speak for millions of Irish people all over the world when I say we put away these women because for too many years we put away our conscience.  We swapped our personal scruples for a solid public apparatus that kept us in tune and in step with a sense of what was "proper behaviour" or the "appropriate view" according to a sort of moral code that was fostered at the time, particularly in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  We lived with the damaging idea that what was desirable and acceptable in the eyes of the church and the State was the same and interchangeable.</p><p> Is it this mindset then, this moral subservience, that gave us the social mores, the required and exclusive &quot;values&quot; of the time that welcomed the compliant, obedient and lucky &quot;us&quot; and banished the more problematic, spirited or unlucky &quot;them&quot;?  To our nation&rsquo;s shame it must be said that if these women had managed to scale the high walls of the laundries, they would have had their work cut out for them to negotiate the height and the depth of the barricades around society&rsquo;s &quot;proper&quot; heart.  For we saw difference as something to be feared and hidden rather than embraced and celebrated.  Were these our values?  We can ask ourselves for a State, least of all for a republic, what is the &quot;value&quot; of the tacit and unchallenged decree that saw society humiliate and degrade these girls and women?  What is the &quot;value&quot; of the ignorance and arrogance that saw us publicly call them &quot;penitents&quot; for their &quot;crime&quot; of being poor or abused or just plain unlucky enough to be already the inmate of a reformatory, or an industrial school or a psychiatric institution?  We can ask ourselves as the families we were then what was worthy, what was good about that great euphemism of &quot;putting away&quot; our daughters, our sisters, our aunties?</p><p> Those &quot;values&quot;, those failures, those wrongs characterised Magdalen Ireland.  Today we live in a very different Ireland with a very a different consciousness and awareness.  We live in an Ireland where we have more compassion, empathy, insight and heart.  We do, because at last we are learning those terrible lessons.  We do, because at last we are giving up our secrets.  We do, because in naming and addressing the wrong, as is happening here today, we are trying to make sure we quarantine such abject behaviour in our past and eradicate it from Ireland&rsquo;s present and Ireland&rsquo;s future.</p><p> In a society guided by the principles of compassion and social justice there never would have been any need for institutions such as the Magdalen laundries.  The report shows that the perception that the Magdalen laundries were reserved for those who were offensively and judgmentally called &quot;fallen women&quot; is not based upon fact at all but upon prejudice.  The women are and always were wholly blameless.  Therefore, I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the Government and our citizens, deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them and for any stigma they suffered as a result of the time they spent in a Magdalen laundry.  I hope that the publication of the McAleese report and this apology makes some contribution to the healing process.</p><p> In reflecting on this report, I have come to the view that these women deserve more than this formal apology, important though it is.  I also want to put in place a process by which we can determine how best to help and support the women in their remaining years.  One of the many things I have learned during my recent meetings with the Magdalen women is that their circumstances and current needs vary greatly from person to person.  That is why the Government has today asked the President of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. Justice John Quirke, to undertake a three month review and to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the Government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs.  The terms of reference for Mr. Justice Quirke will be published later today and I will also arrange for the representatives of the women to be fully briefed on this process.  When Mr. Justice Quirke has reported, the Government will establish a fund to assist the women, based on his recommendations.  I am confident that this process will enable us to provide speedy, fair and meaningful help to the women in a compassionate and non-adversarial way.  I am determined that the fund will be primarily used to help the women, as is their stated and strong desire, and not for legal or administrative costs.</p><p> The McAleese report also refers to women who recounted similar experiences in other residential laundries, such as the laundry offering services to the public that operated in the training centre at Stanhope Street, Dublin.  The Government has decided that these women should be included in both the apology I have extended today and in the fund.</p><p> I am also conscious that many of the women I met last week want to see a permanent memorial established to remind us all of this dark part of our history.  I agree this should be done and intend to engage directly with the representative groups and as many of the women as possible to agree on the creation of an appropriate memorial to be financed by the Government separately from the funds that are being set aside for the direct assistance for the women.</p><p> Let me conclude by again speaking directly to the women whose experiences in Magdalen laundries have negatively affected their subsequent lives.  As a society, for many years we failed you.  We forgot you or, if we thought of you at all, we did so in untrue and offensive stereotypes.  This is a national shame for which I again say, I am deeply sorry and offer my full and heartfelt apologies.</p><p> At the conclusion of my discussions with one group of the Magdalen women one of those present sang &quot;Whispering Hope&quot;.  A line from that song stays in my mind: &ldquo;When the dark midnight is over, Watch for the breaking of day&rdquo;.  Let me hope that this day and this debate heralds a new dawn for all those who feared that the dark midnight might never end.</p></speech>

I say to all of those women, some of whom are with us today:  We have heard you, we believe you and we are profoundly sorry for what was done to you, and that what happened to you, as children or as adults, should not have happened.  It was Ireland that was wrong, not you.  As a Government, we are determined to work with you in the weeks ahead to give a concrete expression to our apology and to provide a tangible expression of our regret and acknowledgement of the wrong that was done.  We want to work with you, and we ask you to work with us.</p><p>  Today is not the end for the Magdalen survivors.  No apology, no matter now sincere, can ever erase what happened.  We cannot turn back the clock and undo what was done to so many.  What we can do is acknowledge the wrong, apologise and work to translate that apology into a better future for those who remain.</p><p>  There are moments in the history of our nation when we come face to face with our past, when a door, long kept shut by fear, neglect or design, is forced open and a light shines on the country we think we have left behind.  Today is such a moment.  The Magdalen laundries are the product of a different Ireland, an Ireland so different that many today find it hard to understand what this country once was, as a State and as a society.</p><p>  I join the Taoiseach in thanking former Senator McAleese for the work that he has done and thank the team that worked with him.  The McAleese report shows how the history of the Magdalen laundries lumbered in step with the history of independent Ireland.  What was remarkable was not how much changed when Ireland became independent, but how little - how the newly independent State lauded the notion of republicanism but was, in reality, a profoundly conservative, theocratic and unaccountable place where state bowed to church and where the rights of citizens could be trampled if they did not fit in with the official line.  It was a society where appearance was everything and nothing and no-one could be allowed to challenge the conservative consensus, a society where incarceration in an institution was so normal as to be banal - recorded in the green books of factory inspectors, unremarked by doctors on their rounds - an informal safety-valve in a state which, despite, by 1961, having the highest levels of institutionalisation in the world, still struggled to contain the symptoms of its failure.  It was an Ireland where a citizen could be committed to an institution for being poor, for being an orphan, for being a bit different, for being pregnant and for being a woman, and an Ireland where the State, the dominant church and society colluded in making it so.</p><p>  It is clear from former Senator McAleese's report just how fluid was that culture of collusion - a probation officer could as easily be a volunteer from an organisation concerned with public morality as an agent of the justice system, the person who committed a woman to a laundry could as easily be a parent as a priest and teenagers could graduate from a reform school to a Magdalen asylum spending their entire childhood and early adulthood in the grey area between the civil and the church authorities.  Nowhere in any of this did the word or concept of citizenship, personal rights and personal freedoms appear, and all the while the high, windowless walls of the laundries stood alongside busy main streets, part of the local economy.</p><p>  What happened to the thousands of women who walked through those doors, down the decades, happened in plain sight, but there is nothing so blind as the blindness imposed by a dominant ideology and a subservient State, a blindness that can subvert what our human intuition knows to be right and wrong, that saw tens of thousands of small children locked up in industrial schools, that often punished the abused rather than the perpetrator, that would banish a young woman from her community for the so-called crime of getting pregnant, that did not question a long absence by a sister, niece or aunt and that did not trouble itself about an industry built on unpaid, involuntary labour.</p><p>  The most reliable litmus test of freedom, and of the separation of church and state, is how that state treats its female citizens.  By this standard, Ireland was, until recent decades, a virtual theocracy.  It was a country where women were cast out for having sex outside of marriage, where they were denied contraception, denied work if they were married and, as we have seen, committed to an institution, sometimes for little more than being an inconvenience.</p><p>  This was an Ireland where justice and morality were conflated so that there was much in the way of morality but little in the way of justice, and justice was not done for these women.  Their moment has been a long time coming, and it began with rolling back the dominance of one church and one morality in Irish society.</p><p>  The battle to liberalise Irish laws, to separate out in practice church and State was, at its heart, about freedom.  It was about the individual and about personal dignity.  It was about the kind of society we wanted for ourselves and for our children, not a society that forced women into giving up their babies, not a society where poverty split families apart or required unhappy ones to stay together, not a society that survived on secrecy.</p><p>  We look back on the Ireland former Senator McAleese describes and it is like a foreign country, but the Ireland of today was forged in the face of profound opposition at every step.  I am proud of the role my party, its members and its elected representatives played in that transformation.  It was not an easy task, nor was it always a popular one but the Ireland of the Magdalen laundries is now a historical curiosity for a new generation of our citizens because of that campaigning vision.</p><p>  I am proud, too, of the refusal to forget the victims of that repressive Ireland, of the members of my party who would not go quietly as long as this historic wrong was ignored.  I pay particular tribute to my colleague, the Minster of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for her long-standing solidarity with and commitment to justice for the women of the Magdalen laundries.  It is no coincidence that the Government which established an investigation into State involvement in the Magdalen laundries and the Government which will offer some recompense to the women of the Magdalen laundries, is one of which Deputy Lynch is a member.</p><p>  That path to justice has been a long and hard one.  In the words of Councillor Sally Mulready of the Irish Women Survivors Network, the women of the Magdalen laundries endured &quot;years and years of misery and rejection&quot;, and &quot;as a consequence remained out in the wilderness for years trying to find a path to justice&quot;.</p><p>  As a State and as a people, we can never make sufficient restoration to the women of the Magdalen laundries for what they have experienced.  We can never give them back their past, their youth, their opportunities or, for some, the children they gave up.</p><p>However, we can tell them that we believe them.  We acknowledge that what happened to them was wrong, that the stigma they have been branded with was false and that we are sorry.</p><p> The picture that emerged from former Senator McAleese's report was complex.  It reflects an Ireland where the lines between personal morality and civil authority were blurred, sometimes beyond distinction.  To draw a straight line, and to distinguish between those women who were committed to the Magdalen laundries by the State and those who entered by other routes is to ignore how the very fabric of Irish public, civic and private life supported those institutions.  What is more it is to ignore the role of the four religious orders which managed the laundries, and which controlled the entry and exit of women into and from these institutions.</p><p> As a people, we cannot undo the past, but we can and will make a contribution to a more comfortable, secure future for the women of the Magdalen laundries.  There is also a role for the religious orders, which ran the laundries, to make a fair contribution along with the taxpayer.  These laundries were private businesses run by those orders, which benefited from the unpaid labour of the women committed to them.</p><p> The past does not belong to the State alone.  As a people, we have become better at looking back and at acknowledging the wrongs that were done, particularly to those who most deserved our care and protection.  However, it is one thing to learn the bitter lessons of history; it is another to apply those lessons to Irish society today.  What are those lessons?  How it upholds human rights, and not any one version of morality, is a core barometer by which we should judge our State, its services and our society.  The principles of human rights, personal freedom and personal dignity should not only underpin the State's relationship with its citizens, but also the relationship between citizens and powerful institutions, such as banks, the media and large corporations - indeed, all our relationships with each other.  They are the lessons which can only benefit us all - the lessons of a fairer, more compassionate Ireland.</p><p> Today is about the women of the Magdalen laundries.  It is about standing by those women, whose futures were stolen from them.  It is about doing the right thing by them.  It is about remembering how they suffered.  It is about eradicating once and for all the stigma that blighted their reputations.  It is about recognising their needs.  Most of all, it is about recommitting ourselves to the values that will ensure that what happened to them can never happen again.  Never again, as a people, as a society, will we walk past a high wall and fail to ask what lies behind it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900037#LL00200"><p>Over many decades thousands of women spent time in Magdalen laundries because the State put them there.  Thousands more went to the laundries because they had no alternative.  They worked and lived in harsh conditions, often deprived of the most basic freedoms.  This should not have been allowed.  The State failed in its duties towards its citizens and it is right and proper that on behalf of the State and on behalf of society, the Taoiseach has offered a sincere, heartfelt and comprehensive public apology.  I commend the Taoiseach's speech and warmly welcome his heartfelt apology.  I also warmly welcome and salute the efforts he has made in the past week to engage with and speak to the survivors of these institutions.</p><p>  The most important part of making such an apology is to understand that it is not the end of dealing with the issue - in many ways, as has been said, it is only the beginning.  The State has now acknowledged its role.  It has yet to provide a forum where the comprehensive testimonies of survivors can be gathered and their experiences fully understood.  It is only now beginning a process of redress.</p><p>  As I said two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il and as my colleagues said last week, we fully acknowledge the failures of all who participated in public life and did not act to intervene.  Earlier consideration should have been given to this issue and there is no doubt that the women of the Magdalen laundries deserved earlier intervention.  I accept that steps should have been taken earlier to make this apology.  I am sorry that did not happen over the past decade while I was a member of Government - I say that in a heartfelt and genuine way.  In terms of the process that has been outlined by the Taoiseach - there will an opportunity to give a more detailed response to that - the specific proposals need to be discussed with the survivors, as has been said.  People need to engage with them so that their wishes are respected and their needs addressed.</p><p>  The apology for the State's gross failures relating to abuse in industrial and reform schools was accompanied by a comprehensive list of measures which had been drawn up after discussions with survivors.  They were also amended after further discussions and the process of engagement was permanently maintained.  This must also be the case for the survivors of the Magdalen laundries.</p><p>  Tribute must also be paid to the UN Committee Against Torture which gave very significant momentum to this issue in its investigations of the cases.  Dr. Martin McAleese and his interdepartmental committee have produced a good report.  I thank him and his team for their work.  However, it is not a comprehensive report - it was given necessarily narrow terms of reference.  It needs to be more expansive to provide an opportunity to give a voice to the experiences of the women who survived the laundries.  It was clearly mandated to answer the basic question of what was the State's involvement in these laundries.  The answer is that the laundries were integrated within the State's judicial and social policies.  They were not the same as industrial and reform schools, which were funded and operated fully under the legal powers of the State, but thousands of the State's citizens spent time in them because it was the policy of the State and society that they should.</p><p>  The report has shown a more complex picture of the working of these laundries than many people had previously appreciated.  It has been shown that just below 27% of those who lived and worked in the laundries were referred directly by the State in one form or another.  However, it would be deeply wrong to say that we can therefore ignore the other 73% of the women.  What the report refers to as the &quot;secrecy, silence and shame&quot; which characterised these laundries was not limited to the women who were there because of a direct action of the State.  This was a broader societal issue within which the State colluded.</p><p>  As the report points out, Magdalen asylums first appeared in the mid-18th century.  They were not uniquely Irish or Catholic institutions - in fact other religions which put an earlier emphasis on what was viewed as moral probity took the lead.  The very use of Magdalen was intended to convey the idea of working to reform supposedly &quot;fallen&quot; women.  They were found in Europe, America and Australia.  Institutions on the basic model of these laundries were in place here by the middle of the 19th century.  Through a range of different routes, women found themselves in these laundries where they were marked as unsuitable for wider society.  That was an era of a state which showed no interest in even the basic welfare and rights of citizens.  However, this system was allowed to survive well into the second half of the 20th century.  While much progress was seen in promoting the welfare and rights of the wider society, these women were excluded.  They continued to live and work in conditions which were morally unacceptable and should have been stopped.</p><p>  The report references a number of detailed academic studies on the laundries in the 19th century.  When these are set against the report's figures for the post-1922 period, it is impossible not to be struck by the fact that the figures are almost the same for how women came to be in the laundries.</p><p>It has been said that these laundries formed part of &ldquo;inherited networks of social control&rdquo; at the foundation of the State.  That is clearly true.  Where the new State failed was in not only leaving many of these institutions in place but strengthening them.  It is hard not to be shocked by the contents of the 1928 Report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor, the recommendations of which are based not on the idea that the State could not afford a new policy but on a twisted morality which sought to keep alive what can only be described as savage ideas.  It proposed that women spend one year in a Magdalen laundry or similar institution for every pregnancy out of wedlock and referred to the need to segregate those who have become sources of evil, danger and expense to the community.  The laundries were not therefore just a place for so-called "fallen&rsquo;"women or those who got into some form of trouble with the law rather they were at times the place for women for whom the State had no place or concern.  The role played by poverty and class is unmistakable.</p><p> The manner in which these laundries were established, named, written about, built and operated and the role which wider society viewed them as playing combined to mark the women within their walls as separate.  Survivors have talked about how they felt shame.  They should never have felt this way.  The shame was on a State and a society which excluded them.</p><p> This is a good report.  However, I would suggest that one of the weaknesses of it is that it has been prepared within narrow terms of reference.  While as a result of it the role of the State has been clarified and articulated, we need to do more to give a stronger and more expansive voice to the Magdalen survivors.  The presentation of legal and statistical information without the testimonies of the survivors is clearly inadequate.  For example, many survivors have spoken of abuse within these institutions.  Some feel their stories have not been fully captured.</p><p> Over the last decade, survivor groups and others have done an immense amount of work to gather testimonies.  Many of these have been made publicly available.  They are detailed, emotional and convincing.  They deserve to be much more widely read, and equally deserve to be collected and published by the State as part of a more comprehensive report on the laundries.  It is right that programmes of individual support be offered to the survivors.  As the Taoiseach said, there are different needs and circumstances, all of which require different responses.  The Health Service Executive should be directed to establish a dedicated counselling service.  We are all agreed that simply acknowledging this issue is not adequate.  </p><p> It is important to note the statement in this report that no cases of abuse were identified.  It could be argued that this was inevitable because of the lack of power or resources to seek out a comprehensive picture in this regard.  In contrast, the Ryan commission, which had such powers and resources and was able to engage with survivors on a confidential and respectful basis, states that there were cases of abuse in the laundries and that women placed therein from other institutions had experienced tough conditions including, &quot;continuous hard physical work&quot;.  I believe the State should commission and sponsor significant further work to ensure that every survivor is offered the opportunity to give her testimony and that this should be studied and made publicly available.  As has been said, the State should in addition engage with survivors on the issue of a permanent memorial.</p><p> There is no doubt that compensation is owed, including unpaid wages.  There is also a need for an acknowledgement of the unacceptable conditions to which the State and society confined women over a lengthy period.  However this is to be done, it must not I agree be adversarial.  In addition to the process outlined by the Taoiseach, the Government should in my opinion establish a special unit in the Department of Justice and Equality which would have responsibility for co-ordinating the State&rsquo;s response to the women in the areas of social protection, health and education.  This would be a significant action that would give the women practical assistance in the short term.</p><p> During compilation of the McAleese report the four religious orders who ran the laundries co-operated fully in relation to records.  Some gave stronger apologies than others.  These orders should be asked to give unequivocal apologies for their part in the treatment of these women and, if possible, should contribute to the redress of the women.  It is only fair that this happens.</p><p> It is important that as a society we learn from the mistakes of the past.  I welcome the apology that the Taoiseach has given to the women on behalf of the State and its citizens.  This is only the first step.  There should a consensus that more needs to be done to ensure that the women receive adequate redress and steps should be taken to acknowledge the women who did not get an opportunity to take part in the McAleese report.  I welcome the inclusion in the process, which will shortly commence, into the Stan Hope Street and Summerhill laundries.  The women incarcerated in these laundries want their testimonies heard.  I welcome that they are to be facilitated.</p><p> I look forward to working with Government and examining its response to this issue in the coming weeks and months.  I sincerely hope that the groups representing the women and highlighting this issue for many years are satisfied.  They should be commended for their work.  As stated by the T&aacute;naiste, over the last decade we have unearthed a great deal about Irish society, many of our institutions and many strands of Irish life since the foundation of the State.  Much of what we have learned about how Irish society organised itself is not a pretty picture, in particular the dominance of institutionalism in caring for people who were poor and their failure to provide these people with a decent quality of life and, more important, with basic social and human rights which were their entitlement.</p></speech>

I particularly commend the women and the groups and individuals who advocated on their behalf and shone the light so that the rest of us could see.  T&aacute;im&iacute;d f&iacute;or-bhu&iacute;och d&iacute;obh.  T&aacute;imid uilig go han-bhr&oacute;nach faoi na ruda&iacute; a dhearna an St&aacute;t ar na mn&aacute; cr&oacute;ga, iontacha seo.  I also acknowledge and thank the Taoiseach for his fulsome and comprehensive apology to the Magdalen women on behalf of the State and commend his remarks.</p><p>   The 1916 Proclamation, which has yet to become a reality, addresses itself to Irish men and women giving recognition to that reality.  It is a mission statement of Irish republicanism at the start of the 20th century which remains as vital and relevant today as it was then.  It is a charter of rights for citizens, which guarantees religious and civil liberties, equal rights and equal opportunities for all.  It is a charter of rights for equality, solidarity and freedom for all the people of this island.  This is not what emerged in our partitioned island post-1916.  </p><p>  The women of the Magdalen laundries had no rights.  They were objects of a conservative dispensation governed by conservative elites in the Church and political establishment.  In the manner of their incarceration and treatment in the Magdalen laundries, these women were slaves of a brutal and inhuman regime to which Irish Governments turned a blind eye.  Successive Governments endorsed and used these institutions. </p><p>Anti-Slavery International's definition of slavery is where &quot;People are sold like objects, forced to work for little or no pay and are at the mercy of their 'employers'.&quot;  There are common characteristics which distinguish slavery from other human rights violations.  These include when a person is forced to work, dehumanised, treated as a commodity, physically constrained or has restrictions placed on his or her freedom of movement.</p><p><br /> Last September I listened to President Obama state, &quot;When a woman is locked in a sweatshop or trapped in a home as a domestic servant, alone and abused and incapable of leaving, that&#8217;s slavery.&quot;  These are descriptions with which I am sure the Magdalen women - the survivors - listening to this debate will immediately identify.  It was an essential part of their life experiences in the laundries.  In a recent article James M. Smith gave a graphic example.  He described how two sisters were put to work.  One of the two, aged 14, was placed in the Good Shepherd Convent in New Ross.  He recounts the horror of her existence:<blockquote>For the next five years she washed society&#8217;s dirty laundry and received no pay.  When she refused to work the nuns cut her hair as punishment.  The hair grew back but to this day the loss of her education angers her.  To her, it was a prison in all but name.  There was no inspector, no child welfare officer.  She was abandoned and no one cared.<br /><br /><br /> Sixty years later this woman lives with the stigma and shame attached to these institutions.  These are the indelible stains on her life.</blockquote> This was slavery and, as the Taoiseach stated, the State failed to challenge or end it or provide for its victims.  On the contrary, as we now know the State employed the system for decades.</p><p><br /> In July 1960, James Connolly's daughter, Nora Connolly O'Brien, addressed the Seanad on a criminal justice Bill.  That piece of Government legislation, according to Nora Connolly O'Brien's contribution to the debate, would permit young women on remand to be legally committed to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.  Nora warned that any girl held there would &quot;suffer for the rest of her life the stigma of having at one time been an inmate of that asylum&quot;.  The Bill provided that girls would have a choice of going to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum or prison, and Nora Connolly O'Brien's objection to the Magdalen system was so great she stated that if asked for her advice she would wholeheartedly tell girls to choose prison.</p><p><br /> Much of what went on in the laundries and the ill-treatment inflicted on women and young girls, some as young as nine, has also been described in previous reports.  The Ryan report detailed the women's forced unpaid labour in the laundries and stated their working conditions were harsh, that they were completely deprived of their liberty and suffered physical and emotional abuse.  Those who tried to escape and who were caught were returned to these institutions.</p><p><br /> As far back as November 2010 an assessment report on the Magdalen laundries for the Irish Human Rights Commission called on the Government to establish a statutory inquiry and provide redress for the survivors.  The following May, the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment commended that the Irish State should ensure survivors from the laundries obtain redress.  It also expressed its grave concern at the failure by the State to institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations into the allegations of ill-treatment of the women.  In June 2012 the Government, and it is to be commended for doing so, established the interdepartmental committee to clarify whether the State had any interaction with the laundries.  I welcome the publication of the McAleese report and thank Martin McAleese and his team for their work.  However, the Government's strictly limited terms of reference mean some of the Magdalen laundries and the stories of some of the women are not included in the report.  According to Amnesty International today, this also includes previously unknown laundries in the North.  Neither does the report cover the scandalous and equally harsh conditions in Bethany Home.  These significant gaps must be addressed if a comprehensive and effective resolution of the treatment of girls and women by the State in institutions is to be achieved.</p><p><br /> I welcome the meetings the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the T&aacute;naiste have had with some of the survivors.  I also have had the honour of meeting some of these women, and they are remarkable women who are living witnesses of a terrible injustice.  They have told the Taoiseach, as he has told us, of their personal experience and of the horrendous and brutal conditions endured by more than 10,000 women in Magdalen laundries.  Some of the survivors feel the 1,000 page report by former Senator McAleese does not accurately reflect the abuse and suffering all the women endured in these institutions.  The report states only a minority experienced physical abuse and none suffered sexual abuse.  Many will take issue with this statement.</p><p><br /> The Taoiseach's apology this evening for what occurred will be warmly welcomed.  What is now needed is a process of redress by the State which treats all of the Magdalen survivors on the basis of equality and provides for their future in a comprehensive fashion.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged clearly, the starting point must be that their incarceration was wrong, that they were treated as slaves, that their basic rights as citizens and human beings were trampled on and that the State must bear the burden of putting this right.  Time is of the essence.  Many of these women are elderly and unwell.  They have lived with the stigma of Magdalen laundries and the brutality they experienced during their incarceration for their entire lives.  The Government has responsibility to act quickly.  We cannot compound the women's trauma by failing to respond promptly and in a satisfactory way.  The D&aacute;il may have concerns about the redress scheme announced, and on which the Taoiseach has commissioned a report from Mr. Justice John Quirke.  We want to hear more of the details of this.</p><p><br /> The State has responsibility to care for citizens and protect them from abuse.  Our acknowledgement that the State failed all of the girls and women without any exception whatsoever requires we bring forward a non-adversarial redress scheme.  The women must be compensated for lost wages and pensions.  Any of their immediate health, housing and counselling needs must also be promptly catered for.  A package needs to be prepared for these women to compensate them for the effects of the abuse they suffered in the laundries, and this requires a transparent compensation package.  This will be the mark against which the Government's proposals will be judged.</p><p><br /> As Martin McAleese records in his report, the women endured unspeakable horror.  He states, &quot;None of us can begin to imagine the confusion and fear experienced by these young girls, in many cases little more than children, on entering the Laundries - not knowing why they were there, feeling abandoned, wondering whether they had done something wrong, and not knowing when - if ever - they would get out and see their families again.&quot;</p><p><br /> We are all agreed the Magdalen women have suffered for long enough.  They now need justice.  Despite their experiences, all of those whom I have met have remained feisty, strong, resilient and good-humoured, and some of them have campaigned relentlessly for justice over many years.  They are more than victims.  They are more than survivors.  They have become role models for the rest of us on the island, and others beyond, who seek justice, equality and freedom.  The Magdalen women are an inspiration, and the D&aacute;il and the people of the island owe them a debt of gratitude for their endeavours on behalf of each other and all those who are victims of abuse.</p></speech>

Three audience members were brought in at a time.  We were brought through the various stages by the people playing the parts of the ladies.  In character, one of them said, "Will you tell?".  I reacted and asked, "Who will I tell?"</p><p>I was only thinking about it afterwards and I thought, who would I have told if I was aware of what was going on?  The State, church, Garda and Judiciary were involved, as well as so many other departments in society and families also, so there was nobody to tell.</p><p><br /> I was struck by that because the Constitutional Convention is examining the Constitution.  When I spoke on behalf of the Independent Members at the opening of that convention, I said that the Constitution defines who we are and how we want to be identified.  A number of us expressed our disappointment that initially there was not more in the convention on economic, social and cultural rights.</p><p><br /> None the less there are positive aspects to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  If they had been invoked, this would never have happened to the ladies.  Article 40.1 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states that &quot;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&quot;  There was no equality, however, for the ladies of the Magdalen laundries, the children of the industrial schools, the ladies who suffered symphysiotomy procedures, thalidomide survivors and the post-polio group.  Despite this, Article 40.1 of the Constitution says that &quot;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&quot;</p><p><br /> The abuse of the Magdalen ladies' human rights, and the others I have mentioned, was in violation of our Constitution.  The abuse of human rights also contravened a number of international human rights laws, including the European Convention on Human Rights, which Ireland ratified in 1953.  It also violated other covenants on civil, political, economic and cultural rights.  It violated the Convention on Discrimination Against Women.  The 2011 review by the UN Committee Against Torture found the abuses reported by the ladies fell within the category of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The ongoing failure to provide reparation amounts to a continuing violation of the Convention Against Torture.</p><p><br /> It is absolutely heart-breaking to read and listen to the testimonies of the ladies and their families, including hard labour, very long hours, the psychological punishment of being kept in solitary confinement, being deprived of food, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and emotional damage.  In addition, there was the loss of the right to achieve one's full potential.  I remember speaking to ladies who told me of their ambitions that were not realised.  Article 42 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann refers to the right to education, but those ladies were all deprived of that right.</p><p><br /> The Magdalen report found evidence of State involvement.  Regardless of the report's criticisms concerning length of stay, physical punishment, non-inclusion or recognition of certain testimonies, the report is an indictment of what went on.  There was deprivation, abuse and, sadly, a loss identity for the ladies involved.  There is a sad account in today's edition of<i>The Telegraph </i>of a woman who found her birth mother after a number of years.  The birth mother had become pregnant on two occasions, yet when she found her birth mother, the lady had no recollection of that, such was the trauma of being in a laundry.</p><p><br /> There are disturbing stories of connections between the laundries and psychiatric institutions.  There are also disturbing stories of women who took their own lives.  There are untold stories of babies who were forcibly given up for adoption.</p><p><br /> For one reason or another, there are those who have not yet told their stories.  They might be encouraged to do so by what is happening.  They need the space to voice what has happened.  I want to support the Magdalen archival and oral history project.  I hope the State will support this and the names project which will eventually give dignity to those who have passed away.  Some of them lie in unmarked mass graves.  Most particularly, we must get rid of the terms &quot;penitent&quot; and &quot;sinner&quot;.</p><p><br /> We see that some European countries preserve concentration camps and prisons as museums.  In this regard, one of the laundries could be preserved as a museum or memorial to commemorate the women.</p><p><br /> I want to acknowledge what the Taoiseach said earlier, including the heartfelt apology, but most especially the reaction of the ladies in the Visitors Gallery.  They are the people whose reactions matter most, not ours.  I accept what the Taoiseach said about the need for two weeks between the report's publication and today's debate, but the extra pain that was caused in that time could have been avoided.  I hope that the establishment of a review under Mr. Justice Quirke will not delay the process further.</p><p><br /> The ladies speak about shame and stigma, but they have no reason to feel that way.  The shame and stigma is on our part and that of society.</p></speech>

A system of slavery, servitude and enforced labour is the single, simple story of the Magdalen laundries.  I am glad that the Taoiseach recognised that in the apology given on behalf of the State concerning that era when women were subjected to such treatment over the decades.  The women in the Visitors Gallery really said it all by welcoming the apology.  That will make the difference.</p><p><br />  Whether a girl or a woman was put into the laundries by the criminal justice system, the Legion of Mary, a parish priest or family members, their human rights are equal to those of anybody else.  Church and State ignored these women's rights over the decades.</p><p><br />  State inspectors visited these institutions to check them, but walked out and said nothing.  The Garda accepted the <i>status quo</i> and implemented it.  I remember seeing a picture of the Magdalen women at some church event, with a line of garda&iacute; beside them so that they could not run away.  If they did try to run away they would be pulled back in again.  That must have been a terrible situation to face for young women who did not know why they were there.  The same applies to others in industrial reform schools and psychiatric institutions.  The Bethany homes have not been mentioned here but they should be referenced in this regard.</p><p><br />  This was an Ireland that ignored the League of Nations' 1926 convention on abolishing slavery.  It was ratified in 1930.  It also ignored the International Labour Organization's convention on forced labour, which was ratified in 1931.  It was aimed at suppressing the use of force in regard to compulsory labour.  It also ignored the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.  Despite this, church and State allowed the laundries to continue, ignoring the rights to liberty and freedom from arrest and detention.  They also ignored the right to be free from criminal, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as well as the right to respect for family life and the right to participate freely in the cultural life of the community.</p><p><br />  We are collectively responsible for the wrongs done to all the women of the Magdalen laundries.  They will obtain redress and will have an enforceable right to compensation.  Some 20 months ago, the European Court of Human Rights gave the State a year to rectify this matter.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that Mr. Justice John Quirke will make recommendations within three months.  The terms of reference have not been set out, but I hope they will be those advocated by the Justice for Magdalenes group which has called for a dedicated unit within the Department of Justice and Equality to facilitate access to pensions and unpaid wages, as well as services including houses and medical cards.  They also want a commission for financial reparation and the preservation of historical records.  In addition, they are insisting on a transparent and accountable appeals process.</p><p><br />  The four orders should apologise and should play a part in the redress scheme.  We must insist, however, that this would not delay any movement by the State to provide funding.</p><p><br />  I salute the women who never gave up believing in themselves.  They recognised themselves as human beings.  I do not know if I would have had the strength to fight on this issue over such a long period.  We see, hear and believe them.</p></speech>

I feel that the women themselves should have the first chance to respond to what the Taoiseach has said today on behalf of the State.  Their reaction is the most important thing.  Things are as they are, however.  Given that, I will try to do justice to the issues as I see them following the Taoiseach's statement.</p><p>As the Taoiseach and others have stated, the history of the Magdalen laundries is a dark and utterly shameful chapter in the history of the State.  It is a history of 90 years in which more than 10,000 innocent women, who did nothing wrong, were imprisoned, enslaved, exploited, stigmatised, abused and denied their most basic human and civil rights.  It is a history in which the church and religious institutions, which claimed to be the moral guardians of society, were the jailers, abusers and torturers of these women.  These institutions were agents for the daily humiliation and incarceration of these women and were responsible for obscenities one would have thought would be unthinkable in a civilised society.  The thought that in a society claiming to be civilised, there would be mass graves in which the number of bodies was not matched by the number of death certificates simply beggars belief in a modern civilised society.  As I listened to some of the speakers at the vigil outside Leinster House, who described and mentioned the names of people who did not survive but who lived and died inside these institutions and who talked about how those women were in these institutions for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, it simply beggars belief.</p><p> If, however, the church and religious institutions were the direct agents of such horrific treatment of these women, the State colluded every step of the way.  It did so by sending thousands of women to these institutions, by inspecting these institutions but ignoring the plight and the treatment of the women inside them, by funding these institutions, by trading with and profiting from these institutions and by failing to uphold human and civil rights, not just as we understand them today but as were in place even then in international law.  It did so by failing to ensure the right to education of these women and thus blighting their future possibilities.  Moreover, the State was at the centre of facilitating a much wider architecture of oppression and abuse that included the Magdalen laundries, Bethany Home, the industrial schools and a more general culture of repression and control in which women, the less well-off, those who were different or who failed to conform to oppressive social and moral norms were the chief victims.  It beggars belief that it has taken this long for these women to get the acknowledgement and apology they have so long deserved.  It beggars belief that the last of these institutions closed down only in 1996 - this was only a few years ago when many Members of this House were involved in politics - and that it has taken until now for the women finally to get the apology they deserve.  The fact they have got it is a tribute to these women.  They are the leaders who have led where the State has failed, where politicians have failed and where we have all failed in public life.</p><p> In conclusion, if we apologise, as the Taoiseach rightly has done, that apology must now have meaning and substance.  It appears as though there is not much to consider in this regard.  The women have led where we have failed.  They have indicated what they need for redress and compensation and we should simply give it to them in order that they no longer are obliged to wait and suffer in the way they have for far too long.  If apologies are to have meaning, we must act immediately.</p></speech>

She had spent 16 years in an industrial school, was found by her mother and moved with her to England, where she stayed for nine months.  She left because she was being abused by her stepfather and on her return to Ireland, she was picked up by the garda&iacute; and brought to the laundry at High Park in Drumcondra.  She told me that on her first night there, she was stripped naked and all her hair was cut off.  She was told to smoke three cigarettes a day to quieten her down.  There were 60 people in one dormitory and they were only allowed to bathe once a week.  Moreover, when they did, all 60 of them were obliged to share the same bathwater.  She spent four years there and she was regularly beaten.</p><p><br />  I also welcome the Government's apology and its promise to provide redress.  Full credit should go to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for their excellent speeches.  It is important to perceive this as a start and that there is no let-up in the effort to bring justice to these women.  The announcement made today should not be portrayed as a grand benevolent gesture on the part of the Irish State.  This is disgracefully overdue and it is about giving these women what they are owed.  I refer to unpaid labour, social insurance contributions that were never paid, pension entitlements that were never accrued and medical services, including disability supports and counselling and psychotherapy, as well as other services.  All the women who spent time in the Magdalen laundries - and their families - must obtain redress.  It is of crucial importance that the redress system be independent, properly resourced, accessible, non-adversarial, transparent and open.  The scheme must be placed on a statutory footing with proper monitoring and oversight and must include an appeal system.</p><p><br />  Amnesty International has made some important observations in this regard.  It pointed out that in June 2011, the United Nations Committee against Torture recommended to the Government with regard to the Magdalen laundries that the State is obliged, under the United Nations Convention against Torture, to ensure all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation, including the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible.  The Government, rather than the women, has the responsibility of bringing to account the religious orders which ran the Magdalen laundries for their role in the abuse there.  Amnesty International also pointed out that it is clear from the report that girls and women who spent time in Magdalen laundries experienced serious human rights abuses, including servitude, forced labour, inhuman and degrading treatment and denial of educational opportunity.  In addition, girls and women were subject to arbitrary detention, since they were <i>de facto</i> detained in these institutions.</p><p><br />  In respect of the McAleese report, it is striking that not once in a report of more than 1,000 pages are the words &quot;slavery&quot; or &quot;torture&quot; mentioned.  Women were imprisoned, forced to carry out unpaid labour and subjected to severe psychological and physical maltreatment.  Never does the aforementioned report name the incarceration of these women and girls for what was, namely, torture and slavery.  It appears at times as though the language in the report tries to explain away the internment of girls and women.  The detention of women and girls in the laundries by the State is labelled in the reports as &quot;referrals&quot;.  According to the report, none of these women was imprisoned, committed or incarcerated; they were simply referred from the health and social service sector, industrial and reformatory schools, the criminal justice system and mother and baby homes.  It of course is welcome that the report established what it set out to do and found evidence of significant and direct State involvement in the Magdalen laundries.  The committee fulfilled its mandate, which was to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries.</p></speech>

However, the committee also went beyond its brief to provide information on the living and working conditions in the laundries and on their financial viability.  The report implies that little physical abuse took place in the laundries.  However, as Amnesty International has pointed out, the report also cited psychological punishments, which also should be deemed to be physical, namely, the use of solitary confinement cells and the deprivation of food for those girls and women who refused to work.  Furthermore, the committee did not include in its report the 800 pages of written testimony provided by the Justice for Magdalenes advocacy groups.</p><p>These testimonies, both from survivors and other witnesses, illustrate that many women experienced physical punishment during their times in the laundries.  I would like to finish with a quotation from a woman whose testimony was published in the Ryan report:<blockquote>The older I get I find these years haunt me, I will carry it to the grave with me... The nuns made you feel as if you&#8217;re a nobody and you never have any roots... As the years go by you try not to be spiteful, I try not to be bitter... I have bad days and then I have good days.</blockquote></p></speech>

It is the day the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, acknowledged their hurt and apologised for their suffering as a result of their being admitted to and working in a Magdalen laundry and the stigma many of them have felt throughout their lives.  It is the day the State acknowledged the extent to which time spent in the laundries tragically blighted the lives of so many, and it is the day the State is finally opening its heart and accepting its moral duty to those who felt abandoned and lost and believed they had no future.</p><p>  Dr. McAleese, in the introduction to his report, says that, for many years, the chronicle of the laundries was characterised by secrecy, silence and shame and, therefore, I express my deep gratitude to the women of the Magdalen laundries who began a journey a long time ago to have the truth of what happened told and acknowledged.  There must have been times on that journey when they wondered if it was ever going to end, if indifference and evasion were the only responses they would receive.  With courage and tenacity, they persisted.  Due to their efforts, the veil of secrecy surrounding the laundries has at long last been lifted and it can never be replaced.</p><p>  This is not a day for recriminations about past failures to respond to these women's quest to establish the truth.  I merely want to record that, upon my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I was determined our Government would address the wrong done to those consigned to the Magdalen laundries and determined to see this day come.  We will all accept that the work done by Dr. McAleese and all those who assisted him has been vital in allowing us to get where we are today.  I am deeply grateful that he accepted my invitation to head a committee that would, once and for all, establish the truth of the State's involvement in the laundries.  As I said in the House last week, I am personally grateful for the calm compassion with which he approached his task.  I undertook in the House that we would publish the report once we had it and then consider our response.  That is what the past fortnight has been about.  We owed it to the women concerned to read and fully understand this story before responding and meeting them.</p><p>  While today is primarily about acknowledging and seeking to make amends for the hurt experienced by the extraordinary women, some of whom I am pleased are with us this evening, we would do a great disservice to ourselves and to future generations if we did not try to learn lessons from what happened.  For decades, our society was prepared to use institutions, including but not limited to the Magdalen laundries, to deal with a host of problems and perceived problems.  Apart from the girls and women placed in the laundries by the State, the range of purposes for which society used the Magdalen laundries can also be seen in the report - some were young girls rejected by their foster parents when maintenance from the authorities ceased; some were young women who had been orphaned or who were in abusive or neglectful homes; others were women with either mental or physical disabilities; others still were simply poor or homeless; and many girls and women were placed in the laundries by their own families for reasons that we may never know or fully understand but which the report indicates &quot;included the socio-moral attitudes of the time as well as familial abuse&quot;.</p><p>  The women's accounts, as cited in the report, describe the laundries as cold, harsh and lonely places.  Sadly, this reflects a truth we must all recognise: that Ireland itself, for many decades, could be a cold and harsh place for the vulnerable among us.  That is not for a moment to suggest that what went on in the laundries was acceptable or to minimise what was endured by girls and women there but if we are to learn what we can from what happened, we must not blind ourselves to what are, we hope, the past realities of Irish society.  The report found that a significant number of women admitted themselves to the laundries voluntarily.  Presumably, this was because they had nowhere else to turn or because they felt that life would be better there than anything else which society offered.  It is tragic to think of those women and the choices they faced but this again is a reality on which we must reflect.</p><p>  Dr. McAleese points out at the beginning of the report that there is no single or simple story of the Magdalen laundries.  More than 10,000 women are known to have entered the laundries from the foundation of the State in 1922 until the closure of the last laundry in 1996.  Each of those girls and women were individuals with their own stories and experiences, before, during and after their time in the Magdalen laundries.  It would be a great injustice to them to define their lives by the fact that they were in the laundries.</p><p>  There is an obligation on us to address the women's needs arising from the hurt they experienced during, and due to, their time in the laundries.  We wish not only to acknowledge the experiences many of the women had in these institutions but also to look to addressing their future needs.  In particular, I want to pursue measures that will promote healing, reconciliation and, in so far as possible, provide closure to them.  Attributing blame or taking an adversarial approach to this issue will not promote the well-being of the women concerned.</p><p>  The Taoiseach has gone to some lengths to meet as many of the women concerned as possible.  The largest grouping of women are those represented by the Irish Women Survivors Network based in the UK.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I travelled specially to the UK to meet this group last Saturday.  In Ireland, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste met women represented by the Magdalen Survivors Together and the Taoiseach also met women currently living in nursing homes or sheltered accommodation under the care of the religious congregations.  I had met many of these women in the past, prior to the establishment of the McAleese committee, and Dr. McAleese also met many of them once he took up his appointment.</p><p>  The concerns they expressed on their own behalf in all of these meetings were quite consistent.  They had felt ignored for many years and wanted their stories listened to.  Through the mechanism of the McAleese committee established by the Government, the women have had the opportunity to tell their stories, to have them listened to, acknowledged, recorded and believed.  We have received letters or messages of thanks from both representative groups for this, expressing their appreciation for, and satisfaction with, this process and the manner in which it was conducted.</p><p>  Another major concern expressed directly by the women themselves was their lasting concern and undeserved sense of shame due to the stigma they felt attached to them because Magdalen laundries were associated in the popular mind with what used to be referred to as &quot;fallen women&quot;.  The facts set out in the McAleese report clearly address this point and put an end forever to any stigma of this or any other kind.</p><p>  The question of an apology has been addressed by the Taoiseach and, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I unreservedly endorse that apology.  What remains is the question of what supports should be provided in the future.  The Government decided earlier to establish fund for the benefit of the women who were in these institutions.  The Government does not wish to see any of this fund wasted on lawyer's fees nor does it wish to go down the road of an adversarial approach where individual women will have to prove they were traumatised.  We are concerned about providing speedy and effective practical help and support.  This is also a message we received clearly from the women directly concerned.</p><p>  The Government has given consideration to a number of purposes to which the fund might be put.  As I mentioned, the largest single group of women who have come forward are based in the UK and represented by the Irish Women's Survivors Network.  The Irish Survivors Advice and Support Network, ISASN, has worked with and provided advice and support to more than 2,000 survivors of industrial schools and laundries.  It is proposed that the step by step centre for Irish survivors be established as a holistic and person-centred service that not only would offer accessible specialist advice and support to those affected, but also focus on ensuring their future health and well-being.  The Government has made a decision in principle to pay out of the fund an initial sum of &euro;250,000 to the UK step by step centre for Irish survivors of industrial schools and the laundries.  I envisage this payment being made as soon as the legal technicalities have been clarified.</p><p>  The fund is aimed at women who spent time in Magdalen laundries.  However, the stories of a certain number of women who were admitted to and worked in the residential laundry in Stanhope Street in Dublin reflect those of the women in the Magdalen laundries.  In recognition of that, the Government has decided to include the women who worked in the Stanhope Street laundry without pay within the scope of the fund.  A number of women, in particular those represented by Magdalen Survivors Together, were keen to have some form of memorial for the story of the Magdalen laundries as we now know it.</p><p>It is appropriate that the women themselves now consider the nature and location of a memorial they would deem suitable.</p><p><br /> The needs of individual women vary considerably and, as I noted, the Government wishes to have a system in place that will be open and transparent and at the same time will avoid a complicated administrative system.  While I appreciate that any further lapse of time may not be very welcome, I hope, on balance, the women will see the advantages in our decision to appoint an independent person to advise on these matters in a relatively short timeframe.  To this end, the Government has appointed retired High Court judge and current president of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. Justice Quirke, to examine how, taking into account the McAleese report, the Government might best provide supports, including health services such as medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs for the women who need such supports as a result of their experiences.  Mr. Justice Quirke is being asked to advise on the establishment of a scheme under the fund, which is to operate on a non-adversarial basis, to make payments to individuals from the fund.  This will include identifying the criteria and factors to be taken into account, such as work undertaken in the laundries for no remuneration.  He will advise on the operation of the fund and, in particular, the nature and amount of payments to be made out of the fund.  He will further set the procedure for the determination of applications in a manner that ensures the moneys in the fund are directed only to the benefit of eligible applicants and not on substantial legal fees and expenses.</p><p><br /> Mr. Justice Quirke is being asked to report back within three months.  Everyone concerned is anxious to avoid unnecessary delays and I share this concern.  For this reason, I have instructed officials in my Department to start the process now in anticipation of the entry into operation of the fund.  To this end, with effect from tomorrow, people may contact my Department to register their interest in being considered to receive benefits or supports from the fund when it enters into operation.  This will allow people time to gather the necessary basic documentation that will be required to verify their identity and stay in one of the relevant institutions.  It may also give some indication of the numbers who have an interest in such a fund.  I hope the religious congregations will co-operate in facilitating the operation of the system which will facilitate the making of payments to those who seek them.</p><p><br /> The contact details will be as follows: Magdalen Laundry Fund, c/o Department of Justice and Equality, Montague Court, Montague Street, Dublin 2.  There will be a notice on my departmental website, which will provide a telephone number, e-mail addresses and a website, <i>www.idcmagdalen.ie</i>.  I do not expect anyone to remember the website addresses but the details will be readily accessible on my Department's website at <i>www.justice.ie</i>.  My Department will also be in touch with the representative groups on this matter.</p><p><br /> It will be a matter for Mr. Justice Quirke to decide how he will carry out his task.  He will receive whatever assistance he needs from the relevant Departments and will, no doubt, take into consideration the views expressed by representative and advocacy groups.  We are determined that the money in question will be solely for the benefit of the women.  In that context, I am confident Mr. Justice Quirke will devise a scheme which will be straightforward and include every administrative assistance for applicants.</p><p><br /> I know the women present this evening will be the first to agree that we should also remember that the greater number of women who were admitted to and worked in the laundries are, sadly, no longer with us.  There are other women too, as the report points out, who never want to tell anyone of their time in the laundries.  That is their right but I hope today that they, too, if only privately, can take some comfort from this day of acknowledgement.</p><p><br /> We accept that what we have done today may not completely satisfy everyone concerned.  No matter how much we want to, we cannot undo the hurt that has been done.  However, what we have tried to do, having listened to the response of the women concerned to the report, is to attempt to resolve the issues faced by them in a fair and compassionate way, in so far as that is possible.  Beyond what we have set out today, the greatest respect we can pay to their stories of the laundries is to say that those stories and the lessons from them will never be forgotten and are truly believed.  We are committed to do whatever we can to be of assistance.</p></speech>

I welcome the heartfelt and genuine apology he made as the Taoiseach and a citizen of the State.  His apology is owed to all of the women concerned.  He has given a voice to those whose voice was stolen from them and in finding their voice, the survivors of the Magdalen laundries and their supporters have shown great courage, dignity and inspiration.  Those of us who have met the women in recent years could not help but be inspired and humbled by the manner in which they have approached their experience.  I have never seen the Gallery as alive or emotional as it was when the Taoiseach spoke.  There were tears of joy at this achievement, which is a compliment to the Taoiseach.</p><p><br />  Over the weekend, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, set a high bar for the person charged with the task Mr. Justice Quirke has since been appointed to complete.  I believe Mr. Justice Quirke will reach the bar and bring great experience to the role.  The job specification and timeframe within which he must deliver is challenging.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, addressed some of the more practical questions we had on the role of Mr. Justice Quirke.</p><p><br />  The Government's commitment to have a memorial is appropriate.  It should not be a statue or monument but a living memorial, somewhere where the testimonies of all of those who were in the laundries and institutions is recorded for posterity.  This will ensure that once this generation, which has learned so much from the survivors and their stories, passes, subsequent generations will not forget and will be able to read and see the survivors' testimony.  We need a living as well as a physical memorial, and a proper scheme that is delivered quickly will also serve as a living memorial.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensure the scheme will be non-adversarial.  The survivors have endured enough adversity and fought long enough to reach this stage.  Tonight, we remember those who were in the institutions and have gone to a better place.  They and their families are in our thoughts.</p><p><br />  I welcome the Government's commitment to establish and fund the step-by-step centre for those living in the United Kingdom.  It is one of the features of the Magdalen women that many of them left the country that abandoned them so many years ago.  Tonight, as those of them who live abroad look in, I welcome the commitment to the step-by-step centre and hope those who are living in countries other than the UK will receive the same service.</p><p><br />  I welcome the commitment to include in the scheme women who were in the Stanhope Street laundry.  It was one of the ironies of the McAleese process - I compliment former Senator McAleese - that the laundry which provided all of the images used to depict Magdalen laundries was excluded from the report.  The inclusion tonight of Stanhope Street is welcome.  I seek clarification on whether survivors of another laundry in Wexford will be included in the scheme.</p><p><br />  Many people have walked the journey and tonight is their night.  Many have given a voice to the ladies in question and many groups have given them a chance.  Film makers brought their stories to life in a way that was precluded before technology.  Tonight is a night for the women and their families who went through this journey in so much secrecy and pain for many years.  Today, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, James Smith from Justice for Magdalenes cited the following poem by Patricia Burke Brogan from the play &quot;Eclipsed&quot;:<blockquote>Make Visible the Tree/ This is the Place of Betrayal. <br /><br />Roll back the stone/ behind madonna blue walls.<br /><br />Make visible the tree.<br /><br />Above percussion of engines<br /><br />from gloom of catacombs<br /><br />through a glaze of prayer,<br /><br />scumble of chanting,<br /><br />make visible the tree,<br /><br />its branches ragged<br /><br />with washed-out linens<br /><br />of a bleached shroud.<br /><br />In this shattered landscape,<br /><br />sharpened tongues<br /><br />of sulphur-yellow bulldozers<br /><br />slice through wombs<br /><br />of blood-soaked generations.<br /><br />This is the place<br /><br />where Veronica,<br /><br />forsaken, stares and stares<br /><br />at a blank towel.</blockquote>The tree is now visible and the stone has been rolled back but the work must go on.  If we are finally to make the tree fully visible, we must see through tonight's announcements fairly and quickly as the people concerned do not have time.</p><p> Last week, Deputies from all parties read into the record some of the testimonies.  We ended with the simple words "We believe".  We believe every one of the survivors.  Tonight, the country believes.  Tonight is their night.</p></speech>

The Magdalen women have waited, hoped and prayed for this moment.  Many of them despaired that it might never come, but it has.  Today saw a full acknowledgement of the wrong done to them.  They were wronged.  The State was complicit in their detention and abuse in the laundries.  It oversaw a system of slave labour, had commercial relationships with and inspected the laundries.  The State was a party to the wholesale violation of the basic freedoms and rights of girls and women detained in those laundries.  Their arbitrary detention, their servitude and their forced labour were illegal.  The State broke the law repeatedly for decades.  It is liable for these unlawful acts and for failing in its legal duties to uphold and vindicate the rights of the girls and women.</p><p>  This is what today's apology is about.  The acknowledgement of the hurt and suffering is essential for the women, but the State's acceptance of its responsibility, liability and failures is the crucial part.  The apology is just a first step in securing justice for the women.  Redress and compensation must follow to make some amends.  In other words, the apology must be matched with actions.</p><p>  The story of the Magdalen laundries brings us face to face once again with the all too familiar themes of shame, stigma, silence and secrecy, themes that have defined the systemic abuse of women and children in Irish society for generations.</p></speech>

We would be fooling ourselves but no one else in the course of this debate if we believed for a second that this approach to vulnerable women and children was a thing of the past.  It is not.  It lives with us yet in society.</p><p>  Deliberate cruelty was visited on young, vulnerable women for decades with the active connivance of the State.  All the while, society looked the other way.  It might be convenient for us at this distance to claim we did not know, but it would be more honest to say we did not want to know.  The truth came out slowly, but forcefully.  The work of courageous journalism, most notably that of the late Mary Raftery, the inquiries into industrial schools, the diligence of human rights activists and advocacy groups and, above all, the immense bravery of Magdalen women and their families put the truth on the record.</p><p>  We have known of the trauma endured by women and girls for some time.  The 2009 Ryan report made an explicit reference to the abuse suffered in the Magdalen laundries.  Archival material and the women's testimonies painstakingly gathered by Justice for Magdalenes had long established a history of abuse and State involvement in same, yet it took the UN Committee against Torture to force the State's hand to address the issue.  In 2011, just 20 months ago, the instinct of the State was still to look the other way and to deny its part in the Magdalen laundries.</p><p>  The McAleese review was set the task of establishing the extent of State involvement in the laundries.  The report published two weeks ago confirmed again State complicity in the detention of women and in breaches of their constitutional and human rights.  The report is to be commended for reiterating these facts.  However, it needs to be said that the report is not a full nor final account of the laundries and the women's experiences therein.  The information and records examined by the committee was incomplete and the report acknowledges that statistics on routes of admission and lengths of stay are substantially incomplete.  The route of entry for almost half of the women and girls is not recorded.  In the case of length of stay, there are no data for 58% of admissions.  The lack of information relating to the laundry in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the partial records for Galway are noted in the report.  The exclusion of the Stanhope Street and Summerhill laundries from consideration by the committee and from the report represents another large gap in the story.</p><p>  The committee heard from just 119 surviving women from the laundries.  It was a disappointment that the written submissions of survivors were not fully reflected in the report.  The finding that there was no physical abuse gave rise to most commentary because it does not tally with the available evidence.  Not only does survivor testimony flatly contradict this finding, but the report itself instances occasions of solitary confinement and deprivation, which are by any definition physical abuse.  However, the McAleese report confirms State collusion with the Magdalen laundries.  This is its central achievement and it is to be commended.</p><p>  I noted with interest the Government's announcement this evening of the appointment of Mr. Justice John Quirke to report within a period of three months.  That is a rather lengthy period for deliberation and I ask the Government to reconsider it.</p><p>  I welcome the Government's commitment to a non-adversarial redress process.  This is how it must be.  However, I wish to sound a note of caution.  It cannot be left to one individual, no matter how honourable or eminent, to adjudicate on these matters.  It is essential that the redress process accord with rules of natural justice and fair procedure and be fully transparent.  For this reason, any redress scheme must be put on a statutory footing, have adequate oversight and have a right of appeal.  I am concerned, as the indications are that this rigour, clarity and transparency might not apply to what the Government has in mind.  I ask it to revisit this approach.</p><p>  No one wants the redress procedure to be a bonanza for the legal profession.  The survivors certainly do not.  However, I would be equally concerned if the Government ruled out the spending of any money on the legal advice the survivors might require.  It would be ill-judged and could prove detrimental to the process and unfair to the women.  We will revert to these issues another day.</p><p>  For all of the women, there is no way in which we can fully compensate them.  We cannot give them back the years spent in slavery in the institutions.</p><p>We cannot give them back their youth, innocence or optimism.</p><p> I am also conscious that for many of the women there can be no redress because they are no longer around.  The most traumatic part for me of what is a deeply traumatic story is the manner in which some of the women died and were buried.  They had lived without the dignity of their name and they died without it also.</p><p> The Magdalen women have done this State a great service.  Their testimony and stories have sharply confronted the historic ambivalence of the State about physical abuse of women and children.  That ambivalence still exists.  The Magdalen women put it up to all of us to confront and rectify abuses in the system both historic and current.  I instance the Bethany Home.  It is disgraceful that yet again those victims and survivors are excluded from yet another redress mechanism.  That is not good enough and it cannot continue.  I instance the enforced illegal adoption of Irish babies in this country and abroad.  It is a scandal simmering just beneath the surface with which we must deal.  I instance the victims of symphysiotomy &ndash; all 1,500 women - who were butchered in State and State-funded voluntary hospitals and who have yet to have any acknowledgement.  The Magdalen women have made it very clear that when women are wronged that women will demand justice.  They have led the way and we owe them a very great debt.</p><p> Today, the full vindication of the Magdalen women begins.  Their truth, their stories, their lives, above all their courage and dignity, have brought us to this moment of apology.  Girls and women were held against their will, enslaved, belittled and damaged, yet today they triumph.  Today, the responsibility of the State - its neglect, collusion and complicity - in the abuses of the laundries is acknowledged fully and finally.</p></speech>

I appreciate the forbearance of the Acting Chairman.</p><p>  I am happy to add to the statements made by the party leaders and the Head of Government, An Taoiseach.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his fulsome, honest and heartfelt apology on behalf of the Government, the Cabinet, backbenchers, his party and, more importantly, the people of this country.</p><p>  I welcome the remaining members of the Magdalen women who are present in the Gallery this evening.  I met them outside the gates of Leinster House.  They did themselves proud with the dignity with which they held their silent, candle-lit vigil as dusk was falling.  They gave a nice rendition of the sad song from which the Taoiseach quoted a line in his speech.  That tells its own story.</p><p>  The Magdalen women are a coterie of people who have been abused beyond all recognition.  No words of mine, the Taoiseach or any Member of this House can ever bring back the lost lives, lost time and the separation, anguish and trauma they experienced in the Magdalen laundries.  Neither will it bring back the loss of friendship and the comradeship of siblings, parents and loved ones throughout the time of their incarceration.</p><p>  Times have changed.  I thank former Senator McAleese for his report.  I welcome the fact that the Government bestowed the job of chairmanship of the committee on him.  It cost &euro;11,400 for a 1,000 page report.  However, pages and volumes of books do not matter; it is what the reports contain that is important.  I refer to the telling and moving stories.  I salute the women who had the courage to recount with humility and honesty the awful stories of what happened to them in spite of the memories they evoked.  It was a truly shocking and appalling vista that emerged.</p><p>  We could say it happened at a different time in the past but the State must take the blame for 28% of the women and what went on at the time.  Some women went into the laundries voluntarily and others were put in by their families.  They must examine their consciences, as we all have to.  We knew of people in our neighbourhood who were put away for whatever reason.  Thankfully, some women of whom I am aware were taken back into the community in later years and reunited with their families.  In a case of which I am aware an excellent service was provided by an individual in minding her siblings and playing a full part in my local community.  I knew her affectionately as Peg.  I never knew she existed or was in a laundry until she arrived back and played a full and honest part in the community.  One would not meet a finer lady.  She went through trauma but she did not discuss it with anyone.  She carried it with dignity and played a full part in her home.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that pension rights will be considered for the rest of the women who are alive today.  I am a fervent supporter of most of the sisters, brothers, priests and clergy but the religious orders must pay some compensation because the laundries were a business that were based on slave labour.  That cannot be tolerated.  Pension rights must accrue to those people and pensions must be paid.  I am pleased that an eminent judge has been appointed to examine the situation.  I am particularly pleased, and I hope and pray, that any redress will not become a legal quagmire.  We do not want that.  We have had too much experience of tribunals and the gravy trains they became for lawyers.  People were left even more embittered following court cases and related situations.  Deputy Halligan has arrived.  I ask you, Acting Chairman, to tell me how much time I have left in order that we have five minutes each.</p></speech>

They are not my words; they are the words of five Supreme Court judges.  A debate in the House on the matter was refused.

That is in stark contrast to the high profile tribunals and inquiries that have cost the taxpayers millions of euro in the recent past.  We should commission a person like Dr. Martin McAleese, and the group involved or similar to carry out any further inquiries into high profile matters in this country.  The report gives us food for thought in that respect.  </p><p> I welcome the Taoiseach's wholehearted apology on behalf of the State.  It is very much due.  I also welcome his assurance that full reparation will be made to all the victims and that all the supports will be provided and their entitlements will be met in tandem with that.</p><p> It is ironic that the Abraham Lincoln story depicting the horrific slavery regime in the southern United States is currently a box office hit in this country, coinciding with the release of this report.  This report also demonstrates a similar miscarriage of justice and freedom in this country up to the 20th century.  This was carried out with significant State involvement under the watch of successive Administrations until the end of the last century but, unfortunately, there was no Abraham Lincoln or people of the repute of the liberator, Daniel O'Connell, who were prepared to stand up and cry halt in this country.  It was most unfortunate that it was allowed to continue until the latter years of the last century, up to 1996. </p><p> The testimonies of the survivors indicate that their treatment fits the definition of slavery.  They were detained in these institutions, in which women and girls were made work without pay, where physical and psychological punishment was practised and sometimes they were placed in solitary confinement, doors were locked and any escapees were returned under the full rigours of the rules that were applied and the law at that time. </p><p> The 1930 Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation, which Ireland signed in 1931, states that the detention and use of women and girls without pay would amount to being categorised as forced labour.  Also the European Convention on Human Rights, ratified by Ireland 1953, also prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  The treatment of girls and women and the State's direct involvement in and failure to prevent and deprive them of their basic right to an adequate education contravened the personal rights provision of the 1937 Constitution.  This episode in Irish history is a contradiction of many of the aspirations in the Constitution and, prior to it, the 1916 Proclamation.  It is a sad episode in our history.  The Constitution in 1922 coincided with our freeing the chains of foreign oppression we had in this country for more than 800 years and the initiation at that time of this abuse, which hopefully is now long gone.</p><p> I wish the very best to all the victims and I hope that they will be looked after following the commitment that was given here this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900046#UU00200"><p>I grew up on a street on which there was a Magdalen laundry,  the Waterford Institution, which housed 120 women at any time.  I lived across the road from it when I was a child.  When I was growing up there was an average of 60 women in the Waterford Institution at any time.  Although I was aware as a child that a laundry operated from the building, I had no idea that the building was the State's answer to many social problems that these women now face today.  Given the State's failure to make provision to address these problems, the religious order had obtained an entirely unpaid and captive workforce for its commercial laundry enterprise.</p><p>  Survivors groups have been telling for years what the McAleese report confirmed, that incarceration in the Magdalen laundries was similar to being sent to prison.  The State's failure to monitor the conditions in the laundries amounts to a grave and systematic violation of the girls' and women's human rights.  Surely a serious crime was committed in effectively kidnapping these women, forcing them to work for low pay and depriving them of all legal constitutional human rights.  For this, we should call for accountability.  The only way I see this happening is if the Government orders a full judicial review and criminal investigation into the Magdalen scandal in order that charges can be brought against all those responsible for this cover up.  If we believe they were kidnapped and held against their will, we have a responsibility under international law and our own law to make sure that the people who did that are held responsible.</p><p>  I will not accept the contention that these were very different times, something that has been said on a number of occasions.  The fact of the matter is that we had legislation in place that should have protected these women but it was not applied.  </p><p>  We need to ask a few questions.  Why did the State's factory inspectors who visited these commercial Magdalen laundries - they visited them in Waterford - not properly question why no rights were being given to these girls and women, some of whom were in their seventies and eighties and were working 12 hours a day, six days a week with no holiday entitlements?  Why did school inspectors not investigate the fact that the State was not living up to its constitutional duty to educate the children in the Magdalen laundries?  No checks were done on that.  Why were garda&iacute; used in an illegal manner to forcibly return escapees who were being held against their will?  Why was the State's judicial system allowed to routinely refer women to the laundries, despite there being no legal basis supporting the court's use of these institutions to confine the women?  </p><p>  I do not want to go into how women have been let down by the country; all of that has been said, and I am grateful it was said.  I thought the Taoiseach was excellent in his remarks today.  The McAleese report states that 42 women died in the Waterford laundry between the establishment of the State in 1922 and 1982, with at least nine of these deaths never even being registered.  It is crucial that this part of Ireland's history is not forgotten and that the State shows a commitment to remember these chapters of the nation's history.  </p><p>  I want to address my final remarks to the church which has been vociferous in telling politicians about children's and women's rights.  Within the church was an organisation that participated in a cruel and premeditated exploitation of women.  How women and children have been treated in the State by the church is reprehensible.  The best thing the church could do at this stage is to shut up on women's rights, women's issues and children's issues.  It is not capable of lecturing or giving advice with the history of child abuse in Ireland.  Now we have the Magdalen laundries.  We have to at all stages face down those, be it the church, the State or any political group, organisation or individual, who would precipitate cruelty on anyone else.  For too long in Irish society the church has hidden behind some sort of Shangri-La that it does not know what it is or how it is but if its members pray and say they are sorry, everything will be forgiven.  We should not forgive them because they have destroyed human lives.  No matter what way we look at it they have destroyed human lives from the time these people were children until they reached adulthood and later on.  </p><p>  We are at nothing here if we do not have a judicial inquiry and deal with the people who perpetrated these awful crimes against women.  </p><p>If, in 2013, we heard this was going on in a third world country or an African country, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would be calling for what I am calling for now.  We should do this.  We will have achieved nothing if we do not bring those who were responsible for the cruelty inflicted on these women and children to justice. </p></speech>

I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the issue of social housing in the House tonight.  There has certainly been much talk of housing, particularly relating to the issues faced by people at risk of losing their homes.  However, there has been very little debate on the solutions to these problems and even less dedicated to the continuing shortage of social housing.</p><p><br />  If one spent much time in this House listening to those on the Government benches or examining the topics for discussion, one could be led to believe there is no issue with social housing.  In fact, the only thing one would learn about social housing is that apparently too much money is being spent on it and it needs a good cut at least once a year.  One would be led to believe that those in social housing are well looked after, that they live very comfortable lives, in good conditions and that those who are not happy with their accommodation are most likely a bit too picky.  However, like most pictures this House paints of those hardest hit by this recession or those who were already on the margins, it is a picture much distorted by many things.  Some Deputies are out of touch, some are in denial and some still look on those who avail of social housing as targets for contempt rather than as citizens deserving of their rights, but that is what housing is.</p><p><br />  Despite what Government policy might indicate, housing is a right.  Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter all recognise the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living.  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, CESCR General Comment No.4: The Right to Adequate Housing, states: &quot;The human right to adequate housing, which is thus derived from the right to an adequate standard of living, is of central importance for the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights.&quot;  Can we really say that in 2013 this State provides that right to its people?  Shamefully, we cannot.</p><p><br />  As the motion states, there are currently almost 100,000 people on the housing waiting lists of this State.  In 1948, the first coalition Government commissioned a report which found that 59,000 homes were needed across the State to make up for the gap between housing provision and demand.  That was just over 26 years after the foundation of the State and now, 65 years later, we have nearly double that demand but are nowhere near providing for those numbers.  In fact, we are providing less new social housing now than we were in the 1970s.  The State has a shocking shortage of suitable homes to provide for people, while there are tens of thousands of homes lying idle which, in many cases, belong to developers who have been bailed out by the public purse.</p><p><br />  Who are these people whose needs the State is so badly failing to meet?  Of course, the degree of need among this very large group varies but I certainly have met and worked with many people whose need could be described as severe.  I met a mother who shared her parents' couch with her two sons in a house of 11.  She has no option but to wait and see, with the hope of getting onto the insecure and increasingly difficult rent supplement scheme.  She cannot get work even if there was work to be found because she cannot sleep a wink, giving up the couch so her sons will not go to school too tired to pay attention.  She sits in her mother's kitchen and hopes for some way out.  Rent supplement, by its nature, perpetuates her poverty trap.  It is her only hope but is only open to her if she is unemployed.  This is a poverty trap which now takes in 94,000 households and includes hundreds of thousands of men, women and children.</p><p><br />  A short-term stop gap to deal with the shortage of social housing when introduced, rent supplement has now become the Government's best weapon in pretending it is providing housing.  We have a system where the State is taking public money and subsidising private landlords who are, in too many cases, not living up to the standards set for them but all too rarely checked upon.  In order to get rent supplement, a person must be on the housing waiting list and be unemployed.  Once a person becomes part of the scheme, he or she must find accommodation, which can be a difficult task, given rising rents, poor standards, cramped conditions and the fact that some landlords, as a means of pre-emptive social cleansing, reject any prospective tenants in receipt of rent allowance.  This scheme costs the State over &#8364;500 million per year and provides not one extra social housing unit at the end of each year.  If rent is dead money then rent supplement is much worse, given the potential this money could have to rebuild communities and the social housing stock in a long-term drive to provide for the needs of the people on the housing waiting lists.</p><p><br />  The Government's other solution is to pretend that NAMA is delivering a social dividend.  While it is supposed to be doing this and a special purpose vehicle was created last year, it would seem to be a little bit of a charade.  Having spent billions of euro bailing out developers through NAMA, we are left with 179 homes delivered in three years, out of a promised total of nearly 4,000, up from an original figure of 2,000 homes which never materialised.  This scheme will also not deliver one extra social housing unit in the long term.  Instead, developers in NAMA will be given an easy tenant for about 11 years.  Estimates are that 2,000 homes will cost the State &#8364;14 million per year.  NAMA developers line their pockets while nothing is done to solve the continuing lack of housing.</p><p><br />  Sinn F&eacute;in has offered a solution, clearly laid out in our job creation package released at the end of last year.  A novel approach, it suggests that we provide housing as part of a public housing system.  The current Minister and the last Minister with responsibility for housing have stated that no big house building programmes would be possible, but we have clearly shown how it can be done.  In our job creation document, we highlighted how, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the European Investment Bank and incentivised investment from the private pensions sector, we could raise funds which would include &#8364;1 billion for improving and increasing our social housing stock.  This could fund the commencement of building 9,000 homes in the next two years, coupled with a renewed focus on the delivery of the 3,949 properties identified for social housing by NAMA, of which only 179 have so far been delivered.  This would take a considerable number of people off the waiting lists and save a considerable amount of taxpayers' money.  This &#8364;1 billion could also be used to improve the maintenance of social housing and to refurbish dilapidated units to make them available for housing families.</p><p><br />  Management companies are a big problem and the taking in charge by local authorities of many private housing estates and apartment blocks is going to happen sooner or later.  The Traveller accommodation maintenance programme in Dublin alone had its budget cut from &#8364;1 million to &#8364;50,000, which is an absolute shame.</p><p><br />  We need a vision for housing and a new approach.  We need an approach that recognises that housing is a right and that people who need housing should be housed and should not have to beg for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900047#VV00500"><p>There is no more obvious sign that working families are bearing the brunt of austerity than the crisis that many are facing every single month in trying to pay their mortgages.  Since 2011, my party has warned that the Government did not appreciate the urgency of the situation.  At that time we called for a new, time-limited, distressed mortgage resolution body.  Such a body would be an independent arbiter, tasked with reaching resolution agreements for those in mortgage distress.  While such an agreement between lenders and borrowers should be on the basis of joint agreement, we said that the resolution body should have the powers to impose agreements.</p><p>We showed how the primary aim of that body should be to assist mortgage holders maintain their family home.  Options to achieve that would include reducing the size of the mortgage.  That is what we have been calling for since this D&aacute;il was formed nearly two years ago.</p><p> The figures are shocking, and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, is aware of them.  During the Government's time in office the figures have got worse.  One in four mortgage holders is in distress and 115 mortgage holders fall into distress every single day.  That is a figure I need to repeat time and time again.  This time tomorrow, another 115 people will be in mortgage distress, and that has been the daily figure for the last two years since the Government took office.  Shocking as those figures are, they do not paint the full picture.  They cannot measure the number of mortgage holders who are going without necessities because they prioritise their mortgage repayments above all else.  They do not show how much the real domestic economy is missing out as mortgage holders refrain from spending to make sure they have sufficient money each month to pay their mortgage.</p><p> We are living through a State-wide social crisis.  How many fathers and mothers are suffering bad health from the stress of being in arrears or because the prospect of losing their family home is hanging over them?  This situation cannot be allowed to fester.  The Government must step up to the mark and start dealing with issues and proposing solutions that will work.  </p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in was critical of the Personal Insolvency Bill because it failed on one core issue.  It failed to remove the veto on lenders over any agreed plans.  No independent voice was empowered to say, &quot;Enough is enough&quot; when it needed to be said.  That is the critical flaw which means the Personal Insolvency Act will not bring about a major change in the mortgage crisis.  It will be an irrelevance for the majority of mortgage holders who are in distress or who may fall into distress in the future.  It is not a solution.  The Government needs to get real and recognise that.</p><p> The Keane report remains unimplemented.  It was a conservative and uninspiring attempt to bring about some solutions but even that report remains, for the large part, on the shelf gathering dust.  On top of this inaction, we see a Government determined to heap more difficulties on struggling lower and middle income earners.  It would be almost comical, if it were not serious, that at the height of the mortgage crisis the Government is moving to tax the family home.  Later this year, we will see water meters installed in these same homes.  We are living through a mortgage crisis and the Government has set its face to taxing the roofs over these families' heads and the water they live on. </p><p> The Government tries to wash its hands of the crisis, and that is simply not good enough.  That inaction has resulted in this crisis getting worse on a daily basis.  Today, the media reported that the chief executive of AIB has announced that the bank will write to 33,000 of its customers who are in arrears.  I am sure many AIB customers who are in arrears will welcome this initiative and hope it will bring some finality and solace to the reality of not being able to repay their mortgages.  The statements in the media, however, give us some insight into what the bank is planning.  The initiative only deals with those who are in mortgage arrears.  It does not deal with those who have already been restructured.  Many people who are in mortgage distress have been restructured into interest only payments.  That is not a solution and is definitely not a long-term solution.  It may provide a short-term solution until a more comprehensive one is looked at.  The fact that AIB has excluded that category of borrowers from this initiative shows it will be taking a minimalist approach. </p><p> That is why Sinn F&eacute;in believes the Government has a duty to intervene and tackle this crisis.  In this motion, we call on the Government to take action, not to sit on its hands but to force the banks to deal with this crisis.  Our motion offers our alternative, which is a direct taking on of the issue. The one in four who are in mortgage distress do not want, and cannot afford, to wait around for the Government to face the reality of the extent of the crisis.  </p><p> The first concrete action the Government must take is to revisit the Personal Insolvency Act and remove the final say from lenders.  The veto must be removed.  As long as lenders have a veto there is little reason for them to seek fair compromises.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling, as we have done for the past two years, for independent agreements on mortgage distress to be decided by a mortgage restructuring panel appointed by the Minister.  This panel would be empowered to act as an arbitrator with authorisation to impose on both parties agreements aimed at prioritising the protection of the family home.  It is regrettable that such a move is necessary but as this crisis deepens, the banks must be made show some willingness to face reality.  Only such a panel appointed by the Minister can fulfil that necessary role.  It would be more desirable that the banks do this themselves, but we need a carrot and stick approach.  The mandate of the new panel should, explicitly, allow for write-downs on portions of mortgages where necessary.  That is only accepting reality for many mortgage holders throughout the State.  Other options, including debt for equity swaps, mortgage to rent and short selling, should be available in settlements when independent agreements on mortgage distress are being reached. </p><p> The crisis is out of hand, in no small part because of the inaction and unreasonable approach of lenders.  These same lenders lent recklessly and some had to come crawling to the State to be rescued.  The State appointed, and still appoints, so called public interest directors to the boards of these same lenders.  These, supposedly, act in the  interest of the citizens.  Some of these public interest directors have come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in recent months.  These so called directors, including former Members of the D&aacute;il and former Ministers, including former Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, have not shown a smidgin of interest in the public.  They are part of the old failed system and they need to be told their role is to protect the public interest and not the interests of the banks.  If they are unprepared to do that they should move aside and let someone else take their place.  These same people receive hundreds of thousands of euro to represent the people.  They are failing to protect the public interest and they should resign.       </p><p> We must also see the Central Bank step up to the mark.  Time and again, Governor Honohan has made the right noises when he comes before an Oireachtas committee but he needs to show the same steel when talking to lenders.  It is also the duty of the Central Bank to ensure that the code of conduct for mortgage arrears is adhered to by all.  The code lays out best practice for resolutions and, critically, lays out the rights of borrowers to be free from harassment. </p><p> To date, the Government has taken a minimalist approach to the crisis.  The Keane report was the bare minimum and even its recommendations have not been implemented.  It is time to take the final say from the lenders and give it to a panel representing the public interest.  It is time to look at write-downs and other options when they are needed.  It is time to give those who did not cause this crisis a break.  </p><p> Throughout our recent economic crisis, the Government has chosen to have working people carry the heaviest burden.  That burden has become unsustainable in many cases and family homes are at stake.  This is unfair.  Irish people are proud to be home owners and we must act to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected.  We must move beyond fine words, and act.  It is time to get real.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

This is a crisis and it is on our doorsteps.  There is a lack of adequate public housing across the State and there has been a dramatic rise in this number since 2009.</p><p>  Many Deputies first became involved in politics through the housing action committees that sprang up during the 1960s.  At that time, as we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, many people, especially young people, realised there was a significant lack of proper accommodation for Irish people.</p><p>At that time, as we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, many people, especially young people, realised there was a significant lack of proper accommodation for Irish people.  After the Rising, which promised radical change and the development of a new Irish state, those who took power failed to deliver on the aspirations of the instigators of the rebellion.</p><p> If we look at where we are today, can we say we are in a better position?  The greed and corruption that surrounded the Fianna F&aacute;il property bubble left this country in dire straits.  The needs of the people were cast to one side and the interests of property developers were put to the fore.  Social housing was significantly damaged by the weakening of Part 5 of the Planning Act by Fianna F&aacute;il, which allowed developers to buy their way out of their social responsibility to provide 20% social and affordable housing as part of any project.</p><p> Since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, there have been further attacks on social housing.  Since coming into power they have cut funding to social housing by 19%, and overall spending has fallen 66.23% from the 2008 figure of &euro;1.7 billion.  The Dublin Traveller accommodation fund has been cut from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;50,000, an example of what has happened.</p><p> The Government also plans to take out leases on NAMA properties to plug the hole in the social housing gap.  These leases will be on a long-term basis and will cost the State &euro;40 million per year for 2,000 units, with the properties reverting back to the NAMA developers at the end of the lease.  This is nothing more than a scandalous double bail-out for developers.  It is not a scheme, it is a scam.</p><p> A special purpose vehicle was set up in NAMA to identify homes but in the year since the plan was announced, only 179 have been delivered.  At present, 94,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, costing the State almost &euro;500,000 a year and subsidising private landlords at public expense.  Sinn F&eacute;in has highlighted a solution to the social housing crisis.  In our jobs strategy, we outlined that a &euro;1 billion fund could be put in place for the construction of social housing.  This could fund the commencement of 9,000 homes in the next two years.  It would also be coupled with the proper utilisation of NAMA properties, providing an effective solution to our social housing problems. </p><p> The only mistake that Irish people made was to believe senior politicians and bankers who encouraged them to do the right thing and provide a roof over the heads of their families.  How can those who cannot currently afford to pay their mortgages, whose incomes are being cut as we speak and who face new and higher Government charges, continue to live?  What will happen to their mortgages as we take more from their pockets?  What will happen to the housing market when these people can no longer find the money to pay their mortgages?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900049#XX00200"><p>Some of the figures we have heard are unacceptable.  I do not know the Minister of State's political history but I am sure he served on a local authority like I did, and he would know better than me the pressures faced by local authorities in trying to provide adequate social housing to meet demand.  My local authority area of Cork City Council has 9,000 applications for social housing and many of those have been on the waiting list for six, seven or eight years.  Those people have little prospect of being offered social housing because we do not have the stock within the city boundaries to provide for those on the list.</p><p>  We must ask why people go on the social housing lists.  There might be medical issues or overcrowded accommodation but primarily they are on the list because they cannot afford to purchase their own home and are therefore relying on the State to provide housing at local level to secure a home for themselves and their families.  This is a vicious circle because these people cannot afford to pay a mortgage so many of them apply for social housing.  If they are lucky enough to have a job, even in low-paid employment, they do not qualify for rent allowance.  As there is no social housing available and because they are working, even for minimum wage, they do not qualify for rent allowance and are therefore forced into the private market.  They end up paying what it would cost them if they were able to get a mortgage.  That is consigning people to poverty.  It is unacceptable and must be addressed.  Much of the private accommodation I visit when meeting constituents is substandard.  The Minister of State will have seen the same when visiting constituents who are looking for social housing in his own constituency.</p><p>  Approximately half of those on the Cork City Council housing list are single, and many of them are separated fathers who will never have their needs met because they are classed as single applicants.  Many of these separated fathers have children and they have access to those children.  Given that the marriage has broken down and as a result of their inability to secure social housing, they must rent in the private market.  They cannot afford to rent a two or three bedroom house which would allow them to have their children to stay.  They are forced to rent one bedroom apartments where they cannot put their children up overnight.  That creates real hardship for the separated parents but most of all for the children.  This is not just about providing social housing, we must provide the sort of social housing that will meet the demand that exists.  No longer do typical three bedroom homes need to be built in areas like Cork City Council, we must tailor the social housing building to meet the demands of those on the social housing lists and those demands will vary from local authority to local authority.  To get hold of this we must have comprehensive review of the type of housing needed and then put in place the finances to deal with it.</p><p>  The cuts in the housing budgets for local authorities are having a significant impact.  There are houses in Cork City Council that are lying idle under the works department but the works department does not have the necessary funding to bring them up to a standard for re-letting.  People come to clinics asking why they must sit on a housing list for seven years when there are houses in the area that have been boarded up for three years.  We are not investing in housing at local or national level and that must change.</p><p>  I commend the motion put forward by my colleague Deputy Ellis and the section dealing with mortgage distress as put forward by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board our proposals for solutions to rectify this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900049#XX00300"><p>There has been a constant crisis in housing for decades.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe there is a fundamental right to housing.  Other parties might not agree but we are marked out tonight in our belief that people have absolute rights that are non-negotiable: the right from the cradle to the grave to a home, education and health.  In any civilised society those rights should be fundamental and should be paid for out of a progressive taxation system.</p><p>These rights are not dependent on building booms, bank bailouts or so-called public private partnerships.</p><p><br /> One of the first pieces of legislation Sinn F&eacute;in introduced to the D&aacute;il in 2002 was a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution to guarantee everyone a right to a home.  The Bill was defeated by the votes of a government which, in hindsight, we all know had a deeply unhealthy close relationship with the same developers who were laughing all the way to the banks.</p><p><br /> Unfortunately, during the age of the so-called Celtic tiger, we were lectured by the great and the good that developers would provide enough homes for everyone.  Those of us who promoted social housing were branded as being old fashioned or backward.  Now, of course, we realise that it was those same property developers and their allies who were in government fanning the flames of a building boom who brought the economy into recession and brought the State to the edge of bankruptcy.</p><p><br /> It is now time to revisit how we provide housing to those who need it.  As I stated earlier, there are currently 98,318 households on the waiting lists of local authorities in the State.  The building boom failed utterly to provide homes for these.</p><p><br /> Now is the time to plan and build local authority housing to meet the needs of these families.  It is far more cost effective to build now when building material, labour and land is so much cheaper.  Local authority housing is a good investment, with the rent providing an investment return to local authorities.</p><p><br /> I merely flag up this practical point with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, because we will always get the answer that the funding is not there.  I have looked at the maintenance budget of a couple of the local authorities and what they collect in rent.  From what I can see, the maintenance budget is between 17% and 22% of rent collected annually.  Assuming the maintenance is 20%, that allows 80% to be paid off the capital sum of providing the homes.  I refer to local authorities that have a fairly good record of house maintenance.</p><p><br /> The mistakes of the past should be learnt from and never repeated.  We do not want to see sprawling suburbs where residents are denied transport, schools and access to essential services.  What we want is well planned housing estates built with purpose.  Services and infrastructure must be at the core of any social housing plan, not fast-buck politics or so-called public private partnerships that have dominated the scene since 2004.</p><p><br /> It is ironic that there were two major house building programmes during significant recessionary periods in the State.  In the 1930s, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government, to its credit, carried out a considerable house-building programme.  In the 1950s, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello's party, in power with Fine Gael and Clann na Poblachta, carried out a considerable house-building programme.  All the Marian avenues were built in 1954 - one can see them all throughout the State.</p><p><br /> Unfortunately, now the major parties tie themselves up in knots in their attempts not to provide social housing.  Every trick in the book, such as rent subsidies, rental assistance scheme and social leasing, has been tried but all of them lead back to the same point in the circle.  They all lead to a dependency on private landlords and private developers, with the taxpayer carrying the buck.  Let us invest in social capital.  Let us invest in good local authority housing.</p><p><br /> None of those approaches will ever provide enough homes to meet the needs of the 250,000 people who make up those 98,000 households that are on the waiting lists, and now we have the sight of unfinished estates lying dormant, some of them in the hands in NAMA.  There are empty houses but there are people who do not have houses.</p><p><br /> In my county, there are 1,700 households languishing on the waiting list, yet houses lie unfinished in Portlaoise, Portarlington, Mountrath, Boris-in-Ossory and Graiguecullen.  I would propose where the estates remain unfinished and there is no bond, that the local authority complete the infrastructure, as it is doing at present in my neighbouring estate, Woodgrove in Portlaoise.  Local authority staff are in there today finishing off that estate.  They are completing the works that should have been done by the developer, who is gone.</p><p><br /> Where there are empty houses, the ownership of some of these properties could be transferred to the local authority <i>in lieu</i>of payment of the bond that should have been in place to carry out the works in those estates.  This is practical.  It is just, realistic and fair.  This is part of our social dividend.  It is part of the burden sharing.  This should be part of the solution to the housing crisis.</p></speech>

There are 98,316 on the local authority housing list, 23,649 on the RAS and 94,000 in receipt of rent supplement.  If one adds up those figures, it comes to 216,000 persons who are awaiting social housing.  In contrast, according to figures we were given here a number of years ago, there were 314,000 units empty in the country, the majority of them accommodation for housing.</p><p><br />  Over the past number of years the taxpayers, against their will, bailed out the banks.  These are the very same banks which are currently trying to repossess family homes across this island.  There are others also involved, the sub-prime lenders.  Previously, I have read names into the record.  One of those is a person by the name of Mr. Ronald Weisz of Wise Mortgages and other companies, who has been declared bankrupt in the United States but who also has a conviction here for illegally soliciting deposits.  Mr. Weisz's company operates in a legal limbo.  Prior to 2008, there was no authorisation or supervision of retail credit companies and, consequently, Wise Finance is neither licensed nor supervised by the Central Bank.  Clearly, there is a need to bring all such persons under legislation.</p><p><br />  Anyone who read the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on Saturday last would have seen where it named Wise Mortgages and a person by the name of Mr. Ian Andrews, who was convicted for corporate tax fraud of &pound;76 million and served 12 years in prison.  These persons are operating in this country and nothing can be done about them.  They are repossessing homes and property from Irish persons whom they sucked into their web and there is still nothing that can be done about them.  I have written to the Central Bank about it and I received letters back from it.  I have repeatedly raised the matter in the House.  Nothing is done about these legalised gangsters who are effectively evicting ordinary decent Irish persons from their homes on a daily basis.  Something needs to be done about it.  Something needs to be done, in particular, to provide a social housing programme that will provide accommodation to those who are seeking this for so long.</p></speech>

According to my own records, today alone I had 11 housing queries, between social housing and mortgage difficulties.  It is a crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in is to be highly commended and thanked for bringing in this Private Members' motion to give the issue an airing because it is bringing severe hardship on families.</p><p>  There are families who are locked into a position of owing a massive burden of debt to the banks.  There has been a write-down for all of the big players but the young couples with families occupying very modest houses which cost a fortune are paying huge mortgages.  These couples are failing to put proper heat into those houses.  They are going without proper food and proper clothing because they are married to paying the banks.  The sooner the banks realise that there must be a write-down for these couples and they must be taken care of, the better.  No ordinary person can afford to pay &euro;200,000, &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 of a mortgage on a house that today might not be worth &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  These couples have young families.  They will only live once.  The Government will have to act and try to assist and be of help to those couples.</p><p>  When it comes to social housing we all will be aware that the social housing building programme is gone.</p><p>Thousands of people are on housing waiting lists.  These are young people with their lives on hold in rented accommodation where they do not want to be.  They want the opportunity to be placed in local authority housing and in a number of years' time when they get their legs under them they might be able to purchase that house.  I do not mind anybody having to rent a house for a few years when starting out - that is perfectly normal and par for the course.  However, I hate to think of a young couple having to stay in rented accommodation all the days of their lives.  That is not right or proper.</p><p> I again thank Sinn F&eacute;in and in particular Deputy Martin Ferris for sharing time.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's achievements in this area and our strategy for the future.</p><p><br />  The context for the mortgage arrears and high level of indebtedness is the economic downturn, as the Deputies have acknowledged.  The Government is deeply committed to addressing the challenge of economic recovery, growth and jobs in the first instance in order to produce the environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their homes.  The Government is very aware of the difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and we are committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  I will outline to the Deputies the steps we have taken, as well as our continued efforts in assisting our citizens who face difficulties with mortgage arrears.</p><p><br />  One of the important steps to protect mortgage holders who are experiencing such difficulty is the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  This code remains a key framework to govern the relationship between mortgage holders in difficulty and their bank and it offers very worthwhile protections for distressed households.  The code provides that each bank must put in place a formal mortgage arrears resolution process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.</p><p><br />  Forbearance is a very worthwhile and an appropriate response to most people experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The approaches set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears can provide a household experiencing temporary mortgage difficulty with the necessary and important breathing space to enable that the household can get back on their feet and resume meeting their full mortgage commitments at a future time.  The Central Bank has commenced a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which will involve a public consultation process.  The review of the code will have to take account, as appropriate, of recent developments such as the new insolvency legislation.</p><p><br />  The Government also recognised that, in certain circumstances, other approaches may be required.  In view of this, the Government's Economic Management Council established an interdepartmental group, which was chaired by Mr. Declan Keane, to consider what additional measures could be introduced to assist people who are dealing with more significant mortgage difficulties.  Two main objectives were set for the group.  First, there was a desire, where appropriate and possible, to assist people who are experiencing real difficulties with their mortgage commitments to remain in their home.  Second, incentives should not be created that would encourage people who can pay their mortgage to stop doing so.  The Government has accepted these Keane report recommendations and has put in place an implementation framework to advance this work agenda.  The Government attaches a very high importance to this work as evidenced by the fact that a special Government sub-committee has been in place since March 2012 to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This committee is chaired by the Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.  More recently the remit of the committee has been expanded to include a greater focus on meeting the challenges facing small business.</p><p><br />  The Government's strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas: personal insolvency; a mortgage advisory service; the mortgage-to-rent scheme; and engagement with the banks.  Considerable progress has now been achieved across this agenda.  This cross-departmental strategy reflects that there is no single solution to the mortgage arrears problem and it is being tackled on many fronts.</p><p><br />  The Keane report indicated that, given the recourse nature of mortgages, personal insolvency reform and in particular the introduction of new more accessible insolvency-resolution frameworks were essential for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem.  The Personal Insolvency Act is now law and the introduction of this new and very important Act should be a catalyst to incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases.  We expect that the majority of agreements between borrowers and lenders can be made outside of the provisions of the Act as bilateral agreements between borrowers and lenders, without recourse to the new insolvency framework or the courts, would in many cases be in the interest of all parties.  However, the new insolvency framework will be necessary for some cases and the Insolvency Service of Ireland is now urgently preparing the ground to make them operational as soon as possible.  The director-designate of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, who took up his position last October, has been tasked with setting up an insolvency service to administer the new personal insolvency framework.  He has established an implementation team to address all operational matters necessary for the office and he is working towards a launch date at the end of next month with a website, an information campaign, and the issuing of publications and relevant guidelines.</p><p><br />  The vast majority of mortgage holders in distress also have unsecured debt, for example, credit card, personal loans and credit union loans.  Therefore the Personal Insolvency Act will allow mortgage holders in distress to address both their secured and unsecured debt effectively and in a holistic way.  As this is a formal process lenders are bound by the final agreement and thus this will provide the mortgage holder with greater certainty.</p><p><br />  There is a three-phased approach to provide a comprehensive mortgage arrears information and advice service to assist people in mortgage distress.  The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> and the establishment of a mortgage arrears information helpline within the Citizens Information Board, both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage-arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long-term mortgage-resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p><br />  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower's choosing for the provision of this advice.  The independent financial advice is available to all holders of a mortgage secured on a primary residence, who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lenders.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation.  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are listed on a county-by-county basis on the website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i>.</p><p><br />  A key housing support for those with distressed mortgages is the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has now put this scheme on a nationwide basis.  The objective is protecting the home of the most distressed mortgage holders through a mortgage-to-rent scheme where the ownership of the house passes to an approved housing body.  The existing owner then becomes a social-housing tenant.  This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low-income families, whose mortgage situation is unsustainable, to allow that family remain in their home.  While the numbers are still relatively small, mortgage-to-rent is an option that is being rolled out and many lenders are actively engaged in this roll-out.</p><p><br />  Of course the Central Bank also has a key role to engage with banks and mortgage lenders and to require banks to engage in a meaningful way with their customers who have distressed mortgages.</p><p>The Central Bank, under its MARS project, has been for some time intensively working with lenders to ensure that they have a range of long term options, including trade-down and split mortgages, sale by agreement or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders, available for their distressed mortgage customers and that they have the capacity to implement these in an effective manner.  While progress in this area has not been as rapid as desired, greater effort and resources are now being deployed across the banks to this issue and real engagement on resolution options should now be further enhanced.  In that context, I welcome the recent statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland at a conference on distressed property markets that, having ensured that the banks are much better staffed and organised.for dealing with arrears, it will be setting out its quantitative expectations for their effectiveness in achieving lasting solutions.</p><p> The Central Bank is focusing in 2013 on the implementation of MARS by lenders and is specifically looking at their operational capability in this regard.  Deputies will be aware that the Central Bank compiles and publishes data on mortgage arrears, repossessions and mortgage restructures on a quarterly basis.  The Central Bank commenced the publication of such data for the quarter ending September 2009 in respect of principal dwelling mortgages and from September 2012 also in respect of buy-to-let mortgages.  In addition, it now publishes pre-arrears data.  This data is available on the Central Bank website.</p><p> The Government is committed to building on the progress made and to further intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem and in that context is proceeding on the basis of the recommendations of the Keane report.  However, banks and other lenders also have a very significant obligation and responsibility to address mortgage holders experiencing genuine mortgage arrears.  Indeed, given that lenders extended the credit in the first instance, they can be regarded as having the primary responsibility for addressing the debt problems now facing their customers and for resolving the position in a sustainable way for those customers experiencing genuine difficulty.  Following the progress achieved so far in other areas, this will be the key focus of our attention.</p><p> Many Deputies raised the issue of social housing.  The Government's housing policy statement published in June 2011 identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  The Government is determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  This means meeting the needs of the greatest amount of people in the most cost-efficient manner, which has necessitated a shift away, for the time being, from large-scale local authority capital-funded construction programmes.</p><p> The mistakes of the previous Government are well documented.  One of the consequences of those mistakes has been a reduction in the social housing capital budget from &euro;1.54 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333 million in 2012.  This year's anticipated outturn figure will be in the order of &euro;299 million.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding quicker and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms and utilising a range of actors.  While the private sector is one of those actors, the Government's housing policy statement also recognises non-profit approved housing bodies as a key delivery agent in the coming years.</p><p> In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative outturn of approximately 4,000 housing units was achieved in 2012, which compares well with the figures provided in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013, which is an increase of 25%.  The limited funds available to the Government for social housing must be stretched to meet a wide variety of needs, including those of the elderly, the homeless and people with special needs.</p><p> While I would like to speak in detail about a number of issues, time does not permit me to do so.  The 5,000 plus units of social housing to be provided in 2013 are broken down as follows: 350 units for people with special housing needs; 150 units specifically for people leaving institutional care; an additional 400 permanent homes delivered through capital expenditure under the social housing investment programme; 300 transfers under the mortgage-to-rent scheme and approximately 4,000 units which will be delivered under social leasing, including property transfers from NAMA, the rental accommodation scheme and mortgage-to-lease scheme.</p><p> The Government has also been in discussions with NAMA in regard to 2,000 units of accommodation which it is anxious to acquire for the social housing market as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900052#AAA00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I also welcome the Government amendment to it.</p><p><br />  This Government inherited a severe mortgage crisis.  Too often, discussions on the mortgage crisis are dominated by facts and figures when in reality they should focus on the social problems it is causing, the untold sleepless nights and the children who will grow up listening to an ongoing battles in their homes because of the unsustainable mortgage debt and insurmountable financial difficulties placed on their families.</p><p><br />  There has been some good news on the economic front in recent weeks, including the deal on the promissory note and the recent announcement of the sale of Irish Life.  Buoyed by this good news, it is now necessary that our full focus is brought to bear on the problem of unsustainable mortgage debt.  A failure to tackle this problem will allow this tsunami of misery to continue in homes all across Ireland.</p><p><br />  We have all dealt with cases involving families faced with impossible debt who are paying a huge emotional price in terms of their daily living.  I have come across a case of a man on disability benefit who lives in a house built on his parents farm, which is unsaleable as it is of little use to anyone else, in respect of which he continues to be pursued by the banks for an astronomical sum.  Despite repeated attempts, the bank has failed abysmally to open any line of communication, in terms of a write-down, with this man, causing huge upset and worry for him and his elderly parents.</p><p><br />  There is much talk of moral hazard.  Many people who never took out large mortgages will find the prospect of a write-down difficult to comprehend.  However, what must be communicated is the extremely high social price that is being paid daily for the alternative.  No solution will be a one-size fits all panacea but some solution has to be arrived at.  Many aspects of the October 2011 report of the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group have been implemented, including the personal insolvency legislation and the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  I look forward to the Central Bank's report on its expectations in terms of the banks achieving lasting solutions with mortgage customers in arrears.</p><p><br />  Currently, our small towns and villages are being strangled by the lack of spending power of ordinary families.  These ordinary families do not have any money to spend because all of their income is being taken by the banks as they try desperately to keep a roof over their heads.  Until ordinary families begin to spend modest amounts of their hard-earned money in their local economy, the downward spiral will continue.  Alternatively, if these people had their unsustainable mortgage debt dealt with, they could begin to live again, to make simple everyday purchases within their reach and to provide the economic lifeblood that our local towns, such as Tuam and Loughrea in my own constituency, require so urgently.  Achieving this will require a sea-change in the banks.  As legislators, we have the power to institute such change.  It has to happen because the alternative will consign generations to the economic scrap heap.</p><p><br />  The Irish people bailed out the banks yet there appears to be little or no recognition of this in the prevailing culture in the banks as they attempt to squeeze every cent out of hard pressed families.  It is crucial that proper monitoring be put in place to ensure that the banks<b></b>do<b></b>not, as they have done in the past, employ sleight-of-hand to sidestep measures designed to force them to engage with householders whose debt is unsustainable.</p><p><br />  Another issue of great importance in relation to the motion before us tonight is social housing.  Every week, in towns such as Portumna, Headford and Tuam, I encounter people who are experiencing huge difficulty in securing social housing.  These people have been on the housing list for many years.  It is not unusual to encounter people who have been on the waiting list in County Galway for five to seven years while all around them there are half-finished housing estates, the houses in which would make lovely family homes but are lying abandoned and unfinished.  NAMA needs to work more closely with councils such as Galway County Council with a view to providing a much-needed boost, in terms of numbers and quality, to the county's housing stock.</p><p><br />  The work of NAMA needs to be more focused on providing a social dividend as well as an economic dividend.  I believe that if NAMA works more closely with local authorities in future, the authorities will be able to house people quicker, thus reducing the prevalence of people living for many years in temporary accommodation instead of permanent homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1048" speakername="Arthur Spring" time="21:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900053#BBB00100"><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.  This is serious politics and it is about time we had a proper discussion about the matter.  More importantly, it is time we had some ideas and solutions as to how to rectify the problem.  It is the biggest problem facing my generation.  We have been knee-deep in the mortgage crisis for almost five years and the toll of the crisis has reverberated throughout all sections of Irish society.  One in four mortgage holders has been identified as incapable of repaying mortgage debt and 86,146 private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses were identified as being in arrears for more than 90 days.  I often think of the other three in four who are making payments on their mortgages and the physical, mental and emotional problems they must encounter monthly, weekly and daily and how their family lives must suffer under this financial stress.</p><p>  We are now all aware of the long reaching implications the mortgage crisis has had through our work as politicians, through our friends and family members, through the media and for many of us personally.  Coming from that generation, I meet it at my clinic and throughout the country because as a former banker people come to me looking for solutions.  It is not easy but it must be resolved.  Otherwise we will become known as generation jinxed.</p><p>  Many people who set out on their course in life went travelling, learned a trade, went straight to work to earn money or went to college to gain skills and knowledge.  People did what they could to find the right type of employment for themselves, which would later help them afford a home and a family.  They followed along the natural path of life of finding a partner, buying a home, having children or some version of these events in some order.  For many people in a certain generation the carpet was pulled from under them overnight, and they have been struggling ever since.  I belong to this group as do many of my colleagues.  Normally when I look down to the Front Bench I am very happy to see people with grey hair who are slightly older than me.  I am on the record as welcoming their political experience and their ability to stay calm in the eye of the storm during a time of crisis.  However, those of us in the younger generation need to identify what is critical to us and need to put pressure on the Front Bench to ensure it is dealt with so we do not lose sight of what we are trying to gain as a society.</p><p>  The Government's announcement on the Personal Insolvency Act and AIB's announcement today that it is willing to offer debt deals for the 33,000 homeowners who are in arrears are encouraging.  While announcements such as these are a bit late in the grand scheme of things I see them as a pro-active approach to the mounting and growing crisis of which we have all been aware since 2008.  Those of us clued into economics realised this would happen a long time before then.  It is time for the other banks to stop playing catch-up on the mortgage crisis and tackle the issue.  We need to have certainty for the family home.  We are trying to protect people, families and young children.  Ireland has always put a great value on the idea of owning one's own home, and whether through social housing or personal ownership one does not want to have a stressful situation.  This is a fundamental Irish principle which all political parties share.</p><p>  An examination of the banking crisis is essential to regain the confidence of those we have lost through the actions of a previous Government and the failings of institutions which cannot function on their own.  The people of the country need to hear the truth.   President Michael D. Higgins, my former colleague and a good friend of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, stated at the Sorbonne during the week we should not be considered as consumers of commodities but rather as social beings, and that we should use economics to this effect.  We must achieve this through legislation, pressure and the banks coming up with a solution.</p><p>  I propose a framework for people to approach banks.  If one in four mortgage holders is in arrears how many people are pushed to the pin of their collar just to make payments?  I believe many people pay 70% or 80% of their net income towards keeping a roof over their head and preventing bankruptcy.  We need a meaningful and structured write-down of debt much along the lines of what we achieved on the promissory note.  This is where I differ with Sinn F&eacute;in, but if we were to be objective we would come to the same solution.  The debts should be separated and those which are affordable should be dealt with by the debtor and the other debts should be put onto the State.  We should catch this can and kick it so far down the road that it becomes irrelevant to us as a nation.  This would mean asking the European Central Bank to take some responsibility for its culpability and telling every citizen in the country we are in this together.  Older generations complain their children are hamstrung financially and they are helping them out.  The ultimate way to sort this out is not through wealthy parents helping out less fortunate children or any other social scenario one can think of.  It is important to act as a society.  We should bring the debts together and look at packaging them and using the ESM, if this is the mechanism to be used.  Earlier Deputy Doherty referred to the Personal Insolvency Act not giving people the capacity to go back to the banks.  I do not believe this is necessary.  To complete the circle, it is up to AIB, Bank of Ireland and other State-guaranteed banks to get back up on their own two feet.  I would like to see them remain nationalised through the ESM and held onto by the State until they become extremely profitable and then used as an asset to pay down some of our debt or provide services to people.</p><p>  Anybody seriously considering buying a State-owned asset such as a stakeholding in a bank will do due diligence.  If mortgage holders are in arrears or impaired nobody will be interested in purchasing the banks.  The banks know they must clean up their act and carry out securitisation of loans whereby the best are picked and sold and one gets money from it.  This would be to the benefit of the State and would decrease our debts and provide us with funding.</p><p>  I have raised this issue for a long time.  I propose there should be a moratorium on banks taking profits on a generation which was mis-sold loans on property prices which had no connection with reality.  My parent's generation received mortgages of two and a half times one's income for 15 or 20 years.  My generation received mortgages of up to ten times one's income for up to 40 years.  In many cases two incomes were going into a house.  The hyperextension of credit is largely responsible for this.  Bad governance, stewardship and regulation also played a part but it is not really about blame any more; it is about trying to resolve it.  Those who are culpable need to take some of the pain.</p><p>  Integration is key.  The irony is that the Irish banks are less capable of dealing with this than the non-Irish banks.  The Irish banks are owned by us as a State, so every time we write off debt for somebody we will place it on that person's neighbour and the rest of us.  I am okay with this but I would also like to see the bondholders and the European Central Bank play a role.  It will not be simple.  It will be complex but people should stick with us and we hope to resolve this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="21:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900053#BBB00200"><p>There is no doubt mortgage distress and the lack of social housing are some of the most pressing issues facing the State today.  One could argue the debate on renegotiating the Croke Park agreement also revolves around these issues.  Many front-line workers were afforded mortgages on the basis of their pay and allowances.  We hope their pay will not be disproportionately affected by any proposals emanating from the Government.  Many of these people are no longer able to afford the mortgages they have, but they do not hear any real solutions from the Government.</p><p>They do hear about the continuation of the property tax, further cuts to the children's allowance, prolonged delays in allocating medical cards and education grants, and they face water charges that have still not been made fit for practice.  Prior to the election, the public had been assured of a softer, easier way with the immediate overhauling of the promissory note deal and retrospective capitalisation of our banks.</p><p> It was said that the Government's choices and decisions would be more progressive, yet they have been regressive.  While the promissory note deal, as Eamon Dunphy might say, could be described as a good deal but not a great deal, it affords an opportunity and a new start, as well as the potential for some social dividend.  Even at this late stage, it could start by addressing concrete issues which in turn address the mortgage crisis, rather than having more rhetoric, Cabinet sub-committees or talk of special focus.  To date, we have seen no definitive action in the area of split mortgage schemes but we have seen the decimation of mortgage interest relief.</p><p> The Personal Insovlency Act provides that financial institutions may exercise a veto in terms of resolutions.  Whether devised in conjunction with and negotiated by an independent assessment, the veto still remains and is retained by the bank.  </p><p> Last week, I tabled a question to the Minister concerning the failure to adequately promote or implement the mortgage-to-let scheme.  Taking both residential and buy-to-let mortgages as of September last year, 167,000 mortgage accounts were in arrears out of a total of 911,000.  A further 51,000 have been restructured, so 23% of all mortgages are not being paid in accordance with their original terms.  This is both a social and economic crisis.</p><p> The data show how little progress has been made in dealing with the mortgage crisis.  The Personal Insolvency Bill is untested and it is difficult to predict whether or not it will be of benefit to homeowners, given the veto the banks have over any proposed settlement.</p><p> The fact that 20,000 residential mortgages are in arrears of over two years is a shocking indictment of the Government's response to date.  There appears to be little or no prospect of these mortgages ever being repaid in line with their original terms.</p><p> Despite last week's news on the promissory note, the banks are still reliant on the State for funding and will not get outside investors to invest unless the mortgage crisis begins to resolve itself.  At that point, the recapitalised banks may be able to lend with relatively clean balance sheets, and the issues around credit for businesses and households may resolve themselves.</p><p> The buy-to-let sector represents a time-bomb for the economy.  Some 17.9% of buy-to-let accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days at the end of September 2012.</p><p> As regards the mortgage-to-rent scheme and in response to the question I put to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan last week, eight months on from the launch of the scheme, just eight homes have gone through the mortgage-to-rent scheme service.  Only two of those transactions have been completed so far and this is from an initial 708 applications.  The ongoing failure of the scheme exposes the Government's complete inadequacy in tackling the mortgage crisis.  The scheme has even been the subject of judicial criticism for giving false hope to struggling homeowners.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, said the scheme would help more than 100 families in 2012 and could eventually be geared up to help several thousand.  She and her officials emphasised the humane aspect of the scheme in that families do not have to leave their homes.  However, the prediction of 100 families being helped in 2012 is in tatters, as is the claim that the scheme could be geared up to help several thousand.   The Government needs to answer questions on the failure of the scheme, as well as providing reasons for what has happened. </p><p> Of the 708 applications, some 300 were ruled out immediately.  I understand that a three-month period must elapse before any such deal can emanate.  In addition, it has succeeded in only two cases since last June.  As I said earlier, there are no specifics regarding split mortgages, the veto remains with banks, and mortgage interest relief has been decimated.  That does not bode well for dealing with this crisis.</p><p> By virtue of the social dividend that is supposed to emanate from last week's deal, can we expect progress in this matter in future?  The Government has cut spending on social housing by 19% to &euro;585 million, thus leaving local authorities' housing sectors desperately underfunded.  This has resulted in close to 100,000 households on waiting lists for local authority housing across the State.</p><p> Meanwhile, NAMA has advised that it has identified roughly 3,900 residential properties controlled by its debtors and receivers as being available for social housing provision.  To date, demand has been confirmed by local authorities for over 1,500 of the properties that NAMA has made available.  Another 800 properties are being evaluated, bringing the overall total that may be deemed suitable to slightly over 2,300.</p><p> NAMA is mandated to provide a social dividend, yet only 203 units have so far been provided for housing.  This is despite the fact that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, spoke about 2,000 homes being provided in 2012 for people on social housing waiting lists.  Let us be generous and say that 50% or 100 units have been provided, allied with the two cases mentioned in the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  That is the sort of success that has been achieved in this area. </p><p> Where are the 1,800 plus houses that have been promised by the Government from NAMA's property portfolio but which have yet to be delivered?  NAMA has made the properties available, local authorities have identified them but the Government has not acted.</p><p> The Government has failed to confront the immense scale of the mortgage crisis facing the country.  Promissory note deals will mean nothing to ordinary home owners if the financially devastating impact of the mortgage arrears crisis is allowed to rage on.  The disaster of the mortgage-to-let scheme exposes the ineffectual response of the Government to date.</p><p> While social housing waiting lists have ossified with the failure to utilise NAMA properties, it is now time for the Government - even at this late stage - to get to grips with what is a spiralling crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="22:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900055#DDD00100"><p>The experience of losing one's home must be added to those most stressful experiences in a person's life.  I acknowledge the Government inherited a severe mortgage arrears crisis and that its amendment outlines the steps taken to address it, including the mortgage-to-rent scheme, the Personal Insolvency Act and the engagement by banks in mortgage advice.  However, the point is that if all these measures were working, people and society would be seeing the benefits and one would be able to discern a decrease both in the number of mortgage holders in distress and in those at risk of distress.  Instead however, we are seeing the severe impact of the mortgage debt crisis.  At the end of 2010, statistics indicated that one in ten residential mortgages were in trouble.  A few months later the figure was one in nine mortgages, then one in eight and this evening's Sinn F&eacute;in motion states the figure is one in four.  Consequently, it is obvious that the measures are not sufficient.  Moreover, one week ago Professor Honohan stated, "I fully agree that not enough has been achieved on the mortgage arrears".  He was expressing his frustration, and that of the Central Bank, that the performance of the banks is not good enough.  He spoke of the dilemma that were the Central Bank to issue a directive to the banks, it would give the latter an out and they could then absolve themselves of all responsibility.  However, responsibility does lie with the individual banks which gave the mortgages.</p><p>  I accept the responsibility on the individuals who took out such big mortgages for their dream homes or for the purpose of starting a property portfolio.  However, the banks and lenders also have a responsibility for facilitating and encouraging such borrowing by giving 100% mortgages, not insisting on deposits and sometimes giving top-ups for furniture and extensions.  As for the responsibility of those in marketing, advertising and auctioneering, they all played a part in creating that property bubble with the extortionate prices being paid between 2001 and 2007.  At the time, prices such as &euro;250,000 and more were paid for houses and apartments that people knew were worth, at most, one quarter or one half of those amounts.  The really unlucky ones are those who bought in the period between 2001 and 2007.  They are suffering and this suffering is compounded by the additional taxes.</p><p>  Repossession is not the answer because that will lead to further speculation in property, another property bubble and more rogue landlords and speculators and my constituency of Dublin Central certainly has enough of those.  Repossession also puts additional pressure on the local authorities and Dublin City Council, for one, does not have sufficient housing stock.  In addition, there would be further fuelling of the private rented sector.  I was struck by one newspaper headline today, which stated that AIB was to engage with customers in mortgage arrears.  I thought this would be something that would happen quickly but when I read the article more closely, I did not get any sense of immediacy.  While I acknowledge this debate is on mortgage arrears, I wish to make one further point before concluding.  In listening to and reading the comments from, for example, the 24/7 Frontline Alliance, one factor to emerge regarding the cuts to people's salaries pertained to their inability to get a mortgage with consequential effects on their wish to start families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="22:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900055#DDD00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the mortgage and social housing crises.  The Technical Group raised the mortgage crisis in the D&aacute;il in 2011 during Private Members' time, at which time there was a crisis in respect of mortgages.  However, almost two years later, we remain in crisis and that crisis is only deepening to the point where at present, one mortgage in four is in arrears of 90 days or more.  This is the biggest crisis facing the country.  It is a crisis that is holding back the domestic economy and has taken spending out of it.  Moreover, it ensures that no growth can be achieved and that people have no confidence and are completely unable to spend because they are lumbered with such massive mortgage debt and mortgage arrears and their sole purpose is to try to keep a roof over their heads.  It has gone beyond time that the banks are obliged to deal with this issue.  They must do so by providing write-downs and this is essential.  It is the only way we will emerge from this crisis.  It is clear the steps the Government has taken thus far are not working and will not work because there is a lack of engagement with the banks in dealing with people in a way that will allow them to manage their debts and to continue living, working and spending in the economy.  Unless the Government does this, the country will be faced with another recapitalisation of the banks this year in order that they can deal with the losses they will be obliged to take into account on their balance sheets.  Is this what will be done?</p><p>  Everyone claims there is a moral hazard involved in the question of how one deals with people in mortgage arrears but the bigger moral hazard is to allow the situation to continue.  The banks have been let off scot-free by bailing them out.  There is no moral hazard for bankers or bondholders in this society but yet there is a moral hazard for those who simply wanted to provide a home for themselves and their families.  It has gone beyond the time at which this matter must be dealt with.  Write-downs must be provided to make sure that people can manage their debts and to encourage spending back into the economy again.  Allied to this crisis is another in social housing, whereby the Government has completely privatised the provision of social housing across the State.  A social housing capital fund must be put back on track to enable local authorities to provide housing for those who need it, that is, for those who, through circumstances beyond their control, will never be able to gain access to mortgages and provide for their own needs.  The Government must address these two issues and must so do as a matter of urgency.  It must force the banks to deal with this in the only way it can be dealt with, namely, by providing write-downs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="22:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900056#EEE00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p><br />  I am pleased to bring the Bill to the House at a time we can be optimistic.  Ireland is continuing to recover from the most severe downturn in the history of the State, caused by crises in both the public finances and the banking system.  The approach the Government has taken to engineer that recovery has had three overarching principles, namely, returning stability to the public finances, repairing the banking system and restoring sustainable growth to the economy.  The Government is on track to bring the deficit under 3% of GDP by 2015; the banks are returning to more normalised operations and have accessed borrowing markets, and the economy is expected to record the third straight year of growth in 2013.  Progress is real and tangible but much remains to be achieved.</p><p><br />  The most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show that in the first three quarters of 2012 GDP increased by 0.8% compared with the same period a year earlier.  Growth continues to be driven by exports which increased by 3.2% in the same period, reflecting improvements in competitiveness and Ireland's enduring attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment.  Our progress is reflected in investors' confidence in our ability to successfully tackle our economic and budgetary problems.  For example, the yield on 2020 Government bonds has fallen from approximately 15% in July 2011 to 3.6% today.</p><p><br />  On the fiscal side, the public finances have stabilised and the budget deficit is declining.  The general Government deficit for 2012 is currently estimated to have been under 8% of GDP, down from an underlying deficit of 9.1% of GDP the previous year.  This year the deficit will be reduced further to 7.5% of GDP, in line with commitments under the EU-IMF programme.</p><p><br />  On the financial side, we have consigned the promissory notes and the annual payment of &#8364;3.1 billion every March to history.  We have also removed the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society from the banking landscape.  This success in dealing with legacy issues has been complemented by positive developments in terms of the sale of &#8364;1 billion of Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes and today's sale of Irish Life to Great-West Lifeco for &#8364;1.3 billion plus a &#8364;40 million dividend.  These developments illustrate that there is value to the State's holdings in the banks and that the Government will sell these assets when the price and time is right for the taxpayer.</p><p><br />  With regard to the Bill, the Government considers unemployment to be its biggest challenge.  While job creation in the exporting sector is encouraging, it is domestic growth which will help us to make real progress in tackling this issue.  That is why the Bill contains a package of measures designed to support small and medium enterprises.  The Bill begins to implement the ten point tax reform plan announced in the budget.  The plan includes measures such as reforming the three year corporation tax relief for start-up companies, increasing the cash receipts basis threshold for VAT, amending the close company surcharge to improve cash flow for SMEs and extending the foreign earnings deduction for work-related travel to certain additional countries.  Another measure which will be important for this sector is the amendment of the &quot;key employee&quot; provision of the research and development tax credit regime by reducing from 75% to 50% the proportion of time that such an employee must spend solely on research and development activities to qualify for the credit.  In addition, as outlined in my Budget Statement, I will extend the employment and investment incentive and the seed capital scheme for a further seven years.  I have also decided to allow for investments in hotels, guesthouses and certain other self-catering accommodation to qualify for these incentives.</p><p><br />  The introduction of the new JobsPlus scheme later this year will provide grants for employers to encourage them to employ individuals who have been on the live register for greater than 12 months.  My Department has been working closely with officials of other Departments on the design of this initiative.  It will provide a single, easy to understand, focused incentive in this area to replace a number of schemes.  In recognition of this, the Bill provides for the closure of the Revenue job assist scheme, to be co-ordinated with the launch of the successor scheme to which I referred I announced the budget.  The details of this will be announced in the coming days.</p><p> A provision that establishes a scheme for accelerated capital allowances in respect of the construction of hangars and ancillary airport facilities is included in this legislation.  There is scope to place Ireland firmly on the map as a centre of excellence for the aviation industry, with all that may then ensue in terms of job creation.  To support our thriving agrifood sector and build on the supports for this sector announced last year, the Bill provides for a capital gains tax relief to be available where the proceeds of a sale of farm land for farm restructuring purposes are reinvested for the same purpose.</p><p><br />  The legislation also provides for pre-retirement access to funded additional voluntary contributions, AVCs.  Individuals will be allowed a once-off option to withdraw up to 30% of the value of funded AVCs made to supplement retirement benefits.  This is a restricted measure which will enable rather than incentivise certain individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.</p><p><br />  As announced in the Budget Statement, the Bill will provide a new tax regime to allow for the introduction of real estate investment trust, REIT, companies in Ireland.  It is hoped they will facilitate the attraction of foreign investment capital to the Irish property market.</p><p><br />  The Bill contains a number of measures which demonstrate Ireland's positive reputation in international tax matters.  As I noted in my Budget Statement, Ireland is one of the first countries in the world to conclude a new type of agreement with the United States to improve international tax compliance.</p><p><br />  I will describe the main provisions contained in the Bill.  Part 1 deals with the income levy, universal social charge, USC, and income, corporation and capital gains taxes.</p><p><br />  Section 1 is an interpretation section.  Section 2 makes provision for a USC charge, in specific circumstances, in cases where a balancing charge arises.  It also exempts from USC amounts paid under pre-retirement access to AVCs.  Section 3 provides for the changes to the USC announced in budget 2013 which applies the standard rates of USC to those aged 70 years and over, as well as to medical card holders - both PAYE and self-employed income earners - who have income in excess of &#8364;60,000 per annum.  Section 4 provides for the extension of certain revenue administration powers in relation to the collection of income tax to the collection of USC, while section 5 relates to the &quot;key employee&quot; provision of the research and development tax credit, the threshold for which will be reduced to 50%.</p><p><br />  Sections 6 and 43 amend sections 71 and 29, respectively, of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, TCA.  These amendments counter potential avoidance mechanisms in relation to non-domiciled individuals.  Section 7 provides for the closure of the Revenue job assist scheme, in line with the launch of the new JobsPlus scheme.</p><p><br />  Section 8 gives effect to the budget day announcement that maternity benefit payments will be treated as taxable income with effect from 1 July 2013.  As is the case with all social welfare payments, maternity benefit payments will continue to be exempt from USC.  In addition and to ensure a fair and consistent approach, this section also provides that adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit payments will be treated as taxable income with effect from 1 July 2013.  The section also provides for the making of regulations for the efficient collection and recovery of any income tax due on the benefits.</p><p><br />  Section 9 provides for an extension of the foreign earnings deduction for work-related travel to a number of African countries which have been identified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as having great potential for Irish agrifood exports.</p><p><br />  The disregard for tax relief for third level fees is increased in section 10 in line with the scheduled increases in the student contribution announced by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p><br />  Section 11 introduces legislation that will counter avoidance schemes, whereby employers utilise employee benefit trusts to provide loans or loans of assets for employees.  Such schemes can involve the non-repayment of such loans, thereby leading to a gain for the employee, which is not subject to tax.</p><p><br />  Section 12 makes a number of changes in respect of benefit-in-kind, BIK, legislation.  In particular, it confirms that when a benefit is provided by any public body for an office holder or employee, whether employed directly by that body, a BIK charge applies.  The budget change in the specified rates applicable to preferential loans is also confirmed, while a number of minor technical amendments will be made.</p><p><br />  Section 13 deals with various issues relating to <i>ex gratia</i> payments, including the abolition of top slicing relief, which I announced on budget day.  In addition, the section provides for the extension of the maximum lifetime limit of &#8364;200,000 that may be paid tax free to all termination or <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  The section provides for the abolition of foreign service relief in respect of gratuity payments made on retirement or removal from office.</p><p><br />  Section 14 provides for an amendment to the definition of &quot;relievable amount&quot; which will provide that the standard rate tax relief at source on a health insurance premium will be net of any &quot;risk equalisation credit&quot; under the new permanent health insurance risk equalisation scheme introduced by the Minister for Health in late 2012.</p><p> Section 15 makes changes to the basis of assessment for rental income or profits sourced from outside the State.  The changes in effect mean that losses from foreign rental income cannot be offset against other foreign income such as income from foreign trades, pensions or dividend income.  The long-standing Revenue practice of allowing foreign rental losses to be offset against foreign rental profits will continue.</p><p><br /> Section 16 provides for pre-retirement access to funded additional voluntary contributions, to which I referred earlier.  The section also amends certain requirements relating to the extension of the approved retirement fund option to all defined contribution pension arrangements provided for in the Finance Act 2011 by temporarily rescinding the increases set out in the Act in the specified income requirement for the approved retirement fund option and in the maximum set-aside amount for the purpose of an approved minimum retirement fund.</p><p><br /> Section 17 introduces two new provisions which apply to individuals who are engaged in the trade of dealing in or developing land.  The first relates to restrictions on the use of certain losses by individuals who are not actively engaged in a trade of dealing in or developing land until these losses have actually been realised.  Also, provision is being made to ensure that where loans are taken out to acquire land by individuals engaged actively or otherwise in a trade of dealing in or developing land and these loans are subsequently released or forgiven, the amount forgiven is treated as a receipt of income.</p><p><br /> Section 18 provides for the changes to the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies that I announced in the budget.</p><p><br /> Section 19 relates to stock relief.  The Finance Bill extends the general 25% rate and the 100% young trained farmer rate of stock relief to 31 December 2015.  The Bill also extends the definition of registered farm partnerships for the purposes of the enhanced 50% stock relief - 100% for certain young trained farmers - to other registered farm partnerships such as beef or sheep farm partnerships.  Both the 50% and 100% rate of reliefs are subject to State aid clearance from the European Commission.  As part of this process, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had to give assurances that certain conditions would be adhered to in relation to the 100% young trained farmer rate.  The Bill makes provision for these conditions.</p><p><br /> Section 20 relates to film relief.  Following a review of the relief by my Department, film relief will no longer be available to investors in qualifying films.  Instead, a payable tax credit will be paid directly to a producer company.  I am setting the rate of the tax credit at 32%, which is a substantial saving to the taxpayer since relief is currently given to investors at a rate of 41%.</p><p><br /> The extension and change to the employment and investment incentive and seed capital scheme, to which I referred earlier, are provided for in section 21.</p><p><br /> Section 22 increases deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, by three percentage points, with effect from 1 January 2013, as announced in budget 2013.</p><p><br /> Section 23 modifies the definition of an &quot;investment certificate&quot; to facilitate the issuing of Islamic bonds.</p><p><br /> Section 24 reduces the tax credit available for donations of heritage property to the State from 80% of the market value of the property to 50%.  The section also makes a number of other changes to permit the donation of ancillary buildings and land along with heritage properties, which may be necessary for the provision of access or parking facilities for tourists.</p><p><br /> Section 25 provides for the offset of unutilised foreign tax credits against universal social charge liabilities.  It also provides for an additional tax credit in respect of foreign tax paid on certain dividends from EU or EEA treaty partner countries, by reference to the nominal rate of tax in the payer's jurisdiction.  This latter change is being made on foot of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p><p><br /> Section 26 makes two technical amendments to update definitions in the Taxes Consolidation Act, section 79C.</p><p><br /> Section 27 increases the amount of group expenditure on research and development activities excluded from the incremental basis of calculation from &#8364;100,000 to &#8364;200,000.</p><p><br /> Section 28 makes a technical amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act, section 246, and provides an exemption from withholding tax on interest payments to approved pension schemes.</p><p><br /> Section 29 relates to the living cities initiative.  I announced in my budget speech that proposals for targeted tax incentives in already identified regeneration areas would be examined.  As this is a pilot scheme, it will be confined to certain designated areas for the time being.  Due to the requirement to obtain EU state aid approval, this provision will be subject to a commencement order.</p><p><br /> Amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act are made in section 30 to establish an accelerated capital allowances scheme pertaining to the aviation sector, as I outlined.</p><p><br /> Section 31 contains the enabling legislation to allow for the implementation of an International Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the United States of America to Improve Tax Compliance and Provide for Reporting and Exchange of Information concerning Tax Matters which was signed at the end of 2012.</p><p><br /> Section 32 amends the close company surcharge rules and increases the <i>de minimis</i>amount of undistributed investment and rental income which may be retained by a close company without giving rise to a surcharge from &#8364;635 to &#8364;2,000.  The same increase will apply in respect of the surcharge on undistributed trading or professional income of certain service companies.</p><p><br /> Section 33 extends the three year corporation tax exemption for start-up companies and allows that any unused relief arising in the first three years of trading, due to insufficiency of profits, may be carried forward for use in subsequent years.  This is subject to the maximum amount of relief in any one year not exceeding the eligible amount of employers' PRSI in the year in question.</p><p><br /> Section 34 introduces an amendment to reduce from ten years to five years the period in which a specified intangible asset must be used in the trade to avoid a clawback of allowances. </p><p><br /> Section 35 updates the list of specified non-commercial State sponsored bodies that qualify for exemption from income tax and corporation tax.  The section also introduces a clarification that grants or subsidies paid under the wage subsidy scheme, as administered by the Department of Social Protection, are exempt from income tax and corporation tax.</p><p><br /> Section 36 reinstates a technical provision to ensure the appropriate amount of trading losses is brought forward when making a claim for value basis relief.</p><p><br /> Section 37 clarifies certain conditions necessary to qualify for group relief for corporation tax losses.</p><p><br /> Section 38 increases the rates of tax applying to life assurance policies and investment funds by three percentage points with effect from 1 January 2013.</p><p><br /> Section 39 provides for the introduction of a tax regime for real estate investment trust, REIT, companies in the Taxes Consolidation Act.  I referred to this earlier.  Subject to meeting a number of criteria, including a requirement to distribute 85% of its property income by way of property income dividend, the regime provides a tax exemption in respect of the income and chargeable gains of a property rental business.  The section also provides that property income dividends paid by the REIT will be subject to dividend withholding tax and will be taxable in the hands of the shareholders.</p><p><br /> Section 40 restores the tax transparency treatment of investment limited partnerships, ILPs, established under the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994.  It does so by inserting a new section 739J in to the Taxes Consolidation Act.  The section also updates certain other provisions of the Act to refer to the new section 739J.</p><p><br /> Section 41 provides for the capital gains tax rate increase from 30% to 33%, as announced on budget day.  Section 42 replaces references to &quot;Irish currency&quot; in certain provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with the term &quot;the currency of the State&quot;.  Section 43, as described with section 6, is an amendment to counter potential avoidance mechanisms.</p><p>Section 44 amends the provisions relating to the tax treatment of certain profits, known as &quot;carried interest&quot;, received by venture fund managers, the purpose of which treatment is to attract venture capital investment into this country.</p><p><br /> Section 45 relates to changes in capital gains tax, CGT, relief introduced in last year's Finance Act for individuals who dispose of agricultural assets to their children and certain other individuals.  The amendments ensure that relief will apply to such disposals by individuals aged 66 years or over on or after 1 January 2014 where the consideration for the disposal is &#8364;3 million or less.  In addition, it provides for the aggregation of the consideration for disposals made on or after 1 January 2014 by such individuals for the purposes of the &#8364;3 million lifetime limit introduced in last year's Act.</p><p><br /> Section 46 provides for the relief from CGT for farm restructuring that was announced in the budget.  The relief will apply to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.  The commencement of the relief is subject to receipt of EU state aid approval.</p><p><br /> Part 2 deals with excise.  Section 47 gives effect to the increase in the rates of tobacco products tax, which, when VAT is included, amounts to 10 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i>increases on other tobacco products.  The section also provides for a further increase of 50 cent per packet of roll-your-own tobacco.</p><p><br /> Section 48 makes some technical amendments to the mineral oil tax provisions of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 1999.  Section 49 introduces a new section in mineral oil tax law to provide for a partial relief - by way of repayment - for auto diesel used in the course of business by qualifying road haulage and bus operators.  I had announced that this would apply to tax compliant licensed hauliers but, following consideration, I have decided to extend this relief to tax compliant licensed passenger transport operators.</p><p><br /> Section 50 amends general provisions of excise law, including provisions to ensure that repayment of overpaid excise duty does not result in unjust enrichment.  Section 51 defines terms used in the provisions of general excise law, while sections 52 and 53 amend provisions of general excise law for the powers of Revenue officers for excise purposes as well as the delegation of powers, functions and duties.  Section 54 provides for the indictable offence of illicit production of tobacco products, as well as an offence of the selling or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.</p><p><br /> Section 55 amends the betting duty provisions by clarifying the provisions in respect of relief from betting duty for so-called laid off bets.  This involves the deletion of existing provisions and the inclusion of a relief provision in line with other excises, and it also provides for the necessary amendments, subject to commencement, when the provisions with regard to remote betting contained in the Finance Act 2011 are commenced.</p><p><br /> Section 56 gives effect to the increase in the excise rates of alcohol products tax, which VAT inclusive amounts to 10 cent on a pint of beer or cider and a standard measure of spirits and &#8364;1 on a standard bottle of wine.</p><p><br /> Sections 57 and 58 provide for a relief from electricity tax and natural gas carbon tax in respect of electricity and natural gas intended for use in the context of diplomatic relations in the State, in accordance with EU law.  Section 59 provides for a number of amendments in preparation for the commencement of solid fuel carbon tax with effect from 1 May 2013, as I announced in the budget.  This section also provides for a relief from solid fuel carbon tax in respect of solid fuel intended for use in the context of diplomatic relations in the State, in accordance with EU law.</p><p><br /> Section 60 amends a number of definitions for vehicle registration tax, VRT, purposes.  Section 61 gives effect to the revised system of VRT, which was introduced from 1 January 2013.  Section 62 extends the period for the VRT relief for hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles, while sections 63 and 64 are minor technical amendments.</p><p><br /> Part 3 deals with value added tax.  Section 65 is an interpretation section.  Sections 66 and 69 provide that receivers, liquidators or any other persons exercising a power are liable to VAT in respect of services they make on behalf of a defaulter, including obligations under the capital goods scheme and options to tax.  Section 69 also includes the strengthening of a general anti-avoidance measure as regards sales to connected persons.  Section 67 is an anti-avoidance measure with regard to the supply of vouchers supplied to businesses outside the State for resale.  Sections 68 and 73 relate to the entitlement of fund managers to deduct input VAT and bring our law into line with the EU VAT directive.  Section 73 also provides that the services threshold applies to public bodies in respect of supplies made by them of sporting facilities.  Section 70 increases the VAT cash receipts basis threshold from &#8364;1 million to &#8364;1.25 million with effect from 1 May 2013.  This change is part of the ten point tax reform plan for small businesses announced in the budget.</p><p><br /> Section 71 reduces the farmer's flat rate addition from 5.2% to 4.8% with effect from 1 January 2013, as announced in the budget.  The 4.8% rate continues to achieve full compensation for farmers.  Section 72 is a technical change that allows the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations relating to evidence of business controls regarding the issue and receipt of invoices.</p><p><br /> Part 4 deals with stamp duties.  Section 74 is an interpretation section.  Section 75 introduces a number of technical amendments consequential to the stamp duty self-assessment provisions introduced in the Finance Act 2012.  Section 76 inserts three new sections into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, SDCA, and deletes section 36.  It also deletes section 82 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, which contained similar provisions that were never commenced.  These new sections will counteract stamp duty avoidance measures that involve resting in contract, licensing and long lease arrangements.  Section 77 amends section 81AA of the SDCA to extend the relief from stamp duty on transfers of agricultural land, including farm houses and buildings, to young trained farmers until 31 December 2015.</p><p><br /> Section 78 amends sections 88(2) and 90(3) of the SDCA.  It relates to section 40 in respect of amendments to the taxation of investment limited partnerships and updates the SDCA to ensure that an existing exemption from stamp duty on transfers of units in investment limited partnerships will continue to apply.  It provides separately that the exemptions for the transfer of foreign shares and certain financial services instruments will apply in the case of securitisation transactions.</p><p><br /> Section 79 amends section 123B of the SDCA, which provides for the stamp duty charge on cash, combined and debit cards.  This amendment will continue the exemption from stamp duty for a basic payment account on a permanent basis.  Some technical amendments have also been made to the definition of &quot;basic payment account&quot;.</p><p><br /> Section 80 gives effect to the new rates of the health insurance levy for 2013.  The rates for 2012 remain in force until 30 March.  From 31 March, the rates will vary depending on the age of the person insured - over or under 18 years - and the level of cover.</p></speech>

Section 81 is an interpretation section.  Section 82 provides for the CAT changes announced in the budget, bringing the increase in the rate from 30% to 33% and the 10% reduction in the group tax free thresholds.</p><p>Section 83 confirms the position that interest on outstanding discretionary trust tax, DTT, arises from the valuation date of the initial once-off charge to DTT and from the valuation date of the annual charges.</p><p><br /> Section 84 provides that a claim for a repayment of discretionary trust tax must be made within four years of the valuation date or the date of the payment of the tax, where the tax has been paid within four months of the valuation date.  The amendment also provides that a claim for repayment of any payment made on account of tax is also subject to the four-year claim limitation period.</p><p><br /> Section 85 extends an existing exemption from CAT to assurance policies known as capital redemption policies issued by life assurance companies where the disponer and the donee or successor are both non-domiciled and non-resident in the State.  Section 86 relates to section 40 in respect of amendments to the taxation of investment limited partnerships.  It provides that an existing exemption from capital acquisitions tax on certain transfers of units in investment limited partnerships will continue to apply following other legislative changes.  Section 87 extends an inheritance tax exemption on inheritances taken by a child over the age of 21 from an approved retirement fund or from an approved minimum retirement fund to similar inheritances from a vested personal retirement savings account.</p><p><br /> Part 6, the final part of the Bill, covers miscellaneous provisions.  Section 88 is an interpretation provision.  Section 89 makes a number of mainly technical amendments to the new streamlined assessing rules for direct taxes, that is, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax, that were introduced in Part 41A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by the Finance Act 2012.  Changes are also made to clarify the operation of various provisions.  In addition, this section makes technical changes in certain provisions outside of Part 41A.</p><p><br /> Section 90 amends Schedule 13 to the TCA in order to update the list of accountable persons who are obliged to operate professional services withholding tax, PSWT.  The section also clarifies the position regarding the treatment of partnerships for PSWT purposes and a number of minor technical amendments are made.  Section 91 amends sections 1094 and 1095 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This will require an applicant for a tax clearance certificate to be compliant in relation to stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax in addition to the existing taxes currently included in the legislation.</p><p><br /> Section 92 amends sections 879, 880 and 884 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which set out what is to be included in a return of income by an individual, a partnership return and the corporation tax return of a company, respectively.  The amendment is to facilitate the submission of electronic accounts information with those returns via the Revenue online service, ROS.  With regard to the corporation tax return the amendment sets out the financial information which is to be submitted with the return by a non-resident company trading in the State through a branch or agency.  This is also to support the e-filing on ROS of this information by the company.</p><p><br /> Section 93 amends section 960E of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The amendment provides that the Collector General may issue a demand by electronic means to a person who is registered to deliver a return and pay tax under the Revenue online system, ROS, and a person who is required to deliver a return and pay tax via ROS.</p><p><br /> Section 94 amends sections 811, 811A and 817D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which are concerned with general anti-avoidance, protective notifications and mandatory disclosure of certain transactions, respectively.  The main change is to section 811A which is amended to delete subsection (1C) so as to ensure that the same &quot;burden of proof&quot; applies in determining whether a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction, regardless of whether a protective notification has been received.</p><p><br /> Section 95 provides for the deletion of section 886(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Taxes Consolidation Act in order to ensure that this country can continue to meet its international obligations in regard to the exchange of information with other tax administrations.  Section 96 amends sections 826(7) and 912A which relate to the exchange of information under the Joint Council of Europe-OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters as well as the protocol to that convention.</p><p><br /> Section 97 makes a number of amendments relating to tax arising from the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Section 98 provides that Revenue may authorise a suitably-qualified person to inspect any asset in order to establish its value for tax purposes.  Section 99 ensures that persons other than Revenue officers engaged by Revenue to carry out work relating to the administration of any taxes or duties are subject to the same confidentiality requirements as Revenue officers.  It also provides that any person to whom taxpayer information is disclosed in accordance with the section is subject to sanctions if that information is used for any purpose other than that for which it was disclosed.</p><p><br /> Section 100 makes provision for various amendments to the tax code as it applies to civil partnerships.  Section 101 sets out additions to the list of double taxation agreements, DTAs, and tax information exchange agreements, TIEAs, between this country and other jurisdictions.  Finally, section 102 addresses miscellaneous technical amendments in relation to tax, while sections 103,104 and 105 cover standard annual provisions.</p><p><br /> At this stage, there are still a small number of matters under consideration for inclusion in the Finance Bill that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate tonight, tomorrow and Thursday.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it has been an historic day in the Oireachtas but I do not see the reason for a great rush.  While Second Stage is important, Committee Stage is even more important and I hope adequate time will be provided for all of the elements of the Bill to be properly debated.  We have 105 different sections over 172 pages.  The Minister has read a summary of many of the elements into the record, as is normal on Second Stage.  Many of the provisions are technical and must be carefully assessed and monitored.</p><p>  There is a way of improving the process of making decisions such as this every year.  Whoever is in the Minister's chair announces the key elements of the Finance Bill but we never seem to have a tracking mechanism in place to assess the significance of what we did previously.  Last year the Minister announced a range of measures and we must fish out answers by way of parliamentary question or other means of scrutiny to see how effective they were.  One could take, for example, the special assignee relief programme that was introduced last year, which was a tax incentive to attract key executives into this country.  I do not know how successful the measure has been.  When we get to the next Finance Bill we should be able to carry out a simple, straightforward analysis of all of the key measures from the previous year's Bill to see whether they have delivered and what the outputs have been.  I accept we have the annual output statement from each Department - a reform I welcome - but it would enhance the decision-making process and make what we are doing this evening and over the coming weeks in respect of assessing the Bill far more meaningful.</p><p>  I wish to comment briefly on the sale of Irish Life today to Great-West Lifeco.  Overall, it is a positive development.  I am not able to give an opinion on the price that was achieved or whether more could have been secured over a period of time.</p><p>The Minister said today that the State is not in the business of being an investment manager or a hedge fund and what we achieved in terms of price is essentially what we paid for it.  It is certainly a vote of confidence that a very significant global player is willing to invest in a going concern such as Irish Life in Ireland and that brings benefits.  Investors considering other possible investments in Ireland will take some comfort from the fact that a company such as Great-West Lifeco has invested in Irish Life.  The Minister pointed out in his press release that the deal is &quot;the first time during this crisis that a company in which we have invested has been returned fully to private ownership&quot;.  That is true but, as the Minister well knows, the problems in Irish Life and Permanent were not in Irish Life but in the banking arm of Permanent TSB, but nonetheless it is progress that we are able to divest ourselves of it.  I do not believe the State should be in the business of running commercial entities that in many respects are better operated by those who have expertise and a track record in that area.  I ask the Minister at some point to update the House on the employment implications.  Irish Life has 2,200 employees and Canada Life (Ireland) has approximately 600 employees, which amounts to almost 3,000 employed by the new entity.  From my reading of the various press releases today, it seems inevitable that there will be voluntary redundancies in the new organisation.  We need more information on that because that is something that has happened in past.  For example, when the joint liquidator sold Quinn Insurance to Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank, commitments were given not by the Minister but by the joint administrator, but from looking at the record those commitments were not honoured.  That is an issue we need to have dealt with.</p><p><br /> At an overall level, standing back from the detail and having regard to the Minister's opening remarks, I note he highlighted a number of positives in the direction we are going with the economy.  There are positives; of that there is no question.  He said that 2013 is likely to be the third consecutive year of economic growth but, as he will readily acknowledge, the level of growth that is being achieved is barely discernible.  It was around 1% last year and hopefully it will be 1.5% in the current year.  If it was an opinion poll, one would be saying it was within the margin of error.  Any level of growth is to be welcomed and is important, particularly against the backdrop of what is happening in the eurozone, where the economic data are not particularly encouraging and the area is still stuck in recession.  Overall, Ireland is doing better than many of our counterparts in the European Union and in the eurozone.  The Minister has correctly highlighted where the key battleground is as we go forward: it is in the domestic economy.  Exports continue to do reasonably well, though some data are not as glossy as people might like to portray.  Many of the export sectors are not as labour-intensive as we would like them to be.  One does not get the employment dividend from much of the export-related activity that one gets in the domestic economy from activity on the high street and in the retail sector and service industries.  That is where we need to generate additional activity.  </p><p><br /> There is no doubt that there are good measures in this Bill.  The Minister has outlined a new ten-point plan for SMEs.  I hope it does not suffer the same fate as the Fine Gael five-point plan in the election, which has not been seen for the past two years.  Hopefully, this ten-point plan will last a little bit longer and will actually be implemented.</p><p><br /> It is now two and half months since the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, introduced budget 2013 to this House.  We are in a position to give it a more detailed analysis through the Finance Bill that has been presented.  It is my contention that this Bill represents act two of a deeply unfair package - that is, budget 2013.  It will be followed shortly by the social welfare Bill, which will copperfasten the most egregious elements of the budget.</p><p><br /> To put the budget in context, we should look at last week's statistics from the CSO, which show that poverty is worsening.  The latest analysis indicates that the number of people in poverty has now reached a record level of more than 700,000.  The increase in the proportion of Ireland's population at risk of poverty, from 14.7% to 16% in just one year, points to a major policy failure by the Government.  In 2012 a disproportionate part of the budgetary adjustments fell on poor and vulnerable people.</p><p><br /> It is important to examine the budgetary record of the Government during the past few years.  The ESRI made it very clear that budget 2012 was regressive in nature.  It stated: &quot;Looking at the impact of the 2012 budget it is clear that the greatest reduction in income is for those on the lowest incomes - a fall of between 2 and 2.5 per cent for the poorest 40 per cent of households [compared to] ... a fall of close to 1 per cent for the next 40 per cent of households, and of 0.8 per cent for the top 20 per cent.&quot;  One would expect that the Government would have learned its lessons from the regressive and unfair nature of that budget but the early analysis from researchers attached to the ESRI is that budget 2013 was unfair in its impact.  A number of those researchers have published their opinions and they estimate that for the lowest income group the income reduction is just over 1%, while for the top income group it is lower, at a little over 0.5%.  That is its assessment taking into account the distributional effects of budget 2013.  It outlines exactly what is included and what is excluded from that analysis and points out the likely impact of including the items that are excluded, and it does not change the overall conclusion.  It is important that is put on the record.</p><p><br /> Families, once again, were in the firing line.  The budget taxed maternity benefit from mid-2013, cut child benefit once again despite the promises from the Labour Party, reduced financial support for back to school costs and hiked college costs again despite the promises that were made.  This is on top of the misery heaped on people from the abolition of the PRSI allowance, which they are now feeling in their pay packets, and the introduction of a residential property tax that takes no account of ability to pay in any meaningful way.  Nothing in the Finance Bill undoes the damage inflicted on budget day by these and a number of other measures.</p><p><br /> To take some comfort from the measures that were introduced, many of the Labour Party Deputies, in particular, were going around saying that the budget included &#8364;0.5 billion of wealth tax measures.  The Taoiseach said that the package of tax measures directed at richer people had been the largest tax on wealth ever introduced in Ireland.  It would appear that many of those who made such points do not fully understand the difference between wealth and income.  The list that the Labour Party has been putting forward includes a mansion tax on properties worth over &#8364;1 million, an increase in the universal social charge on high-income pensions, extending PRSI to trade and unearned income, reducing tax reliefs for large pension pots, and increases in capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and deposit interest retention tax, DIRT.  While some Labour Party Deputies have called this a wealth package, the only tax on wealth defined as an asset that is included in the list is the property tax.  It is my estimate that no more than &#8364;115 million can be linked to high earners in 2013 and about &#8364;175 million in a full year.  It must be acknowledged that that is aside from the change to the maximum allowable pension funds that will attract tax relief, which the Minister outlined on budget day, but those changes are not coming into effect until next year and it appears that not a huge amount of work has been done on that issue.  The Minister acknowledged on that day that the estimated full-year savings are provisional at this time, as further detailed analysis of the necessary changes and their impact will be required.  That was not a measure in budget 2013; it was an advance announcement of something that may or may not happen in budget 2014, and I am certainly sceptical that the revenue yield of &#8364;0.25 billion that has been earmarked from that measure will actually be achieved if it can be implemented.<b></b></p><p><b></b>I would be the first person to acknowledge that there are some welcome measures in this Bill with regard to the SME sector.  I welcome the focus the Government is putting on the SME sector.  The Minister's declaration that &quot;the SME sector will be the driver of the economic recovery across the country&quot;<i></i>is one with which few would argue.  The Bill introduces measures such as improving research and development tax credits and the inclusion of hotels in the employment and investment incentive scheme.  I submit that the Minister could have been more radical in that regard.  I ask him to give consideration to a new set of additional measures.  Currently, the research and development credit is a function of increases in expenditure using 2003 as the base year for comparison.  I welcome the limited changes in this area, but overall the incremental approach should be reviewed in light of the pressure on company budgets.</p><p>In order to encourage investment in the sector, I suggest all research and development expenditure should, for a two year period, be eligible for a tax credit, subject to EU approval.  Second, the cap on outsourced research and development expenditure should be reviewed.  I know some improvements were made in this area last year, but it still limits the degree to which enterprises can collaborate with universities and third level institutes in research and development activity and is inconsistent with other Government policies aimed at fostering linkages between these sectors.  Third, the Minister could extend and widen the key employee relief to include companies in loss-making positions.  This could be of particular benefit to start-up enterprises.  The Minister has reformed the corporation tax exemption for start-up companies, which I welcome.  In order to encourage the widest possible uptake of the research and development tax credit, Revenue and Enterprise Ireland should actively target the SME sector with user-friendly information guides on how the relief works.</p><p> I welcome the extension of the employment and investment incentive scheme to the hotel sector.  The tourism industry is vital to the economy.  It provides approximately 196,000 jobs, equivalent to 11% of total employment.  Good value hotel rooms in a viable industry sector are vital to our tourist offering.  However, the hotel sector faces a massive debt overhang, with many other sectors of the economy, which, if not addressed, will lead to significant job losses.  We are already beginning to see this happen.  Hotels in Ireland owe banks &euro;6.7 billion, which represents a whopping &euro;113,250 of debt on average per room.  Given the current trend in profitability, we should take note of a report commissioned by the Irish Hotels Federation which indicates that the maximum sustainable level of debt per room is approximately &euro;70,000.  Therefore, the sector's liabilities need to be cut by 38% or &euro;2.5 billion.  An injection of new equity capital would be much more preferable to a debt write-down and the Minister's proposal is welcome in this regard.  However, he could go further by setting up a hotel restructuring fund using funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, to purchase assets that have a commercially sound prospect for profitability and growth.  Alternatively, he could look to setting up a qualifying investor fund for hotels that may be attractive to private investors, especially from abroad who would like to invest in Irish hotels but do not wish to own hotels directly.  As a  final point on the sector I note that NAMA and the banks control 10,000 hotel rooms, representing approximately one sixth of the market.  It is important that NAMA and bank-controlled hotels are prevented from engaging in market manipulating practices.  The Competition Authority needs to continue to monitor for such practices and take action, if needed.</p><p> As I mentioned, I welcome the overall intention of the Minister in regard to the SME sector.  However, as I said in another debate last week, without access to credit, the SME sector is going to remain in the doldrums.  The report by the Credit Review Office shows just how difficult things are for SMEs.  Of the total of &euro;8 billion of new lending advanced by the pillar banks, only an estimated &euro;2.5 billion was deemed to represent actual new lending, with the balance representing loans being rolled over.  In total, both banks' SME loan books contracted by &euro;2 billion in 2012 as the figure of &euro;2.5 billion of new lending was outweighed by &euro;4.5 billion in net repayments by these SMEs.  Tomorrow Mr. John Trethowan from the Credit Review Office will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and my colleagues and i will be questioning him on some of these matters.</p><p> I draw the Minister's attention to another issue of concern, namely, the increase in vehicle registration tax, VRT which was announced in the budget and is provided for in the Finance Bill.  We know that in January, according to official figures from the CSO, sales of motor cars dropped by about one quarter when compared to the same month last year.  I recognise that the change in the registration system, with cars having a 131 registration in the first half of the year and a 132 registration in the second half, may well have the effect of spreading car sales more evenly over the year.  Having said that, a drop of one quarter in January 2013 compared to January 2012 is a source of major concern.  I met a major motor dealer recently and we sat down and went through the figures together.  He is predicting that many of the major dealers in Ireland will end up closing and that we are going to witness very heavy job losses in the sector.  The Minister has pencilled in that the change will bring in &euro;50 million in additional revenue in 2013, but those to whom I have been speaking in the industry dispute this.  The Minister must monitor what is happening in the motor trade very carefully because the early signs in 2013 are ominous.  He should not be unprepared to change his position if that trend continues in the next few months.  </p><p> The aspect of the Finance Bill I find most disappointing is the lack of significant measures to stimulate the domestic economy.  We saw a worrying development last week regarding export figures.  The trade data for the month of December showed a significant fall-off in the export of goods from Ireland.  Unfortunately, this is likely to feed through to weaker than expected GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2012.  If we are to avoid seeing GDP slipping back to negative territory, we need to do something to get the other components of GDP moving in the right direction, specifically consumer spending and capital investment.</p><p> We all know that the economy is suffering from very weak overall levels of consumer spending and that there is significant growth in the black economy.  To tackle this, I am suggesting to the Minister that a tax credit of up to &euro;2,500 be made available for approved home improvement works, subject to the home owner engaging a registered, tax-compliant contractor.  Ideally, consumers would do this of their own accord, but sometimes one needs an intervention to nudge people in the right direction.  This measure would provide a significant boost for local economies as contractors purchase goods and spend money in shops.  We all know that there is a huge amount of activity in the black economy, particularly small-scale building jobs, home improvement works, renovations and so forth, and there is a way, if we use the taxation code imaginatively, to bring more of this activity into the mainstream economy.  It would have the added benefit of increasing VAT and income tax receipts.  We should, therefore, seriously consider this measure.  In general, we should be prepared to try new things.  If the Minister introduced a measure that did not cost much money but did not work, I would not criticise him for this.  We must be open to considering new ways of doing things and introducing initiatives on a pilot basis to see if they would have an impact.  This is one measure I encourage the Minister to consider because we all know that the major drop-off in employment levels since 2008 is mainly related to the construction sector.  If we can give people a boost through a targeted tax incentive system, under which home owners would benefit, the idea has merit.  </p><p> I have made reference on a number of occasions recently to the fact that the Government is gutting the Exchequer capital programme.  Last year's stimulus programme was little more than a fig leaf to attempt to hide that reality.  </p><p> My party regards the pension levy imposed by the Government in 2011 as fundamentally unfair.  Most defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit, often substantially so.  Few employers can afford additional contributions to eliminate the deficit.  Many pension scheme members have already faced substantial increases in their pension contributions or reductions in benefits as a means of closing the gap in the fund.  The introduction of the levy has made the already difficult situation for defined benefit schemes even worse.  Existing pensioners, for example, will probably see their pension increase by less than the cost of living, if at all, as will deferred pensioners.  Active members of pension schemes are likely to see their pension reduced or their rate of contribution increased.  At the time the levy was introduced we pointed to its unfairness as all pension assets are fully taxed when drawn down as income.  To impose a levy on pension assets prior to draw-down represents double taxation and is likely to have a very negative impact on people's retirement income and the incentive to make additional voluntary contributions.  I remain very concerned that the levy will become a permanent fixture, despite the sunset clause in the legislation..  What I suggested first in 2011 and repeat again tonight is that the levy be scrapped and replaced with a mandatory investment by private pension funds of 1% per annum for three years in the strategic investment fund established by the Government under NewERA.  This would be an investment of &euro;700 million per annum and could be supplemented by an equivalent annual investment from the NPRF. </p><p> One aspect of pension provisions that often discourages take-up is their perceived inflexible nature.  There is an estimated &euro;72 billion invested in Irish pension funds.  Many in society face severe financial difficulties as a result of the economic crisis.  In some cases, the individuals concerned have significant pension assets accumulated which they are prevented from accessing until retirement under the terms of the Pensions Act.</p><p>An OECD report stated that while care is required to ensure that people do not unduly threaten their retirement incomes, early access to pension savings should be considered as a policy option by Government to reduce the effect of cyclicality in the economy.</p><p><br /> I believe the proposals in the Finance Bill are limited in scope and unlikely to have much take-up.  Employer paid contributions, regular employee contributions, self-employed personal pensions and normal personal retirement savings account, PRSA, contributions are excluded, as are AVCs that are being made for the purposes of purchasing notional added years.  I would be pleasantly surprised if the measure raises &#8364;100 million in tax revenue in the current year.</p><p><br /> I concur with the view that limiting early pension access to AVCs discriminates against other private pension fund holders.  With credit so tight, the self-employed and other business owners have as good, if not better, reasons to want some access to money tied up in their pensions.  However, they are effectively excluded.  We will seek to amend this on Committee Stage.</p><p><br /> To put it at its simplest, Government policy on the health insurance levy is driving more and more people from the health insurance market.  Perhaps that is the Minister's intention.  It is a system on the brink of collapse.  Currently, 6,000 people are dropping their policies every month.  This is resulting is ever-higher premiums for the remaining customers, increasing pressure on an already stretched public health system and additional delays.  As a result of the budget increase in the health insurance levy, a family of four will be paying &#8364;940 in levy charges alone.  </p><p><br /> We know now that the Government has reneged on its commitment not to extend the increase in the levy to customers with lower levels of cover.  There is clearly an affordability crisis in health insurance.  It would appear premiums are now going up twice a year and this is hitting hardest at young families with mortgages and high child care costs, the people who are least able to pay.  According to the Department's own regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, the people leaving the market are those who are younger and healthier, and those with children.</p><p><br /> The market has gone from being one where more and more new customers were joining, a phenomenon that supported the principle of community rating, to one where the market is declining and the very customers who are leaving are the young families who should be its lifeblood.  As noted by one industry source recently:<blockquote>It seems entirely lost on the Department that the best way to provide protection for the older and sicker is to ensure that younger healthier people continue to find health insurance attractive in terms of benefits and costs.  You can't get intergenerational support if you drive younger people out of the market.</blockquote>That comment should be considered carefully by the Minister.</p><p><br /> The Revenue job assist scheme allowed employers a double wages deduction if they employed a person who had been unemployed for 12 months or more.  I know the scheme has been criticised by industry for being too limited in scope, with most applicants not meeting the scheme's strict criteria.  However, it is disappointing that no details of the replacement scheme, the jobs plus initiative, have yet been provided.  I understand this will happen shortly, and the Minister indicated that again tonight.  It is vital when it does happen that it is focused on the needs of the long-term unemployed.  This is now an acute problem with nearly 200,000 people out of work for over a year.  Once someone reaches this unhappy milestone it becomes increasingly difficult to get back to full-time paid employment at a decent wage level and the replacement scheme, jobs plus, needs to be sufficiently flexible to reflect the many facets of long-term unemployment, which is now a deep seated economic and social problem.</p><p><br /> I welcome the extension of the fuel rebate scheme to bus and coach operators.  They have suffered from massive increases in the cost of their main input in recent years.  I am concerned about the impact on firms that do not use licensed hauliers.  A small supplier of goods, such as a catering supply firm or concrete manufacturer, that runs its own fleet will not benefit from the diesel rebate and will be at a disadvantage.  I ask the Minister to look at this again on Committee Stage.</p><p><br /> As announced in the budget, the carbon tax will be extended to solid fuels on a phased basis.  A rate of &#8364;10 per tonne will be applied with effect from 1 May 2013 and at a rate of &#8364;20 per tonne from 1 May 2014.  According to the industry, this will add &#8364;2.50 to a 40 kg bag of coal and 50 cent to a bale of briquettes so a household that goes through two bags of coal a week for half of the year, which is not unusual particularly for those without central heating, will pay an extra &#8364;130.  In addition to the obvious fuel poverty implications, how will the Minister combat the smuggling and illegal sale of solid fuel products, particularly in the Border area?</p><p><br /> Finally, I refer to our pre-budget suggestion that a 10% on alcohol sales in off-licences be introduced.  The proposal was a recognition that Ireland is currently seeing an increase in alcohol consumption within the home.  One of the reasons often cited for this trend is the significant price differentiation of alcohol products between on-trade and off-trade establishments.  Not only has this discrepancy affected social behaviour by discouraging people from consuming at public houses, but it has also been cited as a contributing factor in the rise of binge drinking and under age drinking.  According to <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>last weekend,  the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, made a similar proposal to his Cabinet colleagues before the preparation of the Finance Bill.  He proposed that the proceeds of the measure be ring-fenced for sports and recreation.</p><p><br /> There were some suggestions that the proposal was considered to be in breach of EU competition law because it solely targeted off-sales.  However, legal opinion commissioned by the industry from Arthur Cox solicitors suggests that it would be feasible if the proceeds were ring-fenced for specific purposes.  Assuming they are accurately reported, I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's views and I think this is something that we should consider again.</p><p><br /> The Minister's references to bond options and the reduction in the cost of borrowing are welcome.  The real benchmark in that area will be when the NTMA goes into the market and sells a 10 year bond at 4% or thereabouts.  That is something the agency is actively considering.  I would encourage it to do so.  It would send a strong and powerful signal to the markets that Ireland is on the brink of successfully exiting the programme and being able to fund itself on the international markets.  I hope we see such a move by the NTMA in the very near future.</p><p><br /> We look forward to debating the measures in detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="23:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900062#LLL00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his Second Stage speech and I welcome the opportunity to respond to it.  As he began his contribution, the Minister took the opportunity to reflect on recent developments.  Given the state of Ireland's economy, the fact that we did not incur a loss in the sale of Irish Life and that the dividend to be paid should nearly equate to the interest we would have had to forgo in investing the &euro;1.3 billion, is to be welcomed.  I agree with the previous speaker that we need more detail to see if this was the best type of investment, but the fact that we have not lost on it has bucked the trend of some of the financial institutions we have had to take on board in the past number of years.</p><p>  There are serious concerns about redundancies.  The statements are clear that voluntary redundancies are being sought.  There are already estimations of savings of &euro;40 million from the merger of Canada Life and Irish Life.  There are fears that these savings will necessitate compulsory redundancies.  I hope there is agreement and that the Government has ensured there will be no compulsory redundancies.  What will that mean for job prospects in the future? </p><p>  The Minister commented that the development illustrates that there is value in the State's holdings in Irish banks and that the Government will sell these assets when the price and time are right for the taxpayer.  That statement is factually correct.  My party and I have never disputed the fact that there is value in the banks.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund currently values them at between &euro;9 billion and &euro;11 billion.  </p><p>  The Minister says the Government will sell these assets when the price and time are right.  There is a significant expectation that the retrospection of the deal, in terms of separating sovereign and banking debt, is what we will achieve and that the ESM will purchase these for historic prices.  I have concerns about the Minister's statement.  Deputy Michael McGrath and other Deputies who are members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform have heard the banks say that if there is an investor, they will sell their assets.  I worry about how that would play out in terms of trying to sell assets for more than their current market value.  The investment was far superior to the current value.</p><p>In saying that, this is the Minister's second Finance Bill, and it is one of three Bills that cement the budget for 2013, the second austerity budget presided over by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</p><p> When the Finance Bill 2012 was published, the Minister claimed he was making good progress in implementing the programme for Government.  I am struck by the Minister's continuing references to the programme for Government.  This programme, written by two parties that had received a huge mandate from the people, contains laudable sections, but I wonder if the Minister and I are in possession of the same document.  In the programme for Government to which I have access, there is a statement that the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il policy of blank cheques for banks would be ended and we would step back from the edge of national insolvency.  What happened last week, where the Government took on the debts of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in the form of a sovereign bond that writes the total on the cheque for once and for all and takes on the liabilities, making good the letters of comfort sent by the Minister to the Central Bank?  The Minister continues to keep the coffers open for the banks and the bondholders.</p><p> The parties also promised in the programme for Government that there would be an end to asset transfers to NAMA because they were unlikely to improve market confidence in either banks or State.  We all know that last week assets were transferred to NAMA from IBRC that totalled about &euro;16 billion.  The programme for Government contained a promise that a strategic investment bank would be established - that was a major pillar of Labour Party policy - but the Minister and I have had more than one exchange on that and we all know it will not happen any time in the near future.  Its precursor has not even been brought forward in legislation despite it being announced over a year and a half ago.</p><p> The programme outlined how all remuneration schemes for banks subject to State support would undergo a fundamental review to ensure an alignment of interests between banks, their staff and the taxpayer.  I know that the Minister will say we have to await the Mercer report.  We were told it would be here by the end of the year but now we are told the Minister has access to the report.  While the Minister is toing and froing, one of the banks that was subject to that review no longer exists and, lo and behold, the Minister was able to confirm today that some of the senior executives, despite losing their jobs in the liquidation, are now back being employed by the liquidator.</p><p> These are the commitments on which the Government claims to be making progress.  Another commitment in the programme for Government is that any site valuation tax must take into account the significant number of households in mortgage distress.  I will come back to that promise in detail later.  The question can genuinely be asked if I have the wrong document or if the Government still maintains its progress in some of these programme for Government commitments.</p><p> Turning to the Bill itself, a Finance Bill should do a number of things and I want to give my overall impression of what the Bill does and does not do.  A Finance Bill should, in times of recession anyway, contribute to reducing the deficit.  Does this Bill reduce the deficit?  One could argue it does, even if it does not do so in a way that I would agree with or support.  A Finance Bill should stimulate economic activity and support business.  Does this Bill do that?  It certainly attempts to support business and there are a range of business measures in it, some good and some bad.  It definitely fails, however, to stimulate the economy and certainly fails to stimulate domestic demand.</p><p> While there are some good measures for business in the Bill, they are no substitute for a real and meaningful stimulus, such as the one my party presented to the Minister last year in our jobs action plan &quot;Create Jobs, Create Growth&quot;.  That plan required actual spending on infrastructure creation which would have assisted business and created jobs, as well as a series of measures, such as abolishing upward-only rent reviews, that would have saved many businesses from closure.  Deputy Michael McGrath was right; the Government has butchered the capital budget and continued what Fianna F&aacute;il was doing before it.  Capital spending has fallen from &euro;10 billion to &euro;4 billion, with the present Government responsible for &euro;2 billion of that reduction.</p><p> The Finance Bill should also act to ensure redistribution.  It should have at its heart a policy of fairness.  Does this Bill do that?  Clearly, the answer is &quot;no&quot; unless we believe redistribution should have some sort of reverse effect, from the bottom to the top.  As it was last year, this Finance Bill is a disappointing missed opportunity.</p><p> I live in the real world.  In the budget the Minister had the chance to reduce the deficit fairly, to stimulate business and to ensure that middle and low-income families were protected from the worst of the necessary financial adjustment.  Because I live in the real world, I submitted a budget alternative to the Department of Finance.  I know the Minister receives hundreds of these submissions each year and I know many of them are unrealistic, demanding as they do provisions for vested interests without any interest in how those provisions are funded.  The budget I submitted, however, was tough but fair.  It contained a series of measures to meet the budget target of &euro;3.5 billion, from tax proposals to savings in the public spend.  It did this without targeting the vulnerable and while supporting families and mortgage distressed householders.  To protect these groups, it sought tax increases from higher earners, a fairness in the tax code and an end to the gravy train for politicians and top grade civil and public servants, to name but a few measures.  All or any of these could have been done in this Finance Bill but the Minister and his colleagues in Government chose not to.</p><p> I am reminded as we stand in this Chamber tonight that by the time we debated last year's Finance Bill, the Government had been forced into several U-turns because of measures announced in the preceding budget.  The attempted cuts to people on disability benefit and the cuts in funding for disadvantaged schools - both proposals from Labour Party Ministers - had to be shelved.  That was a good thing.  The cuts should never have made it on to the agenda but a U-turn was better than forging ahead with something so deeply unpopular as to be unsustainable.</p><p> Unfortunately, no such wisdom has been shown in the two months that have passed since the announcement of the budget for 2013.  For example, despite a collective and emotional campaign against the cut to the respite grant, the Government has stayed determined to implement that cut in its entirety.  The line has been that there is nowhere else that sum of money could be found, but here we have a detailed Finance Bill that has numerous additional new sections to those that were announced in the budget.  Many of those new sections, if they come to fruition, will entail additional costs to the Exchequer.  There is no money to reverse really harmful cuts such as that to the respite care grant, but other measures have been inserted without any proper costing.  That is simply not acceptable.</p><p> The Minister argues that they are an essential cost in that they assist business or indirectly foster growth, and I am sure that is true in some but not all of the cases.  They are a cost none the less.  How is it that the Minister can find money for these measures but not to reverse the respite grant cut?  I am particularly concerned that the Department does not seem to be able to put a cost on these new measures, a trend that is apparent time and again.  Last year I asked for the Finance Bill to be costed section by section and that could not be done.  During a briefing on the Bill today, the officials, who otherwise did an excellent job answering questions as thoroughly as possible, could not tell me an estimated spend for a number of these sections.  In some of the sections there will be an expansion of measures that were introduced last year even though there are no data that show the effectiveness or cost of those measures in the last 12 months.</p><p> The Minister cites our overall growth projections and deficit targets as justification and vindication of his second austerity budget.  We are all agreed we need good economic indicators, but these figures mean nothing if they are having no tangible impact on people's real lives.  They might mean a lot to people examining the economy who are trying to steer the ship in the right direction but mean nothing to those trying to get by day by day.</p><p>Does he honestly think that anybody adversely affected by budget 2013 cares if he is pleased that we are in line with the troika targets or that he has met the budget adjustments this year set by the troika?  They do not care about any of that because numbers are meaningless to them.  They are interested in impacts and results.  If the result of the Finance Bill and the budget is to improve their lives, then they and I will believe the Minister has done a good job.  If the Minister announces a new measure in the Finance Bill which he considers absolutely necessary to improve the economic realities of those across the State and his measure works as he says, then he has done a good job.</p><p> However, to date, the Minister has not done a good job.  I will use the example of one of the new measures announced last year, the special assignee relief programme, SARP, because the Minister announced this with much fanfare last year and dedicated a large section of his speech to its introduction at budget time.  This tax-free clause was to be the measure that attracted high-powered executives to Ireland to stimulate economic activity and create jobs - we all will be aware their children got free fees, or they got tax reliefs against their fees and flights to and from America or from wherever they came.</p><p> The Minister told us that SARP would place us up there with our tax competitors, who are becoming increasingly more clever than us in the race to the bottom to attract FDI at any tax cost.  When I tabled a parliamentary question in October to provide an update on SARP given that it was such a central element in last year's Finance Bill, including the number of persons who have availed of the tax relief, the total amount of relief awarded and the number of jobs that have been directly created as a result of this relief, the Minister could not give an answer.  In fairness, I appreciate that many tax measures can only be viewed in their totality after being one year in effect and I tabled the question today to see if the Minister can give me an answer.  There was much hubbub about this being tied to job creation, etc.  The Minister also must be honest.  He touted this scheme as an essential new additional spend to budget 2012, for all the reasons that I have already outlined.  With a scheme as important as he told us this would be, I am more than a little surprised that he has not monitored it more closely to see how successful it has been.  I am also more than a little curious to see how much it has cost and how many jobs it has created.</p><p> The impact of SARP might not be clear, but there are some facts at our disposal.  For instance, since the Government has come to power 20,000 jobs have been lost in the economy and long-term unemployment has increased.  Also, in the same two years, 167,000 people have emigrated, 70,000 of whom are from within the 15-24 year demographic.  We also know that over the past year IDA created just over 6,570 net jobs.  Armed with facts like these, the Minister can understand why anyone would be sceptical about how effective this Finance Bill will be for the economy as a whole.</p><p> There can be no denying that this Finance Bill is oriented towards a section of the business community.  I am acutely aware that the economic strategic policy of the Government appears to rest, not merely on a hope and a prayer, but on an ever accommodating tax code for the international business community so that it will come flocking to Ireland's rescue.  Such a policy has its work cut out for it.  The City of London, the Dutch and Singapore are all adapting their tax systems and attempting to outstrip Ireland as a tax-friendly location for business.  It is most important that we continue to offer a competitive regime to attract foreign direct investment into this State but the attractions should include more than just the tax code.  They should also offer first-class infrastructure, world-class graduates and a society to which any high-flying executive would want to move his career and family.</p><p> That said, I am concerned that in the Bill, and in the Department in general, there does not seem to be a policy on an effective rate of taxation for business.  There is much discussion about this and the failure of the Minister to deal with this in the Finance Bill is seriously questioned.  I have asked parliamentary questions about this in reply to which the Minister has been less than forthcoming with his information, and yet across the world, from the OECD to the European Commission and economic forums of world leaders, this issue of Ireland's business tax rates, and the lack of an effective tax rate which allows major companies to pay a very small amount of taxation using schemes and loopholes, has been dominant.</p><p> Everyone wants business to succeed and be accommodated, but there is a growing consensus that this cannot be done at any price.  It is not bad to use finance legislation to deal with the tax system to attract business, but it is limited in its applications.  It is clearly something on which the Department is lobbied quite intimately by certain vested interests.</p><p> As I have stated, I do not object to this if the results of it are positive for all of the people of Ireland, but I question whether there is equality of opportunity to lobby the Department.  When an auditing firm or a stockbroker sends the Government its list of tax incentives needed to facilitate business, does it receive the same level of attention or more than the submission from the respite carers' group that tells the Minister the cut to its grant will not only decimate its quality of life, but probably end up costing the Exchequer more?  That is merely an example of what the people will wonder when they see the contents of this Bill and the boxes it ticks and does not tick.  There are many other examples.</p></speech>

I understand that it comes from others but it is part and parcel of the budgetary proposal.</p><p><br />  The Bill does tick some boxes.  In the past, the Minister has presented me and my party as negative when we were attempting to constructively criticise legislation.  We all will be aware that is a political ploy and it is par for the course.  He will be aware that we have never shied away from welcoming measures for which we ourselves have campaigned.</p><p><br />  The increases in capital gains tax and acquisitions tax are positive moves.  I welcome them, even if they do not go as far as we would like them to go.  I also welcome the further clamping down on some tax avoidance measures, such as the withdrawal of the foreign service relief for <i>ex-gratia</i> payments and the implementation of stamp duty anti-avoidance measures.  I welcome the extension and improvement of start-up relief, as long as it continues to be tied to job creation.  The changes to how employees benefit trusts are treated for tax purposes are a positive move.</p><p><br />  I am glad to see that the Bill contains excise duty relief for hauliers and transport providers.  The relief for hauliers is something for which we called in our jobs action plan last year and I, too, believe it has the potential to be revenue neutral.  Significantly, the tax treatment allowances for civil partnerships are necessary and good and welcome news.  There are other parts to the Bill that also would merit welcome.</p><p><br />  However, there are some features in the Bill over which there are question marks.  The establishment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, has been widely welcomed by the property analysts and numerous economic commentators.  I have some concerns and questions about these entities.  I recognise that these are functioning in many jurisdictions and, in many cases, successfully so.  They have been established in the United States since the 1960s and over the past decade a plethora of countries have started to introduce them.  Essentially, these REITs are investment vehicles and the level at which the investment is set, and the cost in that regard, will be a determining factor.</p><p><br />  There are also questions regarding how the Minister has set these investment vehicles up.  One of the concerns is that the REITs, as entities, thrive in low-rate environments.  They have sprung up in distressed property markets worldwide to take advantage of collapsed property prices and while they may encourage some recovery in property prices, they also have many of the warning indicators associated with bubble investment vehicles.  I am concerned that this State may be hopping on a bandwagon that has already pulled out of the station.  I question that the Minister set the dividend at 85%, given that, I believe, Britain and the United States have set it at 90%.  There also are questions regarding the mixed assets and that the legislation seems to lack any meaningful asset test to protect potential investors.  These are some issues which we will be able to address in more detail on Committee Stage.</p><p><br />  In addition, the changes to research and development tax credits for employees give rise for concern.  If this tax credit introduced last year was to accommodate companies engaging employees for research and development, why is the portion of those employees' research and development work being reduced, from 75% to 50%, in the Bill?</p><p>Why was this not spotted last year?  What is the thinking behind it?  There are no quantitative data on how the scheme introduced last year is playing out today.</p><p> I question the living city initiative on which I have serious reservations.  Regeneration of urban centres is absolutely crucial.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's jobs action plan, we proposed the completion of the Limerick and Dublin regeneration schemes as a socially-friendly policy leading to job creation.  This is regeneration of housing estates that have been crying out for help for many years and have been ignored by successive governments and finally we are seeing some movement.</p><p> The writing-off of tax over a period of years to renovate what is probably a small number of Georgian houses in two counties looks and smells very much like section 23, and does not make sense.  This clause allows up to 100% tax back over ten years of an investment in an asset that one can use for retail purposes as well as for living in.  There are serious concerns over why the State would provide such support for somebody who is developing the bottom of a Georgian house into a retail unit, thereby putting the next house, which is not Georgian, in the same street at a complete disadvantage.  It skews the market terribly and also allows for somebody to invest huge amounts of money.  While there is a threshold that it must be 10% of the market value, there is no cap on the amount of upgrading works that might be carried out to such a Georgian house and qualify for the tax break.  This means that the State is potentially giving hundreds of thousands of euro to people to fix the upper storeys of a Georgian house for living accommodation and the basement and ground floor for retail use.  That is seriously questionable.</p></speech>

While there is a minimum threshold there is no maximum.  I do not live in Limerick and have not spent much time there but I have been around the city and seen the accommodation in Moyross.  Many people there would love the Minister to be announcing that if they carried out upgrades to their houses, the Government would write it off from their tax liability for the next ten years.  This clause basically provides for a grant to repair a house by way of tax foregone.  The people who own the Georgian houses are able to avail of this provision but the people in social housing or normal houses are unable to avail of it.  Indeed the Government is asking them to pay a property tax, either through increased rent in social housing or directly via the property tax.  This is seriously questionable and I do not understand the rationale behind identifying a select number of properties.  Just selecting people in Georgian houses does not make sense.  If the Government wants an area-based scheme, it should specify an area-based scheme.  Why restrict it to Georgian houses?  Why put no upper limit on it?  At a time when the Government is asking 1.8 million homeowners to pay additional tax, why is it effectively providing 100% grants for people who own Georgian houses and are willing to live in them to renovate and upgrade them?  It stinks to high heaven.  These are some of the issues that we will also go through later.</p><p>  The largest tax take this year is planned to come from family-home tax, and I will deal with this in a moment.  The Bill contains several measures to increase indirect taxation, namely through excise duties and a change in certain tax treatments.  One of the more notable changes is the taxing of maternity benefit for new mothers and the Minister has added to this by taxing adoptive benefit, and health and safety benefit - a payment paid to expectant mothers and breastfeeding mothers who cannot be accommodated in their workplace.  These payments were traditionally left untaxed.  Last year I said the Government would probably do this and this is what it has done.  They were left untaxed in recognition of the cost incurred by mothers and families when bringing a new baby into the household.  It was interesting to hear the Constitutional Convention at the weekend discussing the clause on facilitating mothers to stay at home and its decision to bring that clause into the modern age.  It was interesting because the Constitution has a specific clause to facilitate mothers in the home and yet, the Government has step-by-step tried to dismantle the financial support mothers and parents receive when having children, ranging from the measures we are discussing now to the constant attacks on child benefit in the Social Welfare Act and what has been reported in the media in the past week.</p><p>  The Bill also legislates for the provisions in the budget to increase excise duty on alcohol and cigarettes, to increase VRT and to extend carbon tax to solid fuels.  These tax hikes all tend to hit middle and lower-income consumers disproportionately.  The Minister is aware of this, yet each year he goes back to the same pockets and tries to squeeze a little more.</p><p>  I am particularly concerned at the changes to VRT.  Motorists and the Irish motor industry have been really feeling the effects of the recession.  Fuel hikes, motor tax hikes, the licence fee hike in this Bill and diminishing income have all hit car sales and employment in the industry.  The Irish motor trade continues to be a key employer across the State but it has been seriously hit by the recession.  At its peak in December 2007, this sector accounted for 49,600 employees, but the industry had shed 14,300, 29%, of its workforce by the end of 2009.  The increase in VRT is devastating for a fragile industry and the biannual number plate will not negate the impact of increased VRT rates.</p><p>  While it is not addressed in the Bill, the Minister missed an opportunity to bring fairness to the motor tax system.  I support the sub-classification of the bands, but this should have been done in a way that reduced the tax for small and family cars and increased it substantially on expensive cars.  The environmental goal of forcing the car industry into making its models carbon efficient has succeeded.  Now the Government should address the disparity that exists in the motor tax system whereby someone who owns a Nissan Micra is paying the same motor tax as someone driving a Volvo V50.</p><p>  This brings me to everything that is missing in this Bill.</p></speech>

The programme for Government specifically stated that any property tax would take into account the significant numbers of people in mortgage distress.  Our Private Members' motion tonight is about mortgage distress and removing the bank's veto.  Some 115 households fall into mortgage distress every day and the Minister plans to impose an additional burden on them.  There is a different way to do it by introducing a proper property tax, which is a wealth tax.  A wealth tax operates in many OECD countries, including France, Norway, Sweden and Iceland.  I produced the legislation which is open to be amended and shaped in whatever way the Government wants.  This is what governments in other countries are doing.  The Spanish Government has recently reintroduced a wealth tax and the Liberal Democrats in Britain advocate one.  The main opposition party in Germany, the SPD, is committed to introducing such a tax if it gets into government.  This is what the Government should do instead of penalising householders across the State because they have a roof over their heads.</p><p>  I could elaborate on other measures in the Bill.  I believe it is a missed opportunity.  As I mentioned earlier, the Bill has some positive aspects that will, hopefully, have some beneficial impact on the economy but they are too small and too far between and do not negate the seriously damaging policy of austerity.  On the whole the Bill is a missed opportunity and underpins the austerity policy of the Minister's party and the Government. </p></speech>

I wish to commend the Department of Finance officials on the obvious hard work they need to put into preparing what is clearly a very technically complex and mind-bending Bill.  They do so every year and deserve great credit.  They were very helpful in answering some of my questions this afternoon and this evening.</p><p>The conclusion I have drawn from my reading of the Bill is that there is not an awful lot in it.  To my mind, that is the biggest problem with this Bill.  I do not want to reiterate the point I made earlier on the Order of Business in regard to the timing of the introduction of this Bill, except to say that its introduction late at night is connected to there being nothing much in it.  It smacks of manipulation of the debate around what is a critical issue about which every citizen of this State is concerned because of the severity of the crisis we are in, namely, the financial state of this country, and the measures and proposals being put forward by the Government in terms of offering relief, hope and a strategy for getting us out of that mess.  This Bill is being introduced late at night precisely because it does not do that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-02-19a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="23:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900066#PPP00300"><p>I have heard that.  However, I am unconvinced.  I am not aware of the Minister's schedule or meetings in London.  Perhaps he can tell me about them afterwards.  Maybe he will convince me.</p><p><br />  This is the second time in two weeks that we have dealt with critical legislation dealing with the finances of this State at a time when they are in the worst state they have ever been in the history of the State.  To my mind, it is problematic that this should happen twice in two weeks into the early hours of the morning.  I see a connection between what happened two weeks ago and what is provided for, or not, in this Bill.  Two weeks ago the Government used a late night session of the D&aacute;il to present as a great victory a Bill which was in reality simply a repackaging of the treasonous decision of the previous Government to pin &#8364;30 billion worth of the gambling debts of former Anglo Irish Bank to the backs of the citizens of this State.  The Minister presented that repackaging as a great victory and implied that there was something in it for the citizens of this country and the economy when the real substance of what went on during that late night session was that the Minister confirmed the disastrous decision made by the previous Government, legally committing us to paying every cent of those gambling debts and guaranteeing we are facing into long-term economic stagnation.</p><p><br />  The <i>quid pro quo</i> of making that commitment is that the Government now has no room to manoeuvre.  That is the point I am making.  The reason there is nothing in this Finance Bill that will make any substantial difference is because the Minister has given away all of our room to manoeuvre.  What he should and could have done, much as he protests it is impossible and so on to do so, was said that these are not our debts, that our economy cannot afford to take them on if it is to have any hope of economic recovery and if he, as Minister for Finance, is to have any room to manoeuvre to propose measures that could help stimulate the economy and economic growth, and that we will not pay them.  To put it simply, because of the guarantees given, this Bill can offer us nothing.  </p><p><br />  Furthermore, as if committing to paying off Anglo's debts was not bad enough, it has emerged during the past two weeks that even the short-term savings, about which the Minister was crowing two weeks ago we would get in 2014 and 2015, cannot be translated into any measures which make any substantial difference to the citizens of this State.  It is somewhat debatable if these short-term savings even exist.  It is clear that even if they do, and if the Minister's arithmetic is correct, they cannot be translated into any reversal of proposals to introduce a home tax, water tax or previous austerity measures such as the universal social charge imposed on low and middle income families, all of which not only ensure people suffer but are utterly destructive in terms of the domestic economy and its capacity to recover.  The Government claims that none of these savings can be used for public investment programmes or to prevent the troika demanded sale of State assets, which to my mind are sales which move us precisely in the opposite direction to that we need to go if we are to have any chance of economic recovery.</p><p><br />  I would like to comment on the sale of Irish Life.  I do so not for the sake of it but because I believe somebody needs to puncture the consensus.  I cannot believe the Government is congratulating itself, that Fianna F&aacute;il is congratulating it and that, more astonishingly, Sinn F&eacute;in is giving a cautious welcome to the sale of Irish Life.  It beggars belief.  We propose to hold on to all of the institutions that are broke, insolvent and have bad debts and to sell off a State asset that is profitable, resulting in the loss of a couple of hundred jobs, it being asset stripped and all of the profits derived therefrom going to somebody else.  How on earth is this a good deal for us?  I do not get it.  Private financial institutions committed not to the interests of this State or its citizens but to profit caused the financial crisis.  The Government now proposes to privatise a profitable financial institution owned by the State.  It is beyond belief.</p><p><br />  The Minister's comments that this package is part of a general situation about which we should be optimistic and that things are slowly moving in the right direction are utterly unconvincing.  The reality is that the key decision made by the Minister ensures there can be no development or growth in the domestic economy and no improvement in employment.  What we are left with is a few gestures, which I welcome, which are marginally progressive but almost meaningless in terms of what they will gather for the Exchequer.</p><p>These include increasing the level of universal social charge on people over 70 who earn more than &euro;60,000 a year and increasing the level of the universal social charge on self-employed pensioners with more than &euro;100,000 a year.  This is progressive, but so small as to be utterly insignificant.</p><p> I do not agree with tax incentives because they are focused on the same premise which caused the crisis in the first place.  This premise is that we need to incentivise parts of the private sector to deliver the investment and growth the State itself is not willing to provide.  Even here, the measures are marginal.  They are small tweaks in the research and development credit, the foreign earnings deduction and the living city initiative which, frankly, is a bit bizarre and the Minister will have to explain this one.  Why should people with Georgian houses get a particular tax break?  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but I do not see its logic.  The Bill also includes tax breaks for the aviation industry.  Aside from the specifics of these measures, the problem is they are part of the same failed approach whereby in so far as we can do anything, it is about incentivising the private sector.</p><p> These are small tweaks and extensions to the much more fundamental policy, which the Minister has refused to examine, of stating we must keep tax on the corporate sector low.  This means if we must levy taxes they must be levied on low and middle income workers.  The most important dimension of this comprises the universal social charge, which is destroying people, the household charge and water charges.  Whatever we do we must not look at corporate tax and think about increasing it or even forcing the corporate sector to pay the 12.5% it is supposed to pay.  This is what the Bill should be examining and what we should be discussing.  We need serious interrogation on this and we will deal with it on Committee Stage.</p><p> The sacred cow that low corporate taxation was the key to our economic success could possibly stand up during the period of the Celtic tiger, but four years after the collapse of the Celtic tiger can we really say this sacred cow should not be questioned?  The Minister's red-line protection of low corporate tax rates has delivered nothing in the past four years in terms of economic growth or employment.  The Minister claims a marginal increase in the export sector, but this is at the expense of the domestic economy.  There has been no net increase in employment.  This is not a vista of hope for anybody.  I propose the Minister examines whether we should do things the other way around and that we have a serious debate on this.  The universal social charge should be removed from people earning less than &euro;60,000 a year, which would cost approximately &euro;2.5 billion, and taxes on the corporate sector and those earning more than &euro;100,000 a year should be increased by &euro;2.5 billion.  This would be a combination of higher income taxes and increasing the effective tax rate paid by corporations.  This would do more to stimulate the domestic economy by creating demand on the high street and by providing us with funds for a public investment programme which could stimulate growth.</p></speech>

As I did this morning on the Order of Business, I object to the time the Bill was introduced tonight.  It is disappointing.  I recognise the Minister has a heavy schedule, and I understand he wanted to be here, but perhaps we should have moved to London with him for the next three days to debate it there or, more appropriately, we should have moved to debate it in the German parliament because we are being dictated to and our hands are tied with regard to what we can do here.  I know the Minister inherited it from the previous Government but he knew what he was getting into.  He had the books and made his predictions and promises.</p><p><br />  The Government did not have to promise anything, as I have stated many times, as it would have been elected anyway.  The Government has the finest mandate any Government ever received and it has thrown it back in the people's faces.  It accepted <i>carte blanche</i> diktats from Europe and the European Central Bank.  Last week a wonderful deal was announced, but now we do not know whether it is on or off.  The Minister's colleague in the European Parliament, Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, asked questions yesterday and Mr. Draghi could only say he would have to wait and see later in the year and there may be a court challenge.  Some friends we have in Europe, and I have stated this since the previous so-called bailout which the former Minister, Mr. Lenihan, brought home.  I described it as a clean-out.  We had to put up &#8364;17 billion of our own funds.  This was an attack on us.  I voted in favour of it and I have apologised for this several times because it was the biggest mistake I made.  I was told if I did not vote for it we would face the abyss.  How much worse could the abyss have been?  It could not have been any worse than this.  We have absolutely no solidarity from other European parliaments.  The Taoiseach continues to be the poster boy of Europe and be patted on the head and thanked, but this is real politics.</p><p><br />  I welcome one or two small items in the Finance Bill and the budget.  A fuel rebate for road hauliers was introduced in the budget.  This is something for which we fought for years and the previous Government failed to introduce it.  I welcome this.  I also welcome the inclusion of school transport and the bus fleet in an amendment.  I will table an amendment on agricultural contractors' diesel because the contractors are being penalised.  They have huge credit problems and have suffered from the bad weather of the past 18 months.  They are a vital cog in the wheel of delivering a productive agriculture sector.  We have had discussions and Government backbenchers have met a group of farm contractors.  The Government speaks about Food Harvest 2020 and Ireland's recovery being based on agriculture.  Agriculture has a huge role to play and it brought us out of the last two recessions.  It will also bring us out of this one and there has been a small pick-up.  If we have good weather this year we will have a good season.  The agricultural contractors are represented by a professional organisation covering the 32 counties and I plead with the Minister to accept the amendment I will table on agricultural contractors' diesel.</p><p><br />  I do not want to come here to knock everything, but I must mention the lack of a fuel rebate and the carbon tax on a simple bag of coal, and the short number of weeks covered by the fuel voucher scheme.  The Minister is being lobbied by my former colleague, and former Minister of State, Sean Connick, and the fuel industry.  To increase the cost of a bag of coal by &#8364;2.50 and the cost of a bale of briquettes by 50 cent is a retrograde step.  People buy a bale of briquettes every couple of days because it is all they can afford.  The increase in cost is very foolish.</p><p><br />  In recent years I have proposed a tax incentive for ordinary homeowners who want to upgrade their houses, such as through retrofitting for green energy and solar panels or upgrading them through extensions.  Allowing people to claim a tax deduction on these would kill the black economy and stimulate the economy.  It would also support small builders and tradesmen who are on the dole queues.  It would provide much needed money for the Exchequer and get rid of the rogues and cowboys in the black economy.  I do not know why the Minister does not do this.</p><p><br />  For the past four years I have also proposed, to the Minister and his predecessor, an increased tax on alcohol sold in off-licences because drink is too freely available at every street corner, shop, supermarket and filling station.  God help anybody suffering from alcohol addiction if they are off it, because drink will be in front of them anywhere they go to buy a loaf of bread or petrol.  It is wrong.  The supermarket lobby is now stronger than the vintners' lobby, which is a sad day for the country.  At present we have a scandal with horsemeat.  The large supermarkets are too powerful and are calling the tune.  At least &#8364;1 billion in revenue could have been taken and it would also have prohibited some younger people from buying alcohol and drinking it in unsupervised places.  I have teenagers and I understand the problem.  The Minister's family is a bit older but he knows what I am speaking about.  The supermarket lobby won the day against the vintners.  Every pub pays rates, taxes, wages, bills and VAT.  The vast majority involved are genuine businesspeople who uphold the laws on underage drinking, but they are not thanked for this or supported.</p><p>In Germany in the early 1930s, before the rise of you know who - I will not mention his name - certain kinds of policies were pursued, and we are going that way here now.  Our democracy is being eroded.  The Minister got the mandate but he is not responding to it.  He has flung it back in people's faces.  People voted for him because of what he said he would do, but now he is not doing it.</p><p> Ten days ago, special provisions were brought in here.  We should have learned from the last time we did it in 2008.  Bad law is made in the middle of the night.  It is ridiculous to come here at this hour.  I was due to speak at 12.40 a.m. on the Finance Bill.  We can talk about many Bills and people outside the House are watching us, but this is not the way to do business.  I appreciate that the Minister has to go away and I know how hard he is working, but we have to be real.  We should show cause to the electorate as well as listening to them, empathising with them and understanding them.</p><p> I mentioned what happened in Germany, and some of the measures in the Bill will stoke a fire in ordinary people's lives.  We should not be doing that.  We have become regressive.  On the one hand, we have gone like communists, while on the other hand we have gone so right-wing, we do not know whether we are coming or going.  Democracy, however, is the last thing on our minds.</p><p> I complimented the Taoiseach on his fulsome apology for what happened several decades ago.  The T&aacute;naiste was claiming that Labour had brought about all this change, including NewERA.  However, he blackguarded the fund the Oireachtas passed for the children's referendum.  The Government literally stole &euro;1.1 million of it.  I am not saying that, but five Supreme Court judges said so.  We should pay heed to democracy because there is no point in having tokenism.  We are supposed to be in a democracy so we should listen to the people.</p><p> There is too much interference from Big Brother.  The property tax is coming and the Government wants to put the Revenue Commissioners into people's homes.  In my home they are there already because I operate the self-assessment system.  They can come at any time to check my books, which is fine.  I am a self-employed practitioner and Deputy Mathews would know what I am talking about.  Others pay by PAYE.  There is a buffer, however, and our houses are our castles and are sacrosanct.  Why should we expect a house buyer to report on a seller?  That is snitching and informing.  I support the Garda and wish to banish the word &quot;informer&quot; in fighting crime, but this is getting worse.  The Revenue Commissioners have a job to do, but they cannot get powers to enter our bedrooms, kitchens and utility rooms.  That is over-regulation with the State becoming too powerful.  It will not be accepted. </p><p> The Minister is putting capital gains tax up from 30% to 33%, but who is advising him?  I pay tribute to the departmental officials - as did Deputy Boyd Barrett - for their work, but who is advising the Minister?  It is not any shopkeeper or businessman because nothing is happening.  There is no stimulation or spending, so how does the Minister expect to increase capital gains tax to bring in &euro;60 million?  It is not going to happen, full stop.  The Minister should ask anyone in the high street or back streets.  It has not happened and it will not happen.</p><p> I supported the previous Minister for the Environment, the former Deputy John Gormley, as well as the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, when they introduced regulations for low emissions cars.  They encouraged people to buy new cars and the scheme was supported by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  The motor industry lobbied for it and it was introduced as a fabulous success, but what happened?  The current Minister has broken a solemn commitment given by the previous Government that if a person bought a low emissions car, the tax would be low.  That argument has been dismissed, however, and it is a total breach of faith with the electorate and the public generally.  Where is the contract and bond with, and the respect for, the people?  We cannot expect the public to take this seriously.  In good faith, thousands bought low emissions cars in return for low car tax, thus stimulating the economy and keeping jobs in the motor industry.  Now, however, taxes have increased across the board.</p><p> On the night of the budget, I said the Minister would tax shrouds or habits next.  He has increased the tax on hearses this time.  Nothing is sacred for this Government.  I am not being insulting or disparaging to the Minister, but it is old hat from Fine Gael.  It is the party of big people and has refused to introduce a wealth tax.  It is the party of the landed gentry and is proving that all the time by taxing ordinary people.</p><p> The Government has said that if garda&iacute; and other front-line workers do not participate in the Croke Park talks, it will legislate for pay cuts.  The Taoiseach has said it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has also said it.  Those are bully-boy tactics, trying to frighten people, which happened in the time of the Blueshirts.  Those days are gone, however, and we must have consensus.  We must also have honesty, openness and respect in order to bring the people with us.  The Minister is not doing that.  There are no incentives or any room for people to do anything.  Worst of all, we cannot make agreements in one budget and then break faith with them in the following budget.  What kind of sour taste does that leave in the mouths of the electorate?  It is no wonder we have seen a rise in extreme left-wing parties.</p><p> I totally resent what Deputy Adams said earlier, that we should all be breathalysed coming here tonight.  It is the second time he has stated that in ten days.  If that is the way he behaves up North, that is fine.  I do not wish to tell him what he should say up there, but I resent what he said here this morning.  I resent many of the cheap, snide remarks of Sinn F&eacute;in and their cheap policies.  They have answers for everything, but in reality they have answers for nothing because their policies do not stand up in any shape or form.</p><p> Several attacks have been made on working people, including those in small businesses, which are on their knees.  How does the Minister expect them to pay the property tax or the water tax?  People are living on diminished incomes.  A friend of mine, who used to work for me 20 years ago and is now a local authority employee, phoned me this evening.  He said he had not had a pint since 24 December because he cannot afford it, that he gets up every morning and is glad to have a job to go to, but that it is diminishing and he wonders how he is going to pay the tax.  I do not know why the Minister cannot see that by now.  This is because of the troika.</p><p> The Minister should release ten or 20 officials from his Department and send them to any rural town or village.  They would see the closed shops and the lack of investment and spending power by ordinary citizens.  They would see the austerity that has come with negative policies.  The Minister should go back and tell the troika about it.  If Mr. Draghi talks about a challenge in the courts, the Minister should tell him that he will go back to the people, put it to a vote and do the decent thing.  We know what the people will say: that we have a democratic country, or are supposed to anyway, which is run autonomously, and that we cannot take any more austerity or put any more penury on our people.</p><p> We have seen the flight of the earls, with hundreds of thousands of people leaving.  We have suicides and all kinds of trauma visited on us.  The Minister knows this better than I do.  It is happening in his constituency and in mine.  On Saturday evening, I was at the household of a 29 year old who had committed suicide.  It was a lovely new house, with a young child and a partner left behind.  The anger I felt because of the problems arising from austerity was palpable.  People invested in good faith during the boom, although I know some of them were unwise given the amount they had borrowed in mortgages.  None the less, these mortgages were shovelled at them by our banks, and by European banks when our banks ran dry.</p><p> That is why I am saying that we do not owe the money the Minister has committed to paying over 35 years.  The Minister said he bought his house in 1964 or 1965.  God rest his good wife with whom he reared his family.  He paid off the mortgage and he mentioned that 25 years later it was only a month's wages.  I accept that but he had a house at the end of it.  Thank God he has a house and a family.  What will people have after paying all of this?  They will have nothing.  The evaporation of tax, hard work and sweat is driving our people to despair.  The Minister is killing the entrepreneurial spirit of business people.  If we do not have entrepreneurs, we will have nothing.</p><p> I was one of those but I am fairly battered at this stage after 32 years in business.  We need a fresh start and must educate our young people to have the courage, passion and vision to progress in various capacities in business.  They will all leave the land, however, due to the lack of incentives.  They need decent chances and breaks.  They need to be rewarded for their work and, above all, to be able to employ people and have respect.  It has nothing to do with Croke Park, but all small employers have a wonderful relationship with their employees.  There is a bond there whereby they work and respect each other.  We need that.</p><p> On the corporation tax, I differ totally with my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  South Tipperary is one of the capitals of the pharmaceutical industry and we should maintain that.  The 12.5% corporation tax must certainly be paid and, if not, it is up to our officials.  I would blame Revenue for that.</p></speech>

I do not want to frighten them away from our shores because we need them.  I am a small-scale entrepreneur and I know that we need stimulation and initiatives.  Above all, we need our people at work.  They must have dignity and be respected for what they do.</p><p>  At this time, the people of Ireland need hope and a vision for the future in order to get rid of depression and suicide.  A small bit of stimulation is required because austerity is not working.  The Minister knows this better than I do.</p></speech>
