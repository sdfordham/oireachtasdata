    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1188" speakername="Colm Keaveney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600003#A00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to make special provision for independent voting by visually impaired, incapacitated and illiterate voters.  As matters stand, many visually impaired persons are unable to vote independently under the current electoral system.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I am bringing forward this Bill in order to facilitate greater access to and ease of use of the voting system for visually impaired members of society.</p>  <p>  As has been highlighted for the National Disability Authority in a 2012 discussion paper, many visually impaired persons are currently unable to vote independently under the electoral system.  There are a number of methods by which they may exercise their democratic franchise.  They may bring a trusted companion into the voting booth, review the large-print ballot paper available at each polling station to help them mark their own ballot paper or ask the presiding officer for assistance with marking their ballot paper.  This situation is inadequate for many, particularly those who are visually impaired who would like to vote independently, just like any other voter.</p><p> The National Council of the Blind in Ireland has in the past called for the implementation of alternative methods of voting for those with sight loss.  Complaints have been made to both the Ombudsman and the Irish Human Rights Commission about the inaccessibility of the voting procedure for persons with sight loss.</p> <p> The 2006 CSO National Disability Survey revealed that there were approximately 48,000 adults in Ireland who had substantial difficulties in seeing for everyday activities.  More than half of these were aged 65 or over at the time of the survey.  Some 2,300 could not see at all.  With the correct aids, some with significant sight loss may still retain some useful vision.  The National Disability Survey data indicated that 16,000 persons used a magnifier, large print materials or Braille reading materials, with about 3,500 using large print or Braille on computers.  Approximately 1,900 used a screen reader when using a computer and 3,900 used audible or tactile devices.</p> <p> Those with sight loss and difficulties reading and writing and with capacity face additional obstacles when voting.  Some of these obstacles can be addressed by the development of appropriate guidelines and practices to ensure accessible voting for all those entitled to vote at an election or referendum.  This Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2015 aims to operate side by side with those guidelines and practices and to give statutory footing to the facilitation of independent voting for those with sight loss.</p> <p> The Bill aims to extend the time during which those with sight loss can vote with the assistance of a companion by reducing the timeframe during which the presiding officer can refuse to allow visually impaired voters to vote with assistance.  It also proposes to remove the word "blind" from electoral law and seeks to encompass all visually impaired persons who cannot vote independently due to sight loss.  The Bill retains the categorisation of visually impaired persons together with those who cannot vote independently due to literacy difficulties or incapacity.</p> <p> The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for independent voting by persons who are visually impaired, illiterate or incapacitated.  This is achieved at referenda through the use of templates.  It also provides for independent voting at elections through the use of electronically-assisted mechanisms.</p> <p> Electronically assisted voting is used in Australia and Oregon in the United States to allow those with sight loss to vote independently.  It utilises software on a computer or a telephone to generate a printed ballot paper that records the voter's preference.  Critically, it is distinguished from electronic voting by virtue of the fact that it is printed on paper, and goes into the same collection and counting procedure as every other vote. The vote is not recorded or counted electronically.</p> <p> The Bill preserves the option of voting with a companion and reduces the time in which a presiding officer, in presidential or D&aacute;il election, can refuse a request by visually impaired, incapacitated and illiterate voter to vote with the assistance of a companion.  It is important to note that voters can be denied, up to two hours from the closing of the ballot by a presiding officer, such companionship or the right to vote at an election.</p> <p> The Bill will operate together with existing provisions for assisted voting by visually impaired, incapacitated and illiterate voters and provides the additional option to vote independently, following the provision of assistance or without any assistance at all.  The Bill will operate side by side with wider guidelines providing for greater access to voting for persons with sight loss and intellectual disabilities.</p> <p> Section 1, contains the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement.  It provides that the Act may be cited as the Referendum Act 2014 and provides that the Act can be cited together with the Referendum Acts, 1992-1998, and construed together as one.  Section 2 provides for definitions of certain terms used in the Act.</p> <p> Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 103 of the Act of 1992 by removing the word "blind" and replacing it with the "visually impaired".  It also reduces the time during which the presiding officer can refuse to allow an elector to vote with the assistance of a companion, from two hours to one hour before the close of the poll.</p> <p> Section 4 provides the definition of a "tactile voting template" and provides for the form of a tactile voting template at a constitutional referendum and an ordinary referendum and provides for the form of the template in the Schedule to the Act.  A "tactile ballot template" means a folder of card or light plastic, with information thereon identifiable by touch, that allows for the ballot paper to be marked through openings in the tactile ballot template by inserting the ballot paper into the tactile ballot template.</p> <p> Section 5 provides that the section will apply in every constitutional and every ordinary referendum.  It provides that, during a referendum, a tactile ballot template shall be available for use at every polling station.  It provides that a presidential elector who satisfies the presiding officer that his or her sight is so impaired that he or she cannot vote unassisted, may request that his or her ballot paper be placed inside a tactile ballot template and may mark his or her ballot paper through a tactile ballot template.</p><p>It provides that where a presidential elector has requested to mark his or her ballot paper using a tactile ballot template, the presiding officer may assist the elector by reading out in full the particulars stated on the ballot paper, but shall not assist the elector by marking the ballot paper on his or her behalf.  It also provides that the presiding officer may refuse to assist the elector by reading out the particulars of the ballot paper if the request is made within one hour of the time fixed for the close of the poll and that in such circumstances, the elector may still elect to mark his paper using a tactile template.  Section 6 provides for the insertion of a third Schedule into the Act of 1994.</p> <p> Part 3 sets out the principal elements of the Bill.  Section 7 defines certain terms used in Part 2 of the Bill.  Section 8 states that Part 2 does not create an entitlement to vote by electronically assisted voting.</p> <p> Section 9 provides for the approval by the Minister of a computer programme and a printer to be used for electronically assisted voting.  It sets out the properties that the programme and printer must have in order to ensure as far as possible that this form of voting mirrors voting in the ordinary way before they are approved by the Minister.  This section also provides for the computer programme to be known as "an approved computer program".   The computer programme will enable a visual display and auditory description, including the names and order of the candidates and other details about the candidates as they appear on the ballot paper.  It will enable voting instructions to be provided to an elector.  It will allow the voter to read a description of the candidates and voting instructions on a visual display and to listen to the description of the candidates and voting instructions through personal listening devices.  The computer programme will allow an elector to vote using a touch screen or keyboard.  It will enable a voter to select consecutive preferences beginning with the number 1.  Importantly, it will allow an elector to spoil his or her vote just as any other elector might opt to do in line with his or her democratic right.</p> <p> The programme also allows an elector to correct a mistake before the vote proceeds into the computer process.  It allows an elector to abandon the ballot without completing the vote.  It can, through a printing device, produce a paper record of each vote cast to enable the counting of votes in the election.  I want it to be noted that the computer programme will not retain a record of the vote that has been cast.  This will prevent any person from ascertaining the vote of a particular elector.  Section 9 also provides for a printing device to be used together with the approved computer programme, provided that the printing device can be loaded with, and print upon, a ballot paper and is capable of printing a record of the vote cast by an elector by marking the ballot paper in the appropriate space.  In addition, the ink or font used by the printer must be of such a colour and of such characteristics that, as far as practicable, the mark made on the ballot paper resembles a mark made by manually marking the ballot paper with a pencil.</p> <p> Section 10 provides that at least one polling place in every local election area shall be designated as "an electronically assisted voting centre".  To protect the secrecy of the ballot, it states that no polling place should be used exclusively as an electronically assisted voting centre.  Section 11 provides for the designation of a screened area, known as "an electronically assisted voting compartment", which should contain a computer with an approved computer programme installed, such audio or visual equipment as may be necessary, a printer approved by the Minister and any other furniture the presiding officer considers necessary on the day.  Section 12 provides that the ballot paper used in an electronically assisted voting compartment shall be indistinguishable from the ballot paper use by other electors at the election.</p> <p> Section 13 provides that, not less than ten days before polling, an elector whose name is not on the postal list or the special voters list who satisfies the returning officer that he or she is unable to vote without assistance, by reason of his or her vision being so impaired, he or she being physically incapacitated, or he or she being unable to read or write, may apply to vote at an electronically assisted voting centre.  The location of the polling place at which he or she is authorised to vote should be contained in an authorisation form provided by the providing officer.  It provides that the elector must provide such evidence in the form of documents as may be necessary to satisfy the returning officer.</p> <p> Section 14 provides that an elector who has been authorised to vote at an electronically assisted voting centre or who is already on the register of electors in a polling place which has been designated as an electronically assisted voting centre and satisfies the presiding officer that his or her vision is so impaired, he or she is otherwise physically incapacitated or he or she is unable to read or write to such an extent that he is unable to vote without assistance, may vote at an electronically assisted voting centre using an electronically assisted voting system.  That was one sentence.  This section reserves the right of visually impaired, incapacitated and illiterate voters to elect to vote with a companion in accordance with section 103 of the 1992 Act.</p> <p> Section 15 provides for the means by which an elector votes using an electronically assisted voting system.  It provides that a vote using an electronically assisted system shall be the same as a vote in the ordinary way and that the ballot paper cannot be rejected solely on the grounds that it was marked using a printing device.  It provides that the validity of the vote cast cannot be disputed on the ground that the elector could have voted without assistance.</p> <p> Section 16 provides for arrangements to ensure the computer programme and electronic devices used or intended to be used for or in connection with electronically assisted voting are kept secure and free from interference and the integrity of voting is maintained while electronically assisted voting is being used.  It provides for the offence of damaging, destroying or interfering with any computer programme, data file, audio equipment or electronic device, including a printing device, which is used, or intended to be used, for or in connection with electronically assisted voting and for the penalties for that offence.  The Schedule provides for the form of the third Schedule to be inserted into the 1994 Act and for the form of the tactile voting template in a constitutional referendum and in an ordinary referendum.</p> <p> I ask Deputies to pay special attention to the distinction between electronically assisted voting and electronic voting.  What is proposed in this Bill is emphatically not electronic voting.  No record of the vote will be retained by the computer and the counting of the vote will be done in the manner to which we are accustomed, with tally men and women and everything else that adds to the buzz of an election count.  This Bill is simply another step in providing greater equality for people with disabilities.  It provides a method by which people with a visual impairment or who are illiterate may vote in a manner that protects the privacy of their ballot to the same extent as the majority of people enjoy.  It is my sincere hope that the Government accepts the Bill.  I will be happy to discuss and debate any need or requirement for an amendment, if that is what is offered by the Government, with Deputies on both sides of the House.  I thank Deputies for making themselves available this morning.  I also thank those whose dedication, commitment and actions have contributed to this wonderful Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the spirit of this Bill positively and to act in conjunction with the Opposition in fulfilling the obligations set out in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600005#C00200"><p>I acknowledge the work that has gone into the preparation of this Bill by Deputy Keaveney and in bringing it to the House.  The Government agrees with the principle of advancing the needs of voters with particular disabilities.  This is at the heart of the Bill before the House.  Therefore, I can say at this early stage that we will not be opposing it on Second Stage.  The right to vote is a core democratic principle.  It is a fundamental right of anybody who is eligible to vote.  Over the years, successive Governments have introduced legislation to better assist voting by voters with disabilities of one type or another.  I see the Bill as a further progression in that vein.  The Department's disability sectoral plans have been supportive of examining independent voting.  A number of aspects of the Bill will require careful examination before it is brought through the further Stages of the legislative process.  I refer, in particular, to the provisions in Part 3 regarding electronically assisted voting.</p>  <p>  In the Electoral Acts, we recognise that people with disabilities have particular needs.  The provisions in these Acts are designed to make the voting process as accessible and inclusive as possible.  At the same time, these provisions aim to ensure the integrity of the ballot is maintained and secrecy is provided for to the extent practicable.  Our electoral procedures aim to strike an appropriate and reasonable balance in that regard.</p>  <p>  Several measures have been introduced over the years on an incremental basis to meet the needs of voters with particular disabilities.  It might be useful if I outline briefly for the House some of these measures before addressing directly the measures proposed in this Bill.  A number of the measures that have been taken address physical disability directly.  Local authorities, in making polling schemes, are obliged to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users.</p><p>Returning officers must, in addition, where practicable, give public notice not later than eight days before polling day of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users.  If an elector has difficulty gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.  In addition, the option of postal voting by voters living at home is available to those who cannot go to the polling station due to a physical disability or illness.</p> <p> The Department issues guidance to returning officers in advance of elections and referendums.  The guidance includes an accessibility checklist in relation to the selection of polling stations.  The checklist is based on the National Disability Authority's publication, Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach.</p> <p> The Electoral Acts specifically provide for voters at polling stations who satisfy the presiding officer that their sight is so impaired that they are unable to vote without assistance.  The Electoral Acts also have similar provisions for voters who are physically incapacitated or unable to read or write.  Those voters can all avail of companion voting or voting with the assistance of the presiding officer.  The focus of the provisions is to facilitate the voters concerned while endeavouring to ensure that the integrity of the ballot is maintained.</p> <p> To act as a companion at an election, for example, a person must be at least 16 years of age, must be neither a candidate nor the agent of a candidate at the election, and may not assist more than two voters at an election.  The presiding officer must not permit a companion to assist a voter unless he or she is satisfied that the companion fulfils the conditions.  If a person is not eligible to act as a companion, the voter can have another person act as a companion or he or she may ask to be assisted by the presiding officer.</p> <p> Where the presiding officer assists the voter, he or she marks the ballot paper in accordance with the instructions.  The Department's manual for presiding officers suggests that the presiding officer and personation agent go with a voter to a voting compartment, or to a part of the polling station where a conversation in normal tones cannot be overheard, in order to mark the ballot paper.  The manual also suggests that, if necessary, the presiding officer can suspend entry to the polling station and have the station cleared to ensure that no other person can overhear the voting process.  I have witnessed that in the past, as I am sure the Deputies present have.</p> <p> The provisions of the Electoral Acts providing for the inclusion of photographs and party political emblems on ballot papers were designed to assist voters with visual impairment and literacy difficulty.  Likewise, the requirement on the presiding officer to display a large print version of an election ballot paper in the polling station is aimed at assisting voters with visual impairment.  More recently, changes were made to the format of the referendum ballot paper.  The new format ballot papers were used at last month's referendums.  The changes made included the use of different and generally larger font sizes, together with better use of upper and lower case letters, and the use of bold lettering and shading.</p> <p> Following the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad in October 2013, concerns were raised about confusion among voters in respect of the design, text and language of the ballot paper used at the referendum.  The Department reviewed the format of the ballot paper in consultation with the National Adult Literacy Association and the National Council for the Blind.  Arising from that, significant formatting changes were made to the ballot paper.  While not meeting all of their requirements, both organisations were agreed that the new format of ballot paper was a big improvement on the one previously used.  The introduction of the changes reflect a willingness on the part of the Department to make changes to assist people with visual or literacy difficulties.  While the measures in place to assist voters with disabilities are helpful, it could be argued that they fall short of independent voting.</p> <p> I understand Deputy Keaveney's Bill is intended to address that while, at the same time, leaving in place the existing range of measures to assist such voters.  In Part 2, it is proposed to achieve that end at referendums for voters with visual impairments through the use of templates made of card or light plastic, more commonly known as tactile voting devices.  Tactile voting devices are used at elections in the UK and other European countries.  The Department has had their use under consideration in the light of trials undertaken by the National Disability Authority in June 2014.  In its January 2015 report on the trials, the National Disability Authority commented on the current generation of tactile voting devices.  It stated that they were unlikely to provide a workable solution under the Irish single transferable vote system.  However, the authority recommended that the Department should consider the use of tactile voting devices at a referendum, where there are only two choices to be made in voting, namely, "Yes" or "No".  Arising from that recommendation, the Department is examining the scope for the use of tactile voting devices at referendums.  This includes consideration of costs, technical specifications, procurement, legislative provision, training and information for polling station staff and for voters.</p> <p> In Part 3, it is proposed to achieve independent voting for voters who are visually impaired, physically incapacitated or illiterate through the use of electronically assisted voting at D&aacute;il, European, local and presidential elections.  The Bill proposes that this would be done through the provision of dedicated computers, at least one to be provided in each polling place in each electoral area.  I understand that the intention is that the voters involved would interact with the computer to produce a marked ballot paper which would be indistinguishable from all other marked ballot papers at that election.  While the Department is not aware of the particular device that the Deputy has in mind, the Department is aware that electronically assisted voting options have been made available in some jurisdictions for use by voters with visual and other impairments.</p> <p> The Deputy's proposal will need to be considered in detail in the progression of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am aware that the January 2015 report of the National Disability Authority commented that computerised and telephone voting raises issues around the security and integrity of the ballot as well as logistical and cost challenges.  The authority also noted in its report that while voting by computer worked for some voters in the trials undertaken, "some people with sight loss, especially older people, would be unlikely to be comfortable with such technologies".</p> <p> Nonetheless, the authority recommended in its January 2015 report that the feasibility of electronic vote casting be explored by the Department and discussed with the National Disability Authority and relevant disability organisations.  It would seem to be the case, therefore, that any proposal to introduce electronically assisted voting would require detailed research, assessment, testing and costing.  It is not clear whether this has been undertaken for the proposal in Part 3.</p> <p> In concluding my contribution at this stage, I wish to say that any initiative to improve voting arrangements for voters with visual impairment, physical disabilities or literacy difficulties is worthy of support.  That said, there are aspects of the Bill that would require careful examination on Committee Stage, in particular the workability of the provisions in Part 3 for electronically assisted voting.  While measures have been taken in the development of the electoral code over the years to better assist such voters, I acknowledge there is always room for improvement.  I again commend Deputy Keaveney for raising this very important issue and for taking the initiative in introducing the Bill.  I look forward to working with him and with other Members of the House on it.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600006#D00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I commend Deputy Keaveney on introducing it.  Independent voting rights are very important and the Deputy has set out a strong case in the Bill to assist people with sight difficulties.  In general, we support the Bill.  Clearly, much work has gone into preparing the legislation and it is obvious that those drafting the Bill consulted closely with people who have sight loss and put a great deal of consideration into it.</p>  <p>  The technical aspects of the proposal are complex but presumably they are similar to systems which operate in other jurisdictions.  While the object of the Bill is to facilitate independent voting, it is welcome that it preserves the right of visually impaired voters to be assisted to a certain extent by a companion.  That is essential, as many people, particularly the elderly with visual impairment, would not have much experience of electronic equipment or computers.</p>  <p>  I am somewhat confused as to the provision of tactile voting for referendums and in presidential elections but not in D&aacute;il or local elections.  Perhaps that is due to the greater complexity of such elections.  Deputy Keaveney might elaborate on the point when he responds to the Bill.</p>  <p>  I assume the provision of a computer will constitute the main technical assistance in elections, in addition to the existing right of the visually impaired and those with reading difficulties to have a companion with them to assist them in filling out the ballot paper.  The proposals to allow greater time for people to be registered and then turn up at a polling centre are sensible.</p><p>The Minister of State spoke about access but there is still a problem with wheelchair access at polling stations.  That should be examined again in respect of each centre to improve the access for people with mobility problems.  <br/><br/>A raft of other changes are required to existing electoral legislation.  We dealt with the issue of establishing an electoral commission at the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht this week.  It is noticeable that there is general cross-party consensus on not only the need for such a body but that it would be established as soon as possible, preferably before the next election.  We are realistic that everything cannot be transferred over too quickly but elements of the process could be transferred over.  If we had an electoral commission, it could deal with many of the problems that arise in regard to registration, ballot papers and so on, and it would be the ideal place to deal with the proposals contained in this Bill.  It would also be able to assess the technical aspects of the proposal and recommend what would need to be done in a relatively short space of time whereas leaving such matters to <i>ad hoc</i>committees and various bodies set up from time to time means there is a delay in implementing necessary changes.  Changes made in the past have not always been properly thought through before being put in place.  We know that from the godforsaken e-voting machines, which incurred a large initial cost and a huge hang-over cost while we had them for many years.  The ongoing confusion with regard to the layout of referendum ballots is another issue that could be dealt with by such a body. <br/><br/>I published a Bill in the recent past proposing the lowering of the voting age to 16.  The Minister, Fine Gael and the Labour Party should not be afraid of 16 and 17 year olds voting.  While the Government&rsquo;s position is to lower the voting age to 17, it has not given an indication as to when it will implement it measure.  Will it implement it prior to the next general election, as promised, or will it fall by the wayside, off the Fine Gael-the Labour Party bandwagon.  I also proposed that, given the still large discrepancies regarding the register of electors, personal public service, PPS, numbers be used to automatically register a person on reaching the age of 18 or the age of voting, whatever we may determine that to be.  I have heard various objections to, and questions about, this, but I am sure they could be ironed out and with their use, we would have less of a problem than we currently have given that there we have 200,000 more people on the register than are recorded in the census of population.<br/><br/>Registering people by PPS numbers could be verified by another independent verifier held by State bodies.  It would also represent what would be a positive move away from a household registration system.  It would reduce the risk of election fraud, which we all want to address.  It would solve some of the problems linked to people changing address.  It is not good enough to have one's registration tied to an address because people, particularly younger people, change jobs more frequently and they move to take up studies.  People who have been living at the same address and have been on the register for years can go to their polling station and find they have removed from the register.  <br/><br/>I met people from the Union of Students of Ireland this week and they have produced a good document on this subject, which I commend to the Minister of State.  That document contains several valid points showing where improvements can be made.  They are sensible proposals.  They make the case for people being able to register online rather than go through the process of filling in forms and having to go to a Garda station and local government offices.  Care would have to be taken to verify online registration but with the proper safeguards, it would increase the number of young people registering to vote.  The outcome of the recent referendum showed that young people are interested in voting, contrary to what many people belief.<br/><br/>We still have not got around to finding time to discuss the fifth Constitutional Convention report on voting rights.  On two occasions in the past few weeks, it has been put on the D&aacute;il schedule and then taken off due to time constraints.  I hope that time is found to discuss it as it deals with important issues in regard to Irish citizens outside of the State having the right to vote in Presidential and Seanad elections, for which there is broad support.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports that right, especially given that Irish citizens living in the North have been candidates in the past and, hopefully, will be candidates in the future, for the office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  Several people, including the late former Senator Gordon Wilson and others from the North, have been appointed to the Seanad by various parties.<br/><br/>I wish to state my general support, and that of my party, for this Bill but I also call for the establishment of an electoral commission before the next general election.  The Minister of State should not wait until after that.  Such a body would be the most suitable way to deal a wide range of issues, including some of the issues arising in this Bill.  <br/><br/>As the Minister of State is here this morning, I want to raise with him his abuse of the D&aacute;il in stitching the water Bill as an amendment-----</p></speech>

We support the principle of advancing the needs of voters with disabilities of one type of another.  In my earlier contribution, I outlined some of the main measures that had been taken over the years to assist voting by people with disabilities.  I think all sides of the House have been, and continue to be, well disposed to doing whatever is feasible to advance this agenda.  While the range of measures we have in place is commendable, there is always room for improvement and I want to acknowledge that also.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority in June 2014, in the trials that it had undertaken and that were reported on by the authority in January 2015, has been very helpful.  Its report identifies options for consideration and some of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the advancement of independent voting.  The Department has taken up the recommendations in the National Disability Authority's report in regard to the use of tactile voting devices at referendums and is currently examining the scope for their use.  As I said earlier, the workability of the proposal in the Bill to provide for electronically-assisted voting will also require detailed examination in due course.  In our examination of these proposals, we should always keep in mind the integrity of the ballot, and I believe Deputies will agree with that.</p>  <p>  Some questions were asked about the establishment of an electoral commission.  Its establishment is a commitment in the programme for Government.   It was also a recommendation of the fourth report of the Constitutional Convention.  The Government accepted the recommendation of the convention and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published a consultation paper on 27 January 2015 to commence the pre-legislative process leading to the establishment of the commission.  </p><p>I thank Deputy Keaveney for the work he has put into the Bill.  We are not opposing it on Second Stage.  It is something we need to evaluate continuously to see how we can improve access for voters who have a right and a franchise to vote in elections and referendums.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1188" speakername="Colm Keaveney" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600008#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, for indicating that the Government would not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  In respect of his concerns about Part 3 of the Bill, I believe adequate provisions are made to protect the integrity and secrecy of the ballot.  I am sure we will mutually see the benefits of that integrity on Second Stage.</p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the Bill is that a person with a visual impairment, or who is illiterate, may vote in a manner similar to any other person without being disadvantaged by the inequality born out of their disability.  Part of this is that they should enjoy the privacy and secrecy of the ballot along with every other citizen.  We have proposed the use of a technology to facilitate this.  It cannot be beyond the scope of human genius to create a printed font that resembles the mark of a pencil, to make the ballot paper indistinguishable from any other ballot.  As to the cost of the challenge, the Bill does not propose to make electronically assisted voting machines mandatory.  The Bill as drafted would allow for the kind of careful roll-out that the Minister of State discussed and, as practicably as possible, would ensure that integrity is built into its measures.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Stanley for his helpful contributions.  While it is not covered in the Bill, I agree that polling stations do not adequately provide for persons who use wheelchairs.  I recently witnessed the experiences of a number of people who had access disabilities when voting in the referendum.  The reason for restricting tactile ballots to referendums and Presidential elections has to do with the complexity of extending them to other elections, given the variety of ballot papers that can be used.  We should look at this in the future, as Deputy Stanley has said.  I would be happy to discuss with Deputy Stanley, or with the Minister of State, any improving amendments within the spirit of the Bill.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the working group, some of whose members have visual impairments.  Its members have shared their concerns around literacy and have helped bring the Bill into the Chamber today.  The issue is of cross-party concern and I hope we will continue in this focused spirit on the remaining Stages of the Bill.  We should all work together in the interests of those who are listening and watching today, and who hope they have an equal right to exhaust their mandate in secrecy and independently.  We should ensure that any advantage given to able-bodied people is, irrespective of the cost, but within reason, afforded to people who have disabilities or are illiterate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

At the outset, I would like to address the way in which the House orders and does its business.  The legislation was drafted about this time last year in response to a particular fiasco that had developed.  It has taken 12 months to reach the floor of the House, which says a lot about the way we do our business.  The legislation was proposed to deal with a matter which was pertinent at that time.  Since the event has now passed, the Bill could be seen as somewhat irrelevant.  Nonetheless, it is still important that we address the matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will recall the cancellation of the five Garth Brooks concerts in Croke Park as the result of a decision by Dublin City Council not to grant a licence for three additional concerts.  The decision impacted greatly on the 400,000 people who had purchased tickets to attend the event.  It also impacted on Ireland's tourism product, as 70,000 tickets had been sold outside the State and people were due to travel from many different jurisdictions across Europe, North America and further afield to attend what they believed would be a spectacular event.  They had booked hotels and paid for their tickets.  In my view, the decision by the council had a very damaging impact on Ireland's reputation as a tourism and event destination.</p>  <p>  The residents rightly raised concerns about the potential impact of the concerts on their lives.  The fiasco revealed a lack of certainty in the legislation.  I do not believe the legislation as it currently stands adequately addresses all the potential concerns in respect of outdoor events of this nature.  Nor do I believe that the proposals that the Government has brought forward adequately address the problem.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, assured us at the time that he would begin a process of consultation with all stakeholders, community leaders, event promoters, venue owners, etc., to bring forward a set of proposals to ensure something like this could never happen again.  It seems to me that the guidelines announced by him and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, in the last couple of days are a hastily put-together response in the knowledge that this Bill, published last year, would be discussed in the House today.  The changes in regulation are really all based on a pre-consultation discussion between the promoter and the relevant local authority.  It is possible to study the transcripts of the meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>When the interested parties came before us and gave their evidence, it was clear a number of pre-application consultations had taken place between Aiken Promotions, Dublin City Council and Croke Park.  The representatives of Croke Park, Aiken Promotions and Dublin City Council accepted the planning authority had indicated to the promoter and venue owner that five concerts would be possible.  The Minister of State knows from a planning point of view that pre-consultation and pre-planning meetings are usually careful in their deliberations, because until such time as the entire application is lodged and the process complete it is not a certainty.  A pre-consultation prior to the lodging of an application will not give certainty to the promoter, the ticket purchaser or the venue owner.  What the Government has done is just tinkering around the edges.  No effort has been made to put in place a comprehensive plan for the licensing of outdoor events.<br/><br/>My Bill, in the absence of an appropriate framework for licensing outdoor events which would provide certainty for all concerned, sought to give the Minister powers effectively to provide a licence.  The Bill is about conferring powers on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to grant a licence for events in exceptional circumstances.  The Bill states:<blockquote>Where a licence has been refused under section 231 by a local authority or where a local authority has granted a licence subject to conditions, the Minister may, if he deems it appropriate and believes the event is of national and cultural importance, review the decision of the local authority and may grant a licence or remove conditions imposed by the local authority provided that&mdash;(a) the Minister notifies persons and bodies which must be consulted in relation to a licence that he is reviewing the local authority&rsquo;s decision,<br /><br />(b) the Minister gives the persons and bodies which must be consulted in relation to the grant of a licence 7 days within which to make submissions.</blockquote>The Minister would make a decision based on the national or international importance of the event and its considerable benefit to the State.<br/><br/>I am still at a loss as to why the Government has not put in place the appropriate legislative framework.  The Garth Brooks fiasco to which this legislation sought to respond could easily happen again under the changes the Government is making.  If a promoter were to enter into a discussion through a pre-consultation process with a local authority and receive the same assurances or same type of tacit support or acceptance of the proposal as was given to Aiken Promotions and Croke Park by Dublin City Council at the time we could still end up in the same situation, whereby four weeks prior to the event taking place permission for the licence could ultimately be refused, creating exactly the same scenario of which we are aware.<br/><br/>The period of time for lodging an application has been extended from ten weeks to 13 weeks.  I remind the Minister of State with regard to the Garth Brooks event that Aiken Promotions submitted the licence application 14 weeks prior to the date of the first concert.  The Minister of State knows the impact of the decisions taken then were economically assessed to have cost the city and the region around Dublin approximately &euro;50 million in lost revenue due to the cancellation of these events.  Unfortunately, in my view the proposals the Government has brought forward this week will in no way prevent this happening again and give no certainty whatsoever.<br/><br/>The regulations do not provide for an appeals mechanism, despite an attempt by the Department to suggest otherwise.  There is no independent review of event licensing decisions which will take into account the impact of the decisions made locally and in the wider community.  The Government now suggests that a decision by a local authority to grant or not a licence four weeks prior to an event allows for the normal statutory process of a judicial review.  We all accept a judicial review has no real powers in this regard and it does not give any further assistance or help to those who either promote such an event or assist the venue holders in offering their services.  The new regulations announced by the Government will in no way resolve the issue.<br/><br/>In future, event promoters will not be allowed to sell tickets before consulting local authorities.  This is pre-consultation.  If they have a conversation and there is tacit acceptance by the local authority the event should go ahead, they can go ahead and sell the tickets which they must do to ensure a demand for them in the first instance.  This still gets us back to where we were at the outset.<br/><br/>In attempting to find a resolution it was my expectation the Department would have drafted legislation to ensure certainty about each particular venue in the State.  Without requiring planning permission, Croke Park can host three major events in a year, as is the case with the Aviva Stadium, but none of the other potential locations in the country has access to this facility.  I would have thought the best way to resolve this and ensure such an event never happens again would be to draw up a framework by which venues could apply for the issuance of a licence in perpetuity detailing a number of events per year.  This happens in other countries.  Thomond Park in Limerick, Nolan Park or another stadium as part of an ongoing process could apply for and be granted a set number of events of particular size and scale on an annual basis and have this in perpetuity.  If this were in place and was part of the solution we would go a long way towards resolving the problem.<br/><br/>Promoters have a particular difficulty with the licensing regime as it exists because they are trying to attract international acts and compete with other countries.  They also compete with other events taking place in these stadia.  It is a difficult challenge for them to attract these acts which are of significant benefit to the State in terms of economic activity and attracting tourism, and unfortunately the proposals brought forward by the Minister of State will not resolve or give any certainty to those people attempting to develop this business.<br/><br/>The proposals the Minister of State has brought forward do not resolve the issue.  They give more lead time and perhaps assist through the consultation process, but we still need a detailed appeals mechanism.  On this basis will the Minister of State give consideration to accepting the Bill I published almost a year ago, and allow the Department and the Minister to have powers in special circumstances to overturn a decision by a local authority in the interests of the economic activity of the region and the State in general?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600009#G00200"><p>I thank Deputy Dooley for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill and acknowledge it is well-intentioned in its aim to address some of the issues the Deputy has outlined which occurred last year with regard to the fiasco to which he referred.  It gives me an opportunity to set out the Government's position and I am happy to debate it with the Deputy.  The response to it from the Government is all about striking the balance in licensing large-scale events.  I am happy to outline this in more detail in my response.</p>  <p>  Deputy Dooley's Bill, which essentially proposes amendments to the event licensing provisions in the Planning and Development Act, is short and succinct and comprises two main elements.  It proposes that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government can review and overturn the decision of a local authority regarding an event licence application if the Minister deems the event is of national or cultural importance.  It also proposes that the Minister can remove conditions attached by a local authority to an event licence.</p><p> Second, it proposes that the Minister can remove conditions attached by a local authority to an event licence.</p> <p> The Bill is silent on the meaning of the term "events of national or cultural importance".  I would have liked to see more detail on that definition.</p> <p> Deputy Dooley's Bill is a repeat of a Private Members' Bill tabled last year on the same subject, and we all know the background to this Bill, as has been explained to the House.  It relates to issues that arose in relation to the granting of event licences at Croke Park last year, specifically the number of events that could be held at the venue over the period of a calendar year.</p> <p> The 1993 planning permission for the redevelopment of Croke Park allows for the holding of three special events, such as concerts, per calendar year subject to the approval of an event management plan by Dublin City Council.  Any further events in excess of this number require the submission of an event licence application by the promoters of the events to Dublin City Council.  I note that the Deputy mentioned Thomond Park and other venues.  The Aviva Stadium and Thomond Park have planning permission for three specific events by condition.</p> <p> The problems that arose last year occurred when, after three events had already been held at Croke Park under the terms of its planning permission, an application for a licence for further events on five consecutive nights in July was submitted.  This was exacerbated by the advertising and selling of tickets for all five nights prior to the submission of the application for the necessary event licences.  Even though Dublin City Council subsequently granted a licence for three of the five additional concerts, the promoter and artist in question eventually cancelled the concerts for all five nights, leaving many people who had purchased tickets disappointed.  As Deputy Dooley acknowledged, it was also a huge blow to the economy.</p> <p> Dublin City Council cited a number of reasons for its decision to grant a licence for three of the nights applied for.  These included the scale and number of concerts proposed; the anticipated attendance of in excess of 80,000 people per night over five consecutive nights, which would be unprecedented for Croke Park; the fact that the stadium is located in a heavily populated residential area; and also that holding concerts on five consecutive nights, in addition to the three that had already been held, would represent an over-intensification of the use of the stadium, imposing an unfair burden and level of disruption on local residents.</p> <p> Moving on to the specific content of Deputy Dooley's Bill, I note that the planning system has been modified in recent decades to specifically preclude political interference or involvement in planning-related decisions.  As we all know, political interference in the planning system has in the past caused many problems, leading among other things to long and costly tribunals, and it is important that we do not return to those times.  In this regard, section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 specifically precludes the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government from exercising any power or control in any particular case with which a planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, is or may be concerned.  In proposing to bring the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government back into the planning decision-making process, albeit only in relation to event licences, Deputy Dooley's Bill runs contrary to these section 30 provisions which have established an important principle that political interference in the planning system should no longer be allowed.  We have moved on from this and we should not be returning to past practices.</p> <p> In addition, conditions attaching to event licences are generally concerned with public safety issues and mitigating against possible risks, including securing the safety of those attending the venue, maintaining public order, noise and traffic management, and the minimisation of disruption to the neighbourhood in which the event is to be held.  Such matters, which are dealt with by way of conditions attached to licences, are most appropriately dealt with at local level by local authorities in consultation with the principal response agencies, while also having regard to the views of local residents, and should not involve the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p> Arising from the events of last year, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, announced a comprehensive review of the event licensing legislative regime with a view to preventing this type of scenario from happening again, establishing a review group for this purpose comprising representatives of all relevant stakeholders.  The review group conducted its deliberations over the period October 2014 to March 2015 and submitted recommendations to the Minister and me in April, following which I signed new amending event licensing regulations just last week, which will come into effect on 1 October this year.</p> <p> The main changes incorporated in the new regulations include that it will now be mandatory for event promoters to have a pre-application consultation meeting with the relevant local authority prior to submitting an event licence application.  Event licence applications will not be accepted by a local authority unless a pre-application consultation meeting has already taken place with the event promoter.  Event promoters will not be entitled to advertise or sell tickets for events prior to the holding of a pre-application consultation meeting with the relevant local authority.  Event licensing applications must be lodged with the relevant local authority at least 13 weeks in advance of the proposed event.  Local authorities must make their decision on an event licence application no later than four weeks in advance of the proposed event.  Where it is proposed to add performances to a schedule already announced, a further pre-application consultation meeting will be required to take place before the announcement of any additional dates.</p> <p> Deputy Dooley is calling for more certainty and clarity and a better understanding.  The fact that event promoters will not be entitled to advertise or sell tickets before a pre-application consultation meeting is a positive advance.  It is a clear indication to promoters that a better understanding of the local authority's position can be secured at those meetings before advertising and selling tickets, which is what caused much of the hurt last year.  These are improvements that will be welcomed generally.  The new regulations, which were signed into law just last week, are intended to make the event licensing system more streamlined and fit for purpose, while also bringing greater order and certainty to the process for all parties involved.  I am confident that the new regulations will prevent the type of scenario that arose last year from happening again and, accordingly, I oppose Deputy Dooley's Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>

That led to Dublin City Council imposing conditions limiting the number of concerts, among other things, with which the promoters of the event were dissatisfied, and it was cancelled.  While I am not dismissing the concerns of the residents, much concern was voiced about the incident.  Not only did it have an impact on people who had bought tickets and were disappointed at the cancellation, including people from overseas, but it also had considerable economic consequences in respect of cancelled hotel bookings and the overall level of spending that such an event would have generated, including from overseas visitors.</p>  <p>  I can see where the proposals outlined in this Bill are coming from.  However, I have some concerns regarding how it might impact on the democratic decision making of local authorities.  The elected members of local authorities should have more power in respect of such matters than they do at present.  Currently, city and county managers are able to make decisions not only without having to take account of the views of local elected representatives, who legally constitute the council, but often against their express wishes.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Garth Brooks concerts, Dublin city councillors had to resort to tabling emergency motions to attempt to influence the conditions under which the license for the events was being granted by the council planners.  There should surely be a more democratic and transparent manner of making such decisions so that there would be no need for ministerial intervention as proposed in this Bill.</p>  <p>  There have been issues in local authorities around the country in which similar disregard was shown to the views of elected representatives.  Those of us who have come through the local authority system have all experienced that.  In Dublin we had a situation a few years ago in which there was significant cross-party opposition, including from the Government parties, on the city council to a waste incinerator.</p><p>That opposition was totally ignored and a decision was taken by the city manager to go ahead with the project.<br/><br/>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has considerable power.  We have seen what the Minister has done in the past 24 hours and what both the Minister and the Minister of State are capable of, or what the Labour Party and Fine Gael are capable of.  </p></speech>

I refer to a recent example which impacted on my own county when a vote by Westmeath County Council regarding the conditions for the building of a massive wind farm was over-ruled by the then Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  She was able to do so under the critical infrastructure legislation which allows An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Minister to over-rule planning objections and any decision by local authorities if the proposed project is deemed to be of vital economic or strategic importance.  Given that legislation is in existence, it should have been amended to return power over vital planning issues to local councils, which was proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in its wind farm Bill .  I would be dubious about a proposal such as this which would further diminish the power of  democratically elected local councillors.  Such powers are the bedrock of any democracy and democratic system, which we should never forget.  We have weak local government.  The significant reform of local government introduced last year has some potential.  I would like to see that reform expanded into other areas.  Unfortunately, the Minister has removed significant powers from local authorities, as did the previous Government, which is regrettable.</p></speech>

I would welcome a debate on it issue to see how this can be achieved.  In general, Sinn F&eacute;in supports it.</p><p>I am also interested to know what might give grounds for the need for the Minister to intervene in the case of proposed events.  I presume that the proposer has in mind the circumstances surrounding the Garth Brooks concerts.  However, there are surely circumstances where such an intervention by a Minister might not only over-ride the decision of local planners but also might cause upset among local people who may have genuine objections to such an event.  Is it the case that the Minister would define what he would determine the national importance of the event, as referred to in section (2)(<i>c</i>), as something that was perhaps popular among people planning to attend but not with those living close to the venue, as in the case of the Croke Park concerts?  There could be situations where, for instance, an open air event was to be held over the space of a number of days thus causing concern among local residents.  Is this Bill proposing that if the local authority with the support of democratically elected representatives decided that the planning application did not contain sufficient guarantees on various grounds, the Minister should be able to intervene and over-rule that decision?  This is a matter of concern.</p><p>I live in County Laois which hosts a number of major annual events, such as the ploughing championships which is attended by approximately 250,000, with some estimates at more than 300,000, over three days, as well as the Electric Picnic event and a number of other large events.  These events are handled very well in co-operation with the local authority and the councillors have an input.  I would like them to have an increased input.  However, it goes to show that these issues can be resolved.  I agree that the area around Croke Park has high density housing and population and it is necessary to be sensitive in those circumstances.  I think we need to be very careful about moving powers away from local authorities and handing the Minister such powers.  In the case of the situation in Dublin, the council chamber was the place to iron out many of these difficulties where the people elected to represent the different communities around Croke Park could have had a greater input.  We need to be careful about handing over such powers to Ministers.</p><p>We need to be cautious about creating about a situation where legitimate objections on the part of local planners, local representatives and local communities could simply be ignored because a proposed event was likely to bring economic benefits.  I would prefer a situation where local planning for such events is made much more transparent and involves greater consultation with the community with a final decision resting with the elected councillors.  I believe that this would ensure that the optimum conditions would be imposed on such events in the interest of the community and those attending them.  It would also prevent a small number of people who might be living right beside a venue having a veto as the council would reflect the interests of the community in general.  The councillors in the north Dublin area would represent the broader interests of the wider community, including residents and businesses.</p><p>In my view the provisions in the Planning Act relating to major events need to be updated.  On that basis, I support the passing of Second Stage of this Bill, so it can move to Committee Stage where it could be amended to ensure that we have better legislation governing these events.  I will be drafting a planning Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in-----</p></speech>

I am a bit puzzled by Deputy Stanley's position in that he spoke for ten minutes about his opposition to the ministerial power to intervene with regard to planning conditions for events, which is the main plank of this Bill, but he then states he will support the Bill.  I am unsure as to his position; it is a bit too complex for me to understand.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this matter, which he has done with good intentions and which I acknowledge.  I refer to what occurred in Croke Park with regard to the Garth Brooks concerts, the fiasco that followed, the hurt it caused to many stakeholders, especially those who had purchased tickets, the local residents and everyone who was up in arms at the time.  It was acknowledged that a further review of the licensing regulations was necessary.  A deep consultation process was undertaken and I was happy to sign off on amendments to those regulations last Friday.  These will bring greater clarity and extended notice to those involved in the licensing of large scale events in this country.  It is an important step because a mandatory pre-consultation meeting must be held with the relevant local authority and no tickets can be advertised or sold prior to that pre-consultation meeting.  This is the main change to the regulations which the Government has provided.  </p>  <p>  We are aware that there is a need to strike a balance between the rights of residents and the due process associated with any event licensing applications.  I think the balance has been struck and the regulations will bring greater certainty to promoters, to performers, to those people interested in attending concerts and to the residents of the area.  </p>  <p>  Conditions for event licensing are generally issues referring to public safety, the maintenance of public order, noise and traffic management.  As I outlined, these matters are conditions attached to licences and are most appropriately dealt with by the local authorities in consultation with the principal response agencies involved at the time of major event planning.  These include the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the emergency services, the local authority, traffic management officials, the HSE and many others involved in the background planning for safe and secure large scale events.  The views of the local residents are regarded as very important.</p><p>They can be reflected by the public representatives who represent those areas appropriately at that level.  Therefore, it is obvious to me that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should not become an arbiter on such issues.  I believe we have learned - I certainly hope we have learned - from the events of the past year and I certainly do not want to see them repeated, as I am sure Deputies opposite do not.  </p> <p> The new event licensing regulations that I signed into law last week, which emanated from the work of the review group that was mandated to make recommendations for appropriate changes to the legislation, will provide greater certainty to the whole event licensing process.  Some minor problems will always arise in this area.  For example, we witnessed the cancellation of a music festival in Killarney this weekend due to poor ticket sales.  It is not possible to provide for every eventuality in legislation.  I am confident that the new regulations are balanced and reasonable and constitute a genuine approach aimed at preventing the type of scenario we saw last year from being repeated.</p> <p> I thank the Deputy.  This was an interesting, appropriate and topical debate and it is an issue we should keep under review and evaluation.  I look forward to seeing how the new regulations will improve the process for all stakeholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-26a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062600012#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comments.  I wish to put in context the reason the Bill was published.  Its purpose was to deal with the crisis at the time and to try to resolve a problem that was particularly acute.  I thought, in light of what happened, that the Government would carry out a detailed analysis of the entire licensing regime for open-air events or events of that nature at large venues.  It was my expectation that there would be a much more comprehensive framework for the issuing of licences.  The Minister of State commented about meddling in planning matters and not wanting to go back to the past.  We all recognise that.  The facts of the matter are such that the licensing of such events cannot be confused with the poor planning decisions taken through political interference in the past.</p>  <p>  I had expected that the Government would introduce proposals for complete separation of the issuing of licences for such events from the Planning and Development Act and would examine the possibility of controlling such events in a completely different manner.  If that were to happen, there might be no need for my Bill.  However, the Minister has allowed the issuing of licences to remain within the remit of the Planning and Development Act.  He has not really changed the mechanism; he has only tinkered around with the dates.  He is insisting on pre-consultation discussion meetings involving planners, venue owners and promoters before a concert can be advertised or tickets sold.  The fact of the matter is that, during the planning for the Garth Brooks event, all of these things happened.  The then county manager at Dublin City Council implied to the promoters and the venue owners that, in principle, the five concerts would get the go-ahead.  Other things happened afterwards.  There was involvement by local residents, and the decision to refuse permission was based on the facts available to the planners at the time.  In my reading of what the Minister of State is suggesting, there is nothing there that would resolve the issues that surrounded the Garth Brooks concert if it were to happen again.  There are few enough acts in the world that would require five nights in Croke Park, so this is an exceptional set of circumstances that does not raise its head too often.  In my view, there is no mechanism to deal with such an eventuality.  </p>  <p>  I hope the Government will look seriously at addressing the entire licensing regime and consider the venue rather than the event.  Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned the National Ploughing Championship and other such events.  If an event that takes place somewhere in County Laois or Clare has an established capacity and the planners know the numbers attending and the structures, a licence should be granted for that particular style of event at that location in perpetuity.  Certain metrics should be put on the event, including upper limits on the number of people who can attend and the number of such events in a year.  That gives certainty to the residents, the venue owner and the promoter in trying to attract international acts.  I gave Thomond Park and Nolan Park as examples.  I am aware that Thomond Park and the Aviva stadium also have, as part of their general planning, the potential for three such events without recourse to the licensing regime, but they are allowed to apply for more on an ongoing basis.  That is wrong.  There should be a set limit on an annual basis so that the venue owner knows he cannot go back on that, the residents know that something will not be foisted upon them at a later stage and anybody seeking to attract an international event or act knows with certainty that Thomond Park, Nolan Park, Cusack Park in Ennis, or wherever, has particular dates available.  That takes away the necessity for a risk-assessment-based approach which requires a caveat stating that tickets are being sold subject to licence.  Even with the pre-consultation process mentioned by the Minister of State, promoters will still have to put a proviso at the end of the advertisement for whatever it might be, stating "Subject to licence."  Up to four weeks before the event takes place that licence can be refused, which means disappointment.  That does not happen with every event.</p>  <p>  There was an extreme set of circumstances in the Garth Brooks case.  It could happen again, and I have no doubt that it will unless the legislation is amended to provide certainty.  What everybody wants is certainty for all concerned.  With my colleagues, I intend to draft more comprehensive legislation to separate the entire licensing regime from the Planning and Development Act to allow venues to seek licences in perpetuity under certain conditions.  Issuance of those licences will be subject to input from local authorities and residents.  It will be a comprehensive approach to dealing with this important matter once and for all rather than the haphazard approach that applies currently.  If that legislation is accepted, I will be prepared to work with the Department on it, in which case there is no need for the Bill I have proposed, which was to address the lack of an overall review in legislation.  I wish to put on record that I and my party have no interest in going back to the planning practices of the past that saw people from quite a number of political parties involve themselves, wrongly, in the decision making process, or in any way undermining the whole notion of local democracy.  Now and again there are exceptional circumstances that should allow the Minister, in a transparent manner, to intervene until such time as there is a comprehensive methodology for addressing the licensing regimes of venues throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his comments and his approach to addressing the matter.  I am disappointed that he will not accept the Bill, but I ask him to work with all sides of the House on a more comprehensive methodology for addressing this important matter so that not only those who attend events but the economy as a whole can benefit from Ireland's reputation as a destination that welcomes such events, whether it is the National Ploughing Championship, certain sporting events, concerts or large international acts of distinction.</p></speech>
