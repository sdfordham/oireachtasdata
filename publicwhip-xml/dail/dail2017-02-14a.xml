I read the Tusla file when in Maurice McCabe's home.  It is truly shocking.  What strikes one is the incredibly casual approach to a monumentally false allegation on the part of the authorities in terms of the fact that the report was left hanging around in Garda stations without being corrected and in terms of the length of time it took for either Tusla or the HSE to deal adequately and properly with it.  The lethal aspect of all this is the fact that the report in question was used to fundamentally undermine the integrity of Maurice McCabe.  There is no doubt, in my opinion, that there was an attempt and a campaign to undermine the integrity of Maurice McCabe because he was proving to be a major thorn in the side of senior people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or on foot of the fact that he was raising issues that have subsequently been vindicated by a commission of investigation.</p> <p> There is a need - I would like the Taoiseach to confirm this - for a public tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act.  Any inquiry cannot be secret.  There must be the right of public cross-examination.  People may ask why this should be the case.  The McCabes made it very clear to me that they will never again engage with an O'Higgins-type process because what they went through in that regard was shocking, with the kitchen sink and all thrown at them by senior counsel representing the Garda Commissioner.  The senior counsel said that he would be attacking McCabe's integrity and motivation all the way through the inquiry.  He said that his instructions were to challenge the integrity of Sergeant McCabe and his motivation all the way through the inquiry.  There was a five-page document prepared by the Chief State Solicitor's office on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  That is why they do not want to be involved in a similar exercise again under any circumstances.  They want a public inquiry, Taoiseach.  I know that Deputy O'Callaghan, who has acted in good faith throughout this situation, has sent out draft terms of reference for such an inquiry, which must include events at the O'Higgins commission of investigation that were designed to entrap Sergeant McCabe.  Had he not had the tape recording of the Mullingar meeting, God knows where this would have ended up.  That has to be investigated.  I want confirmation from the Taoiseach that the Government is agreeable to including events at the O'Higgins commission of investigation in the terms of reference and that it is agreeing to a tribunal of inquiry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400004#B00200"><p>I thank Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for his question.  Since responsibility came my way as a result of the office I hold, for the first time since the foundation of the State we have had a senior ministry for children, a Department for children, an agency for children, children's rights enshrined in the Constitution by way of a referendum and a statement in respect of sexual abuse in Cloyne and the cover-up engaged in and the limbo that existed in respect of what went on in this country for years.  The entire country has sympathy with Sergeant McCabe and his family.  I have made that point on many occasions.  What is required is an effective process to deal with a central issue, namely, was there or was there not a deliberate smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe and his family by senior garda&iacute;.  That is what needs to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality received two protected disclosures some time ago.  Four days later, she sent them to a judge, Mr. Justice O'Neill, who assessed them.  His response was that what was needed was a commission of investigation to determine the truth and he set out the terms of reference for that commission of investigation.  Following on from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's meeting with Sergeant McCabe and my meeting with the Deputy this morning, I understand that the McCabe family will not participate in a private investigation.</p><p>They want a public investigation.  I want to be very clear about this.  When we proceed down the road of having a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act, dealing with tribunals, we have to be very clear that this is right down the middle in respect of everybody.  The presumption of innocence until proven otherwise stands for every citizen, and people should be very careful respect of this.  Yes, Sergeant McCabe has pointed out the appalling litany of instances of his treatment.  There is nothing worse in this country than being called a sexual abuser.  It has to be soul-destroying for the individual or his or her family to put up with that.</p> <p> I can confirm to the Ceann Comhairle and the House that the Government agreed in principle this morning to set up a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act, with the terms of reference to be worked out and the details and the structure by which the central issue here can be addressed, that is, the determination of the truth and justice for everybody in respect of the central question as to whether there was an organised smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe by the senior Garda officers.  The Government will work with the individual parties in respect of the terms of reference.  I want to make it clear, however, there can be no bias or over-reliance upon anybody in the determination of how these terms of reference will be set out and the purpose for which they are intended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400005#C00200"><p>I welcome the confirmation that there will be a tribunal of inquiry.  The Taoiseach made the point that we must be very careful.  I suggest to him that maybe we were all too careful in our response to this saga over the last number of years, particularly considering that the O'Higgins commission of investigation was conducted in an unacceptable manner.  That said, I put it to the Taoiseach that the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry - it has not been established yet - is no basis for Ministers not coming into the House to answer questions and being accountable to it in regard to the Tusla file, which is over and above and additional to the protected disclosures issues that gave rise to the inquiry in the first instance.  As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children, in particular, know, the Tusla file indicates an apology was to be given by a State agency to a citizen, namely, Mr. Maurice McCabe.  Incredibly, his family was on the file.  They were embroiled in it; it is appalling.  It is very difficult to understand why that was not revealed to the Cabinet, that is, that a State agency is about to apologise to someone who at this stage is a major public figure in respect of very high-profile cases.  There is an onus.  This is an important Chamber in terms of accountability.  This week, Ministers should come before the House to answer in regard to their responsibilities in this matter and to give straight, clear answers which may clear up a lot.  There has been incoherence at the heart of the Government's response to the Tusla file, and that is to put it mildly.  There is an opportunity this week in this House for Ministers to do what is normally done in Parliaments, that is, account in the House for their stewardship regarding a particular issue and enlighten the Deputies on whatever challenges and constraints they were operating under, or give explanations as to the lack of coherence in articulating their position on an issue that has given rise to major public interest and major public scandal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-02-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400005#C00300"><p>I am before the House myself.  I have said to the Deputy that the Cabinet has agreed in principle to hold a public inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.  The Deputy mentioned the O'Higgins investigation.  Without being too political about this, I understand one of the Deputy's own Members was a number of years ago allegedly given very important information that could have been germane to the report but chose not to give it for a period of three years.  People should understand that, over the past period of time, the Government has tried to set up the independent inspectorate, to revamp and restructure GSOC after ten years and set up the completely independent Policing Authority because the perception of the Garda at higher levels over many years has not been what it should have been.</p><p>It will take some time to change that culture by the independence in appointment of the independent Policing Authority.<br/><br/>I want to make it clear, as the Minister, Deputy Zappone, pointed out, that when she informed me that she had spoken to the McCabes, the discussion that she had with them was about false allegations made to Tusla.  She did not indicate to me any issue of the detail of the discussions she had with the McCabe family or, indeed, the existence or any content of a file that the Deputy mentioned.  Obviously, this became very public knowledge on the relevant &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is very clear that the discussions she had with Sergeant McCabe were of a confidential nature, that she had to respect his privacy and that these things were not in the public domain at the time that she met with them.<br/><br/>I might say <i>mea culpa</i>, because I did say, and I am guilty here of not giving accurate information, I understood, from thinking myself that I had, that she had asked me about meeting Sergeant McCabe in the first place.  It actually was her office that consulted with my officials, who told me.  She is very clear that she did not tell me that she intended to meet Sergeant McCabe but she did tell her official to tell my office, so I regret that.</p></speech>

If he wants to know why, he should reflect on his <i>mea culpa</i>of a moment ago.  His little deal with the Fianna F&aacute;il leader may delay that necessary development.  It will also delay the search for truth by Maurice McCabe.  The tipping point for Sinn F&eacute;in was the way that the Government dealt with the campaign of vilification, smears and false accusations against Garda Sergeant McCabe.  That is a campaign that the Garda Commissioner now acknowledges, although she says that she did not know it was happening at the time it was happening.</p><p>This is not the time to go into the twists and turns, lies and spin of this long episode, but it is remarkable that Maurice McCabe, his wife, Lorraine, and their family have survived it all.  That is obviously because of their resilience, bravery and commitment to each other and the need for the highest standards in public life, including in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There are two issues - allegations of a criminal conspiracy by senior garda&iacute; and the enabling of that by the Government.  This series of scandals began when Maurice McCabe raised concerns about corrupt practices in the hierarchy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 and then publicly when he and Garda John Wilson did so in 2012.  They were smeared, bullied and undermined.  So were Teachta&iacute; who raised concerns in this Chamber.</p><p>Then there was the Taoiseach's role in the retirement of Commissioner Martin Callinan, the resignation of the confidential Garda recipient, the resignation of the Minister, Alan Shatter, and the transfer of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It goes on and on.  Eight years of public defamation and State vilification of Sergeant McCabe and his family.</p><p>What of the concerns of the other whistleblowers?  Last week, the Government proved itself once again to be incompetent, incohesive and without any authority to govern except that gifted to it by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.  Citizens deserve a 21st-century, accountable policing service.  So do members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is not capable of establishing that.  The Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader in their choreographed, staged little exchanges of a moment ago may laud the merits of the public inquiry that the Taoiseach has just belatedly announced, but the credit for that public inquiry is entirely Maurice and Lorraine McCabe's.</p></speech>

Last week the Government rejected a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the terms of reference of its ill-fated commission.  The amendment would have allowed investigation of contacts between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Government, former members of the Government, Members of the Oireachtas and other State agencies relevant to the allegations made against Sergeant McCabe.  The Taoiseach blocked that.  Why was that blocked by you, Taoiseach, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality?</p></speech>

If you want to play politics with an issue that is so sensitive and so personal that it goes to the very heart of the public soul of Ireland then do so, but I do not agree with you because four days after this Minister got two protected disclosures about these very serious issues, she sent that to an eminent judge to examine them.  He carried out his analysis and said he could not determine the truth here and that what the T&aacute;naiste needed to do was set up a commission of investigation.  The Government followed his recommendation to the letter in respect of the terms of reference and the way that it should be conducted.

There is no leadership there now.  Does Deputy Adams want to do the same thing down here?  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government simply because it wants to cause chaos down here as well.  Allegations, rumour and hearsay do not count in our dictionary here but truth does.  Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family deserve, as do others, the fairness and justice that will come from a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act.  Deputy Adams should not come in here and try to determine what the outcome of that might be before it is even set up.  We have had all of Sinn F&eacute;in's stuff over the years - run away and deny everything.  Sinn F&eacute;in's deputy leader says "sure Gerry couldn't be wrong".  That is the way it is.  When our T&aacute;naiste received these two protected disclosures, they were given to a judge within four days and the judge took an extra six weeks to examine them.  The important point made by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and others, including myself, is that the central issue here is that Sergeant McCabe has made the case that there was a deliberate smear against him to denigrate and do him down.  The only way we can deal with that is by getting at the truth.  The way you can determine that truth is by having compellability, cross examination, publication and everybody understanding what went on here so that the central question can be answered.  What Deputy Adams wants to do is bring down the Government so that this cannot happen.  It is the same old story from Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is a very sensitive personal issue for this family.  It is also an issue for the Garda Commissioner and the previous Commissioner.  This is why there must be fairness and a recognition of innocence until proven otherwise.  Under our legal system, we do not jump to conclusions or have kangaroo courts as happens in some other places.</p></speech>

It goes well beyond that.  Let us quote what the Taoiseach said on &quot;This Week&quot; on Sunday.  He said:</p><blockquote>Minister Zappone, who is doing a very good job, did tell me that she intended to meet with Sergeant McCabe in a private capacity.  That's all I knew.  I said to her &quot;well if you do have a meeting make sure that you have a thorough account of it.&quot;</blockquote><p>That is not some slightly inaccurate remembrance of his conversation with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is a completely inaccurate statement.  He has said that this conversation did not take place.  How could he remember it in such detail if it did not take place?  It is a central untruth and the reason it matters is because it means that at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Taoiseach knew about Tusla and did not brief the Cabinet and it means that he consciously did not include it in the terms of reference and that he misled the public on RTE.</p><p>Having admitted that moments ago, how can he now continue as Taoiseach?  It is not the only matter of fact on which there is a difference.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael can agree that the difference between the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan does not really matter now.  However, it does matter.  It matters because one of them is telling the truth and the other one is not.  If Deputy O'Callaghan is telling the truth, that means the T&aacute;naiste misled the D&aacute;il on Thursday.</p></speech>

That is the word that sums up the actions of the top garda&iacute; in smearing Mr. Maurice McCabe, engaging in a pattern of black propaganda of a similar sort against at least two other garda&iacute;, political policing, Operation Mizen, spying and trumped up charges against Jobstown protestors.  It is disgusting.  The Commissioner has said that she will not step aside because "a campaign of false accusations ... do not make me guilty of anything".  Tell that to Mr. Maurice McCabe, who had his life ruined.  Tell it to Mr. Dave Taylor, who was suspended from his job for 22 months with the Commissioner's husband leading the investigation.  The Commissioner's husband took control of his mobile phones, upon which, allegedly, there is a text from the Commissioner saying "Perfect" in response to the idea that a journalist was meeting the alleged victim of Mr. Maurice McCabe.  How can the Taoiseach allow Commissioner O'Sullivan to remain in place?  How does he know that she will not use her position to obstruct the inquiry?</p>  <p>  The questions that Mr. Maurice McCabe has posed do not need a tribunal.  We are in favour of a tribunal, but Mr. McCabe has posed six simple questions that the Government and the Ministers can get answers to from the Commissioner, Tusla and the HSE.  When will Mr. McCabe have answers to those questions?</p></speech>

There are many people who were here before me for many years who made mistakes.  I stand here to say that I had spoken to the Minister about the information on her meeting with the McCabe family.  She notified my office, which told me of that information.  I put that in the public domain and I regret that because I should not have.  The Minister did not refer to any of the details of the discussion with the McCabes, the existence of a file in Tusla or the information contained in that file.  It is not true to say that I had any information about the existence of that prior to the Cabinet meeting in Government Buildings.</p>  <p>  The judge who was appointed to conduct the commission of investigation confirmed that what he saw on the "Prime Time" programme was covered by the existing terms of reference.  After Judge O'Neill examined both protected disclosures, he was unable to determine the truth.  He set out the terms of reference that Government followed faithfully.  That included covering the issue of erroneous sexual allegations against Sergeant McCabe.</p>  <p>  I will return to the central point.  There is an issue of truth and justice that needs to be determined.  It is a very sensitive, serious and public matter now.  The way to achieve that is to have the co-operation of everybody in order that this work can be done.  There is no point in having some private investigation or commission if the McCabe family is not willing to participate in it.  As far as I am concerned, the Government was very anxious to decide in principle to have a tribunal of enquiry under the 1921 Act, to be fair to everybody and draft terms of reference that will allow the tribunal to do its work.  I hope that can be concluded within the next 48 and that it can go through both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in order to let that commission and tribunal of inquiry get on with its work.</p>  <p>  The central issue is whether there was or was not a concerted smear campaign by senior garda&iacute; against Sergeant Maurice McCabe.</p><p>That is the question which needs to be answered and it is the question I hope the tribunal of inquiry will be able to deal with in everybody's interest.</p></speech>

Does the Taoiseach agree that it is a fundamental threat to any notion of democratic rights when those at the top of a police force feel able to do that?  Will he agree that it is not a question of one or two bad apples but that, in the context of the Garda, the barrel is evidently rotten at the top?

They are simple questions and the Government has the power to ask them of the relevant authorities and get the answers.  For example, who contacted the counsellor or who was contacted by that counsellor such that this matter ended up in the domain of being put back on the Tusla file?  Where did that come from?  The answer will clearly will establish a train of events in terms of where this comes from?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the questions should be answered?</p></speech>

That is the Deputy's position.  I have pointed out already that the Government has made serious adjustments to bring about greater trust, confidence and belief in the Garda, both in terms of the restructured Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which is a totally independent police authority, and an independent inspectorate to help create that trust and confidence that the public and garda&iacute; themselves need in the force.</p>  <p>  The questions posed will be answered in so far as they can but I would say to Deputy Murphy that there is clearly an interaction between the substance of a number of those questions and the tribunal of inquiry to be set up.  In so far as the Department of Justice and Equality can answer from relevant information, that will be done.  However, the fundamental issue is that a tribunal of inquiry must be balanced, fair to everybody, have terms of reference that include that and then be allowed to do its job. I hope that can be approved by the D&aacute;il and by the Seanad this week so that this tribunal of investigation and inquiry can start its work at the earliest possible time.</p></speech>

Many bad things have happened.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that everybody has the presumption of innocence.  He has a short memory.  For several years, according to the Fine Gael-Labour Government, Maurice McCabe was guilty until proven innocent.  N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan talked yesterday of a campaign of false accusations against her.  Is she saying that Maurice McCabe was lying?  Is she saying that David Taylor, Keith Harrison, Nick Keogh, Sin&eacute;ad Killian, Eve Doherty, Donal O'Connell and others are all liars?  If she genuinely did not know how whistleblowers were treated, she is not fit for the job because she did not know what was going on in the force.</p>  <p>  In the context of the O'Higgins inquiry, she instructed her legal team to give false evidence until Maurice McCabe's tape turned that upside down.  If she was innocent, why did she not sanction or discipline the two garda&iacute; involved?</p><p>It is a long time ago.  How can the Taoiseach explain that when Nick Keogh reported Garda involvement in the heroin trade in Athlone he faced five internal investigations that same year but none before that.  Why?  Why was the superintendent whom Nick Keogh accused of bullying and harassing him put on the promotion list?  In 2014, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to look at Keith Harrison's complaint.  The assistant commissioner leaked information back to the superintendent who was the subject of the complaint.  On foot of a different complaint involving the very same superintendent that same assistant commissioner was asked to carry out an investigation.  If all this was not bad enough, when GSOC, following its investigation into the second matter, asked for disciplinary proceedings to be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whom did N&oacute;ir&iacute;n appoint over it?  One would never guess - the same assistant commissioner.</p> <p> In early 2014, a journalist contacted David Taylor when he was press officer.  The journalist told him he had been to the family of the girl at the centre of the sex allegations against Maurice McCabe.  He told him he had a great story which would be really damaging for McCabe.  Taylor texted Callinan and O'Sullivan and told them the good news.  Callinan texted him back to welcome it.  N&oacute;ir&iacute;n decided to ring him and have a good chat about it.  This is the woman who said several weeks ago on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" that she had absolutely no knowledge and nor was she privy to any campaign to undermine any individual in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The press officer, David Taylor, who was given back his job yesterday, stated everybody in headquarters knew about the campaign against Maurice McCabe.  Everybody, seemingly Taoiseach, except N&oacute;ir&iacute;n.  What does the Taoiseach think?</p></speech>

What he is doing is making his comments and he is also concluding the outcome of a tribunal of inquiry.  What is the question being asked here?  Was there a deliberate smearing campaign by senior garda&iacute; against Sergeant McCabe or was there not?  We can talk all we like about it in here, but it will not answer that fundamental question.  Judge O'Neill was unable to determine what that truth was and he examined both of those protected disclosures in great depth and got a six-week extension to do his work.  He concluded at the end of it all that he was not in a position to determine what the truth was, so he said to the Minister and the Government they had to hold commission of investigation and gave them the terms of reference.  The Government followed that faithfully, but clearly the judge appointed was also happy that the terms of reference covered agencies that might or might not be involved.  The position is the Government has agreed in principle to set up the tribunal of inquiry.  The question of the terms of reference, its structure, its range and all these are issues to be decided now, and I hope this matter can be accepted and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann this week and that the person to be appointed, whoever that might be, will be able to get on with his or her work and start the process of effectively finding out the answer to the central question on whether there was or was not a concerted effort of smearing Sergeant McCabe from the highest echelons of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na na h&Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

That is grand.  We are not saying lock her up and throw away the key, but for God's sake take her out of the police job because she is not fit for it.  I am not throwing notions plucked out of the sky at the Taoiseach.  I am throwing information and facts at him.  In 2008, when Maurice McCabe first raised issues of wrongdoing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and systemic problems in how the force worked, he was trying to change the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Here we are in 2017 and, sadly, the culture has not changed.</p> <p> The Government did not change anything.  It brought in a few changes in legislation but these were not nearly enough.  It changed the Commissioner but appointed one in who was at the shoulder of the other one when he called whistleblowers "disgusting".  Since then she has hounded and harassed whistleblowers.  It is not as if the T&aacute;naiste was not told about this.  The Government knows it is going on but it has decided to turn a blind eye.  It did not want to know what is happening because it did not suit.  If the Taoiseach has any interest in how we do policing in Ireland he should change it now by getting rid of the Commissioner.  He should get rid of all the hierarchy too as several assistant commissioners are due for retirement.  He should do as the Patten report recommended in Northern Ireland and start afresh.  Let us find someone from outside the country or a civilian and get a new hierarchy from the lower members of the force who were not able to get promotion because they were clean.  Let us make a fresh start before the Taoiseach retires and let us do something for policing.  There was a time when Fine Gael was seen as the party of law and order but this Government has rubbished that. </p></speech>

The Commissioner is the first person to come through an independent competition trawled internationally for that purpose.  The Deputy said we should change history.  He might think he is in a position to fire everybody but this Government introduced a totally independent policing authority, the first since the foundation of the State.</p></speech>

This is why Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring is changing the structure of GSOC to ensure people have trust and confidence in the organisation and that if they want to make complaints those complaints will be examined confidentially and be subjected to a full and thorough analysis of their value or otherwise.  This Government, like the previous one, is changing the nature and the perception of the structure of the Garda, which is necessary.  The Deputy can talk about it but there is now an independent police authority and a changed structure, with confidentiality in the way complaints are made and in the way business is done, all under an eminent judge.  We are doing all of that to protect whistleblowers and we are having a tribunal on the central issue, namely, the alleged smearing of Sergeant McCabe on the basis of erroneous sexual allegations.  The Deputy should support the holding of a tribunal of inquiry, which should be drafted in a way that is fair to everybody so that justice and truth will be the outcome.</p></speech>

The entire nation has been convulsed by an issue of major public concern.  During Leaders' Questions I asked the Taoiseach if he would confirm that Ministers would come before the House to answer questions about their stewardship on this issue and be accountable to the House on the specifics of this issue.  I think that should happen.  The most important thing the Oireachtas can do to respond to this issue is to try to get to the truth.  I understand that people will agree to a tribunal inquiry.  Motions of confidence would not get that this week, but we can agree to a tribunal of inquiry.  However, that does not mean that Ministers cannot come before the House to answer questions.  To be fair, the McCabes issued a statement last evening with six straight questions in it.  Answers to those questions do not require a tribunal of inquiry.  It is no basis for people to run to the hills and seek protection and cover over very basic things that can be explained and on which Ministers can answer questions.</p><p>There was a time in this House when Private Notice Questions were <i>de rigueur</i>and the norm in situations like this, involving matters of great public concern.  In recent years, including the last D&aacute;il, that was not so much the case.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, given the enormity of this issue, Ministers should come before the House.  The D&aacute;il is relevant in responding to it and acts in the public interest in endeavouring to get answers to the one major issue that has convulsed the nation over the last week or so.  Our overriding consideration should be to get answers not just for the McCabe family but also for the administration of justice and the administration of Tusla.</p><p>Apart from all the other issues, how Tusla dealt with this is shocking when one reads the file.  It beggars belief that any State agency could allow something like this to happen.  There is a lack of checks and balances.  With all of what the Taoiseach said about reforms and modernisation, this is as basic as it gets.  It is quite shocking how poor it is.</p></speech>

While the issue of the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe can be dealt with by a public commission of investigation, that is not the only issue at stake here.  There are questions which need to be answered in terms of the Taoiseach's management and the management by Ministers of the Government.  At the very least, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, must come before the House to make statements clarifying direct contradictions in accounts about who knew about the Tusla reports, when they knew, what they decided to do or not do about those things or whether to include them in terms of reference.  All of those things need to be addressed by the Taoiseach.  The Government must address why it refuses to suspend the Commissioner or to ask her to step aside, without prejudice, pending the outcome of an investigation when that is normal practice for somebody against whom such allegations are made.</p>  <p>  There was supposed to be a Business Committee meeting at 1 p.m. which was requested by a number of parties.  The Government collapsed that meeting to discuss this issue.  On the insistence of ourselves and others, a meeting took place at 1.30 p.m. but the Government came in and no discussions happened.  It came in to say the meeting had been put off until 4 p.m.  It is unacceptable to have any delay for people to concoct new stories.  We want direct, factual accounts and statements from the various people.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il did not speak up against the move to delay that Business Committee discussion.  We need an answer about statements today, not tomorrow or Thursday, from the relevant Ministers and, for that matter, from those who have made statements on this on the Opposition benches so that the public gets truth and clarity.</p></speech>

In advance of any discussion of the terms of reference of, as now seems to be the consensus, a tribunal of inquiry, the issues put on the table by the McCabe family in the six questions should be addressed by the relevant Ministers in so far as they can be addressed.  Most of us have tabled Private Notice Questions but it would probably be better if the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs would make short statements on the unfortunate but clear contradictions in their individual statements over the last number of days.  If there is an explanation, let us hear it and move on then on the basis of clear knowledge.  It cannot be the case that contradictory statements are left standing.</p>  <p>  Last week, the terms of reference of a commission of inquiry into these very important issues were not discussed in advance with the Opposition parties.  Certainly, they were not discussed with my party.</p><p>In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, she did accept the proposition of taking amendments during the course of the debate and we deferred that.</p> <p> In respect of what will be a much more extensive body of work of a tribunal of inquiry - I understand that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has already submitted draft terms of reference - in advance of publishing any terms of reference, I ask that there be proper discussion among the parties here.  We are all anxious to avoid a multi-annual inquiry.  We need to ensure that terms are comprehensive and where there are interacting issues that need to be dealt with together or in tandem before we can get an accurate picture of the truth that these things would be done.</p> <p> We are all working from the basis of knowledge we have on ensuring that the terms of reference are comprehensive.  I ask that the Taoiseach cause a meeting to take place where we could have a proper and full discussion on these matters.</p></speech>

There are totally contradictory statements from him, other Ministers and Government representatives on all of the pertinent points that passed us last week.  We also have the six questions from Maurice and Lorraine McCabe.</p>  <p>  I am still waiting for an answer to the question I put to the Taoiseach a number of times today.  The Taoiseach has agreed, in principle, to a public inquiry, but we need to get sight of the draft terms of reference.  Last week, the Minister for Justice and Equality failed to meet the Sinn F&eacute;in justice spokesperson, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, despite him asking, on a number of occasions, to meet her.  There is an e-mail on that if the Taoiseach is looking for a paper trail.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach meet with all of the leaders to thrash out the terms of reference?  Will he give a very clear commitment now that he will not proceed unless Maurice McCabe is satisfied with the terms of reference that are going forward?</p></speech>

We could not make a decision because the Cabinet meeting had not finished.  I suggested that we postpone until 4 p.m.  This matter is extremely serious, as we all know.  The last thing I want to see is another tribunal that drags on, makes fat cats fatter and gets us nowhere.  All of the groups here should be represented at an all-party group to try to formulate terms and conditions.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, should come in here and make brief statements, and then take questions and answers from people across the floor.  That is very necessary.</p></speech>

We agreed that we would have to come back at 4 p.m., reorder the business and start the process again.  We should be seeking to prioritise statements from Ministers who, as best they can, should provide answers to the six questions raised by Sergeant McCabe.  We should also prioritise in any work we do or debates we have the setting of the terms of reference, the means of bringing in outside expertise, ensuring that we cover every base and getting this absolutely right.  We should concentrate on that rather than political motions when we meet in an hour's time to set the Order of Business.  Everyone agreed at the earlier meeting that was what we would do at 4 p.m.  No one believed that this order would survive the full length of the day.</p></speech>

This is a matter that should be dealt with and agreed by the Business Committee.  Apart from a general consensus in respect of the need for a full public inquiry, there are a number of aspects to the proposed inquiry which need to be agreed.  In addition, we need short-term responses in respect of the conflicting statements made by Ministers in recent days.  There is a demand for replies to questions from the McCabes.</p><p>There is also the not insignificant issue of the serious shortcomings that have now been exposed in Tusla and the need for reassurance that our child protection services are fit for purpose now and not at some point at the end of a lengthy period of inquiry.  Finally and not least, there is the need to discuss and agree the most appropriate action to be taken by the current Garda Commissioner and also her position.  This needs to be agreed in detail on a cross-party basis and is not something that can be readied up between the two main parties.  This needs to be dealt with at the Business Committee as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I was, as the Ceann Comhairle stated, at Cabinet and there was no intention to collapse anything.  Notwithstanding what others have stated, I wish to make a suggestion.  Can we agree the Order of Business until 5.17 p.m. today?  The House could carry on until we have our meeting at 4 p.m. when we can agree what we want to do from Topical Issues thereafter.  I know I may have changes to make to the Order of Business for tomorrow and Thursday arising from the potential establishment of a tribunal.  It would mean that we would not go dark.  We could carry on with questions to the Taoiseach and perhaps questions to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, until we decide what we are doing.</p></speech>

This is a major decision but it needs to be got right in the interests of a comprehensive response.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams made the point about the questions.

The Ministers should come to the House and answer questions about this issue.

Last week, in a debate in the British Parliament on the Brexit Bill, the British Government, the Conservative Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Ulster Unionist Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party all voted down an amendment which would have blocked any changes to the Good Friday Agreement.  This is clearly in breach of the assurances given by Prime Minister Theresa May to the Taoiseach.  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will today meet the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, who voted against protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask the Taoiseach to have his Minister tell the British representative that this is totally unacceptable to the Government.  The Taoiseach should also revise his narrative on this issue and start fully and wholeheartedly protecting the integrity of the Agreement.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Adams that I made it perfectly to the British Prime Minister when I spoke to her originally and more recently in Dublin that the Good Friday Agreement is absolutely central and sacrosanct, as are the votes of the people, North and South.  This issue will be a clear priority for us in all of this.  We want to see the Good Friday Agreement continue and its successor agreements implemented in full.  This is an issue on which we will negotiate hard from a European perspective to see that it continues as a central issue in the negotiations when they commence.</p></speech>

As I indicated, three Private Members' Bills have been drafted by the Opposition, one each from Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party.  It is my understanding that the spokespersons of the three parties will meet this week to discuss a consolidated Bill.

The HPRA report is flawed and does not go nearly far enough.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Bill we introduced on 1 December 2016 will come before the Select Committee on Health?  It should be taken within 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  On a serious related matter, Deputy Harty made comments over the weekend which prejudiced the Bill proposed by People Before Profit.  The Deputy stated that the Bill is no longer needed.  I have asked him for clarification but he has not provided it.  His role as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Health is untenable.  He has shown disrespect to me, my party comrades and the people in the Public Gallery on 1 December last.  I ask him to comment.

In the context of the extraordinary Kafkaesque accusations which were made in respect of Sergeant Maurice McCabe via Tusla and those Deputies who as indicated in the media will perhaps be supporting the Government - Deputy Harty says he makes up his mind on a case-by-case basis and Deputy Lowry says he has not decided which way he will vote but he is likely to back the Government - has the Taoiseach had any discussions with those Deputies or other Deputies from whom he may possibly gain support about Tusla and what, in effect, through their agency and offices has been done whether against the internal rules of the agency or against the law?  Has the Taoiseach had any discussion with the Deputies mentioned or with anybody else because they are indicating that they propose to back the Government, presumably based on reason and context and the understanding as indicated by Deputy Lowry on a previous occasion unspecified he has with the Government?</p></speech>

It is reasonable to state that collective Cabinet responsibility has broken down in recent times in terms of Ministers flatly contradicting one another.  I understand the Taoiseach had a meeting this morning with the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in advance of Cabinet.  Are there regular meetings between the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in relation to the confidence and supply arrangements or how are the confidence and supply arrangements supported at leadership level between the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il?</p>  <p>  In regard to the question raised by my colleague, Deputy Burton, on the Government's maintained support of Deputy Lowry, the Chief Whip was reported as saying that she provided weekly briefings to him but information obtained under a freedom of information request indicated that there was no available material in that regard.  Are weekly briefings provided to Deputy Lowry or any other Deputy outside of Government?</p></speech>

It may well be that a Deputy may not read his or her notification of business and may contact the Whip's Office about the business of the House but as far as I understand it there are no individual briefings of the nature mentioned by Deputy Howlin.  I have often said that in terms of party leadership there are occasions when it is necessary to talk to all of the party leaders.

If Deputy Howlin made a similar request, I would be happy to meet him, as leader of the Labour Party.</p>  <p>  In regard to the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, that is a matter that is reviewed.  If Deputy Martin or other Deputies on the far side wish to make a comment about an element of the confidence and supply agreement, which is published, then they do so.  There are not regular meetings about it to the effect of whether we have addressed No. 5 or No. 6.  Meetings between leaders take place as necessary.

As the Taoiseach said, he met this morning with Deputy Martin.  Perhaps he would brief the D&aacute;il on whether the Fianna F&aacute;il leader committed his party's continued support for the Government and what commitments, if any, he gave in return for that support.

The parties were forming something together but Sinn F&eacute;in broke it up.  It is extremely important right now in the Republic that, in response to the crisis, we have meetings to obtain answers on a core public issue that is convulsing the nation and that goes to the heart of the administration of justice.  It is important that we meet and convey the views and emotion of the family at the heart of this.  That is important and that manifests itself in a public policy which has now broken away from the idea of a commission of investigation, with all the perils a tribunal can involve.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Lowry is very clear that he has an understanding with the Government.  He says it puts him in a privileged position when it comes to having meetings with Ministers and influencing the allocation of funds to the constituency.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach differs with him in that regard.  Is the Taoiseach saying the Deputy is not telling the truth in this matter?  Does the Deputy have an arrangement with the Taoiseach?</p>  <p>  Could the Taoiseach indicate when Deputy "Boxer" Moran will be taking over from Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney as Minister of State?  When is the exchange, the toss-of-the-coin job as to who will be Minister of State for a year?  When is the decision due?</p></speech>

There is no favouritism shown here.  People who have their ear to the ground might know that things are going to happen.

Has the Cabinet reached an understanding yet with its constituent groupings and its Independents on the matters relating to the formation of the tribunal and, more important, as I said on the last occasion, relating to the grave wrong that was done, the Kafkaesque experience of Sergeant McCabe and his family regarding the complaint made against them via Tusla?

As a consequence, he recommended that there be a commission of investigation and suggested terms of reference to cover all the relevant matters.  Clearly, we have moved on from that because there is no point in having a commission of investigation if there will not be participation by one of the central elements, the McCabe family.  Therefore, the Government reached agreement in principle this morning to have a public inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.  The issue now is to draft the terms of reference for that inquiry and determine its structure, range and how it is to be set up.  I hope that can be done today and tomorrow and that the matter can go through the House on Thursday, and also the Seanad, so the commission of inquiry can start its work.</p></speech>

To support the work of the ministerial task force, Mr Kieran Mulvey was appointed to engage with the local community groups, representatives and other interests and to report back with specific recommendations.  The terms of reference for this work were published in July and these include making recommendations on specific measures to support the long-term economic and social regeneration of the area, including in the areas of community safety and policing; early intervention programmes for children; education and training; employment opportunities; housing; improving the physical environment; tackling the impact of drugs; and community development, including family, youth and recreation activity.  Part of the work involves reviewing and making recommendations on structures and procedures to ensure better co-ordination of statutory and non-statutory programmes in the area.  A number of short-term measures were announced to help the community address some of the immediate challenges facing it, and these have been progressed by the responsible Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  Those Members close to the area will know that Mr. Kieran Mulvey has spent a lot of time in the area since he started his work last September.  He has walked the area many times, visiting projects and residents, and he has engaged with the business community, local community and political representatives.  Throughout this extensive period of consultation, he has formed his views on what is needed to regenerate the area and help the community of the north inner city.  He briefed the ministerial task force in late December, setting out the main areas of recommendations.  As promised, he met with members of the community on 1 February and set out the broad outline of the report, including the main areas of recommendations, providing time and space for the community to respond.  I understand that was a very positive engagement and was well attended, with strong contributions covering a broad range of issues of importance to the community.  Mr. Mulvey has finalised his report, which will be published later this week.  I expect the Government to move quickly to respond to the report's recommendations and it will work with all the people involved to ensure a properly resourced implementation plan is put in place.</p></reply>

I have been told by quite a number of people that while people very much welcome the fact that the report has been issued at all, they have serious concerns over the fact that no mention was made of the investment of money to implement the various proposals, some of which are very good.  Can the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that these proposals will be fully funded?  There were not even any costs in regard to most of them.  We know there was about &euro;1 million extra allocated last year and carried over into this year for much-needed sports facilities, for instance.  Can the Taoiseach state what will happen to the many iconic buildings in the area, particularly the old Rutland Street school, which is now standing empty for a long time?  There seemed to be a difficulty with the task force accepting that historic buildings with a very prominent history in community life may not be restored.  Will the Taoiseach commit to addressing these issues?</p>  <p>  The other issue is that Mr. Kieran Mulvey suggested very strongly - I support his suggestion - that the employers in the IFSC should become responsible for providing employment opportunities, training and education to local people.  Despite agreement on this, there is no mechanism in the report by which to follow it up.</p></speech>

We welcome the setting up of the task force and Mr. Kieran Mulvey's recommendation of initiatives and interventions needed immediately in the north inner city.  The Taoiseach will recall that in July 2016, he met the community representatives and stakeholders.  I understand he made a commitment on the refurbishment of Rutland Street school.  Apparently, that is not now being delivered on.  The Taoiseach also made a commitment that this would be a community-led initiative.</p><p>The community came together and developed a substantive submission that was presented to Mr. Mulvey.  The community was under the impression, or at least believed, that it would have access to this report, but it has not had that.  Community members have been told that it was with the task force or was going to the Cabinet.  There is a rumour going around - maybe it is a false one - that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, met the business community about the Mulvey report, but did not meet the community group that made the substantive submission.  Will the Taoiseach provide some clarity on this matter?</p> <p> I am familiar with the inner city area.  It is a community that has been let down by politicians and the elites for a long time.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, we have seen evidence of planned-for spending being repackaged and the main reports have been delayed.</p>  <p>  I wish to address two aspects.  First, the one consistent demand from the community has been for the development of a new community facility in the old Rutland Street school buildings.  It is an historic location and its development would be symbolic of faith in the long-term spirit of the community, yet Dublin City Council has announced that the likely cost is too high.  Will the Taoiseach agree to step in and ensure that the project can go ahead?</p>  <p>  Second, many areas need systematic planning and support.  It should not require high-profile murders before the State pays attention.  In 2011, the Taoiseach abolished the role of the Minister of State for local development and the Government got rid of the many area-based schemes targeted at the most disadvantaged communities.  The schemes had an excellent record and delivered substantial improvements.  When I met the local community, the constant criticism was that many of the community supports that it had enjoyed for more than a decade had been whittled away in recent years.  That was a mistake and the community suffered as a result.  In particular, the RAPID programme has been undermined.  There was much behind it.  It was a yardstick by which Government investment was allocated.  It should be properly restored nationally.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that none of the funding for the inner city allocations will come from reducing allocations to other areas of the city?</p></speech>

This is coming directly from the community.  We should say it on the day that Garda morale has been impacted by other developments.  There are exemplary garda&iacute; doing work on the ground.</p>  <p>  I am interested in asking the Taoiseach about the implementation of the plan.  He stated that it would be published at the end of the week.  What will the Government do with it then?  What is the implementation strategy?  When we discussed this at the beginning, the idea was that we would have all-party buy-in and a commitment to fixed resources over time so that the plan would be an exemplar to be replicated in other socially disadvantaged areas.  What is the Government going to do once the plan is published?  What is the implementation procedure?  Does it involve the House debating, deciding and committing ourselves over a number of D&aacute;ileanna to ensure that the proposals are implemented?</p></speech>

The community is anxious to get a response to those submissions, but my information is that the commitments given at that meeting were vague and uncosted, there was a rehearsing of old themes and no new real commitments were made.  There was nothing tangible on housing, community facilities, the integration of new communities, youth services or supports for the elderly, all of the issues that need to be addressed, and there was a reliance on previous commitments.  Most importantly, no commitment on additional funding in 2017 was given.  If there are to be new projects and initiatives, new funding is needed.  The Government must be conscious of this.</p>  <p>  There has been a suggestion about renaming the north inner city.  That is a matter for the local community, but I am unsure as to whether it is a good idea.</p></speech>

There is a crisis, the Government has to be seen to be doing something, there is a media frenzy, a task force is set up, and once the media frenzy ends, the interest from and commitment by Government wanes.  I hope that that is not the case in this instance and that there is a serious programme of implementation.

It is an important building.  It is owned by DCC, which does not intend to dispose of it.  We are working to see how best we can accommodate that and deal with it, but it is a substantial increase in the estimates, as the Deputy is aware.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey mentioned the renaming of the area.  It is a rebranding, as it were.  Okay, the Deputy does not agree with it.  It is to rebrand it without losing its identity and is to be carried out by the community itself.  It may wish to do this, it may not wish to do it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin is right in talking about the Garda superintendent involved there.  He has done a superb job with his members, both in dealing with understanding who the people are - their names, their families, their involvement in the community - and also dealing, of course, with the more serious issue of crime and gangland crime.  That is one of the reasons why the Fitzgibbon Street station is an iconic building just up the road from Croke Park.  The intention is to re-open Fitzgibbon Street station as a really central Garda station within a stone's throw of half a dozen murders.  There is some preparatory work to be done on that.  The board of works has carried out its estimates and I expect that to move ahead shortly.</p>  <p>  There is a whole list of smaller things that are important.  Examples include the improvement works at the swimming pool, the public lighting upgrade, the painting of public lighting, signposts and all of these things to improve the general look of the area.  This has been a central feature of what communities have said - broken footpaths, windows smashed, places that are overgrown and derelict - in terms of making an improvement in all of those things.</p><p>I refer, for example, to the Mountjoy Square railings, the restoration and the improvements, the public domain improvements, including roads resurfacing and realignment, vacant sites, hoardings, the Sheriff Street recreation centre equipment upgrade and sporting facilities for many of the communities such as indoor pitches, all-weather pitches, boxing clubs and all of the various measures.  It will all be published on Thursday.  Deputy Martin inquired about how it will be implemented.  The intention is that it will be done by Dublin City Council, DCC, and some of the groups themselves.  The implementation plan will be followed faithfully.  There is money involved and sizeable allocations will be made to improve the general lot of the area in the coming years.</p></speech>

We will proceed with the development of Rutland Street school and Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, which are two major iconic buildings.  There is involvement with the corporates from the IFSC and interest has been expressed by the National College of Ireland in working with disadvantaged children through its schools programme.  Quite a deal of activity has taken place recently to give everybody an opportunity, from Grangegorman on one side to the National College of Ireland on the other, flanked by the IFSC, together with the improvements throughout the area.  The streets are quite wide in the area and they were well built initially but many of them have fallen into disrepair.  That is all part of the general improvement of the environment and presentation of the locality.  The schools are working very hard to bring about a situation where every child in the north inner city gets a real opportunity.</p></speech>

The NESDO is the corporate body of the National Economic and Social Council.

Perhaps it hearkens back to a different time and while the idea of social partnership might be a loaded concept now but it is a relevant one and an important one still.</p>  <p>  We have already reached a period of some considerable industrial disputes.  Tesco workers are on strike today.  In the public sector nurses and teachers are about to go on strike and in the semi-State sector there is the possibility of bus drivers going on strike, and there are others.  In that context does the Taoiseach think we need to have some restoration of a mechanism for social dialogue?  I refer in particular to the old employer-labour conference concept, which was a final appeal mechanism when intractable disputes could not be resolved and representatives of labour and employers could knock heads together, as it were.  The mechanism has worked very effectively in the past.  When people run out of space sometimes one needs a third-party mechanism to enable intervention.  In the context of what we are probably facing into in the coming months in both the public and private spheres we need to be alert to the need for mechanisms that can defuse disputes before they do serious damage to the well-being of our people and to our economic well-being.</p></speech>

He knows from his own experience the importance of being able to deal with issues in advance.  Clearly there are concerns in respect of rail workers, bus workers, some teachers, nurses and staff in the medical profession other than nurses.  The business of public pay in general is being considered by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  We have had a number of interventions both from unions and business to have discussions about the perspective that lies ahead.  Without returning to social partnership, as was, or the employer-labour conference, we are putting in place a mechanism by which people can come and discuss forthcoming issues in a forum that is not a decision-making process but would give the Government a clear indication of their views so that issues do not become siloed.  One can have a general discussion about the issues that affect people and the impact they will have on them.  As Deputy Howlin is well aware, discussions are about to begin in respect of Brexit and the negotiations that will take place once Article 50 is moved.  Unions and employers across a range of sector have turned up at meetings on the issue around the country to give their views, both North and South.  The second all-island forum is on Friday of this week in Dublin Castle.  I suppose Deputy Howlin will attend it.  That is the facility we have in place now and I hope it will continue to prove beneficial without going back to the old social partnership concept of the past.</p></speech>

What is not clear is where in government leadership will come from in this area because we are seeing more and more examples of strife and conflict in the public service concerning both service provision and remuneration.  The Government is making it up as it goes along, and that is taking a charitable view.  Before Christmas there was the Garda dispute and the Labour Court intervention was a catalyst for bringing forward the Lansdowne Road pay agreement.  There is the transport dispute with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is also the health dispute involving nurses and now general care staff are looking for concessions.  That is a huge worry for people given the prospect of industrial action in hospitals.</p>  <p>  In previous times there was a social partnership framework and since the crash it is a concept that dare not speak its name.  When one talks to people either in the public service or elsewhere there seems to be a general lament and longing for some framework, forum or dialogue on a consistent and ongoing basis so as to have a greater vision and sense of a collective approach to the future of the country and society.  It seems that the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater, so to speak, in terms of the concept of social partnership.  I do not say we should go back to it, as it is clear there were errors and mistakes made in previous iterations of it, but given what Deputy Howlin raised in his question on the NESDO it seems there is relevance in terms of what structures we have nationally to facilitate the pursuit of common ideals between partners in society, namely, the trade union movement, farmers, the community and voluntary pillar and the Oireachtas.  That absence is contributing to a vacuum which, in turn, is lending itself to periodic and episodic bouts of conflict and industrial disputes, one leapfrogging another and there is a real danger the situation will spin out of control in terms of the public service.  The Taoiseach might indicate what he intends to do in the coming weeks to try to prevent the escalation of industrial conflict.</p></speech>

The review concluded that NESC continued to provide an important forum for discussing social, economic and environmental issues on a multilateral basis across a number of sectors.  A number of other fora exist for engagement such as the National Economic Dialogue, the new Labour Employer Economic Forum, the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Social Inclusion Forum.  NESC remains the only forum where national economic, social, environmental and institutional views can engage and interact.  These other fora or opportunities are also important.  In particular, I hope that the Labour Employer Economic Forum will prove to be somewhat beneficial for discussions of this nature.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has been very careful in his assessment of the range of services for public service for the time ahead in order to put in place a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I regret that the ASTI executive was not in a position to recommend acceptance of the improved offer in respect of Lansdowne Road to teachers.  The Garda dispute went before the Labour Court and that matter has been attended to.  Clearly, there are issues about whether capacity to strike will be considered in terms of the legislation.  These are important elements.</p></speech>

Our little discussion about the north inner city shows the merits of proper engagement with the community and voluntary sector based on equality.  We have the same thing in terms of our farmers and rural communities.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged the economic crisis presented by Brexit and the fact we are facing major strikes, one of which is in the health service.  There is strike at Tesco where the employer is trying to force a section of the workforce to accept a new contract which would give these workers inferior terms and conditions.  There is a threatened strike at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  God knows what might present.  We know these workers only take up this action because they feel they have no other options.  The statutory responsibility for social partnership rests with the Taoiseach.  How does he manage?  How does he structure these relations with the social partners?  The issue of demolishing NESDO goes back to 2013.  To my knowledge, we do not even have a date for when these matters will be debated here.  Could the Taoiseach tell us how he manages relationships with these sectors in a structural way and when the process of scrapping NESDO will be completed?</p></speech>

All Ministers engage in dialogue on these matters.  Formal structures in place include the National Economic Dialogue, the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Social Inclusion Forum.  The role of NESC needs to be assessed in light of these arrangements.  In addition to these structures, we now have the national risk assessment process.  We have just published the national risk assessment for 2016, which identifies the strategic risks in the economic, environmental, geopolitical, social and technological areas.  The programme for Government also points to the need for longer term planning, specifically citing areas like housing, broadband, climate change, pensions and long-term funding models in higher education and health.  The question of pensions was raised earlier today.  We need to find a way to bring all these elements together in a coherent fashion and to tap into the knowledge and expertise that is out there regardless of whether it lies with academic experience or other experience.  I did not set a specific timeline for the completion of the assessment process.  A great deal of work is being carried out by the Department and this work will, hopefully, come to a conclusion soon.  I will return to the House in respect of this issue.</p></speech>

Tusla provides a significant level of financial support to family resource centres across the country to assist them in their work with vulnerable children and families.  Tusla provides funding to some 109 communities through the family and community services resource centre programme.  This typically covers the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs.  In 2016, Tusla provided &euro;13.5 million in core funding under the programme.  In addition, Tusla provided funding of &euro;595,000 to family resource centres for counselling services under the agency's counselling grants scheme.  In December 2016, in recognition of the valuable work that the family resource centres do, Tusla provided additional once-off funding of &euro;1.422 million to centres.  This additional funding, which was in the form of minor capital assistance, allowed for the upgrade of equipment and other remedial works at centres.</p>  <p>  Family resource centres are supported by two regional support agencies, which are funded by Tusla under the family and community services resource centre programme.  These support agencies play a key role in promoting good practice providing technical support, advice and training to family resource centres.</p>  <p>  Tusla also provides funding under the programme to the family resource centre national forum.  The forum operates as a network for all family resource centres.  It provides networking and training opportunities as well as information and support.  Tusla plans to build on the strengths of the programme in the years ahead as it continues to deliver on its mandate for community-based early intervention, prevention and family support.  Tusla is currently finalising details of the funding to be allocated to family resource centres in 2017 and will be confirming funding levels for individual centres shortly.</p></speech>

It is not the first time I have put down this question but rather the second.  The reason I put down this question is because family resource centres are stretched to capacity.  By and large, most family resource centres have approximately two key workers.  The Minister is right.  Funding covers salaries and a bit of capital.  Most centres do not have a development worker.  They provide valuable resources to families in need, particularly in respect of counselling services for children.</p><p>An example is Gort family resource centre, where they are helping with the undocumented.  They need three times the amount of staff to deal with what is being presented.  They are carrying out the role of the community welfare officer also.  When is the Minister going to allocate funding to support the development workers that are required on the ground and to deliver a good service and support to Tusla?</p></speech>

Tusla is currently finalising details of the funding to be allocated to family resource centres in 2017.  As the Deputy knows, I was able to increase the overall budget for Tusla for 2017.  It will confirm funding levels for individual centres shortly.  I understand the various issues raised by the Deputy in terms of the difficulties and the levels of funding.  Tusla is looking at that and is engaging with Family Resource Centre National Forum, which represents the views of all the family resource centres nationally.  It also meets with individual family resource centres on an annual basis to discuss governance, funding and service issues.  Tusla recognises the benefits that additional funding can bring to family resource centres.  In my 2017 statement to Tusla, I emphasised the importance of prevention and early intervention in enhancing outcomes for families and children as one of my key priorities.</p></speech>

Support for the family resource centres has to be front and centre of what we are looking for from Tusla.  From 2011 up to the previous budget, the centres endured a huge number of cuts.  That has impacted on the service they deliver at a local level, which affects every family that requests their support, be it from the very young to the most vulnerable and the aged.  They provide an outstanding service.  I witness it myself in Loughrea family support centre, where the additional capitation means that they can now look forward to moving into a new centre and can cut down on the fundraising they were continuously doing.  It is amazing how the little bit of funding directed in that way can support the family resource centres, the development workers and the extra capitation.  Many families can benefit from that quality of care.</p></speech>

The Deputy has suggested that there are certain ways in which additional resources should be targeted in order to increase the efficiency of the family resource centres that work in conjunction with their own communities and, no doubt, with a number of volunteers.  As I said earlier, Tusla recognises the benefits that additional funding can bring to family resource centres, as I do myself.  It is Tusla's intention to review the funding and resource allocation model as it applies to family resource centres.  The review will take account of significant resource pressures experienced by family resource centres up and down the country.</p></speech>

I am very willing and happy to participate in any of the decisions that the business committee is now engaged in.  With regard to the parliamentary question, I am aware that providing care for children below the age of three results in higher costs to services than caring for older children.  This is as a result of the legally required adult-child ratio, which is as low as 1:3 in the case of the youngest children. </p>  <p>  Some services providing this care have been impacted by the full implementation of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, which requires that all staff should hold a minimum FETAC level 5 qualification when working directly with children.  In several cases, services have been utilising staff working on community employment, CE, schemes to count towards their required ratios.  Under the regulations, this will only be allowed when the individual in question has the necessary qualification. </p>  <p>  In order to assist the services in addressing this challenge, I recently announced that &euro;1 million of additional funding will be made available to child care providers who have been facilitating the training of community employment scheme workers to ensure that regulatory changes do not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places. </p>  <p>  In preparation for the implementation of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, which the Deputy's question refers to, child care committees Ireland were commissioned by my Department to investigate the impact of new child care regulations on community childcare providers.</p>  <p>  This research indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However, it did find that some services had come to rely on community employment scheme workers and I determined that these services should be provided additional funding to enable them to recruit and retain qualified staff to work alongside their CE scheme participants.</p></reply>

I attended a meeting yesterday in Cork.  It was entitled "perfect storm".  I believe it was aptly named because it was about the combination of the changes in regulation, the new child care scheme and the pressures on the community sector generally.  It related specifically to 13 services in and around Cork city and 349 children attending those.  As the Minister will be aware, I am on the board of management of one of those as a non-executive director.  It is an issue of very particular concern.  They believe that those 13 services in Cork city will all be closed by September 2018.  This is obviously not just about Cork, it is a nationwide issue.  The Minister is aware of the benefits of this in terms of early intervention.  Clearly, there is a need for a recognition of how we fund these services for the complex additional needs that many children attending these services have.  For example, in Cork, 26% of the children attending those community services have an additional need and 24% are awaiting diagnosis.  There needs to be a financial recognition of that additional need.</p></speech>

We have been attentive to those and I have been specifically concerned about the centres he has raised.  I know that resources are required.  The Deputy questioned that &euro;1 million figure.  However, we did set aside a significant sum of money in order to ensure that the concerns the Deputy raises are going to be addressed.  As a result, I have made available with that money up to &euro;2,000 for services to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management.  I will make sufficient additional money available to each service after analysis of their individual financial situation to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff until September 2017.  After this time, these services should be in a position to fund these places through their own income, but this will be kept under review.  No service will be forced to close.</p></speech>

However, maintaining them through their own income either involves cutting some services or increasing fees.  These are services that service disadvantaged areas.  If there is not going to be a commitment to an additional long-term funding for additional places, it will not be sustainable for those settings to maintain those staff and settings.  They will focus on ECCE and ACS schemes.  Some of the zero to three years services will lose out.  Will the Minister introduce sustainability measures for the long term to ensure that services will remain open?  Will she take into account the additional need per child for increased payments?  Will she meet with myself and the other Deputies from my constituency to discuss the specific issue that was raised at that meeting yesterday?</p></speech>

I would be happy to hold a meeting such as the one he requests.  Second, with regard to funding for sustainability measures in a long-term capacity, the answer is "yes".  The setting aside of &euro;1 million for budget 2017 indicates the initial commitment and the ways in which my Department and I, in the discussions, try to support the services to ensure they do not have to close and that they can maintain the commitment to communities, particularly communities of disadvantage.  There is no question that we do not have that commitment.  However, the commitment to sustainability comes in the establishment of the affordable child care scheme and my intention is to ensure, in budget 2018, that we get more moneys into that sustainable child care scheme, always with a focus on other communities where people with disadvantage live.</p></speech>

I am happy to reply to her question again, with perhaps some additional information.</p>  <p>  Under Tusla's current national leaving and aftercare policy, young people leaving care are expected to have an aftercare plan.  Tusla has informed me that from January up to the end of September 2016, 467 young persons in care turned 18 years of age.  Of these, 457 young people were eligible for aftercare supports and 412 are availing of the aftercare supports.  There were a total of 1,841 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of aftercare supports from Tusla at the end of the third quarter in 2016, and 82% of these young people had an aftercare plan in place.</p>  <p>  Tusla is putting in place revisions to its operational national leaving and aftercare policy to bring it into line with the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015.  Once the amendments to the 1991 Act are commenced there will be a statutory obligation on Tusla to have an aftercare plan prior to the young person leaving care.  Those who have left care before the changes and who do not have an aftercare plan can, under these amendments, obtain an aftercare plan from Tusla up to their 21st birthday.  Tusla is identifying gaps in the aftercare service nationally and has indicated that this will require an expansion in aftercare management and workers.  Tusla is currently finalising arrangements for the publication of its 2017 business plan, which sets out the priorities for these important services in 2017.  Its 2017 budget, as Deputy Rabbitte knows, was increased by &euro;37 million, bringing its funding to over &euro;700 million in Exchequer funding, and this included additional funding to support service delivery to implement legislation.</p></reply>

I attended the Empowering People in Care, EPIC, conference before Christmas and the main point from it was the lack of access to aftercare plans and the lack of continuity with social care workers.  That they did not have that was their biggest concern.</p>  <p>  I met with a provider last week who looks after children in residential care to whom I put the question of aftercare, and I did not get a positive response.  He told me of the 18 year old who is literally left at the front door with black bags.  That is not what I call an aftercare plan and whether it is Tusla, or whatever organisation is responsible, we need more than statistics.  I need to hear that as does the Minister.  The social care workers must tell us that their aftercare plans are working but that is not what I am hearing.</p></speech>

I will make some additional comments in response to the questions the Deputy raised.  I refer to young persons who are eligible but perhaps not availing of supports.  Young persons who are eligible for aftercare supports may choose not to avail of them.  I accept that is not Deputy Rabbitte's example but there are instances where that is the case.  However, Tusla maintains contact with the young person where that is possible.  The young person may have disengaged with Tusla as they return to the wider family for support or for their own reasons but Tusla keeps the door open for contact and will help in terms of the immediate and longer term support for the young person that can be provided by the State.  There are supports also that are provided by Tusla without an aftercare plan.</p></speech>

The reason I continue to harp on about this issue is because for the 233 children in full-time residential care, the only people who are responsible for them and charged with their governance - effectively their parents - are this Government.  I continue to ask the question because we have a duty of care to those young people who sometimes do not have a voice, do not know how to access the proper services or might be misguided because they think they know it all at 17 or 18 years of age when in fact they do not.  It is not just me conveying what I am experiencing.  Focus Ireland, in its submission to Tusla, stated that one of the problems was the lack of continuity among social care workers, that relationships had not been built and that young people below the age of 16 or 18 years are not governed by having the aftercare plan.  I raise this issue with the Minister on a regular basis for the simple reason that we are the parents governing these children.</p></speech>

It is correct that she should do so.  What I have been indicating is an awareness of what the Deputy is saying while at the same time giving a commitment, as the Deputy has done, to ensure that the aftercare provisions are improved on and that any young person who wants to engage in aftercare as they age out of care has the possibility of doing that.  In terms of the numbers, I have indicated to the Deputy that most of them do have that at this stage.  However, Tusla is aware that there are gaps in the aftercare service nationally and it is revising its policy on aftercare and carrying out a number of consultations in that regard.  It has also mapped the availability of aftercare staff nationally and identified a number of areas that could benefit from additional aftercare sources.  Its business plan commits to the completion of aftercare policy and supporting documents by the second quarter of 2017.  It is currently recruiting social care staff, including recent graduates, who will allow Tusla to fill the gaps in its services.  In those ways it is, under my direction, following an effort to prioritise and increase the capacity of provision of aftercare plans.</p></speech>

We need time to raise the issues, particularly from the perspective of spokespersons on children and youth affairs.  The fact that incorrect information was in the system in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na long after it had become apparent that it was not true and that that data could have come from what was the Health Service Executive, HSE, at the time but is now Tusla's responsibility is something on which we all want to ask questions and need to ask questions on behalf of the public.</p>  <p>  The question I tabled is on the number of unallocated cases that have not been assigned a social worker and are under the child and welfare protection services.  The target for the end of 2016 was for a 60% reduction in the number of open cases.  My question is to find out if that target has been reached.</p></reply>

As I said, I am willing to engage should that be the decision of the Business Committee.<br/><br/>On the question the Deputy has put before me, as she is aware, I have placed a high priority on addressing the number of children who are without an allocated social worker.  I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017 and Tusla is now in its second year of a three year plan to ensure a social worker is allocated to all children and young people who need one.  In its 2017 business plan it identified additional funding of &euro;2 million for the recruitment of more than 120 social workers to further reduce the number of unallocated cases.<br/><br/>The number of cases without an allocated social worker stood at 6,718 at the end of 2015.  The figure at the end of 2016 was 5,413, representing a reduction of 19%, or 1,305, over the course of 2016.  Cases to be allocated to a social worker include children known to Tusla whose social worker is no longer available to them, as well as children waiting to be allocated for the first time.  All unallocated cases are assessed and prioritised according to risk.  It will continue to be challenging to address the problem of unallocated cases, but we made good progress during 2016 and Tusla will continue to prioritise the issue in 2017.<br/><br/>I have provided Tusla with the necessary financial resources to tackle the problem.  I secured additional funding of &euro;37 million in 2017, bringing its overall allocation to more than &euro;700 million.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br/><br/>A key challenge to achieve our objectives will be the recruitment of sufficient social workers and other professional and supporting staff.  Tusla is engaged in a major recruitment of social workers, social care workers and business support staff for this purpose.  It is important to emphasise that, as Tusla's three year plan to address unallocated cases continues, all urgent cases are dealt with immediately and prioritised, as required.  These children do not simply go on a waiting list.  My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I attach a high priority to tackling this matter and will continue to engage directly with the Tusla board and senior management team over the course of the year to review progress.</p></reply>

The target figure was 60%, but what has actually been reached is 19%, which clearly is totally inadequate for the children who have had no social worker allocated to them, despite the fact they are at risk.  Why is this the case?  The Minister has just said extra funding was allocated, but I believe there is a problem with recruitment.  We were told Tusla expected to reach its target by the end of 2016, but it is clear that the target has not been reached.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask about the 24-hour service.  There is a very limited service available.  There is an on-call social worker whose number is available to the Garda and a very limited number of other agencies but not to all those involved in child welfare services.  There is no opportunity to have a one on one meeting between a social worker and a child at risk.</p>  <p>  In the context of the issues I mentioned at the very start, including closing cases when there is no longer perceived to be a risk, this point must be reached at some stage, but we really need to know how come in a case in the public arena of which we are aware incorrect data were still on the Garda system a year or so after it had been identified that they were not correct.</p></speech>

I concur that her ability to do maths is good and accept what she said.  Although there was a significant reduction of 19% in the number of unallocated cases in 2016, that does not mean the target was reached.  It was a self-imposed target, but I am aware that it was not reached.  Additional funding of &euro;4.2 million has been allocated for the recruitment of almost 70 social workers and to deal with legislative issues related to Children First, adoption and after-care services.  The target for the number of social workers at the end of 2017 is 1,675 whole-time equivalents, an increase of more than 200 on the number at the end of 2016.  As the Deputy is aware, this is a key issue in dealing with unallocated cases.  The target is still ambitious.  Tusla is in the second year of a three year plan.</p>  <p>  On the 24-hour service, I am aware of the issue, as is Tusla.  We hope that in time we will be able to improve it and move beyond the current arrangements.</p></speech>

Is there a sign-off?  Is there a management system in place, whereby it is stated a case is closed and information on it should not be in any arena.  The Minister obviously knows that I am speaking about Sergeant McCabe.  There should be a system in place, whereby Tusla ticks boxes to state an issue has been fully dealt with.</p></speech>

Because child care costs for parents in Ireland are among the highest in the OECD, we need to address the issues of affordability and quality at the same time.  The Department is not an employer of child care workers, but it is a significant funder of child care services.  I am very conscious that there is an issue with the pay and conditions of workers in the sector and the Department is engaging with the early years sector to explore how it can be addressed in the short, medium and long term.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality child care, which probably has more to do with what will happen in the medium term.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new single affordable child care scheme and we are progressing this work in that context.  The review will feed into future policy development, including on levels of payments to services.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the previous two budgets delivered a 35% increase each year in funding for child care services.  We need to continue to invest and I will argue for more resources in 2018.  To go some way towards addressing cost pressures faced by providers in the sector, I have secured &euro;10 million to enable them to be paid for non-contact time, when they will have no children present and will be able to pay staff to concentrate on the administrative workload.  The services can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  That is to happen in the short term.</p></speech>

It is welcome that she has said she will argue for more funds.  All of the child care providers and staff watching will be delighted to hear this.  Representativesd of Early Childhood Ireland, ECI, appeared before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs at its most recent meeting, as did Ms Marion Quinn from the Association of Childhood Professionals, ACP, and representatives of the city and county child care committees.  ECI and the ACP stated they would have preferred if the review had been carried out before we went down the route of the affordable child care scheme.  As someone who is committed and true to her word, the Minister has delivered on the objective of providing affordable child care, but people are still looking for the findings of the review.  What exactly is its status?  When can we expect to hear the results?  Will they feed into the Minister's budgetary recommendations later this year?</p></speech>

The answer is "Absolutely."  I am happy to come back with an exact, or almost exact, deadline for when we expect to have it but I need to check with officials first.  The terms of the review are being worked on.  I appreciate that the child care sector will be looking for them but its own research will feed into the review and is guiding us now in the decisions we make on how to use the money I got in budget 2017.</p>  <p>  We anticipate that this will come and will give us more evidence than we have now to enable us to have strong negotiations for budget 2018.</p></speech>

There are concerns among community providers and private providers over the sums provided by Early Childhood Ireland.  They show that private providers have to pay commercial rates and this makes them different from community providers, who in turn are concerned over wages.  Up to the end of last year they had CE workers to help with their ratios.  We talk about universal care and affordability but different providers are quite diverse in their concerns.  One has concerns over the ECCE worker and the other over commercial rates.</p></speech>

There is a diversity of cost bases, depending on where they are located, and we must address these and take them into account in our review of costs.  The review will provide us with better evidence than we have at the moment.  That will enable us to make the case more strongly for increased resources and to take account of the diversity in the cost of providing services.</p>  <p>  I agree that concerns around the pay and conditions of the child care workforce are real, and evidence for these is backed up by the reported difficulties.  These concerns have been discussed in the early years forum, where many organisations have raised them.  I am delighted that steps are being taken towards the unionisation of the early years sector and I and officials from the Department met ICTU on this subject.

Social work duty teams keep high-priority cases under review by regularly checking to ascertain risk to the child and where necessary will reprioritise the case.</p><p>Tusla holds the statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection and is the appropriate body to receive reports of concerns relating to children at risk.  Each referral received by the agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Every report of concern for the safety and well-being of a child is assessed and required action is identified. </p><p>I am committed to commencing the Children First Act 2015, which is due to be commenced by the end of the year.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Children First Act 2015 will see mandatory reporting by key professionals, mandated assisting, comprehensive risk assessment and preparation of child safeguarding statements by services for children, and the establishment of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group on a statutory basis.  Tusla is developing online training for mandatory reporters.  Children First guidelines will continue in parallel with the Act.  This sets out the roles and responsibilities for all citizens to report child welfare and protection issues to Tusla and, where criminal matters are involved, the Garda.</p><p>I believe we have made significant progress in our structures and practices for child protection.  The Children First Act 2015 is of particular significance but I see it as part of a suite of child protection legislation that includes the Acts relating to the National Vetting Bureau and the withholding of information on offences against children and vulnerable persons. </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>There is no room for complacency about our safeguarding measures and we will constantly review them to ensure they are effective.</p><p>Tusla works closely with other care providers, including the HSE, in respect of access to primary care services, child and adolescent mental health services, disability and other services.  Tusla and the HSE monitor their interagency relationship to ensure they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.</p></reply>

Is there a system whereby an investigative team can identify particular households and ascertain the causes for a child being referred in these ways?  In a reply to a previous question, I was told that, in the space of one and a half or two years, 300 children aged between ten and 14 were referred to emergency departments having self-harmed.  What is the underlying cause?  How can the system deal with it?  I applaud child care workers for doing what is a very responsible job.  It is a difficult job and the public can often be very critical.  I am concerned about adequate resources being available and that they can be deployed as necessary.</p></speech>

However, Christina Lamb had an article in that paper about unaccompanied migrant children.  Some 25,800 unaccompanied minors arrived in Italy last year, half of whom have now gone missing.  Some 91% of the children on those boats coming across the Mediterranean do not have their parents with them.  We now have a slave trade or trafficking problem as well as a migration one.  In that context, it is welcome that we have the D&aacute;il motion on taking in such children, but there is no legislative basis for it.  In addition, it is not clear what rights such children will be granted.  How will the Minister be working with other Departments to define those rights and ensure that we play our part in what is an incredible tragedy across Europe at the moment?</p></reply>

The new International Protection Act 2015 has been commenced and it contains an enhanced provision from the previous legislation.  It allows the T&aacute;naiste to recognise the children from Calais as programme refugees.  This means that the children can be accepted into the country, with refugee status, once they have completed identity, age and security checks.   Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, receives these children into care.  It also looks after unaccompanied minors who arrive at our ports and are referred by the immigration services.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I are working closely to progress the D&aacute;il resolution on unaccompanied minors who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais.  Tusla staff have undertaken two missions to France so far to meet and assess a number young people who have a desire to come to Ireland.</p>  <p>  At the end of last year, I visited Greece and saw the valuable work being done under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  I met with resilient families and young people who need our help.  My Department is part of the programme, which co-ordinates the interdepartmental and interagency work, and includes the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  I supported the setting up of an IRPP office to facilitate improved co-ordination by arranging the secondment of a senior Tusla manager to it.  Separately, Tusla has seconded a social work team leader to the Reception and Integration Agency, in the Department of Justice and Equality, to assist with its work with families living in direct provision.</p></speech>

I have some specific follow-on questions but if she cannot answer them directly perhaps her Department could write to me.  I am keen to know whether children will be entitled to family reunification rights after they have been relocated to Ireland.  If so, will this extend to their parents, siblings and grandparents?  In many cases, these children only have distant relatives, so what are the provisions in that regard?  I understand many of these children may be 16 or 17 years old, so what kind of supports will be provided to them once they turn 18?</p>  <p>  As regards those minors coming from Calais, I understand that the UK Government has taken 750, which is roughly half the unaccompanied minors.  Does the Minister have any details of the numbers she expects to take from Calais?  Have they been identified and selected for relocation to Ireland?  What collaboration has gone on with the French authorities in that selection process?</p></speech>

In regard to family reunification rights for any unaccompanied minor who comes into the country by whatever route they arrive, one of the first things Tusla engages in is finding family members and assisting the child in being reunited with them.  Young people who were formerly in the Calais camps will come in under a different legal mechanism.  They will already have refugee status which provides them with more security and a sense of stability in traumatic and stressful circumstances.  Having arrived in six to eight weeks' time, if we find when engaging with them and assessing their particular needs that they wish to be reunited with their family, that is one of the first things we try to support them with.  I know there was another question but I will be happy to address that the next time.</p></speech>

In that regard, however, I understand that only 8,000 of those refugees have been relocated, and there are only 171 unaccompanied minors in total.  Where are we in our commitment to accept approximately 4,000 refugees from Greece, in particular, but also within that European programme?  Those 160,000 were meant to be catered for by September 2017.  Where will we be by September in terms of our commitment?  How many unaccompanied minors will there be within the overall total we may take under that scheme, which I understand is the one the Minister is using?</p></speech>

The numbers are increasing subsequent to the visit the T&aacute;naiste and I made to Greece to solidify the kinds of practices undertaken between both countries.  It is approximately 2,000 now but I will have to check.</p>  <p>  I am clear about the unaccompanied minors.  There was a commitment in the initial programme for 20, and we have approximately four or five now.  One of the issues concerning unaccompanied minors coming from an Italian route was that we were not provided with an opportunity to address security and bring garda&iacute; over with us to identify those young people.  That has inhibited the numbers coming in.  At the same time we have already identified 16 coming through the Calais route on the two missions that my Department, Tusla and the Department of Justice and Equality have been engaged in.  We anticipate that we will be able to identify up to 40 before the summer using that route.  They will be fully provided with supports, including efforts to integrate, which was the original context of the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I wonder why that is.  I am sure the Minister will join with me in expressing solidarity with the women and men who are on strike at Tesco.  They work to prevent their kids from falling into poverty.</p>  <p>  My question relates to the greatest fear that parents have of their children being taken into care.  I am not referring to children at real risk, which I fully support.  I am talking about people who are victims of the homelessness crisis.  I have good reason to believe that this is happening and they are being forced to put their own children into care.</p></reply>

In the context of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 years of age who present as "out of home" without their parent or guardian.</p>  <p>  Children under the age of 16 who present as homeless without their parent or guardian are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 which deals with accommodation for homeless children.  Children who are homeless and in emergency accommodation are in the care of their parent or guardian.  Notwithstanding the clearly challenging circumstances that families in emergency accommodation find themselves, I do not think that residing in emergency accommodation, in and of itself, should be the basis for taking children into care.</p><p>Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla's role is to provide family support where this is required.  Tusla has agreed a joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive which covers child welfare protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the Dublin area and it is intended to roll it out across the State.  It will be extended to Galway, Limerick and Cork this year.</p> <p> My Department is working closely with Tusla to provide additional supports for families in emergency accommodation to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation.  Tusla is funding child support workers for this purpose and has also appointed a homelessness liaison officer.  My Department is providing free child care for homeless children in the Dublin area for up to 25 hours a week.  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help to the greatest degree possible those who are affected.</p></speech>

I am getting information that this is happening in three ways.  Orders are being sought by social workers because children are often presenting as frequently ill due to the poor quality of emergency accommodation, lack of routine, bad food, etc.  It is also the case that parents feel pressure to voluntarily place their children in care due to the nature of emergency accommodation with drug users and people with addiction issues nearby.  Others have had their children forcibly removed as a result of problems stemming from their homeless situation.  When I asked the parliamentary question on 31 January, it emerged, amazingly, that Tusla did not keep information on the number of children going into care as a result of homelessness.  Tusla seems to keep a lot of information, but not on something like this.  The head of Barnardos has said that parents are making the heartbreaking decision to leave their children in care because they are unable to secure appropriate accommodation.  It is the biggest child welfare problem we have arising from the homelessness crisis, yet Tusla does not keep any information on the number of parents landing in this situation.</p></speech>

This not my understanding of how children come into care or from a statutory perspective how they should come into care.  I have listened to what Deputy Coppinger has said and I will certainly take it into account and bring it back to my Department and Tusla.  Why do children come into care?  It is for a wide range of reasons.  Deputy Coppinger is identifying some additional ones which we need to investigate.  I note what she is identifying there.  Children come into care for a range of reasons, including the death of a parent, the serious long-term illness of a parent or the significant ongoing mental illness of a parent.  However, homelessness is not a reason to take children into care.  The State only intervenes in family life in exceptional cases.  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in and of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care.</p></speech>

How can we know it is not a problem if we do not have the data?  It is unbelievable that there are no records on homeless children in care yet Tusla has records on people who give important information to the State.  I raise the issue of the Minister's credibility on this.  She gave a commitment to the people of Dublin South-West that she would not enter Government without a referendum.  She went into Government.  She wore a repeal jumper, but would not vote for a repeal Bill.  Now, she tells us that she did not think it was significant that Tusla had terrible information about a whistleblower or that the Cabinet should know it.  Who can believe a solitary single thing she says at this stage?  I question that.</p></speech>

The immediate safety of the child is the social work department's first consideration.  A social work assessment is child centred and considers individual and family needs and takes into account the child's development needs, parenting capacity, family and environmental factors.  I will certainly raise the issue of the collection of data which the Deputy requests I raise with Tusla.  I will come back to her directly on that when I have had discussions with the agency.</p>  <p>  In terms of the commitment to children in the context of emergency accommodation and homelessness, the plan Rebuilding Ireland commits to the identification of young people leaving State care who are at risk of homelessness and to catering for them through appropriate housing and other needs supports.  The provision of accommodation for young people leaving State care is now eligible for funding under the capital assistance scheme operated by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

Tusla is determined to provide a high level of service for unaccompanied children.  In order to best meet their needs, all children on arrival in the State are placed in small residential assessment units so that social workers can get to know them and understand their needs.  I visited one of these units with EU Commissioner Jourov&aacute; and was very impressed with the facilities and services available and in meeting the young men there.  The assessment period is usually in the range of six to eight weeks, but it can be shorter where preliminary work is carried out before the child arrives or where the child's the needs are not very complex.  Assessments are wide ranging and take into account age, language, health and well being, cultural or religious requirements and evaluations of the child's emotional state and mental health.  Tusla also tries to identify any family or relations with whom the child might be reunited.</p>  <p>  As I noted previously, the equity of care principle that each child receives the same as any other child ensures that services focus on the needs of the child.  The child will have a care plan developed to match identified needs.  Unaccompanied minors, therefore, receive the same level of protection and care as any other child in State care.  There is no differentiation of care provision, practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.  Tusla's foster and statutory residential services are subject to inspection, including services for unaccompanied minors.  If an unaccompanied minor is to remain in Tusla's care, a foster family will be considered if it is in the best interests of the child.  Tusla arranges for training and support for foster families to address the child's cultural and religious identity.  For some, however, it is likely that a residential setting may be better suited to meet the identified needs.</p></speech>

Moving those young people into as normal a family life as possible must be the priority.  I listened to what the Minister said about the timeframe and it appears to be improving between needs assessment and actual placement.  What number of foster parents and families is willing to foster or adopt?  In the last D&aacute;il, we had a lot of correspondence from Irish couples and individuals who wanted to foster or adopt from other countries but were unable to do so because certain protocols and agreements were not in place.  Does the Department have a waiting list of parents or is there a shortage of parents who are prepared to foster and adopt?</p></speech>

Such a setting may be supported lodgings because they are older, more independent and look for that kind of support which is provided by Tusla.  If people are interested in fostering unaccompanied minors, having heard they are coming to Ireland, particular training is available for that.  We would welcome people identifying their interest in that.</p></speech>

There were some significant cases of reunification outlined in the previous reply.  I also want to acknowledge improvements.  At the age of 18, at a time when they could have been in the middle of doing their leaving certificate course in a school in Dublin, young people were moved outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Minister opened the YPAR conference and met many young unaccompanied minors and other young people.  Their status is a major issue because it will determine whether they can go onto third level, can work, etc.  Some are in a state of limbo.  They said they feel like ghosts because they do not have the correct status.  They have been able to get through primary and secondary level education, but because of their starters third level is not an option.  Even those who have funding for PLC courses develop skills but cannot work.  I am not referring to those in direct provision alone; rather, I am also referring to other unaccompanied minors the Minister met.  We have to address the issue of status.</p></speech>

I would be happy to meet her and others in the community to examine these issues.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the issue of status is not something for which I am directly responsible.  On reaching the age of 18, many decide to stay with their foster families and Tusla supports that in all sorts of different ways.  If they decide to move on, we are then in the arena of after care plans which we discussed earlier in terms of whether individual plans are in place.  Tusla makes every effort to ensure there is engagement and support for young people as they move beyond 18 years of age.  As I said, the issue of status lays the foundations for security and opportunities and entitlements.  I appreciate they are issues and would be happy to continue to discuss them. </p></speech>

As part of a whole-of-Government approach to homelessness, I am committed to helping families by supporting implementation of Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  It acknowledges that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel seriously affects normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children.  While the concerted efforts and actions outlined in the action plan will result in families moving on from hotels more quickly, my Department, together with Tusla, is working to support parents and children in order to minimise, as much as possible, the impacts of living in emergency and transitional accommodation. </p><p>  We have commenced the roll-out of a special provision under the current community child care subvention programme, which will provide access to free child care, including a daily meal, for homeless children aged 0 to 5 years, inclusive.  A flat rate of &euro;110 per week, for part-time child care over five days per week is being paid for each eligible child.  Over 50 child care services have applied to be part of this programme in the Dublin region and we are examining mechanisms to make the subvention available outside of Dublin.</p><p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, the educational welfare office offers a range of supports.  In DEIS schools where there is a home school community liaison co-ordinator on the school staff, that co-ordinator proactively engages with parents who are experiencing homelessness.  The co-ordinator also supports families to access any other supports that can be of assistance to the family while they are homeless. </p><p>  Children experiencing homelessness who are at risk of early school leaving are also targeted by the school completion programme.  A number of supports are being worked on.</p></speech>

I had a fear, given that many issues were taking up the attention of the Minister and the House, that housing and homelessness, in particular how they affect vulnerable young people living in such situations, would get lost along the way.  We are shoring up problems for the future because young people do not have access to proper cooked meals - a lot of fast food and takeaways are being eaten.  There are issues regarding laundry, privacy, homework and after-school activities.  Schools in my constituency are working to try to compensate for the fact that children are living in emergency accommodation.</p><p>It is a difficult task, but there should be a time frame regarding how long people stay in emergency accommodation, following which they are of absolute priority to get out of the accommodation.  Is the Minister having discussions with<b></b>the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, on this?</p></speech>

I have held discussions with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and some of his advisers, along with my advisers.  I have also raised questions and conducted investigations in the context of my constituency, Dublin South West, and the local authority's provisions for homeless families and their children.  A transitional housing model is being developed that provides wonderful accommodation in a setting that is like any other rental setting for families and which provides them with some security to enable them to move on.  I am aware of the detrimental impact of emergency accommodation and the need for a focus on time frames.  We need to be more ambitious than we have been to date.</p></speech>

Children also face problems depending on where their homeless accommodation is located.  It could be a significant distance from the schools which they have been attending this, which causes more disruption.</p>  <p>  Children are living in appalling private rented accommodation.  Some of the homeless and emergency accommodation is better than some of the private rented accommodation I have seen.  Families are at the mercy of landlords.  I acknowledge there are good progressive landlords but, unfortunately, I am seeing the other kind.  As we speak, some are trying to increase rents, which will increase the number of evictions and create more stress for homeless services.</p></speech>

It is important that children are able to travel between their new place of residence, including emergency accommodation, to the schools they attend.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and Dublin City Council are working with the National Transport Authority to develop and implement the scheme.</p><p>A total of 524 Leap cards were distributed to families in hotels in 2016 as an interim measure pending the development of what is called a "ticketing solution".  The percentage breakdown of the education level of the children using those cards was approximately 58% at primary school level, 19% at secondary level and 4% at third level.  Therefore, they are, first, assessing in terms of the need and, second, developing what they are calling a ticketing solution, which they assure me will be in place by the end of this month.</p></speech>

My concern is to ensure that we target our programmes and funding so that the most vulnerable people are reached effectively and in a way that makes sense in their lives.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector to young people throughout the country.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers, and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to provide an additional &euro;5.5 million in current funding for voluntary youth services in 2017.  This is a 10% increase over 2016 and will support, in the main, the targeted programmes for young people who are at risk of drugs or alcohol misuse, homelessness, unemployment or early school leaving.</p>  <p>  From within this budget, my Department provides funding to projects that are located in disadvantaged areas where a significant addiction problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective is to attract "at risk" young people into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  These schemes target young people who are at risk because they live in a disadvantaged community context and are vulnerable to drugs, addiction and alcohol misuse or are out of school or at risk of homelessness.  These schemes account for 70% of the funding available to my Department for the provision of youth services.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, these services are generally delivered on a non-formal or out-of-school basis to supplement the work of the education sector and to reach young people through non-formal means.  I agree with the Deputy that the co-operation between the schools and this work of the youth services in terms of the schemes that they are involved in would ensure a more effective and efficient way of tackling these issues.</p></speech>

I work with a prevention and education sub-committee in the north inner city that has been involved in quite a number of interventions with young people.  Recently we had a round table discussion with youth workers involved in various projects, including sports, the SPHE programme, SASSY and Community Against Drugs to look at what is the best way forward.  Excellent programmes are happening within youth services.  In some areas, they are very much welcomed into the schools but there is a need for a more formal arrangement or agreement.  I have tried to pursue this with the Minister for Education and Skills but he was not buying because he tells me that the new well-being programme to come into schools will practically solve all the problems.  As a former teacher, I know that is not going to happen because it is very hit and miss in the schools.  We have these programmes, many of which the Minister is funding, and they are working.  I was taken aback at the extent of the work they are doing with young people.</p></speech>

She referred to the day I came to her constituency and the conference that was being held by all of the groups that are engaged in working with young people.  Many young people were there themselves as well as representatives of the schools.  It was impressive.  The Deputy works with people who put into practice that which she is arguing for.  We ought to encourage and enable more integration between those working within the schools and those working within the youth sector to provide the supports that are possible, particularly for young people who are at risk.  These things need to be taken into account, particularly from my Department's perspective, as we are involved in the design of a new funding scheme that streamlines some of the past funding schemes.  We need to build into that a way of ensuring the kind of integration Deputy O'Sullivan is speaking about does happen.  There could be some sort of criteria involved and I am happy to continue to discuss the matter with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I will make two points.  When a blanket amount of funding becomes available, it must be directed at those areas that are most at risk, which is exactly what the young people's facilities and services did.  My second point is on the amount of paperwork required of youth services and community services that have voluntary boards.  I agree with governance and accountability but the amount of form filling required is taking away from the direct and face-to-face engagement of youth and community workers with young people.  It is good to hear the Minister is looking at streamlining it because sometimes the form filling is out of proportion to the amount of funding that has been applied for.</p></speech>

She will be aware that I have a number of years of experience working in similar and comparable communities as well.  I am aware of the absolute importance of working in an integrated fashion.  The Deputy was also concerned with the amount of paperwork etc. that may at times get in the way of doing the job and bringing about effectiveness.  She is aware of the value for money review that was done in terms of youth work.  One of its focuses was the importance of governance and accountability and I am sure the Deputy agrees with me in that regard.  At the same time, there are ways of ensuring that we can do that without overburdening the sector with administrative duties that do not necessarily enable the effectiveness in a way that the review is calling for and, in fact, may be a barrier to it.  We need to examine these matters in the designing of the new scheme and to examine ways of ensuring that the funding supports the integration of which the Deputy speaks.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has described tackling child poverty as a moral imperative and I too believe that it is a vital issue that we must address robustly.  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two thirds by 2020.  This figure currently represents 102,000 children who need to be lifted up from this threshold.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and is adopting a cross-departmental approach.  It also has lead responsibility for the national action plan for social inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the development of this cross-sectoral priority.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection have convened a subgroup with members of the advisory council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to progress solutions to child poverty.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that child poverty is a multifaceted problem, the group includes officials from other Departments, including the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  Led by the Department of Social Protection, it has produced a paper which outlines a whole-of-Government approach to tackling child poverty.  This is based around the three pillars outlined in the European Union's recommendation on investing in children, namely, access to adequate resources, access to affordable quality services and children's right to participate.  The paper will come before the consortium of interdepartmental officials working on the issue in the near future.</p></speech>

At the time, many Opposition Deputies predicted that these changes, specifically the change in respect of payments to children when they reach seven years of age, would exacerbate rates of child poverty.  This has been exemplified in the Silke report.  In that regard, I welcome the Minister's comments on the establishment of an interdepartmental group.  Are these matters being considered, including by the Minister for Social Protection?  Will the fundamental issue of income be reconsidered?  Some of the issues that frequently arise are savage rents that place one-parent families in danger of homelessness and the fundamental change that occurs when the child of a single parent in part-time work reaches seven years of age.  The Minister is continuing with a policy change introduced by the austerity Governments that should be reversed.</p></speech>

We understand that addressing child poverty requires access to adequate resources and that this issue is related to income, specifically, as the Deputy noted, changes in household incomes.  This is not the only way we are addressing child poverty.  Other areas being addressed include access to affordable quality services and children's right to participate.  My Department's role in providing access to affordable quality services for children includes heavy investment in the affordable child care scheme.  A number of measures in the programme for Government are directed at lone parents.</p>  <p>  On the issues the Deputy raised, the Minister for Social Protection is working on a new initiative on working family payments.  It focuses specifically on reducing child poverty and ensuring greater access to employment, particularly for lone parents.  This is where we hope to address some of the issues the Deputy has identified.  </p></speech>

These allegations are extremely grave.  At their heart is the suggestion that there was a deliberate smear campaign against Sergeant Maurice McCabe based on false claims of sexual abuse and that that campaign was orchestrated by senior Garda management.</p>  <p>  Sexual abuse is probably the worst crime a person could be wrongly accused of.  The suggestion that false allegations could be spread to undermine the credibility of a serving member of the Garda force is truly shocking.  It should be noted that the Garda Commissioner has emphatically denied these allegations.  We owe it to Sergeant McCabe and his family, and to all others about whom allegations have been made, to ensure that the truth of all of these matters is definitively established.  This objective has been central to the Government's approach to these issues.</p>  <p>  When two protected disclosures were made to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality in October 2016, she referred them within four days to Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill for examination and assessment.  Following a thorough analysis of the protected disclosures Mr. Justice O'Neill reported back to the T&aacute;naiste and recommended that Government establish a commission of investigation to determine the truth.  Last week, the Government accepted this recommendation and published Mr. Justice O'Neill's draft terms of reference in full and without any changes.  The Government also announced the nomination of the eminent serving Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Peter Charleton, as head the commission.</p></speech>

I utterly reject that assertion.  Not only did it accept Mr. Justice O'Neill's draft terms of reference in full but the T&aacute;naiste agreed to accept some amendments from Opposition parties and to consider others.  It has now emerged that Sergeant McCabe has indicated that he is not happy to participate in a commission of investigation because of the private nature of its proceedings.  This would make it difficult for a commission to establish all of the facts.  In that context, the Government decided this morning to have these matters investigated by a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act.  The T&aacute;naiste is drawing up the terms of reference for this tribunal and will be in contact with Opposition spokespersons on justice in that regard.  It is essential that these terms of reference are fair to and respect the rights of all those involved in these matters.</p>  <p>  I want again to refer to the important work being undertaken by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  As Minister with responsibility for Tusla, Deputy Zappone engaged with Maurice McCabe about very sensitive and personal matters.  She quite rightly respected his right to privacy and confidentiality in relation to those matters.  As I have said previously, I was aware of the meeting between the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and Sergeant McCabe but I was not aware of the details of, or the very serious and disturbing issues that arose at the meeting.  In referring to this last Sunday I mistakenly said that I had spoken to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, prior to her meeting with Sergeant McCabe.  That comment was inaccurate.  The correct sequence is that I was informed through officials in my office that the Minister intended to meet Sergeant McCabe and last Tuesday she informed me that she had met Sergeant McCabe.  However, as confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, she did not divulge any of the details of those very serious issues to me or to anyone else in government, which was the correct course of action.</p>  <p>  I remind the House that this Government, like the previous Government, has a strong track record on justice reform in terms of the changes in structure, the analysis being carried out by Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, the putting in place of the first ever independent policing authority since the foundation of the State, an independent police inspectorate and protection in legislation for whistleblowers.</p><p> In my responsibilities, it was my direction that we would have a Ministry for children, a Department of children and an agency for children and that we would deal with enshrining the rights of children in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann by way of referendum and deal with the issues of the separation of Church and State, with particular reference to sexual abuse over the years.  I referred to the latter in a speech delivered in respect of the Cloyne issue.  Only last year, when I had an opportunity to speak to Pope Francis, I brought to his attention another case of sexual abuse.</p> <p> I believe the central and fundamental issue here is that there is a claim and allegation that a deliberate smear campaign was carried out against a serving member of the Garda by Garda senior management.  I am happy the House is accepting in principle the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act.  I hope the Opposition and the spokespersons on justice for all the parties can agree on the terms of reference so they may be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas this week.  I hope this commission of inquiry, under whoever is chosen and agrees to direct it, will be allowed to commence its work as soon as possible in order that everybody involved in this can have fairness in terms of the terms of reference and that the truth of the fundamental question being asked can be determined, that is, the question of whether Garda senior management were involved in a deliberate smear campaign against Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the events of last week.  Last Tuesday, I brought a memorandum to Government to seek approval for the establishment of a commission of investigation under Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  That memorandum arose in the context of protected disclosures which had been made to me by two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last October.</p>  <p>  I have always made it clear that any wrongdoing within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be addressed fully and fairly.  It was with that in mind that within days of receiving the disclosures, I had appointed Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill to review the allegations and to make recommendations to me.  He reported to me in December, having asked for extra time.  Complex legal issues arose and when these were resolved I brought a memorandum to Government last Tuesday.  The purpose of the memorandum was to give effect to Mr. Justice O'Neill's recommendations, or terms of reference, which the Government accepted in full.  I published the terms of reference and his conclusions and recommendations through the process of laying documentation before the Houses of the Oireachtas, required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  I published what was legally possible.  Mr. Justice O'Neill, having access to the information contained in the protected disclosures, believed that it was the matters which he set out in the terms of reference which required investigation by the commission.  </p>  <p>  Suggestions have been made that I had knowledge of Tusla records at the time the matter was before the Government, which would have required me to amend the terms of reference.  As I have repeatedly stated, this is not the case.  I was as taken aback - and disturbed - watching the revelations about Tusla that were aired last Thursday as anyone else.  Clearly, very serious issues have arisen.  </p>  <p>  Throughout my entire career I have worked to ensure that cases of child sex abuse are not kept hidden and are dealt with openly and properly.  I was the first Cabinet Minister for Children in the history of this State.  I was responsible for initiating Children First and for suggesting a referendum to enshrine children's rights in our Constitution.</p>  <p>  On a different topic, my engagement with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan last Wednesday was constructive throughout and entirely focused on ensuring that a commission of investigation would establish the full truth.  I accept that each of our positions on this aspect of the discussion is genuinely held and I acknowledge very much that this is the spirit in which Deputy O'Callaghan has worked.  I regret that differences have arisen between the two of us as to what exactly was said.  I have always found the Deputy honourable and I know he made very helpful suggestions about changes that might be made to the terms of reference, which, indeed, I accepted in full.  </p>  <p>  It is very relevant to note that Mr. Justice Charleton indicated that he thought the terms of reference as I brought them forward would have been sufficient to cover the matters that had arisen in the "Prime Time" programme.  Let us remember he was the person who had access to all the information and all the people involved in the protected disclosures, and had an opportunity to link with them during the course of his investigation.</p>  <p>  As I have already said, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, telephoned me on 25 January to say she was meeting Sergeant McCabe later that day.  I have also said that I respected the integrity of that meeting between her and the McCabes.  I know as a former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs how sensitive some of the matters in that portfolio are.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that there has been a full apology by Tusla and that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is to establish a statutory HIQA inquiry into the terrible issues that have arisen there.</p>  <p>  There is no question of me having misled the D&aacute;il in any way in what I had to say last Thursday.  Deputies have referred to a series of questions in the McCabe statement yesterday.  In particular, there is a series of six indented questions relating to contacts between the Garda and others relating to the false rape offence allegation.  My Department is not involved in Garda operational matters and would not have details like that in its records.  They are, of course, matters that will be dealt with fully by any inquiry, and this gives rise to a difficulty with the suggestion it is simply a matter of asking the Garda Commissioner to ask the garda&iacute; involved.  I have not had a chance to get detailed formal advice on this from the Attorney General but there are clearly implications for the rights of the people involved.  To say, on the one hand, we are going to establish an inquiry into what a someone did but that, in the meantime, we want that person to provide answers which we need to give to a person who will be party to that inquiry clearly is fraught.  </p>  <p>  Of course I understand well the concerns that people have expressed about the treatment of Maurice McCabe but it would be a great pity for people here to try to rectify one injustice by causing others.  Whatever anger people might feel, in this country we do not set up tribunals of inquiry simply to confirm what people already believe.  We set them up to look at all the evidence, hear all sides, and establish what the truth is.  We have to be careful not to rush to judgment.  Above all, everyone is entitled to basic, fair procedures enshrined in our Constitution.  I cannot ignore that in a rush to judgment which ignores anyone's fundamental human rights.</p>  <p>  We have to investigate the matters fully, but it must be done fairly too.  I cannot uphold the integrity of the office to which I have been honoured to have been appointed by setting at nought the rights of others, so I cannot yield on that point.</p>  <p>  In the course of today, we should not lose sight of the fact that day in, day out An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing excellent work, and I believe that credit is due to all ranks for that.  I have embarked on a programme of major reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the establishment of the Policing Authority.  I hope that, over time, these reforms will bed down in the force.  Obviously, I am totally open to constructive suggestions on any further reforms that might be required.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we need to get on with addressing the issues that have arisen.  Today, the Government agreed in principle to establish a public tribunal of inquiry to establish the truth for all concerned in this situation.  It is incumbent on us all now to get on with that work.</p></speech>

Many Members of this House have also met them and will be aware of the heavy burden of the hurt and wrongdoing that has been inflicted on them.  They have spoken very clearly of the devastating impact this has had on them and their family.  They told me that the most recent development, involving the information they had received through the freedom of information process from Tusla, was worse than anything else that had already happened to them.</p>  <p>  I was deeply conscious then and since then that it is the State that has almost destroyed this family.  I was absolutely determined that, in every action I took, I would try to ensure that I, as a Minister, would not inadvertently cause them any additional hurt.  They have now and will always have my support.  They told me what was contained in the file.  It is shocking.  It showed an unacceptable breakdown in procedures.  This translated in human terms into the most vile, graphic and false allegations made against Maurice.</p><p> At my request, Tusla provided a chronology and outline of their case to me on Friday, 27 January.  I made arrangements to give these to the McCabes on Saturday, 28 January.  I also included a letter saying that the report may "raise further questions" that they would need answered.  I advised them that the CEO of Tusla had offered to meet them if they wished, but I acknowledged that I would understand if they chose not to accept this offer.  I offered to facilitate them in getting further information directly from Tusla as an alternative.</p> <p> Tusla has apologised to the McCabes, will co-operate fully with the tribunal of inquiry and has deleted the information held electronically on the McCabe family, including Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his four children.  A paper file only will be retained holding all information to date for the purpose of review and the tribunal.  The paper files relating to the McCabes have been put under lock and key.  They have been taken out of the system where they would normally be held.  These are the requests that the McCabes made of me at that meeting.</p> <p> It is my view, though, that the apology and these actions are not enough.  An independent external review must take place of Tusla procedures and protocols for dealing with child abuse complaints.  That review is separate from the matters under investigation by the commission.  It is wider.  As the Minister with responsibility for Tusla, I have asked HIQA to undertake an independent, statutory investigation under section 9 of the Health Act 2007 into how Tusla manages child abuse allegations.  In conjunction with the CEO of HIQA, Mr. Phelim Quinn, the terms of reference for the statutory investigation are going to be drawn up to ensure that it is focused and timely.  The Secretary General and senior officials from my Department met HIQA today in order to progress this.  I will seek advice from the Attorney General as part of that process.  This process must be swift so that we can begin to restore public confidence in Tusla and ensure that its systems are fit for purpose in dealing with these issues as we move into the future.</p> <p> In terms of political developments, there were three interactions with Government colleagues.  My adviser met an adviser from the Taoiseach's office on Tuesday, 24 January, the day before I was due to meet Sergeant and Mrs. McCabe, and told him about the upcoming meeting.  She told him that it was in respect of a complaint that the McCabes had about Tusla.  Before meeting the McCabes, I told the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality that I was meeting Sergeant and Mrs. McCabe.  As I stated when I spoke to the media yesterday, I also spoke with the Taoiseach prior to the Cabinet meeting last week.  Just to be clear, this was after my meeting with the McCabes.  I told him that I had met the McCabes and that we had discussed false allegations of sexual abuse made against Sergeant McCabe to Tusla.  The Taoiseach said that this would be covered by the commission of investigation, which is what we were calling it at the time.  I did not go into the detail of any of the allegations that I was aware of, but I did indicate to him that this was the nature of the conversation.</p> <p> During the Cabinet meeting, it was my belief that Tusla would be covered by the inquiry under the terms of reference before us.  I noted from radio and television interviews and debates over the weekend that the chair of the commission shared this view, that is, that the contents of the RTE "Prime Time" programme would have been covered by the initial terms of reference.</p> <p> Perhaps I was overly cautious in protecting the details of the information that I had, and if that is the case, then I accept that.  However, let us be clear that incorrect information circulating about the McCabes is at the root of the horrendous damage done to this couple and their family.  I for one did not want to risk spreading these false allegations any further.  In conversations I have had since, the Taoiseach and other ministerial colleagues have accepted the reasoning behind my decision and that it was an extremely difficult one.</p> <p> The question remains as to whether I should have spoken up at Cabinet.  The situation I was in was to consider whether providing information at Cabinet was necessary to achieve what I wanted to achieve, that is, to ensure that Maurice and Lorraine McCabe got truth and justice.  I believed that the terms of reference covered all matters relating to Tusla.  In order to bring clarity, however, I accept now that some colleagues would have preferred if I had made a contribution at Cabinet.  I will learn from that.</p> <p> As part of this learning, I would like to explore with my colleagues if there is a way that we could have time to look at sensitive memos for the Government in advance of Cabinet meetings.  There is a practice of bringing memos directly to Cabinet.  I understand the issue of sensitivity and confidentiality, but I would also like time to prepare adequately.</p> <p> I also accept that there was confusion around my statements on Friday last.  As the House knows, Friday was difficult in terms of communication, as I was on a brief visit to the west coast of the United States for family reasons and time zones came into play.  The first statement said that I had informed relevant Government colleagues, and it is true that I had informed them of my engagement with the McCabes.  That has been acknowledged by others, but some public commentary during the course of Friday led to the second statement to bring clarity.  I wanted to be absolutely clear that I had not passed on files and information of confidential, graphic, disturbing and highly sensitive information.  As I said then, this was also information that one could reasonably have assumed was the subject of the protected disclosure that was leading to the establishment of the commission.</p> <p> I would like to reiterate that, for my own part, it was always my view that Tusla would be subject to the commission or tribunal of inquiry, a view that the chair of the commission seems to share.  I believed that the information I was becoming aware of through speaking to the McCabes and through Tusla was the protected disclosure that had been a matter of public comment.</p> <p> I have a job to do.  I am the only Independent woman in the Cabinet and I like to think that I bring a different perspective than my colleagues.  I believe that I can bring an influence that would be missing if I were not there.  My only motivation in being cautious about the moment of information that I shared was that I did not want to cause any further distress to the McCabe family.  There was no other motive.  I believe that it was reasonable to assume that the information I had may also have been part of an existing protected disclosure.  Colleagues accept that I believed Tusla was covered by the terms of reference.</p> <p> People can accuse me of being politically naive.  I do not agree, but people are entitled to their opinion.  I would prefer that charge, even if I do not agree with it, rather than be the source that spread false allegations of the most horrific type further.</p> <p> I have read the statement issued by Maurice and Lorraine McCabe.  They have asked questions of present and former members of Government.  They have asked if persons acting as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs since 2013, among others, were briefed formally or informally of the making of such allegations at any time by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since August 2013.  As I fall into this category, I can confirm that I have never been briefed of such allegations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Commissioner.</p> <p> They further identify six questions that they would like answered.  I believe that two of these questions could relate to Tusla.  Who interviewed the alleged victim in respect of that allegation in May 2014 as claimed by her solicitor?  Was any decision made not to inform Maurice of the making of the 2013 allegation and, if so, why and by whom?  I have been in touch with Tusla to establish the answers to these questions.  I have received a response this afternoon and have this evening e-mailed that to Sergeant and Lorraine McCabe.  They may wish to come back on this and interrogate it further.  If they do, and if I can, I will assist them with it.</p></speech>

They deserve answers and indeed all of us, as citizens, require answers to fundamental questions which go to the core of our democracy, the administration of justice, the valuing and protection of whistleblowers and the integrity of the structures we have worked so hard as a country to put in place to ensure that children are protected.  The establishment of a public inquiry will ensure that a light is shone on all these issues.  It will ensure that there is no room for secrecy.  It will also ensure transparent, forensic examination of many key issues.</p>  <p>  For my part, I wish to inform the House of the following information.  I was contacted by the director general of the HSE on Friday evening, 10 February and made aware that a HSE counselling service was involved in the Tusla file concerning Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  This was the first time I was made of aware of that and I had not seen the Tusla file nor have I seen it now.  I was informed that the HSE director general only became aware of the involvement of a HSE counsellor on the same Friday, 10 February when he was also contacted by Tusla.  The HSE issued a statement the following morning, Saturday, 11 February, clarifying its involvement and offering a full apology to Sergeant McCabe and indicating its intention to make arrangements to formally deliver that apology to the McCabe family.</p>  <p>  On the Saturday night, my special adviser received a text message from Sergeant McCabe outlining that he and his family rejected the HSE's apology and the HSE's statement.  This contact was brought to my attention and that of the HSE on Sunday morning and attempts were made by the HSE to directly contact the McCabe family and their solicitor.  I understand that yesterday the HSE, through the director general, issued a formal written apology to Sergeant McCabe and his family.  Prior to 11 February, the only contact between the McCabe family and my departmental office was when Mrs. McCabe phoned that office on 17 January.  The call was returned on 18 January and once the official who took the call established that the call concerned Tusla he made arrangements for the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to contact Mrs. McCabe.  I was not made aware of the call and remained unaware of it until last Friday.</p>  <p>  I am determined that the McCabes get answers to the questions they posed through their statement last night.  Some of the questions relate to the health services.  I do not have these answers today nor do I have the information in my possession to provide these answers.  However, I wish to obtain the answers and I have written to the director general of the HSE to endeavour to provide the McCabe family or their solicitor with as much information as possible and as exists in HSE records.  However, the HSE and indeed the Government will need to be conscious of relevant legal advices and how they interact with the tribunal process on which we are about to embark.  I am also aware that the director general, in his written apology to Sergeant McCabe, has offered to meet him directly if Sergeant McCabe believes that would be helpful.  It is very important that how the counselling services of the HSE have interacted with Tusla and other agencies is examined by the tribunal.  I have vocalised that view to the Attorney General, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and I am pleased that it will, as it must, form a part of the terms of reference for the tribunal which I hope this House will establish this week.</p>  <p>  In addition to the very important issues currently being debated and which will be examined by a tribunal, separate and distinct to that process, I have also asked that the director general would now provide me with a report which would endeavour to provide reassurance that the current policies, practices and procedures for the National Counselling Service are operating effectively and in an appropriate way.  When I receive this report, I will share it with the relevant Oireachtas committees for the appropriate scrutiny.</p></speech>

I told her that I had become aware, from speaking to my party leader Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who had spoken to Sergeant McCabe, that Sergeant McCabe had informed him that there would be a "Prime Time" programme broadcast on Thursday evening which would contain a story about a Tusla file that contained a false allegation of sexual abuse against Sergeant McCabe.  I told the T&aacute;naiste that paragraph B of the terms of reference needed to be extended to cover that.  The T&aacute;naiste agrees that I asked her to extend the terms of reference.  She also agrees that I asked her to extend the terms of reference because of a forthcoming "Prime Time" programme.  However, she denies that I told her about any Tusla file contained in that programme.  If she is correct, why did she agree to consider my amendments, as she did, without asking me what the "Prime Time" programme was about?</p></speech>

He asked me if I would meet him and I left the parliamentary party meeting and went to meet him.  We had a discussion for about 12 minutes.  Deputy O'Callaghan informed me that there was a "Prime Time" programme the next evening.  He used the word "documentary" in relation to Maurice McCabe and the allegations.  He said the programme would cover the smear campaign allegations that had been made against Sergeant McCabe and he said to me that I needed to look at the terms of reference because if they did not cover what emerged on the "Prime Time" programme that would not be a good place to be in and it would leave "egg on our face" in terms of the D&aacute;il and the work we are doing.  He said to me that he wanted to make sure that the allegation of a smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe was covered and whether it had been carried out by the Garda Commissioner and the previous Garda Commissioner.  I said to him that they were already covered in the terms of reference and the vast majority of our conversation was about the detail of the amendments and how they needed to be changed because the Deputy was concerned that the reference in relation to Superintendent Taylor was too restrictive and would mean that there was not a proper examination of the allegations.  For that reason, I agreed to consider how we would extend the terms of reference to make it absolutely clear that this could be covered.  He also asked that Ministers would be included and I said there was no reason not to include them.  I went away to do some work on the changes to the terms of reference.  At no time did Deputy O'Callaghan mention Tusla, and if he had, or if he had said to me he wanted a particular reference in that regard I would have included it.  It would have been to my advantage to include it if I had been told about it, and if he had made it clear to me that Tusla should be included because "Prime Time" was covering it, I would have included it.</p><p>It would have been totally to my advantage to come back to the D&aacute;il and insert Tusla.  Deputy O'Callaghan made no mention the next day about Tusla when he made his speech.</p></speech>

I referred to Tusla in our conversation.  What the T&aacute;naiste has said in her statement is that she was prepared to seek the amendment of important terms of reference based upon a forthcoming television programme I was telling her about.  At no stage is she saying that I indicated to her what the programme was about and at no stage did she ask.  Is it credible that a Minister for Justice would agree to amend terms of reference of an important commission of investigation based on upon a television programme and not ask what the programme was about?</p></speech>

The Deputy spent most of the time talking to me about how it circumscribed the investigation too much and ought to be broader.  He made his case entirely on the fact that the terms of reference were too narrow, not on the "Prime Time" programme.  He made his case on the basis that the way the judge had written them made them too circumscribed.  I accepted in full the Deputy's bona fides on it.  He wanted the terms of reference changed so that there was no doubt whatsoever that all of those allegations could be investigated and I responded on that basis.  What was in or not in the programme was not the central point.  It was that the Deputy wanted clarity in respect of the allegations and that they would be fully investigated and would not be circumscribed by reference to Superintendent Taylor.  That was the main point of the discussion.</p></speech>

After her discussion with me, who did she contact and what did she say to them?</p></speech>

Why did he not raise it in his speech?  I came in here last Thursday and asked for statements so I could take on board the point of view of everybody here.  I was completely flexible in terms of what I wanted to include in terms of investigating it and getting at the truth.  After Deputy O'Callaghan spoke to me, I contacted the Attorney General, asked her about changing the terms of reference, told her what Deputy O'Callaghan's formulation was and asked her whether it was legally sound and whether it was the way we should proceed.  I had a further discussion with Deputy O'Callaghan about how it should be changed.  Deputy O'Callaghan reiterated the points made here the next day but he never mentioned Tusla.  Other people mentioned different things they wanted included.  Deputy O'Callaghan did not mention Tusla.  I had a conversation with him primarily about making sure that the terms of reference included Government Ministers, that they included great clarity and that the commission would investigate the allegations fully.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has not done this.  I have asked him repeatedly to tell the D&aacute;il when he became aware of the false child abuse allegations against Maurice McCabe.  Perhaps it was years ago.  We do not know.  He has ignored my questions, stonewalled and refused to answer.  So far, the Taoiseach has given three different versions in as many days about what he says the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs told him.  For her part, the Minister is very clear about this, what the Taoiseach said to her and what her official told an official in the Department of the Taoiseach.  While giving his contradictory versions, the Taoiseach has refused to say when he first became aware of the false allegation of child abuse against Garda McCabe.  I would like to put that question directly to the Taoiseach now.  When did he first become aware of this false allegation?</p></speech>

I do not deal in rumours, hearsay or allegations.  Deputy Adams's question is irrelevant to the central issue here - how to define and determine the truth of a central issue, namely, senior garda&iacute; carrying out a deliberate smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe and his family.</p></speech>

In her speech, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs stated that she spoke to the Taoiseach prior to last week's Cabinet meeting, which was after her meeting with Sergeant McCabe.  She told the Taoiseach that she had discussed false allegations of sexual abuse against Sergeant McCabe that were made to Tusla.  The Taoiseach stated that this would be covered by the commission of investigation.  First, did the Taoiseach say that?  Second, how was he aware that it would covered by the commission of investigation when the very Minister tasked with drafting the terms of reference for the commission of investigation claims she was not even aware of the existence of a Tusla file?</p></speech>

The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is the Minister responsible for Tusla.  My assumption was that the terms of reference would cover that.  That was clarified by the judge appointed at the time to conduct the commission of investigation.</p></speech>

There was no confidentiality or sensitivity around that.  Maurice McCabe came to see the Minister not to discuss an allegation or a live investigation but to complain about a false allegation.  He also made the Minister aware that he had been talking to the media and that a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme would be broadcast.  The Taoiseach repeatedly refused to say when he first learned of allegations of a sexual offence made against Maurice McCabe.  Let me help him.  It was reported in the<i>Irish Independent</i>on 12 April 2014 that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin met with the woman alleging sexual assault or abuse by a serving Garda.  On 15 April, the same newspaper reported that the alleged victim wished to meet with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  On 2 May, it was reported that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin wrote to the Taoiseach and told him about this and it was mooted in an article that the Taoiseach was going to order an investigation into this matter.  The Garda about whom the woman spoke to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was none other than Maurice McCabe.  So the Taoiseach was aware from that point.  Did he instigate an investigation and why does he persist in a game of make believe that he did not know about these allegations?  He knew about them going back to May 2014.  Will he and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin be witnesses at the tribunal of inquiry?</p></speech>
