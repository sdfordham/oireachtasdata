    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100003#A00300"><p>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that accountability should be central to everything we do in this House.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste should be prepared to come to the House to answer in detail for their actions relating to the appointment of the former Attorney General to the Court of Appeal.  It is an appointment which has been without precedent since 1995 and the 1995 Act, despite their disingenuous attempts to portray it otherwise.  Section 18 of that Act was simply not adhered to and the law was circumvented.  There is no question about that.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday, a week on from the controversy, that, the night before, he was aware of the possibility of an appointment being made on the basis that everyone knew there was a vacancy.  Everybody knew there was a vacancy since March of last year.  The Taoiseach is reserving the right to do it all over again by using the Constitution as his defence, because any new Act can be trumped by the Constitution and Article 1 in the future.</p>  <p>  Today, we learned that Ministers were critical about the appointment at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.  Behind closed doors, they said it should not have been dealt with in the manner it was dealt with at Deputy Enda Kenny's last Cabinet meeting.  I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, got his review at yesterday's meeting.  There was an acknowledgement at Cabinet, apparently, that it was badly handled.  Why was it done so secretly and in such a covert manner?  Why did Deputy Enda Kenny engineer this appointment in this way?  Why did the T&aacute;naiste collaborate with him in doing so with the Taoiseach's acquiescence?</p><p>As I asked on Wednesday last and, indeed, asked the Taoiseach on Sunday evening last, did anybody consider the Fennelly report and its findings in relation to this appointment and to the Attorney General at the time?</p> <p> The D&aacute;il should have an opportunity to debate this and to ask questions.  Yesterday on the Order of Business, I thought we had got an agreement that would happen.  The Government side fought tenaciously to resist questions.  I am glad to hear that there is some change in that direction but it needs to be a comprehensive question and answer session, involving the Taoiseach and, indeed, the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p> The Taoiseach invoked the separation of powers yesterday and that was bogus.  In 1994, there was an open session here in relation to the appointment of Mr. Harry Whelehan to the High Court with full questions and answers taken by the then Taoiseach.  That was a bogus invocation of that.</p> <p> I do not know why the Taoiseach is so reluctant to come to the House to answer detailed questions in relation to it.  Does he agree with his Ministers' assessment that this was badly handled?  Does the Taoiseach accept that he essentially ignored all the Opposition's concerns about this appointment and that he rammed it through on Sunday evening to avoid accountability to the House?  Did anyone raise the Fennelly report when this appointment was going through the Cabinet?</p></speech>

I am here to answer any question Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin wants to ask me in relation to that appointment or any other matter today, as I was yesterday and as I will be on Tuesday and Wednesday next.  I understand that discussions are under way at the Business Committee and among the Whips about a debate later on today involving other Ministers and a more comprehensive discussion and I have no difficulty with that provided the terms can be agreed.</p>  <p>  As I stated yesterday, I knew there was a vacancy.  It was a matter of public record.  In fact, it was advertised.  I knew that it was a possibility the evening before that this appointment could be made.  I did not know it was going to happen and did not have any sight of the memo until the Cabinet meeting itself.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, what happened here was that a suitable person was appointed by a lawful process.  No matter how much Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin tries to make this into an issue different from that, what happen here was that a suitable person who was appropriately qualified was appointed to a vacancy lawfully using a correct process.</p></speech>

I want Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to be mindful of the separation of powers that exists between Parliament and the Judiciary and I also want him to be mindful of the allegation that he made against my Government in undermining the Judiciary.  I want to give Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin an opportunity in this House today to correct and clarify the remarks he made about the suitability and qualifications of Ms Justice Whelan.</p></speech>

It was not the first he had learned about it because I told him on Sunday evening last in a phone call.  I made it clear about the Fennelly commission and concerns I had about it.  I made it clear to the Taoiseach, as I did last week in the House.  I referenced Fennelly in my speech.</p>  <p>  I do not like and, as I said to the Taoiseach on Sunday night, do not want to get involved in personal issues but one cannot separate suitability from an appointment.  The point is that I did not invite this yesterday; the Taoiseach did.  It is the Taoiseach who brought in the personalities and he named names.  None of those persons-----</p></speech>

It is certainly not difficult to see why.  The Commissioner has failed to tackle persistent malpractice and a blatant lack of accountability in the upper echelons of Garda management.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the scandal surrounding serious financial irregularities at Templemore and the Commissioner's handling of the affair took yet another turn.  At the Committee of Public Accounts it has emerged that the Comptroller and Auditor General was misled by the serving Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 31 July 2015 telling him or reassuring him that all was well regarding the integrity of Garda finances.  However, the Commissioner knew that this was not true.  She had known that, she says, since 27 July 2015.</p>  <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts has heard evidence of attempts to contain, if not cover up, financial irregularities at the Garda training college.  As part of that process, senior management sought to muddy the waters in communications with the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>As the Taoiseach knows, there were in excess of 50 bank accounts being operated at Templemore and it has now emerged that GSOC is conducting a serious fraud investigation into what has become known as the Cabra account.  The Taoiseach is aware of all of these scandals.  He should make no mistake that any refusal to act by his Government makes this a crisis not only in policing but also in the leadership of the State.  If, like his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, he chooses to turn a blind eye to the seriousness of the situation, the credibility of his Administration will be broken.  He has an opportunity to avoid that and do the right thing.  He can bring to an end the evasion and political gymnastics that so dominated the previous Taoiseach's handling of these scandals and turn instead to an approach that would really change the administration of policing for the better.</p> <p> Yesterday, during the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Commissioner could or would not express confidence in her senior management team.  How can anyone have confidence in the head of police if she cannot express confidence in her own team?  It is incredible that anybody, not least the head of Government, could seriously argue that the Garda Commissioner is the right person to rebuild public confidence in policing.  While the political establishment in the State stretches the bounds of credibility every day, even in Ireland credibility does not stretch that far.  The Taoiseach has to face up to reality.  The Commissioner has to go.  Her position is absolutely untenable.  Does the Taoiseach have confidence in N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan?</p></speech>

That is crucial in my approach to the matter.  It is unfortunately true that trust and confidence have been strained because of the revelations that have beset the Garda in recent months and years.  The Government has a duty to restore that confidence and trust.  We have a policing model in Ireland that is based on confidence and trust.  We do not have an armed police force such as in other countries which base their authority on arms rather than the relationship with the community.</p></speech>

That is under way.  The Committee of Public Accounts is carrying out hearings and sat for the entire day yesterday in order that the hearings could proceed.  I also understand the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has begun a fraud investigation into accounts in Templemore.  It is important that these investigations proceed and quickly.  It is also important that they be allowed to run their course.  We should not come to conclusions on their outcome until the people actually carrying them out have come to a conclusion having listened to all of the evidence.</p>  <p>  We also need to accelerate the pace of reform in the Garda.  I am not happy with the pace at which it is occurring.  It is very important in the coming months and years that we build on the reforms that have taken place and also accelerate things in order that we can do what is most important, namely, restore the confidence and trust of the people in the Garda.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is treading the well worn path of Deputy Enda Kenny, a master of evasion who brought not taking decisions on Garda reform to the level of a higher art.  Two things have been established and they are not in dispute.  The first fact accepted by everyone, including the Garda Commissioner, is that she failed to comply with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in failing to inform the then Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, of the serious allegations made at Templemore.  That is not a matter of dispute.  The second established fact is that the current serving Commissioner wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General and misled him and his office.</p><p>There is no contention, debate or dispute about those two facts.</p> <p> Leaving everything else aside, on the basis of those two established facts, the Commissioner has to go.  If the talk of reform is more than rhetoric and if the Taoiseach is serious about a new era in policing, then accountability has to start at the very top and that means the Taoiseach, as head of Government, has to come off the fence, call things for what they are and ensure that the Commissioner goes in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and public confidence.  Anything short of that demonstrates for one and all that he is simply talking down the clock and talking the language of reform but not with any real seriousness.</p></speech>

Unlike colleagues often doing the very same job in section 38 agencies and in the HSE, health workers in the 1,800 section 39 organisations have been discriminated against and denied pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>  <p>  Three weeks ago I hosted a D&aacute;il briefing that was addressed by chief executive officers of the two largest section 39 organisations in the country, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Rehab .  The briefing was well attended by colleagues from all sides of the House and the Seanad and was addressed by the two chief executive officers, Ms Rosemary Keogh of the Irish Wheelchair Association and Ms Mo Flynn of Rehab.  I am delighted to extend a welcome to Ms Keogh who is in the Visitors Gallery.  Both CEOs strongly warned that the services provided by their organisations will be in jeopardy if there is no urgent resolution of the pay restoration issue for their staff, and those most negatively impacted will be the tens of thousands of our citizens with disabilities receiving vital support services.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association, which has its headquarters is in Clontarf in my constituency, delivers 1.17 million hours of assisted living services to almost 2,000 people.  It employs 1,500 people in providing assisted living services and it is the largest provider of these services in Ireland.  It has approximately 20,000 members throughout the country.  Ms Keogh succinctly informed us three weeks ago that if one works as a home support worker with a section 38 organisation or the HSE, one will receive the Lansdowne Road agreement pay increases but if one does equivalent work with the Irish Wheelchair Association, the State does not recognise one's right to seek pay restoration even though one will be carrying out the exact same tasks.  Ms Mo Flynn of Rehab, which provides a similar level of services, highlighted the difficulty for section 38 organisations in retaining skilled staff, given that section 38 staff are now earning approximately &euro;120 less per month than those doing the exact same job in the 44 section 38 organisations and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Contrary to what the Ministers, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, have been saying, members of not-for-profit associations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association and Rehab were instructed by the HSE to align pay with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation, adjust it and cut pay scales.</p><p>In 2010 the Labour Court ruled that pay cuts must be imposed because the pay scales of section 39 and 38 organisations had been aligned for more than 15 years.  Why is the Minister, Deputy Harris, so disingenuous when he constantly passes the ball back and forth to the HSE whenever I raise this matter with him?  It is simply impossible for the Irish Wheelchair Association to meet the &euro;1.34 million needed for pay restoration this year under the Lansdowne Road Agreement or the &euro;290,000 needed for last year without HSE and State support.  SIPTU has rightly taken the matter to the Workplace Relations Commission for adjudication and the WRC has suggested a conciliation conference.  Recently, SIPTU also tried to raise the plight of section 39 workers in Lansdowne Road negotiations.  Will the Taoiseach now support a process for the full restoration of these salaries for this dedicated and highly valued workforce which enables our citizens with disabilities to live independent and satisfying lives?  The funding was supposed to have been in the 2017 Estimates and hopefully we will look at this in the Budget oversight committee.  The Taoiseach needs to take action for the tens of thousands of our citizens with a disability.  The workers concerned are people who get up early in the morning and work hard all day.</p></speech>

One is effectively a public servant and therefore is subject to all the pluses and minuses that come with that, the pluses such as the very good public sector pension and minuses that arise from the various restrictions that apply to hiring and firing in the public sector, and pay reductions and increases where they arise.  People who work for section 39 organisations are not public sector employees.  They tend to work for a NGO, charity or religious order which is given a block grant from which they are expected to provide services and pay their employees.  That is the difference between section 38 and section 39.  It is not dissimilar to a company which receives a contract having to cover its costs, provide its services and employ its staff from the money it receives for that contract.  It is not acceptable for any organisation that has had its budget increased to reduce the services it provides to its clients and I would take a very dim view of any organisation reducing services to its clients where its budget has not been reduced.</p></speech>

He and I both know the distinction which goes back to the Health Act 1953.  The reality is that the Labour Court judged in 2010 that the pay scales of similar type jobs in both section 39 and section 38 had been aligned for 15 years.  Those workers took a massive hit, in common with the rest of the public sector workforce.  Because there is this precedent, it is a foregone conclusion that the WRC will rule that section 39 workers are entitled to increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Therefore it is a question of when, not if.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, are placing vital services in jeopardy by withholding funding from the organisations which would have gone to provide necessary services.  There is widespread support across the Oireachtas for this restoration.  Some weeks ago, I sent a letter to Deputy Harris, which has not been acknowledged, from members of my technical group, Independents4Change, Solidarity - People Before Profit, supported by Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Rural Alliance, asking the Minister to meet with the not-for-profit organisation.  He has not even replied to us.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach might ask him to do that.  One final point.  A constituent with a disability, who I know, sums up the need for urgent action on this issue.  She receives a personal assistance package from the Wheelchair Association.  Without it she would not be able to live her life to the fullest.  She is holding down an important job, attending college and taking care of her young child and her family home.  It is for her and the thousands of people like her that the Taoiseach should take action on this and not just give me these formulaic responses.</p><p>I want something different and some real action on this matter.</p></speech>

In the case of section 39 bodies, the employer is the legal employer - the charity, NGO, religious or other body - not the State.  Regarding pay restoration, staff in section 39 agencies were not subject to the provisions of the public service agreements or the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions.  I am informed that a dispute resolution process with the HSE was entered into by both the Irish Wheelchair Association and Rehab and that significant progress has been made, as recognised by both sides.  They have now agreed to a separate WRC process to deal with the issue of pay restoration issue.  I believe the matter can be resolved at the WRC in the normal way.</p></speech>

During the interregnum I was walking around St. Stephen's Green and who did I meet but the Minister for Finance who was walking the other way.  We stopped to have a chat, as one does.  We talked about social partnership, capital plans and, inevitably and briefly, books we would recommend to each other.  I recommended to him <i>The Myth Gap</i>by Alex Evans, while he blessedly recommended to me a short book he had just read, <i>On Tyranny</i>, by Timothy Snyder.  It is a good book and worth reading as it is very interesting.  It contains a thesis about politics having moved from the politics of inevitability, as he calls it, whereby it is just a question of hte inevitable progress towards liberal democracy, to a political system, as we see here, where one party defends the <i>status quo</i>and the other just consists of negation.  However, this myth was shattered in 2008 in the crash.  It is a myth that has collapsed and is no longer viable.  Mr. Snyder argues that it is being replaced in many countries by an alternative, the politics of eternity, as he calls it.</p></speech>

It is the antithesis of a patriot who wants the nation to live up to its ideals, which means asking us to be our best.  I raise this issue because I understand the Taoiseach has taken on an historian as his speech writer.  The book is all about understanding and applying the lessons of history that allow us to see patterns and make judgments.  It sketches for us the structures within which we can seek freedom.  It permits us to be responsible, not for everything but something.  He says the younger generation, to which the Taoiseach belongs, which I can say, unfortunately, has an historic responsibility to make this choice and not go down the route of nationalist politics or stick to the old inevitability but to stand up against tyranny and be courageous in doing so.  The Taoiseach has a chance to be what Mr. Snyder calls the creator in a moment of history.</p>  <p>  In March the Taoiseach said he would not invite President Trump to Ireland.  He is now the leader of the country, a country that wants to stand up against the demonisation of Islam, for which President Trump stands; to stand up against his treatment of Irish emigrants who are stuck in the United States undocumented; to stand up against his repudiation of the Paris climate change agreement which forms a central part of international co-operation; and to stand up with the German Chancellor and others who say President Trump is someone who cannot be relied on.  How will the Taoiseach contact the US Government about the undocumented Irish when the United States does not have an ambassador here?  In so doing will he discontinue the invitation to President Trump?  Will he take the lessons of history and stand up against tyranny and for all that is good in this patriotic country?</p></speech>

I will not, of course, rescind that invitation.  It would be inappropriate and create a diplomatic incident if I was to rescind an invitation once made but no progress has been made in organising such a visit, for which there is no timeline.  I assure the Deputy that in my dealings with the American Government and my interactions and engagement with the charg&eacute; d'affaires who is here and acting US ambassador to Ireland I will approach them based on the long-standing friendship between our countries and the familial, cultural and economic links, but I will never shirk from raising issues such as climate change.  I totally reject and oppose President Trump's attempt to withdraw the United States from the commitments made in Paris.  I will also raise our concerns about human and LGBT rights and other issues in America that very much oppose the values of the new European centre about which I talk.</p></speech>

There will be protests here if he comes and perhaps he might make the same decision not to come.  It would be a deeply divisive moment because he stands for values against which we must protest.  I am interested in the Taoiseach's next steps.  His job is important and occasionally one has the sense that the path of history is evolving.  We are watching his steps to see what path he will take.  He has said he cannot rescind the invitation.  What steps will he take to say the United States is not to be relied on, as Chancellor Merkel has done?  What opportunity will he take to stand up for our values and against tyranny which is the central argument of the book mentioned?  Where will he be courageous?  In what way will he set his values and define what he represents?  It is not good enough to stay shtum for the next ten months, visit for St. Patrick's Day and have the entire parade start again.  What will the Taoiseach do if he is not willing to rescind the invitation?  What has changed from what he said in March other than the confines of his office?  How might he break from them in a truly enlightened and historic way?  His historian might help him craft a speech, which is what I would recommend.</p></speech>

I said to the Taoiseach when we met some weeks ago that this is legislation we are prepared to engage on and compromise on, with a view to getting it through before the summer recess.  It is my view that if we do not move on this, then paralysis will set in with regard to the ongoing development of the technological universities sector, which is so critical to economic development in this country and to the future of the institutes concerned.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House when we are likely to see that legislation brought forward and the prospects of having it delivered through the summer?  Everybody has been criticising the absence of legislation.  The Government has not been active enough in bringing forward legislation over the last 12 months.</p></speech>

By that stage Ibrahim will have been almost four years in Egyptian prisons and the impact of this on his physical and mental health has been enormous.  The Government's diplomatic efforts thus far have been deeply disappointing and totally inadequate.  In a letter written to the Taoiseach this week, Ibrahim writes of entering a dark tunnel and of four years of torture, suffering and pain.  Will the Taoiseach commit to increasing our diplomatic efforts?  Will he speak directly to the Egyptian President?  Will he seek support at this week's European Council meeting for increased pressure on the Egyptian Government to release this Irish and EU citizen?  Ibrahim Halawa was only 17 when he sought shelter in the al-Fateh mosque in Cairo.  No young person should have to live through his experience since then.  Will the Taoiseach respond to his letter and will he substantially increase our diplomatic efforts for his release, as I have outlined?</p></speech>

I want to add specifically that the Taoiseach should talk to the Greek Prime Minister at the European Council.  Our understanding is that it is Greek opposition to having European monitoring of the case which is stopping it.  We need the European monitor there on 4 July to put on the pressure to get him out.  Will the Taoiseach specifically bring this up with the Greek Prime Minister and report back to the House, whatever answer he gives?</p></speech>

That, to me, is something that is utterly unacceptable.  He was detained when he was 17 years old and was a minor.  I think a lot of work has been done by the authorities, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others, to assist in his release.  I know the Ceann Comhairle led a delegation with regard to that and carried out a very important role in the efforts to ensure he is released and given a pardon.  The current state of play is that this cannot happen until the trial happens but the trial keeps on being delayed, which has us in a very difficult situation at the moment.</p>  <p>  He wrote to me last week and I have read the letter.  I welcome the fact that in the letter he said he has ended his hunger strike.</p><p>I will set aside some time next week to consider what additional options or measures could be taken by the Government to assist in his early release but, of course, I do not want to do anything that might turn out to be counterproductive so I need to study it a little more myself.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will remember the Government voted to delay the passage of the Bill for one year.  We now have the report of the all-party committee, and the Labour Party's Bill will pass Second Stage next week when the year is up.

That is the Bill that was drafted to deal with admissions.  There is much consensus on how we should deal with, for example, giving powers to the NCSE to designate a place for a pupil with special needs or making it illegal to discriminate on all sorts of grounds in admissions.  It is an important Bill.  The D&aacute;il decided that the second issue, the issue of how we deal with religion as a criterion for entry to schools, should be dealt with on a different track.  Since the Bill was published we have had a broad consultation on the issue.  Four options were discussed and we had a forum very recently.  What now needs to be done, and what I am doing, is bringing forward and developing amendments that can get the support of the Attorney General as the legal adviser to the Government, and get a broad consensus across the House and the broader education partnership.</p></speech>

The mobility allowance issue has been dragging along for three or four years.  We were promised a review and the Minister of State has met the members of the Rural Independent Group and others on this.  Families are suffering hugely as a result of this lousy cut.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has its claws all over it, but I do not know why it is taking so long to reintroduce the scheme.  I accept there will be new criteria and so forth but there must be some movement on it.  It is simply unfair to families throughout the country who badly need the allowance.  Many of them have old vehicles that are only fit for scrap so they must renew their vehicles.  They need the mobility allowance immediately.  They cannot wait for more promises as this has been ongoing for so long.</p></speech>

However, due to the rules and regulations imposed on the programme by the Government the Leader programme is simply not working.  The rural development programme is turning into an over-bureaucratic rural administration programme.  With regard to the expressions of interest in projects, there is a 60% fall-off before commitment to apply for a project.  We are now ten months into the scheme and in County Tipperary not one contract has been signed and not one cent has been spent.  Under the previous programme after nine months of the south Tipperary Leader programme 49 projects had commenced with a grant value of &euro;720,000.  This is happening across the country so it is clear that the rules and regulations under the current Leader programme are preventing rural communities from accessing this funding.</p></speech>

Under proposed legislation a holder of public office can face up to ten years in prison and be removed from office if convicted under the Bill.  It provides for lengthy prison sentences and allows for unlimited fines.  A judge can forfeit their office and be excluded from seeking public office for a number of years.  In addition, under the new Bill a public official can be presumed corrupt if he or she fails to declare their interests.  Under the current legislation a person convicted of being corrupt faces a fine of &euro;250,000 or a jail term of up to three years or both.  The Bill was initially proposed by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter, in 2012.  When can we expect the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill to be brought to the House?</p></speech>

I want to raise the matter of the housing assistance payment and the fact that there is blatant discrimination by some letting agencies and landlords right across the State on a daily basis.  This, in turn, is forcing more people into homelessness.  A test was carried out recently in which five people contacted the same letting agency on the same day about the same property to rent.  Two of those callers declared that they were in receipt of the housing assistance payment and they were told they would be put on a waiting list.  The other three callers declared they were not in receipt of a housing assistance payment and would be paying privately.  All three got a viewing appointment.  The process that is currently in place is wholly inadequate, first, because it is under-resourced and, second, because it can take upwards of six months to investigate a complaint of discrimination.  Given the level of discrimination right across the State in respect of the housing assistance payment, will the Taoiseach agree to extend the powers to investigate to Threshold and the Residential Tenancies Board?  Will he also agree to a system, such as a telephone line, whereby people could report discrimination?  The system should be resourced so action can be taken straight away against people who are found to be in breach and actively discriminating against those on the housing assistance payment.</p></speech>

It may well be illegal to refuse those on the housing assistance payment also.  That sort of behaviour from landlords cannot be condoned and it is not acceptable.  With regard to the actions that can be taken to prevent it and actions against landlords who engage in such discrimination, it is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I will ask him to get in touch with the Deputy.</p></speech>

The programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the flow of information from Departments to Deputies.  The portfolios announced yesterday included a range of digital responsibilities, including e-government, and various titles related to digital matters, yet every second time I ask a parliamentary question in this House or to a State agency, I receive a raft of paperwork in response.  Very often a short memo states the relevant Department will be in touch and a letter is sent.  Soon I will have enough of these missives to paper my entire office.</p><p>The benefits of electronic communication need hardly be restated.  They include efficiency, savings on costs such as print and postage and the cost to the Exchequer, not to mention the obvious environmental benefits of soft copy communication.  If one was to be cynical, one might even think that it was designed to obfuscate the communication in this manner.  Can the State lead by example?  Can Government communications improve and move to the digital age?  Will the Taoiseach issue a memo to Government to that effect?</p></speech>

Setanta Insurance has collapsed, as a result of which over 1,000 claimants have suffered.  The court case has been settled and the Insurance Compensation Fund must pay out.  The liquidator of Setanta Insurance has informed us that 320 claims are to be processed by the State Claims Agency.  For the first time, it has given me a breakdown of the size of the claims.  The Insurance (Amendment) Bill which is on the schedule will mean that from now on, if there is another case like that of Setanta Insurance, claims will be paid in full.  In respect of the 320 claims being processed, some individuals will lose out to the tune of &euro;140,000 or more.  They have been severely injured in accidents and were covered by Setanta Insurance.  Will the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform adopt the principles contained in my Bill which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, a decision I do not challenge?  The principles would allow for 100% payment to claimants of Setanta Insurance.  This is something the Government is promising to do in the future but not for Setanta Insurance claimants.</p></speech>

What plans does the Taoiseach have for percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, for the north west?  There is a population of approximately 250,000 people in the catchment of Sligo University Hospital, as it is now known.  The people there cannot time their cardiac arrests or heart attacks in line with good weather for air transportation to a centre nor can we wait for roads to be done up so that we can avail of that 90-minute turnaround time.  Mortality from cardiac instances in the north west is a serious issue.  I understand there are currently no plans for PCI in that part of the country.

The context here is the demographic time bomb.  The State pension as we know it is gradually becoming more unsustainable.  Currently, the ratio is one person over the age of 66 for every five people at work.  Within the next 25 years, that ratio will reduce to 1:2.  Therefore, it is imperative to encourage people to save to provide for themselves because, as I have said, the State will be increasingly unable to do so, certainly at the present rate.  Imposing levies on private pensions does the exact opposite.  It discourages people from saving rather than encouraging them.</p><p>Private pensions are the savings of hard-working individuals carefully put away over the years so that they can care for themselves in old age rather than being forced to rely solely on the State which, as I have said, will face increasing difficulty as the years go on.  We should be encouraging people to save.</p><p>The levy introduced by the last Government undermined faith in pension savings.  We should not be surprised that, as a result of that levy, the rate of people participating in private pensions as a proportion of that section of the population has dropped quite substantially.  Irish people appreciate the need to save but they no longer trust the system, hence the need to ensure that such a smash-and-grab raid on pensions, which is exactly akin to dipping into somebody's deposit account, will not recur in the future, at least without the consent of the people.  This is the objective that this legislation intends to achieve.</p></speech>

We also discussed Brexit.  We looked forward to seeing each other at the European Council in Brussels this week.</p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel and I discussed the Northern Ireland talks and spoke about the renewed closeness of relations between Germany and France being a positive force for the future of the EU.  We also discussed Brexit, and agreed to meet for more substantive discussions in Brussels this week.</p>  <p>  In my conversation with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, following my appointment, I extended the Government's sympathies to her and to the people of London on the tragic fire at the Grenfell Tower.  We also discussed Brexit, and the ongoing political discussions in London and in Belfast, agreeing on the need to have the Northern Ireland Executive up and running as quickly as possible.  We agreed to meet in Downing Street to continue our discussions.</p>  <p>  In the meeting on Monday, I again expressed my sympathies on the recent tragedies and atrocities in London.  We discussed the situation in Northern Ireland in some detail.  We are both absolutely committed to seeing the Northern Ireland institutions back up and running as a matter of urgency.  We discussed our respective contacts with the parties in recent days.  I am confident that, in our role as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, we can provide resolute support and encouragement to the Northern Ireland parties in the days ahead, and that with goodwill and respect on all sides we can reach a successful conclusion to the current talks.</p>  <p>  Now that formal negotiations between the EU and the UK have commenced, it is vital that the views and concerns of Northern Ireland are fully reflected.  The Prime Minister and I reaffirmed the commitment of the two Governments to maintaining the common travel area and associated reciprocal rights, to protecting the peace process and, in particular, to keeping the Border invisible.  We also recognise that this will be extremely challenging and, in the words of the EU negotiation guidelines, will require "flexible and imaginative" solutions.  This Government will certainly play its part in working constructively with all our partners &mdash; in Northern Ireland, in Britain and across the EU &mdash; to find solutions that are in the best interests of everyone on these islands.</p>  <p>  I also raised the ongoing talks between the DUP and the Conservative Party in the context of the need for impartiality of the two Governments.</p>  <p>  The arrangements for national security are being kept under review.</p></reply>

Given that there is no nationalist representation in Westminster, given that there are reports today of 30 Members of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May's own party stating that they will not accept a hard Brexit and given that there is a campaign within the British Labour Party to firm up its position to confirm an exit approach which would see Britain still within the Single Market, do we have any political strategy?  Do we have any approach whatsoever?  Are we merely sitting back, letting this unfold and seeing what the European negotiators deliver or do we have any role in the current chaos in the British political system to try and serve our interest, which is not a  hard Brexit but a retention of Britain within the Single Market or customs union?</p>  <p>  What does the Taoiseach say to Mrs. May when she comes back stating the British are adamant, as I understand they stated at the start of the talks, that they want to leave the customs union and the Single Market?  Do we just accept that, do we say nothing, or what diplomatically and politically can we do?  What influence do we have in the incredibly complex jigsaw of political parts that are now at play in Westminster, and at which there is no Irish political representation, which is a shame?</p></speech>

I wonder if they had time to discuss the outcome of the election in Britain.  Increasingly, what we saw in the election was an endorsement of left and socialist policies and I thought the Taoiseach might have an interest in that.  We saw the biggest vote for a left-Labour candidate since 1945, mainly motivated by young people, by women and by traditional Labour voters who returned after the Blairites.  Clearly Brexit was greeted negatively, particularly by some Members in this House last year.  It was branded as being right wing and racist, but how then do these Members explain this vote which was completely the opposite?  It puts it in perspective.  UKIP lost all its seats and, as I stated, there was the biggest left vote since 1945.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been talking a lot about populism and so have some of his Ministers.</p></speech>

First, in regard to his conversations with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, he stated afterwards that he was reassured about the DUP role in supporting the Conservative Government.  What specifically what did the British Prime Minister say to the Taoiseach that gave him reassurances that whatever deal is arrived at with the DUP and the Conservatives, it will have no adverse impact on the Good Friday Agreement or undermine confidence in the role of the British Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement?</p>  <p>  Second, on the issue of sequencing in regard to the Brexit negotiations, the UK agreed to the EU format, in that the three primary issues to be dealt with were agreed but it seems the issue relating to Ireland was long-fingered in that the border issue as it affects Ireland apparently cannot be addressed until the broader trade arrangements between the EU and Britain are agreed.  Did the Taoiseach discuss that aspect with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and what is her view on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100018#Q02200"><p>I, too, am delighted to meet the Taoiseach on his first questions here today.  The Taoiseach told us about the ambience, furniture and he waxed lyrically about poetry and history.  On the serious issue regarding the Manchester Arena attack and the London Bridge attack, did the Taoiseach raise any issues with the British Prime Minister regarding post-Brexit, the borders here and our control of our own borders?</p>  <p>  With regard to the position in which the DUP finds itself, would the British Prime Minister be able to remain impartial if she is depending on that party for support of her minority Government amid the concerns that there are no nationalists at Westminster?  They were elected but, strangely, choose not to go to represent the people of Northern Ireland.  Has the Taoiseach plans to talk to Mrs. May again or when is the next meeting or phone conversation envisaged?  The Border is too serious an issue to let it drift on until the negotiations are complete and we all will be scratching our heads to know what to do.  It will be too late then, in terms of the protection of our own borders and the protection from an influx of people here.</p></speech>

The core dysfunction in the Dublin-London relationship in recent years has been that there have been many meetings but no concrete outcome.  The meetings have covered up the rapid withdrawal of London and Dublin from genuine engagement, particularly in regard to the Northern institutions.</p>  <p>  A curious outcome of Monday's meeting was the Taoiseach's statement that he had been reassured about the link between the DUP and the Tories.  Could he explain what exactly that means?  What was the Taoiseach reassured about?  Did the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, merely tell the Taoiseach she was committed to the Good Friday Agreement and did the Taoiseach respond that that would be great?  The latest news is the DUP is still flexing its muscles and has yet to agree a formal commitment to support the Tories in divisions.  The Sinn F&eacute;in line, that the DUP supporting a government in London means the London Government is breaching the Agreement, is a curious one given that the same logic would apply to Sinn F&eacute;in in Dublin.</p><p>However, there are concerns and the concerns of others are entirely legitimate.  They go to the heart of whether we can trust the independence of governments in the administering of the Agreements.  Will the Taoiseach, please, outline exactly what he was told that reassured him?</p></speech>

That would not be like you.</p>  <p>  The concern in respect of the DUP and any agreement that party might strike with the Tories is that it might contain things that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  That is not only a concern of ours; it is broadly held, but such a deal has not been struck.  Certainly, we made it clear in our meeting with Theresa May that a breach of the Good Friday Agreement was not on the cards.  It simply cannot and will not be countenanced by anyone.  In our discussions the reassurances simply amounted to an assertion that this would not happen.  I, too, would like to hear if the Taoiseach got something more than this.  If so, what was the substance of those reassurances?</p>  <p>  The primary issue I want to raise with the Taoiseach is the fact that he had made the sensible proposition that the North remain within the Single Market and the customs union.  I assume that is still his position.  Certainly, it is supported by the D&aacute;il in our support for special designated status for the North.  Why did the Taoiseach not raise the issue with Theresa May?  What is this jazz about invisible borders?  Any border on the island would be injurious to agriculture, the economy, etc.  Why is the Taoiseach even countenancing the prospect of a border?  Can he answer that question?  Is it still about keeping the North inside the customs union and the Single Market?</p></speech>

As recently as November last year, the authorities had failed to heed warnings from residents to the effect that the tower was an accident waiting to happen.  I said to the Taoiseach last Tuesday that I had been told by a fire expert the week before about how a vast amount of Irish housing stock had major fire safety issues.  This was confirmed over the weekend by Kevin Hollingsworth, a quantity surveyor, who said up to 40% of housing stock built during the Celtic tiger period and far more of the Irish housing stock besides was an accident waiting to happen.  Spokespeople for Dublin Fire Brigade have said the same, yet we get an absolutely muted response.  I am amazed that there has not been a minute's silence in the D&aacute;il.  What is more, I am amazed at the lack of urgency shown by the Government in asking whether the cladding material is being used anywhere here.  Are we going to do something about self-certification in the building industry whereby designs of buildings are certified but not the actual buildings?  We have experts telling us that vast portions of the housing stock are an accident waiting to happen.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?</p></speech>

Of course, it is happening at multiple levels.  Bilateral contacts between the Irish and UK Government are ongoing.  I had a meeting with Theresa May on Monday and will meet her again tomorrow or the day after in Brussels where we will attend the European Council.  We are working hard.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, is in Northern Ireland to try to get the Northern Ireland Executive up and running.  We want it up and running to give Northern Ireland a unique voice and ensure there will be an executive in Northern Ireland that can put forward solutions for it supported by the people of Northern Ireland.  We want to put pressure on in London and Brussels to deliver them.  There is an absence of nationalist representation at Westminster.  I regret that that is the case.  I think it is the first time in over 100 years there will be no nationalist representation at Westminster.</p></speech>

The result of the election in Britain deserves analysis.  Some of what the Deputy  has said is true, but there is also another part to it.  In wealthy constituencies in London there was a big increase in the vote of the UK Labour Party.  They are not people who want their properties to be confiscated or who want to pay higher taxes.  Many in Britain are angry remainers, especially in the south east, and they are right to be angry.  They decided to vote for the Labour Party,notwithstanding the economic policies of Jeremy Corbyn.  That is part of the coalition he put together and it is an interesting part of the analysis that deserves more attention.</p></speech>

The strategy statement is aligned to the Government's key priorities and policies and sets out the following six strategic priorities: providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and Government; ensuring that Ireland has a sustainable economy; helping to ensure that Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society; ensuring that Ireland maintains strong relationships in Europe and around the world; ensuring the best possible outcomes for Ireland in respect of Brexit which, of course, includes protecting the common travel area and the peace process; and planning for the future in the context of all of the many uncertainties arising in the international environment.</p>  <p>  The strategy statement recognises the central and co-ordinating role of my Department in supporting Government to ensure that policies are developed and implemented which support a socially inclusive and fair society.  This work is mainly undertaken through the Cabinet committee structure, supporting the implementation of Government policy and effective cross-departmental collaboration.  In the case of health and education, these are the Cabinet committee on health and the Cabinet committee on social policy and public service reform.  This includes implementation by the respective Departments of programme for Government commitments spanning these areas.  These committees last met on 30 May and 23 May respectively.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes an annual report on progress towards all the objectives in its strategy statement, and the annual report for 2016 has recently been published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

There are very ambitious statements concerning health and education and despite funding and so on, people are still finding it impossible to access health services.  Some 666,000 people are on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.  There are shortages of consultants, nurses and general practitioners.  There is a huge HR issue around health.  Mental health funding fell short and waiting lists for access to therapies are getting longer, particularly for children.  Hundreds of patients are still on trolleys.  It is very difficult to see how improvement is going to happen in the short term.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was allocated money this year, as we requested under the confidence and supply agreement.  However, it is not up and running yet in terms of waiting lists and we are six months into the year.  The money was allocated last October.  It is not satisfactory.  Can the Taoiseach confirm the number of patients who have been treated through the fund this year?  Does he intend to chair the Cabinet committee on health?  On the bed capacity review, is the Taoiseach confident that finance will be allocated to address the bed capacity issue?  When does he expect the bed capacity review to be published?</p>  <p>  As I have said to the Taoiseach before, education is fundamental to the strategic objectives and future of this country.  There is a need for immediate investment in research, development and innovation, and for infrastructure funding for second and third level.  Such investment and funding is critical to bringing in foreign direct investment.  I mentioned the Technological Universities Bill this morning.  There is paralysis in that particular sector.  In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to invest up to an extra &euro;500 million in education up to 2021.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether that commitment will be delivered upon and whether he has a schedule for such delivery?  On career guidance, as I have indicated, although there has been some restoration, the Government has fallen short on definitive issues.  There seems to be some opposition to ex quota guidance counsellors.</p>  <p>  The fundamental point is that to fire-proof against Brexit, we need investment in education, skills and the talent of our people.  Since the publication of the Cassells report, I get no sense that the Government is seized by that fundamental objective and reality.</p></speech>

There is &euro;15 million allocated this year for the NTPF.  I raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on foot of my conversations with Deputy Martin.  I understand that part of the fundamental problem was that the NTPF had effectively ceased to exist.  Although it was still there in name and had a board and some very limited functions around collating waiting lists, it did not have the capacity to do the job it used to do.  There is now a new CEO and it is intended that the NTPF should begin paying for patients to be treated in private hospitals as soon as possible.  I hope Deputy Martin is right and that it will have an impact on the waiting lists.</p></speech>

I am sure that can be done.</p>  <p>  I am going to have some new Cabinet sub-committees.  I think there were too many, quite frankly.  I am going to reconfigure them into a smaller number of Cabinet sub-committees which, of course, I will chair.  They need to be more focused.  We will have a new ten-year plan on infrastructure, which we hope to be able to publish in October or November.  I anticipate that there will be ambitious capital programmes for both health and education.  In health, this will provide for additional bed capacity and upgrading or replacing some of our existing hospital stock.  There will be something similar in education.  It is a long time since there was public money put into capital investment in third level.  That will need to be done.  We do not yet know how big an envelope we have for capital spending in the next ten years.  There are lots of moving parts in that regard.  It will be as big as is possible without contravening fiscal rules or jeopardising the finances of the State.</p>  <p>  I am very supportive of the Technological Universities Bill and want to see it go through.  I should admit that I have a constituency interest in it, namely IT Blanchardstown.  I would like to see the legislation pass so that IT Blanchardstown can combine with IT Tallaght and DIT into a new technological university.  I am very much behind it being fast tracked.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, tells me they now have an agreement with the TUI, the union that represents the lecturers.  They have amendments to the Bill.  The next step is to go to Cabinet with the amendments.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is right.  There are too many and they are too dispersed.  However, on strategic issues, the Taoiseach being a driver makes it happen in a way it would not if he was not personally driving matters.</p>  <p>  Of what particular policy areas does the Taoiseach propose to take personal control?  For example, has he considered Sl&aacute;intecare, the new future of health care document?  Does he consider it worth implementing, albeit not necessarily according to the exact timeline set out by the all-party group?  Would it be something he would want to drive?</p>  <p>  I spent more than five years discussing the fiscal rules in respect of capital spending with the Commission and others.  There is a willingness.  For example, Italy has already utilised flexibilities in accounting for capital spending in particular.</p><p>I welcome the Taoiseach's view that coincides with my own regarding the rainy day fund.  We need a substantial capital envelope, and we will be able to get the capacity if we negotiate and push in Brussels for a very substantial increase in the capacity to spend and not breach the Stability and Growth Pact rules.</p></speech>

In the midst of all his committees, subcommittees and all that paraphernalia and with the competing political priorities, what concretely does he propose to do to advance that position?  Why did he not raise that position with Theresa May in Downing Street the other day?  I do not know what that was all about.  I invite him to move away from the nonsense of invisible borders.  It is an astonishing concept.</p>  <p>  On a different issue, the Taoiseach is aware that the previous Taoiseach visited the north-east inner city of Dublin on many occasions.  He will be aware of the very particular challenges faced by those communities.  They are not unique but it is certainly the case, given what is called a gangland struggle that is under way, that the communities I happen to represent are very much caught in the middle of that.  I would like the Taoiseach to give an indication of his continuing commitment to that process and, most specifically, to address my questions regarding the customs union and the Single Market.</p></speech>

It refers to quite a degree to the housing issue.  There has been some acknowledgement with the transition to the new Minister that rebuilding Ireland may not be all it is cracked up to be given the escalating crisis.  Following my earlier question, given the potentially shocking consequences for fire safety in our housing stock, which I pointed out to the Taoiseach last week and which has been confirmed now by a range of experts with potentially 40% or more of the Irish housing stock being substandard in terms of fire safety, does he not believe that this issue must become a priority for the Government?  That would merit it being included in the strategy statement and being given some urgency, which is distinctly lacking from the Government in the aftermath of what has emerged from the Grenfell Tower disaster and what is being said about the potential implications for the housing stock in this country.  The self-certification process is a joke.  We are having designs of buildings certified rather than the buildings themselves, and there is no enforcement worth its name.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach got a letter, as did I, on the 19th from Mark Vincent Healy - I do not know if he has responded to him yet - where he pointed out-----</p></speech>

I saw the Grenfell Tower on my way to and from the meeting with Theresa May.  It is horrific to see it and to imagine the thoughts and feelings of people who were stuck in that tower while it was in flames and engulfed in smoke.  I extended by condolences and offered any support and solidarity we can give to Prime Minister May when I was in Downing Street.</p>  <p>  In response to the tragedy, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has requested a number of immediate measures to be taken.  First, he has requested that all local authorities review their multistorey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems, emergency lighting and means of escape, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, are fully functional and in place.</p>  <p>  In terms of raising awareness across landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports, the Minister has asked the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to notify all landlords of their responsibilities and obligations as landlords in terms of ensuring that their properties fully comply with the fire safety requirements.  Also, a business control management system, BCMS, was issued to all registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in regard to compliance with building regulations and, in particular, to part B which deals with fire safety.  It was issued to 57,000 registered users, including builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners to remind them of their obligations in regard to compliance.</p>  <p>  Also, a meeting of the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was convened last Tuesday to assess the readiness of fire authorities to respond to emergencies.  Over recent years there has been a general decrease in the number of fire fatalities, putting Ireland among the safest countries in the world.  However, figures for 2017 show a slight upturn in fire fatalities, so while progress is being made, this reversal and the events in London are a reminder that we cannot and should not be complacent and that we need to remain vigilant when it comes to fire safety.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Murphy, he has hit the ground running on this matter and put in place some very important-----</p></speech>

It is not even eight days, it is seven days.</p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Howlin's question, I set out in my speech appointing Cabinet Ministers the two or three major priorities, four in some cases, that I want them to pursue and I will pursue them to make sure that they are pursued.  I will also set out some other priorities in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;inte Care report was discussed at Cabinet yesterday.  We decided that the Minister for Health would be tasked with preparing a reasoned response to the report and there will be a debate on it in the D&aacute;il on Thursday.  There are some aspects of it with which I strongly agree.  We need to disentangle the public-private mix in our private hospitals.  I strongly agree with that, but I accept and appreciate that this would cost &euro;700 million without a single extra patient being seen.  The whole thing needs to be teased out.</p>  <p>  Also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform disputes the numbers.  It will not surprise Deputy Howlin to hear that it thinks it will cost much more and that the report does not adequately provide for demographics, but it will not be put on the shelf.  There will be a reasoned response to it from the Minister and at the very least we will proceed to implement in the first year or two those things with which we all agree, and that is probably the best approach to it.</p></speech>

The amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division was created under a second secretary who also acts as the Government's sherpa for EU business, including Brexit.</p><p>The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Cabinet committee on European affairs.  There are 32 staff assigned to this division and its resources are being kept under constant review.  While the staff in this division deal with a wide variety of issues, Brexit is an increasingly significant factor across the division.  Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit, for example the economic policy division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including possible economic consequences of Brexit.</p> <p> Now that the terms on which the negotiations are to be conducted have been established, the Government has stated its intention to intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit including on domestic policy, measures to reinforce competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from the potential negative impacts of Brexit and pursue all possible opportunities that might arise.  Extensive work is now underway across several Departments on these issues including ongoing analysis of the impacts at sectoral level.  Following on from the 2 May publication setting out the approach of the Government to the forthcoming negotiations, work is underway to prepare a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge. This will draw on the work to date across Departments and will build on ongoing cross-government research analysis and consultations with stakeholders and that will reflect the core economic themes already indicated by Government in terms of prudent public finances, improved competitiveness and diversification, special attention to sectors and regions most at risk, economic opportunities and possible EU supports.</p></reply>

That is something that the reform committee might look at.</p>  <p>  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Given his more fundamental personnel changes over the last week, he clearly was not happy with the team that was managing Brexit because there can be no other explanation as to why he removed the two principal Ministers who have been talking to our European colleagues since Brexit began.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for Europe said that the Taoiseach told him he was being removed because he supported the wrong candidate in the leadership election.  The Government press secretary has briefed that this is not the case.  According to him the Taoiseach based all his decisions purely on merit.  Having decided to replace the whole Brexit team in one stroke, can the Taoiseach now explain the new direction he proposes for these negotiations?  Can he also indicate if he considers it worrying that it is only now that the issue of the economic dimension of Brexit is being seriously examined by his Department?  I find that astonishing.  We have had some work from the ESRI.  Trade is at the heart of Brexit.  It should be the top issue because it determines everything else in Northern Ireland in terms of the Border and so on.  There has been an absence of analysis on the concrete, harsh reality of the potential damage from Brexit can have on the Irish economy in different sectors.  The absence of such a detailed, profound analysis weakens our presentation of the issues to Europe, and particularly weakens the prospect that we will be in a position to provide solutions to Europe, to say that this is how we think it can resolve the undoubtedly difficult issues that will face many sectors of our economy as a result of Brexit.  It is very worrying that focus on this has been absent over the last 18 months.</p></speech>

Setting aside the fact that a coalition of the Tories and the DUP would represent extremism to the right of Genghis Khan, how can the Taoiseach have been reassured when no deal has been done? We are still not clear whether a deal will be done but it is strongly suggested that the DUP is seeking to extract concessions which may not be remotely reassuring on matters such as a hard Border, the common travel areas, tariffs and so on.  Whence does this reassurance come?  Could the Taoiseach enlighten us about any communication he may have had with the DUP itself as to what precisely it wants and what it is trying to extract from the Tories on the issues that effect this island?  </p></speech>

It is my view that Northern Ireland should remain in the customs union and the Single Market.  It is also my view that the United Kingdom should remain in the customs union and the Single Market or that, failing that, we would negotiate a UK-EU free trade agreement that is not far off Britain remaining in the customs union and the Single Market if that is possible.  I did express my view to the Prime Minister, Theresa May, which is that if there must be a border, I would prefer that border would be at British ports and airports rather than on our island.  That decision is not one for me or this Government.  Ultimately, it is a decision for the United Kingdom and the Westminster Government.</p></speech>

Although it does not say it, the contents of that letter are not far off an arrangement where Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the customs union and the single European market.  Perhaps the DUP has hardened its position since then, and it would appear to have done so, based on some of their statements.  If a Northern Ireland executive can be established, surely the co-equal First Minister and Deputy First Minister, joined at the hip, will stand over the letter written some months ago, and ask the British Government to deliver on that.  Ultimately, if Northern Ireland asks to stay in the customs union and single market, London will not refuse that.  This request has to come from the North.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il leis an Teach a chur ar an eolas nuair a fhillim.</p><p>The meeting tomorrow will begin with the usual exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament.</p> <p> The first working session will deal with security and defence, both internal and external.  This is clearly a key concern for member states and our citizens, in particular those in countries that have been the targets and victims of recent terrorist attacks.  I will offer Ireland's continuing solidarity and our strong commitment to working closely with our partners in combating this growing threat.  The meeting will send out a strong message that Europe stands united and firm against terrorism, hatred and violent extremism.  Among the issues we will discuss in particular is the need to fight the spread of radicalism online and to thwart its financing.  This will undoubtedly take concerted action.  Industry too will need to play a part in detecting and removing content that incites violence.  On the external dimension, the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, will report to the meeting on the implementation of the EU global strategy one year after its adoption.  The strategy aims to bring all the tools available to the Union together to maximise their impact so as to protect our citizens and contribute to peace and security in our neighbourhood and beyond.  We have strongly supported the EU global strategy while emphasising the need for the comprehensive implementation of all five of its priorities.  This is very important if all member states are to contribute and play an active part.  I particularly welcome that consideration is now being given to the issues of resilience and the EU integrated approach to external conflicts and crises.</p> <p> On Thursday evening, the European Council will discuss a range of external issues, including recent international summits and Russia-Ukraine.  Given the decision by President Trump to resile from the Paris climate change agreement, the European Council will reaffirm our strong commitment to the swift and full implementation of the agreement and to playing a leading role globally.  As I have previously said to the House, I am determined that the Government should show a new ambition when it comes to tackling climate change, and this will be the subject of a full-day strategic meeting of the Cabinet.</p> <p> Prime Minister May will then update us about developments on Brexit from a UK perspective.  She will then leave the meeting and the 27 remaining EU leaders will discuss other aspects of Brexit in Article 50 format.  At the last meeting in this format, on 29 April, the EU guidelines for the negotiations with the UK were agreed.  As the House will be aware, the outcome was very positive from Ireland's perspective.  The guidelines fully reflect our specific concerns, including the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, avoid an economic border and maintain the common travel area and what it means for Irish and British citizens' reciprocal civil rights: the rights to leave, work and access welfare, pensions, health care and housing in one another's countries as though we were citizens of both.  At the April meeting, agreement was also reached on a declaration providing reassurance about EU membership for Northern Ireland in the event of a united Ireland within the circumstances provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is contained in the minutes of the meeting which will be formally adopted by the European Council in its Article 50 format tomorrow.  Much has changed since the end of April.  The UK has had a general election and returned a minority Conservative Government.  From the perspective of the EU, we remain united at 27.  We are organised and we have been ready to begin the talks with the UK for some time.  I am pleased that the first round of negotiations between Michel Barnier and David Davis took place on Monday.  These focused on the issues to be resolved in phase one: citizens' rights, the UK's financial liabilities and Ireland-specific and border issues.  At our meeting on Thursday, Mr. Barnier will update us on the substance of these talks and the agreed way forward for the next few months.  The meeting is expected to approve procedures for the relocation of two EU agencies currently located in the United Kingdom, namely, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.  Ireland is bidding for both agencies, and we offer a great location in terms of business continuity, connectivity, facilities and other factors.  We will continue to advance our case vigorously between now and the time of voting, which is expected to be in October.</p> <p> On Friday, the European Council will consider a range of economic issues under the heading of "jobs, growth and competitiveness".  These include: Single Market strategies, trade policy, the European Fund for Strategic Investments and the European semester.  I support a high level of ambition for the Single Market.  There are still too many barriers to cross-border trade in services, while digitisation is making boundaries between goods and services less relevant.  Europe's capital markets can also make a stronger contribution to financing investments in the real economy at a time when this investment is urgently needed.  The Single Market and digital Single Market strategies can both help unlock the productivity and growth potential of cross-border trade.  I want to see delivery - concrete timelines delivering early and practical results for consumers and SMEs.  I will work closely with like-minded member states to drive progress in a direction that is open, competitive and innovation-friendly.  I joined several other EU leaders this week in writing to President Tusk to call for greater ambition on this.  On trade, I will make the case for a free and open approach within the EU and internationally.  The draft Council conclusions set out a welcome commitment to this position.  On the European semester, the European Council is expected to endorse this year's country-specific recommendations to member states.  These have been largely agreed, although one member state has a point of contention.  We are broadly happy with the tone and substance of the three recommendations proposed for Ireland, which cover fiscal policy, expenditure priorities and non-performing loans.</p> <p> The discussion on migration will include updates on the migration partnership framework, the EU-Turkey statement, developments along the central Mediterranean route and implementation of the Malta declaration.  The slow progress on reform of the common European asylum system will also be noted.  Ireland remains at one remove from the full force of the migration crisis but we have nevertheless played a constructive role in the EU response.  We have consistently highlighted the need for a comprehensive response that tackles both the effects and the route causes of migration.  Ireland has provided &euro;76.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region since 2012, while our contribution to the EU-Turkey refugee facility will be almost &euro;23 million.  In 2015, the Government decided to accept up to 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees by voluntarily opting into the EU relocation decisions and through participating in the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme.  To date, 785 people have arrived on resettlement and 459 on relocation, and this is ongoing.</p> <p> The last item on the European Council agenda is digital Europe.  This was added in the context of the incoming Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which will focus on digital issues during its term, including at a digital summit in Tallinn scheduled for 29 September.  Ireland is a strong supporter of prioritising digital issues, and I commend the Estonian Presidency for its interest, focus and ambition in this regard.</p> <p> As I said in my statement to the House last Wednesday, politics is far from perfect.  At its best, it is a way of solving problems and helping to build a better future.  The European Council provides the framework for solving our problems at EU level - often problems that cannot be solved by single nation states acting alone - and I look forward to participating actively, always keeping in mind the best interests of this country and Europe as a whole.  I look forward to reporting back to the House next week on the outcome of the European Council.</p></speech>

It has been Fianna F&aacute;il's policy during these sessions to engage constructively with the agenda of the upcoming summit.  In contrast, it has been Government policy to maximise the generalities and minimise the detail and, as we know from yesterday, the new Taoiseach believes that preventing questions being asked in the D&aacute;il can be a priority for him.</p>  <p>  We have been obliged to seek information in Brussels and elsewhere in order to make a substantive contribution, and this seems likely to continue.  I know that many others share our frustration at the superficial and dismissive approach by Government to real discussions of European policy.  As this is the Taoiseach's first statement on Europe, he should be aware that patience has been exhausted on this matter.  The reality is that the Government has seen European issues as simply another forum for domestic politics.  The defining approach to negotiations has been to say as little as possible in public so that whatever emerges can be presented as a great national victory.  In some cases, we have even discovered that Ireland had not actually tabled any proposals but the victory was claimed anyway.</p>  <p>  Over the past six years, each year Fianna F&aacute;il has outlined a detailed and radical approach to the development and reform of the Union.</p><p>From a point two years before the referendum, we have been addressing the specific issue of Brexit, yet in response the level of engagement with and information from the Government for the pro-EU Opposition has been lower than at any point in decades.  It is long past time for a comprehensive statement to be published on Ireland's future European policy.  The debate is well under way elsewhere and some reports suggest the negotiations may even have started on the shape of the European Union in five and ten years' time.  Ireland must join this debate and must develop a strategy to influence it.  There has been a poor beginning to the revised Government&rsquo;s commitment to deal with the Opposition in good faith.  In the normal course of events this would be serious, but when it comes to issues such as the European Union and Northern Ireland, it could cause real damage and undermine the non-partisan legitimacy from which the Government's policy has always drawn strength.  This is the Taoiseach's choice, but if the partisan positioning and press briefing obsessed strategy continues on the European Union, it will do him no good and will cause real damage to the country.<br/><br/>Donald Tusk has been a good President of the Council and we supported his reappointment.  He has shown a keen interest in Ireland from his first days as Polish Prime Minister and has maintained it.  In the next two years he will lead the Council through extremely important discussions on the future of the European Union.  The ten-minute bilateral meeting the Taoiseach is scheduled to hold with him on Thursday clearly will not allow for a detailed discussion; it will be more like a formal introduction.  We would strongly support an invitation to him to address the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Brexit is not a significant item on the summit's agenda for the obvious reason that the negotiations only started this week.  As we have said repeatedly, we believe the Government&rsquo;s failure or refusal to propose specific arrangements for mitigating the impact of Brexit has been an error.  Winning acceptance that Ireland is a special case is not even 10% of the battle.  Securing support for a light-touch border crossing will help only marginally.  Special status in some form for the North and the Border counties must be sought.  Special status would threaten no one, but it could protect many from the worst impact of the narrow-minded decision foisted on Northern Ireland by an English majority.  Equally, there is no realistic way of helping the worst affected industries within existing EU state aid regulations.  If we are to secure concessions in time, we need to be pushing now and not after the worst of the damage has been caused.  We will request a full Brexit debate in the House in the coming weeks during which we will expect the Taoiseach to go beyond the vague generalities we have heard so far.<br/><br/>The House should know that yesterday was World Refugee Day.  The summit is due to discuss the ongoing migration crisis.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I again extend our thanks to the men and women of the Defence Forces who are working tirelessly to save thousands in the Mediterranean Sea.  In particular, I note the extraordinary professionalism and humanitarian commitment shown in recent days by the crew of the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>when they rescued almost 800 people and delivered a baby girl on board.  What is striking about this story is that it is a replica of what happened this week two years ago.  In July 2015 the crew of the<i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>delivered a child while rescuing people who were desperate to get to Europe.  The progress since has been limited at best.  The reason there is still a migration crisis is the factors which cause people to flee their homelands remain.  We support the efforts of the Council to achieve greater solidarity among member states in helping migrants seeking asylum.  However, we also believe that not even a fraction of the required funding is being provided to help people in their home countries or close to them.  The overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to leave their homes and would be willing to wait nearby until they can return.  They are undertaking such desperately dangerous journeys because they have lost hope they can provide for themselves and their families.  What we need from the Council is not just greater solidarity in helping those who reach Europe but also a step change in providing direct aid for people and communities in north Africa and the Middle East.<br/><br/>The decision of the Russian Government to support the Assad regime is the only reason the conflict in Syria escalated, fractured and displaced millions, yet both Russia and Syria are making exactly zero contribution to the provision of genuine humanitarian aid.  As well as calling on the Russian and Syrian Governments to stop targeting civilians, the Council should also commence a process for increasing humanitarian aid in order that by the autumn we will not enter the spiral of heightened misery which has always followed the turn towards winter.  The scheduled discussion on security and defence has not been preceded by details of what is involved.  Our assumption is that it is simply a review of agreed actions and will involve no new policy.<br/><br/>As part of this discussion we believe leaders should begin a more detailed approach to dealing with the exponentially-rising threat of cyberwarfare.  European states such as Estonia and Sweden have been the subject of aggressive cyber-attacks.  In other cases, the use of cyberwarfare methods to interfere in democratic elections has been proved, including both service disruption attacks and the spreading of disinformation.  All of this activity has had one source.  The last two national risk assessments carried out by all parts of the public and security services have identified cyberdisruption as potentially the most damaging risk to Ireland, but little has been little done to respond to it.  I have no doubt that a co-ordinated European response is the only way by which we can develop credible defences against this activity.  I hope the Taoiseach will raise this matter and remind other leaders that it is a security threat on which every country, including the European Union's neutral members, can work together.<br/><br/>The summit will also formally sign off on the latest European Semester.  It may well be the worst named of the many badly named European procedures.  It is simply the end of the latest cycle of economic and budgetary reviews.  The tone of the draft conclusions implies that the process has been successful.  In truth, the reviews have been helpful in only a limited number of cases.  More generally, they are either banal or ignore profound issues.  They are primarily about controlling budgets but are largely superficial when it comes to measures other than structural reforms.  More importantly, they consistently ignore the need for new approaches to dealing with issues such as imbalances between countries.  In addition, they do not grapple with the need for significant debt relief for Greece or provide a credible growth agenda for many other countries.  One issue that has become obvious in recent months is that the current model for discussions within the Eurogroup is unsustainable.  The <i>ad hoc</i>negotiations, devoid of an agreed procedure, dominated by side discussions and led by a Minister for Finance with no fixed term, are not a credible way to address the issues of the eurozone.  As a start, a more permanent arrangement for a Eurogroup chairperson should be agreed, now that the incumbent will soon depart.<br/><br/>It may be that a non-agenda point concerning respect for fundamental rights within the European Union will be raised.  This relates, in particular, to a severe anti-NGO law recently passed in Hungary and some equally concerning laws in other countries.  Every country that joins the European Union gives a commitment to respect basic rights.  At this grave moment, when extremists threaten the basic tenets of liberal democracy, we cannot sit quietly and say nothing.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the Taoiseach will travel to the summit with the lines prepared about how successful his trip will be.  What matters is whether he is willing to do the much harder work of making concrete proposals about the future of the European Union, protecting Ireland against the impact of Brexit and ending the policy where Ireland has been little more than a bystander when fundamental issues have been discussed.</p></speech>

My colleague will focus on key issues on the agenda for the Council meeting, while I will focus on Brexit.  </p><p>Last Monday David Davis and Michel Barnier met for the first time to formally launch the Brexit talks.  Britain has now agreed to negotiate the divorce deal first and then to move on to its future relationship with the European Union.  This represents an embarrassing U-turn for Theresa May.  The three priorities set by the European Union and agreed for the initial phase of talks are the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and<i>vice versa, </i>the financial settlement and the Irish question - the border on this island.</p><p>Given the disastrous impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland, it is more important than ever, now that the formal Brexit negotiating process has started, that we secure designated special status for the North within the European Union and that the Government join in the efforts to secure it.  A motion was passed by the House to that effect, although it was not supported by the Government.</p><p>Last Monday the Taoiseach was also in 10 Downing Street to meet the British Prime Minister.</p><p>Having talked tough on the issue of Brexit during the course of his leadership campaign, I was expecting him to argue the case for the North of Ireland to remain in the Single Market and the customs union.  I was not expecting to him to allude to the "Love Actually" movie but, that aside, I was extremely disappointed with his public call for any land border in Ireland to be invisible.  I believe that entirely misses the point.  Any border in Ireland, invisible or not, will be disastrous for our economy.  Any border will have the most serious consequences for agriculture and small business.  I believe the Taoiseach should have held firm on his earlier commitments and argued strongly against any border in Ireland.  Make no mistake, he will have to argue that case very strongly with the Tory Government.</p> <p> I have no doubt Prime Minister May was delighted to see the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, make a U-turn, as she may have interpreted it, on this issue.  I believe that, on Monday, the Taoiseach failed the first test on his first outing and, in so doing, potentially undermined efforts to protect Ireland, North and South, from the effects of Brexit.  It is vital that he does not repeat his "invisible border" comments at this week's European Council meeting.  I do not think any dodgy films have been made in the Council offices in the Europa building so, hopefully, there will not be any cinematic commentary on this occasion.  The Taoiseach must forcefully fight for Ireland's interests.  He must inform his European counterparts that should the North be forcibly removed from the EU against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, this will have a devastating impact on nearly every aspect of life, North and South.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a range of measures which we believe the Government should pursue in order to mitigate the impact of Brexit, and these types of mitigations must be put on the table.</p> <p> I wish the Taoiseach well.  This will be his first European Council meeting and we will be watching closely.  As we know, there is an appreciation at EU level of the unique challenges that Brexit poses for us here in Ireland.  The job is to harness that and to represent all of the people of Ireland.  The Taoiseach's remit and responsibilities stretch to the entire island of Ireland.  His responsibilities do not stop at the Border - they do not stop at Newry.  I ask the Taoiseach to ditch the "invisible border" line and focus on ensuring that special status for the North inside the EU is secured so that no border will be placed on this island, because no border is acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100025#X00200"><p>Brexit is clearly a priority issue for Ireland but there are other important things to be discussed at the European Council meeting.  Two of the key issues at the Council meeting will be spending on defence, which we believe will lead to the creation of a standing EU army, and migration.  I believe the EU's priorities are all wrong.  The EU says it has no spare money for positive social and economic programmes such as youth unemployment projects and community regeneration or improving public services like health care, but it has announced that it will spend &euro;1.5 billion a year on regressive military projects.  People are aware of the need to improve domestic security considering the recent attacks in Brussels, Paris, London and Manchester, but the creation of this external force is an extra financial burden which is not wanted by anyone.  Indeed, the Taoiseach is signing off on this &euro;1.5 billion while a large proportion of our own Defence Forces members are reliant on lousy wages and social welfare top-ups, and in many cases are living in substandard accommodation.</p>  <p>  The European Commission's reflection paper on the future of European defence, launched on Wednesday, 7 June, clearly outlines its plans to establish a standing EU army.  I want to see Irish taxpayers' money being spent on health care services and ending the trolley crisis, making education more accessible, creating good quality jobs in urban and rural areas and on housing, not on developing and investing in a standing EU army which is able to intervene militarily and conduct war.  Any EU policy which aims to increase EU militarisation is a potential threat to Irish neutrality.  What is the Taoiseach going to do to oppose these plans and protect Irish neutrality?  What is the Irish position on the spending of &euro;1.5 billion on military projects?</p>  <p>  Yesterday was world refugee day.  On Monday the International Organization for Migration confirmed that more than 120 people, mainly Sudanese, had died in a shipwreck off the Libyan coast last weekend.  It also confirmed that 77,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with at least 1,828 people having died.  The preventable deaths of men, women and children in the Mediterranean are unacceptable and a stain on the EU and its member states.  We must do more to stop these people dying in the Mediterranean.</p>  <p>  According to reports on the leaked draft conclusions of the meeting which the Taoiseach will attend, EU leaders are expected to pile on pressure to get countries in Africa to start accepting</p>  <p>citizens who have been ordered to leave the EU.  Many of them may face torture and violations of human rights, as we are hearing from the various agencies working with these people.  It is also reported that the conclusions will include the training of the Libyan naval coast guard as a measure to prevent people from leaving the coast towards Italy.  The Libyan coast guard has already returned an estimated 23,000 people since 2016.  However those stopped are then taken to any number of detention centres, where they are likely to face abuse and exploitation.  I have seen the NGO reports, read personal stories and seen photo evidence of the appalling conditions in these so-called migrant centres.  The centres do not meet any humane standard at all; in fact, we have laws that would not allow anyone to keep an animal in such conditions.  Hundreds of people are cramped into overcrowded and unhygienic cells, with no contact with the outside world, by what are essentially armed militias.  What is happening is wrong but we will be facilitating it.  How can the Taoiseach and his colleagues stand over a system where vulnerable refugees are rescued from drowning and then returned to Libya and left in appalling conditions?</p>  <p>  I am also calling on the Taoiseach to oppose the so-called migration compacts with five African states - Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Ethiopia, and Mali - which tie EU aid and trade to stemming flows of refugees. These are shoddy deals; they are wrong and counterproductive.  Finally, I am calling on the Taoiseach to raise with his Hungarian, Czech, Polish, and Slovakian counterparts their unhelpful and unacceptable boycotting of agreed EU resettlement and relocation quotas.  I heard the Taoiseach earlier quoting John F. Kennedy.  I agree it is time for countries like Ireland to stand up and make our voice heard, not only in Europe but across the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100025#X00300"><p>This will be an important occasion for the Taoiseach as it will be his first European Council meeting as Taoiseach at a critical time for our country and, indeed, at a critical time in the EU's history.  On a point made by Deputy Martin in earlier discussions, it is unfortunate that, as the critical part of the Brexit negotiations begins, the team that represents our country and the institutional knowledge they had about Europe has been completely changed.  The removal of the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, the appointment of a new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to replace the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, along with Deputy Varadkar's own election to replace the very experienced former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, means there will be a completely new group of people without the institutional memory of their predecessors.  That will require a great deal of learning on the job and of bringing themselves up to speed.</p>  <p>  Of course, Europe itself is undergoing change.  A new French President has been elected and we are soon facing into new elections in Germany, and perhaps also in other European countries such as Italy.</p><p>The opinion polls indicate that Chancellor Merkel is likely to be re-elected; she will, therefore, continue to be the dominant force in European policy making.  At the same time, Russia continues to be a destabilising influence on Europe's eastern borders.  I understand the Taoiseach will engage in bilateral meetings with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in advance of the meeting.  When he was elected, President Tusk wrote to him, highlighting the challenges the island faces because of Brexit.  While the Taoiseach's predecessor was criticised for many things, he really did ensure the European Union and all of its member states were very well briefed on the impact of Brexit on this island.  When the Taoiseach meets President Tusk, I hope he will raise with him the future approach of the European Union to the Paris agreement and the decision of US President Donald Trump to withdraw his country from the agreement.  There is an urgent need, therefore, for the European Union to step up and show global leadership on the issue of climate change.  This will be particularly important in the absence of the United States from the agreement.  I hope Ireland will be an exemplar in driving that agenda.</p> <p> The dominant interest for us, of course, at the Council will be Brexit.  In advance of the Article 50 meetings on Thursday, the Council will exchange views with the President of the European Parliament and I hope the Taoiseach will use the opportunity to build a relationship with Antonio Tajani who will have a crucial role to play in the approval of any final deal.  It is critical that a deep understanding of Ireland's concerns and unique position be communicated to all Members of the European Parliament who, in effect, will have a veto, unlike the Members of national parliaments, on the final decision to be made.</p> <p> Formal Brexit negotiations have begun.  It is welcome that when the Taoiseach met her on Monday the British Prime Minister committed again to the goal of what she describes - I suppose there are myriad phrases for it - as a frictionless border.  However, as we know, Britain's intention, restated again on Monday, to withdraw from the Single Market and the customs union makes that statement impossible to achieve.  I am gravely concerned by the approach taken by Britain thus far.  It does not bode well that at the first formal meeting with Mr. Barnier the Secretary of State for Brexit, Mr. David Davis, came with no prepared negotiating papers, we are informed, and instead was simply armed with the White Paper and the Prime Minister's Lancaster House speech.  We have little time as it is and the British Government squandered some time in holding an unnecessary general election, out of which it has come without a mandate or a majority for a clear expression among the elected members of the new Parliament in Britain of what they want from Brexit.  It is very difficult to negotiate when people do not actually have a clear agenda.  I am in very close contact with my Labour Party colleagues in Britain and Keir Starmer is migrating to a very acceptable position for us, which may well mean Britain staying in the customs union.  These are things we need to deepen and address because the British position is quite flexible, or certainly in a state of flux.  We have no detail on what the British Government wants, apart from an unrealistic desire for all the benefits of European membership that it keeps stating it wants but without any of the costs.  At some point in the coming months it will have to make a choice and we should see if we can influence that choice through bilateral discussions with all of the political parties in the United Kingdom.</p> <p> I hope the intense negotiations with Mr. Barnier, when they begin on 10 July, will see a detailed position being set out by the United Kingdom.  In saying that, it is welcome that the British have agreed to the Euorpean Union's proposals for a phasing of the discussions.  However, the strand of the negotiations dealing with Ireland, as others have said, will now be subject, we understand, to slower dialogue, which is truly disappointing.  I hope the Taoiseach will raise with Mr. Barnier this issue when he briefs the European Council 27.  We cannot rest on our laurels, having secured the commitments in the negotiating mandate that we sought.  They will be fluid and dynamic negotiations and making the right start is important, but certainly it will only be a start.  The acceptance of the United Kingdom of the European Union's proposals for phasing means that discussions on a free trade agreement will not occur until after other details have been decided, including the bill for exit and the issues facing Ireland.  I listened again during the week to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain entirely dismiss the moneys expected to be placed on the table as the legitimate cost to be met by the United Kingdom.</p> <p> We have very little time available to us, less than two years, before we reach the Article 50 deadline.  A comprehensive free trade agreement, as sought by the United Kingdom, will certainly not be achieved within that timeline.  It is imperative that a transitional arrangement be put in place, for which we in the Labour Party have argued for some time.  This will ensure Irish companies will have time to adjust and grandfather the changes ultimately agreed to.  The impact of Brexit will fundamentally alter the island.  In particular, if it is not handled extremely carefully, it will destroy many thousands of jobs.</p> <p> I raised with the Taoiseach's predecessor the need for domestic policy action and do so again today with the Taoiseach.  There is a need to secure funding and policy changes in Europe to meet our unique circumstances.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Labour Party published its document on Brexit last March.  While much has changed since, the 20 specific actions we set out in the document are still very important and germane.</p> <p> Since the first civil dialogue on Brexit in Dublin Castle I have highlighted the need for an early warning system between employers and trade unions and, critically, the need to seek to change the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support workers and employers impacted on by market changes due to Brexit or currency changes in advance of Brexit.  One of our ambitions concerns the need to waiver state aid rules and establish a Brexit trade adjustment fund of &euro;250 million to support companies in transition.  Three of the proposals we set out in our March document have been embraced by IBEC, which is an interesting development.  There is growing consensus on what Ireland must do to support people, jobs and the economy.  We have made the specific proposals and now want to see those which can be acted on immediately being acted on immediately.</p> <p> As others have referenced, on Friday the Council will also discuss the issue of migration and the crisis in the Mediterranean.  I hope the Taoiseach will deliver on the commitments we made when we were in government together to accept refugees into the State.  We have committed to accepting more than 2,600 by September this year.  The Taoiseach has given the number who have entered the State to date and I hope the others will arrive and be welcomed in communities throughout the country.  I support the view of others that we need to ensure every member of the European Union will accept the responsibility to take in refugees.</p> <p> The Council will address the jobs, growth and competitiveness strategy.  I call on the Taoiseach to seek changes to the EU fiscal rules.  I have already had these discussions.  If the door is not open, it is certainly ajar.  This is something on which we need to follow up and the clock is ticking.  We need to ensure the vital interests of Ireland are actioned and not simply talked about.</p></speech>

That is very much in tune with some of the very interesting rhetoric coming from him and the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in particular.</p><p>There appears to be a move from the pragmatic approach which veiled any obvious ideological prejudice under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny - not that it did not exist but it was veiled - to a much more gung-ho, ideological leadership for Fine Gael in the form of this Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, with all the talk of attacking the populists as against the sensible, moderate people whom apparently they represent and associate with in Europe.  It is good that they are framing things in that way.  At least, it is a political debate.  However, it is completely topsy-turvy in terms of who are the extremists and who are the reasonable people.</p> <p> The left believes in human beings, internationalism, solidarity across borders and compassion for human beings.  That is not an extremist position, but a moderate, sensible, human one.  I contrast that with the position of some of the Taoiseach's mates in Europe.  Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, who is one of the Taoiseach's colleagues on the European Council, has said that Islam has no place in Slovakia and that it is a necessity to monitor every Muslim.  The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb&aacute;n, is a member of the European People's Party, of which Fine Gael is a part.  He thinks migrants are "poison", every migrant is a terror risk and every refugee policy is a Trojan Horse of terrorism.  He is already responsible for building a fence against migrants and he wants to build another, just like Mr. Donald Trump.  What does the Taoiseach have to say about an association in the European People's Party with people who have those types of extremist views?  The Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, warns about the Muslim threat to the Christian demographic balance of Europe.  This is foul, extremist, racist hate-mongering and I wish to hear denunciations and serious challenge to such hate-mongering from the Taoiseach and the Government.</p> <p> I also seek some criticism of the European Union's fortress Europe policy.  This has resulted in 16,000 deaths in the Mediterranean since 2014, a miserable 3,000 Syrian refugees taken in by the European Union, as opposed to the 2.8 million who have fled that country and are now held up in Turkey, and the deal the European Union did with the Turkish regime, which is an extremist regime, to keep migrants out of Europe.  It also did deals with Libya and Afghanistan, extremist regimes by any definition.  The European Union is lining up with them at the expense of human compassion and decency when it comes to people fleeing from the most desperate circumstances.</p> <p> I will conclude with a comment on the austerity extremism of the European Union.  I read an article today in which a Greek woman named Dimitra says that she never imagined a life of being reduced to food handouts, "some rice, two packs of pasta, a packet of chickpeas, some dates and a tin of milk for the month".  That is against a background of deprivation in Greece that has now shot up to 22%.  There were 2,500 people in receipt of food aid in Athens in 2012.  It is now 26,000.  This is because Europe will not give Greece a break on its debt.  Could we have some criticism of that type of economic and racist extremism emanating from the so-called moderate centre of Europe?</p></speech>

I will comment on the results of the elections in the UK and France.  In some ways the election in the UK was the more significant of the two.  It had a strange result where the winner was the loser and the loser was the winner.  At the start of the campaign, Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party was way behind.  According to one poll the gap was 46% to 23%, or two to one.</p><p>The turning point in the campaign was the launch of the Labour Party's manifesto.  It was rightly described as the most left wing manifesto presented by a main party in a general election in the UK in a generation.  The manifesto's policies included an increase in the minimum wage to &pound;10 per hour, the banning of zero-hour contracts, the building of 500,000 council houses, the abolition of tuition fees, the introduction of a wealth tax to pay for the policies and, importantly, it put back on the agenda the nationalisation of rail, mail, energy and water.  That was not a full socialist programme.  We would go further in terms of nationalising the commanding heights of the economy.  The leader of the Labour Party here was right when he told the <i>Irish Independent</i>that Mr. Corbyn's policies were far closer to the policies of Solidarity-People Before Profit than to the policies of the Irish Labour Party.</p><p>Those policies proved to be tremendously attractive to young people, in particular.  This is the first generation since the Second World War that has a decisively lower standard of living than their parents.  They are fed a diet of precarious work and face a mountain of debt as a result of tuition fees.  They flocked to those policies.  That experience was not unique to the UK.  There was a similar experience with so-called millennials attending the Bernie Sanders rallies in the United States and rallying to the banner of Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon and the radical left in France.  That was a decisive push in that election-----</p></speech>

There could be another election in the UK before the end of the year.</p><p>The election saw the biggest gains by the Labour Party in the UK during an election campaign since 1945, narrowing the gap from 23% to 2.5% during the campaign.  Since then, there has been the horror of what happened at Grenfell Tower, the tomb in the sky.  Everybody knows that was a man-made disaster due to deregulation, cheap cladding, the failure to install sprinklers, slashing the number of inspectors and so forth.  It is a monument to the failure of neoliberal capitalism.  If it had happened the week before the election rather than the week after, there probably would have been a very different election result.  The fact that it happened afterwards shows that the election is not the end of the matter.  There is the start of a social movement against not just the Tories, but also the capitalism they represent.</p><p>In terms of the French election, there were two spectacular victories for Mr. M&eacute;lenchon.  The turnout, particularly last Sunday, was woeful.  It was down to 43%.  Election fatigue and the weather are blamed, but Mr. M&eacute;lenchon was far closer to the mark when he said that it was a civic general strike.  The centre left and the centre right have collapsed into the Macron movement, but there is no great enthusiasm among the mass of people.  Confrontation is looming.  Emmanuel Macron is talking about reforming the so-called labour laws by the summer, implementing a ceiling on damages for unfair dismissal and changing sectoral agreements to company by company agreements.  That will open the door to driving down the living standards of workers in France.  Attempts to go down this road resulted in mass protests against Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande and we will see the same against the policies of Mr. Macron.  The challenge to him will come from the <i>syndicats</i>, the unions and the radical left.</p><p>There is an important lesson here, and I will conclude on this because I am aware that the Taoiseach is an admirer of the ideas of Mr. Macron.  The agenda of the so-called new European centre in reality serves the interests of the establishment and the traditional right.  It will be challenged on these policies by the working class movement and the radical left.</p></speech>

I take back "old".  It was not an ageist thing, trust me.  I am nearly as old as him myself.  Perhaps the new Taoiseach feels the esteemed leaders of the established parties talk more wisdom than us poor mortals.  So be it.</p>  <p>  I understand that the European Council meeting is mostly about migration and defence, or refugees and war, whichever way one looks at it.  It would be good if the Taoiseach brought a new dimension to the European Council meetings.  It is time that Ireland took a new position.  We talk a lot about refugees and migrants.  We probably do not ask enough as to where they come from.  One of the best ways of creating refugees is dropping bombs on their homes.  Sadly, we still allow Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base.  US military proceed from there to cause serious havoc in many predominantly Muslim countries, from which the majority of the refugees and migrants are coming at the moment.  It would be good if we took a step back and reasoned why we have so many problems in this area.</p>  <p>  Interpreting the refugee crisis as a defence and security issue will not make the problem go away.  We are throwing money at people in Libya, people who leave a lot to be desired, to stop refugees coming across.  This Government cheerled when the country was being bombed to bits by the USA, UK and France.  We were happy enough to see the place destroyed.  Now it is in anarchy and there are unbelievable problems.</p>  <p>  We seem okay about and pretty silent on the fact that refugees and migrants are being created every minute of every hour in Yemen at present.  We have no problem in trading with the likes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which, with the support of the USA, France and Germany, are bombing the place back into the stone age.  There are many millions of people suffering on account of it.</p>  <p>  I listened to the debate on Leaders' Questions today during which the new Taoiseach was challenged on not inviting Mr. Trump.  Given that the Government is okay with the likes of Mr. Obama coming here, I do not really see a problem with Mr. Trump coming here, even though he is a lot worse.  Mr. Obama holds the record for the US President longest at war in American history.  He deported more undocumented migrants than any other US President in history and he signed off on the death warrants, without trial, of more people than all the US Presidents before him put together.  While I agree that Mr. Trump is even worse, I do not know why the Irish Government has a problem trading with Russia when it is prepared to deal with the USA and the Saudis.  We should not get into a selection process.  I believe one should talk to everybody on the same terms.  We should reopen our embassy in Iran.  The notion that Iran might be a bigger threat to world security than the likes of the Saudis or the USA is frightening.  It is about time we rethought the position on the Iranian embassy.  Iran has 80 million people.   As the House knows, Deputy Clare Daly and I were there a few months ago speaking at a conference.  It is an amazing country.</p>  <p>  I missed the Taoiseach's opening speech but I believe he mentioned John F. Kennedy.  I do not know whether he was referring to the fact that John F. Kennedy was the one who started chemical warfare and the fact that there are children being born malformed in Vietnam today because of chemicals he dropped on that poor country many years ago.  I am not sure whether the Taoiseach brought that up; perhaps he was raising some other issue regarding it.  I ask him to reconsider allowing Shannon Airport to be used to help the American military to drop bombs on people's homes, thereby creating refugees and migrants who then become the source of a problem for the European Union.</p></speech>

It is heartening to know that in his speech earlier the Taoiseach committed fully to the Paris climate change agreement and said that the 27 member states would stand together very firmly on that.  I acknowledge his comments on migration and digital Europe.  They are welcome but he needs to indicate clearly whether Ireland is living up to its commitments on migration.</p><p>One of the issues mentioned by the Taoiseach on which I have concerns is the European semester, particularly in regard to fiscal policy.  Almost all the discussions we had at meetings of the budgetary oversight committee have revolved around the fiscal rules and looking back at those.  As I mentioned a number of times at meetings of the committee, we have still amassed a huge national debt, largely imposed on us by the European Commission and the major European powers, especially Germany.  This makes it so difficult for us to begin to rebuild our infrastructure, which has been allowed to fall into decay so badly over recent years.  We expect the Taoiseach and new Minister to put up a strong fight for fiscal leeway for Ireland in terms of current spending in certain areas, such as disability, as I mentioned during Leaders' Questions this morning, and also in general terms to give us the kind of elbow room we need, particularly given that we are the people most affected by Brexit. </p><p>From the time of the result of the UK Brexit referendum result, I have been calling for a Brexit Minister.  That the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has effectively become the Brexit Department is welcome.  However I was disappointed yesterday to note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, said there was no question but that Ireland was a priority on the first day of the talks with Mr. Michel Barnier and the British delegation.  I am looking at a picture of the Minister with Michel Barnier in which he is being congratulated.  The Minister stressed that Ireland wants to see a future relationship that is as close as possible between the EU and the UK but the account of the first day of talks in many of our newspapers today is very disheartening and disappointing.  <i>The Guardian</i>, for example, reports that the hopes we all had for swift progress on addressing any possibility of a border being brought back in this country are dashed already.  Mr. Barnier and the UK Secretary of StateMinister, Mr. Davis, MP, reported afterwards that Ireland would no longer be in the first wave of the working groups so we do not seem to be a priority in the negotiations themselves.  We are to be subject to a separate, slower dialogue.  The reason for this, given by Mr. Davis, is that resolving the common travel area and the Irish Border issue is such a difficult issue.  However, many people feel, on considering the cases of Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, with its various borders, that there does not seem to have been the same level of difficulty in respect of them.  Some people were categorising the negotiations yesterday as a 3:0 result, with the European Union being 3 and the UK being 0 in that the latter lost all its main negotiating demands.  In fact, we seem to have had a 1:0 result against us.  It is good that we have a Brexit Department at long last and that the Minister of State is present but we need to refocus to ensure we are a high priority from the outset.</p></speech>

We are sorry to lose her from her last Ministry because she had a lot of input into the fair deal scheme that we are trying to get for the farming community.  She understood it well.  We only hope that the new Minister of State will be as conversant with it as she was.  We wish her all the very best for the future.</p>  <p>  We are elected to this House by the people who vote for us to represent them.  There are small businesses in Castleisland, Killarney, Tralee and Killorglin in Kerry which are very worried about the reduction in the value of sterling.  Already, their incomes and products are netting 10% or 12% less than they were before the Brexit vote.  I am sorry our new Taoiseach has left the Chamber.  I only hope that he did not leave because only the smaller groups or parties are here now and that when he had dealt with the larger ones, he decided to go.  That would be wrong.  He should recognise that we are elected also by the people who vote for us and who need their complaints and problems listened to.</p>  <p>  These small businesses are very worried that if the value of sterling persists at this low rate for a long time, and it is predicted that it could last for 20 years, it would have a savage adverse effect on the Twenty-six Counties.  Those businesses are making no apology for saying it.  Much of the talk in this House over the last number of months has been about making a special case for Northern Ireland.  We are elected here to make a case for the Republic of Ireland, the Twenty-six Counties.  In that regard, it is said that much traffic will go across the Border for cheaper goods.  Down as far as a  straight line from Galway to Dublin, and even down further than that, it will have a very negative impact and all the traffic will be inclined to go up to the North of Ireland.  The counties in the South will suffer an awful lot.  Those businesses are asking how that is going to be addressed.  I mentioned this last night.  They even suggested that Northern Ireland should have to join the euro.  After all, if the Border is going to be at the ports, we will not have a level playing field with the sterling being so low in the Six Counties.  We would lose much of our custom.  Counties and people would suffer accordingly.</p>  <p>  With regard to the farming community, around the time of the election, the price for cattle dropped &euro;100 per head.  It is so volatile now that it dropped &euro;100 per head when there was uncertainty and when Ms May lost so much of her vote in the setting up of a new government.  We need to address those issues.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will do his best as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Government's team and our new Taoiseach will have to address all these issues.  When one goes out the gate this evening, everything looks grand and rosy.  There are tower cranes all over the place.  However, the farther one goes towards the Atlantic the worse things are getting.  Young people are coming to the greater Dublin area to work and are leaving rural Ireland behind.  Let us take the Leader programme for example.  There are 18 different stages of approval.  Rural Ireland is being forgotten about and it is getting worse.  As much as we have talked in this Chamber, it is deteriorating by the day.  On those matters, such as the Leader funding, not a penny has been spent yet.</p>  <p>  I have gone into Deputy McGrath's time.  More emphasis needs to be placed on rural Ireland when we are talking to the EU in the coming days.</p></speech>

I am disappointed to lose her from the position she was in because we had been working very hard on the fair deal scheme.  Hopefully, the good work there will continue and the Minister of State will ask the new incumbent to do what she herself intended to do.  I also wish the Minister, Deputy Coveney, well.  I hope he makes a better job of this than he made of the housing crisis, because there was not a house built in Tipperary last year.  I appealed to him several times to call in the county managers and insist that something be done.  Nothing has happened.  The talks and reports would build mountains and castles for us with all that is going on there, but there has been nothing.</p><p>  We are aware that one of the central issues to be discussed at the EU Council will be the future direction of Europe and what vision will guide the creation of that future.  To that end, the European Commission published a White Paper on 1 March that sets out possible paths for the future of Europe.  The Commission acknowledged that we face a great many challenges, such as globalisation, the impact of new technologies on society and jobs, and security concerns, and that we must ensure we are not overwhelmed but rather that we seize the opportunities that these trends present.</p><p>The White Paper offers five scenarios for the European Union&rsquo;s evolution, depending on the choices we will make.  As the Commission has further noted, the White Paper marks the start, not the end, of this debate.  Work will continue in earnest so that we have a plan, a vision and a way forward to present to the people by the time we hold European Parliament elections in June 2019.</p><p>While I acknowledge the work of the European Commission, it is very hard to take what it says very seriously.  After all, it seems to have had a very late conversion to citizen-centred democracy.  It now speaks endlessly about the rise of so-called populism and the need to consult the people of the various member states.  It has had a very late conversion to that.  Where was all this when the drift away from true public consultation was occurring over the last ten years?  Where was it when this State rejected various treaties, only to be told to think again, but this time with an economic gun to our head?  Where was it then?</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s White Paper presents one scenario of &quot;Doing Much More Together&quot;.  That would involve member states deciding to do much more together across all policy areas.  While this sounds grand and noble, it also reflects the kind of drive toward ever-closer political union that leads many to fear for the sovereignty of their states.  That is a huge worry for many people in Ireland.  We have seen how international bodies like the United Nations already display breathtaking indifference and disregard for the Constitution of this State with its all too frequent and all too biased interventions of our laws, especially around family and life.  Europe and those at the helm of the European project have also demonstrated this kind of arrogance for too long and too often.</p><p>I agree that it is vital that we have a strong Europe, a Europe of genuine partnership and collaboration.  It is vital that it should not come at the expense of disregarding the views of those who fear that the European project has become derailed or overly powerful and centrist.  The European Union must serve the people and not <i>vice versa</i>.  That is what has happened with democracy, including our own one.  We are not serving the people.  We must serve the people rather than fatcat officials.  The Commissioners we sent over failed politicians here.  The European project must serve the people.  The Taoiseach quoted John F. Kennedy today during Leaders' Questions.  Indeed, he was waxing lyrical here again during questions to the Taoiseach with Deputy Coppinger and others.  I have another quote for him that he might like take to the EU Council, which John F. Kennedy said in 1962: &quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&quot;</p><p>I hope he takes that with him as well.</p> <p> I am not sure whether the Taoiseach has taken on only a part-time speechwriter.  If so he should take him or her on full time and make sure he or she has a good lesson in history and understands the recent history of Europe and the way Europe has led to people being disengaged, has down-played the rights and sovereignty of people in this country, put a gun to our head during the banking crisis and told us we had to do this and the other.  Europe is now telling us that we cannot have the housing Bill introduced in the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We cannot have a Bill that would save the people and keep them in their homes.  We can have legislation to deal with the big people but nothing for the small people.  It is time the EU reflected on the small people.  It is time our MEPs told it so.  I supposed I am wishing against the wind that Commissioner Hogan might say something for Ireland but he is too interested in playing golf and making sure all the fellows he put into Irish Water are still there getting their salaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100030#CC00200"><p>I wish to raise a point about which many other speakers have spoken in the past.  In respect of statements, which I am sure will be a subject for discussion in our reform committee, there is a difference between those who come first and those who come last because the Taoiseach is never here and one has less opportunity to get one's point across.  It is worth noting and I will raise it in the D&aacute;il reform committee.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State and wish her the best of luck in her job.  I am sure she will be very capable and have a key role so I am very glad she is here to hear my short contribution.  It is difficult for the Taoiseach as he is going into his first European Council.  I presume the Minister of State will be joining him at that event.  The Taoiseach is going in at a difficult time.  It is a bit like going into the Business Committee when one represents a small party.  One has the two big beasts in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael - the equivalent of France and Germany.  I will not say which is which.  One needs to hold one's ground sometimes and fight one's corner.</p>  <p>  I have been a supporter of the EU for a long time but with the UK exiting, something in me fears for our position as a small country on the periphery in terms of how we can exert an influence if it is a return to the Franco-German engine of development in Europe.  That would be a very different Union to the one we have been in for the past 40 plus years.  We need to be very careful, stand up for ourselves and be resolute.  I will give a few examples reflecting what the Taoiseach said was coming up on the agenda.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that one of the items for discussion is defence co-operation, particularly in response to the terrorist threat and other threats.  We have absolute solidarity and sympathy with our Belgian, French and British colleagues in terms of the terrorist incidents that have occurred recently.  However, I fear that this might be used by the French or German Presidencies, particularly the French, to push for a strong move towards defence co-operation.  I do not believe that would be right for us.  We bring more to the Union when we maintain our historic neutrality.  Deputy Wallace might say that this neutrality has been undermined through the use of Shannon Airport or other factors but it is still a real strength that we bring to the Union in terms of maintaining an independence and not buying in to some elements of the military-industry complex.  I know it is a clich&eacute;d term but it exists in France, the UK and Germany.  We need to be different in that regard.  When we are discussing European security and co-operation in the European Council, the Taoiseach should be upfront in saying that Ireland is different.  I remember having a discussion with T.K. Whitaker about the negotiations around our entry.  At that time, the German finance ministry stood up for our right to be independent in that way within the Union.  We still need to do that.  </p>  <p>  The second is a related issue.  I note that a section of the Council is due to discuss digital Single Market strategies and so on.  The Taoiseach said that one of the items for discussion is how we will fight the spread of radicalisation online and thwart its financing.  We must combat terrorism in whatever way we can but I have a real concern about some of the measures we are seeing.  In example, in the Queen's Speech today, the UK Government is introducing a range of draconian measures that are quite repressive in terms of people's online digital rights.  As a country that has become a centre for much digital industry and software companies, including our own start-up culture, we must be very careful about the nature of online surveillance that is permitted, the protection of privacy and support for content creators on the Internet.  We must do so in a way that is truly based on an ethical and citizens' rights-led approach rather than a judicial, security angle.  While that is important, I do not believe having really draconian measures to crack down on certain freedoms on the Internet will create a more secure environment.  In fact, many of the recent terrorist incidents we have seen have shown that this will not work.  We have a better approach in terms of our response to some of those terrorist threats than some of the other security responses we are seeing across Europe and we should stand up for our approach.  </p>  <p>  Even though we are distant from the most immediate points of migration such as Libya and other parts of the Middle East like Syria as well as Turkey, we have a slightly different relationship with some of those parts of the world.  We should use that in any further discussions and deliberations regarding how we manage migration, for example, how we see Turkey.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned what is happening in Slovakia or Austria.  There is a huge problem in a certain part of Europe regarding relationships with Turkey.  There is a historic concern going back 500, 600 or 800 years about people coming from Turkey and being on the border of Europe.  We have the chance to have a different relationship with Turkey and Iran.  I agree with what Deputy Wallace said.  We have the chance to play a neutral role and not just neutral in a "do nothing" sense.  We can be neutral in a positive and constructive connection with the Arab world, Turkey and Iran.  We should avail of that opportunity because we can bring a slightly different relationship to it compared to some other European countries.  We add to the Union when we act in that regard.  </p>  <p>  The next issue is significant but it is the Minister of State's job to think big in European Council meetings.  I believe we should be taking a much stronger position in response to the Chinese Government's new Silk Road initiative in terms of trying to develop co-operation and links between China and other parts of the world.  I am not an expert in the exact provisions and what they offer with the possible exception of electricity grid connections where I have had some connections and involvement outside this House.  It seems that the work the Chinese Government is doing in this area is hugely progressive and innovative and something where we should use our good relationship with China to think big in that way and to see ourselves as part of a big global co-operative approach rather than just locking ourselves within the EU.  </p>  <p>  The next issue might be outside the remit of the immediate Council, although it may come up because I believe one of the items for discussion is the situation following the US withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement and how Europe responds to that.  We should be strong in our response.  We should hit the US where it hurts in the diplomatic area instead of getting into a trade war with the US that would damage our country as much as any other.  We should be asking questions about the future role of the OECD and the International Energy Agency which typify institutions that were led by US diplomacy and US Governments.  At this stage, the US is completely outside the pale and is a rogue state.  We should be proposing some change in the International Energy Association or the OECD.  How can we can deal with the US when it has put itself outside any proper diplomatic context of co-operation?  </p>  <p>  I am scared by what is happening with Brexit because as others have said, the British Government has entered into negotiations and is three-nil down with about 30 seconds to go.  It is incredible.  Only a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, MP, was saying that the row of the summer would be around sequencing and that the full Irish trade talks would need to begin at the very start.  He went into the negotiations on Monday and walked out half an hour later having agreed to all the sequencing and having demoted the issue of Ireland's trade and Border issues.  It seems that the British do not have a negotiating position.</p><p>They do not have any cards to play and are heading towards a hard, over-the-cliff exit, and we have to try to stop them from doing that.  That is a wider political debate.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in her role, as well as the Taoiseach as he walks into what I think is a very difficult first Council meeting.</p></speech>

I am honoured to do this in my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, which I very much look forward to fulfilling with energy and a huge commitment.  I thank Members for their well wishes.</p>  <p>  The discussions on external relations are likely to include the Paris Agreement on climate change and updates on recent international summits, such as the EU meetings with the US and Turkey on 25 May, with Japan on 26 May and with China on 1 and 2 June.  In their capacity as members of the Normandy group, President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel will also provide an update on ongoing efforts to resolve tensions between Russia and Ukraine.  It can be expected that much of the discussion will focus on EU relations with the US.  Transatlantic co-operation is fundamental for stability, security and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.  The US remains the EU's key strategic partner.  The EU and its member states, including Ireland, have proactively engaged with the new administration in Washington DC to reaffirm commitment to this relationship.  As part of this, President Donald Trump visited Brussels on 25 May and met with President Tusk and President Juncker.  Although President Trump has been sceptical about the EU, the administration as a whole has projected a largely traditional and positive attitude towards the EU, starting with Vice President Pence's visit to Brussels in February of this year.  While there are differences, in particular on climate change, there is also much common ground - for example, in areas of economic co-operation.  Ireland's links with the US run very deep and span many centuries, as we saw recently with the St. Patrick's Day festivities in March.  These links previously transcended any one point of difference.  This close relationship should continue, and similarly, we will work to maintain the close relationships between the US and the EU.</p>  <p>  EU-Turkey relations have been under considerable strain, in particular since the attempted coup last July and, more recently, political developments in Turkey.  The European Council is likely to discuss the meeting with President Erdoğan last month, at which the EU highlighted the key issue of human rights.  Turkey remains an important partner, including in managing migration, and the EU will continue to work with Turkey on all aspects of our relationship.  Ireland fully supports the EU approach and agrees that it is critically important to keep the lines of communication open.</p>  <p>  It has to be acknowledged that the EU relationship with Russia remains under particular strain.  The illegal annexation of Crimea, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the support of the Assad regime in Syria are among the most divisive issues.  In the long term, a constructive and predictable relationship between the EU and Russia is desirable as a strategic goal.  Ireland remains open to exploring engagement with Moscow in areas where dialogue would clearly be in the EU's interest.  However, Russia does not appear to be interested in fostering a more constructive relationship at this time.  In 2014, the EU imposed targeted economic sanctions against Russia in response to its actions on Ukraine.  In the following year, EU leaders linked duration of these to the full implementation of the Minsk accords.  The lack of progress in implementing the security and political provisions of the Minsk accords and Russia's failure to play a constructive role have led the Council to roll over the restrictive measures to the 31 July 2017 deadline.  Ireland strongly believes that any relaxation of the EU sanctions can only be considered where there is clear evidence of the concrete progress we all wish to see on the ground in eastern Ukraine.</p>  <p>  EU leaders are likely to discuss, as has been discussed here already, the Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force last November and which puts in place the framework for countries to take action to limit global warming to well below 2&deg; centigrade above pre-industrial levels, and also to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;.  The Paris Agreement has been signed by 195 parties, representing 194 states and the European Union.  As of 13 June, it has been ratified by 148 of those parties.  Together with our fellow member states of the EU and most other countries, we sincerely regret President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.  We strongly believe that the agreement is fit for purpose and is not open for renegotiation.  We will continue to work closely with our EU and international partners to ensure that the agreement becomes fully operational as soon as possible.  The role of the EU as a global ambition leader will be to re-emphasise the agreement, through ambitious climate policies and through continued support for developing and climate-vulnerable countries.</p></speech>

As we are well aware, there has been strong emphasis over many years on the provision of primary care, the enhancement of services in the primary care and community care setting, and the issue of a new general practitioner services contract is central to that evolution in health provision in primary and community care.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100031#DD00800"><p>A core tenet of Government policy is the development of primary care, which is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high-quality, integrated and cost effective health service.  The aim is to develop a new modernised GP contract which will facilitate the shift within the health service away from hospital services towards an integrated primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.</p>  <p>  I want to see a new contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  It should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions for service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  These are realities in today&rsquo;s world which must be accommodated.  I think this will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments, including the provision of free GP care to under sixes, over 70s, the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care for adult general medical services patients with type 2 diabetes, and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of engagement with GP representatives is under way.  The discussions taking place are wide-ranging and ambitious in their scope.  While there will be challenges for all parties involved, I am hopeful that with the goodwill and co-operation of all parties, significant progress can be made in these discussions in the months ahead.  I made it clear around budget time, as did the GP organisations, that this body of work was always going to take the overwhelming bulk of 2017.  It is a very substantive body of work.  I hope that everyone will remain focused on our common goal of putting suitable new arrangements in place that will work for patients, for GPs and for other health care providers in primary care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100031#DD00900"><p>The problem with the Minister's answer is that we have been waiting for a long time for discussions to commence.  That was a commitment made by the previous Government.  We are now in a situation where we have the Sl&aacute;inte report.  It has identified key recommendations in the area of provision of primary community care, enhancing the services in disease prevention, chronic disease management, moving from a hospital-centric health service to a primary and community care setting and, of course, the key issue in all that is the issue of capacity within the primary care setting.  That is fundamental to the delivery of the recommendations in that report, which are also in line and in tandem with Government policy about expanding the primary care setting.  The Minister talks about under sixes and over 70s, but the harsh reality is that until the Minister expands and enhances the capacity of GP services in the community, we will not be able to provide what has been identified both in Government policy and in the Sl&aacute;inte report from the committee chaired by Deputy Shortall.  I ask the Minister to give an outline as to whether or not the challenges are because of lack of resources, funding, lack of personnel to roll out the proposals or because there is prevarication, either by the representative bodies or by the Department of Health and the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100031#DD01000"><p>I welcome my new colleague in the Department of Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who I know will bring vigour and energy to his areas of responsibility.</p>  <p>  I do not think there is anything wrong with my answer, because GPs and patients have been waiting for at least three decades for a new GP contract.  Within weeks of coming into office, I began the process of engagement to put one in place.  We have a situation whereby those negotiations are already under way.  A process has been put in place for further engagement with GP representatives.  Meetings with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, are held on a fortnightly basis, with some further meetings at an official level to discuss technical issues or, indeed, at a clinical level.  There have also been consultative meetings with the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and, as I have said, I expect a situation where we will see substantive progress made by the end of the year with regard to delivering a new, modern, fit for purpose GP contract.  I am strongly of the view, as I think are GPs, that this should not be a static document.  We should not do what all of us have done in the past, putting one static contract in place.</p><p>We should modernise the contract and then keep the engagement ongoing.</p> <p> In relation to Sl&aacute;intecare, a substantial body of work on which I am looking forward to having a debate in the House tomorrow, it is likely that legislatively changes will be necessary for any substantial extension of GP care without fees to further cohorts of the population.  It is clear that GP capacity must be addressed as well.  I look forward to expanding further on those matters in the conversations tomorrow and in the contractual negotiations.</p></speech>

It is now June 2017.  There has been a substantial amount of drift in terms of the negotiations.  When does the Minister envisage these negotiations concluding?  If we are to convince the public that the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is in line with broad Government policy in terms of the provision of primary care, expanding and enhancing those services, increasing capacity and trying to bring about universal access in primary and community care, these issues are critically important.  They will require legislative changes.  However, we need to see an end date in place.  Could the Minister give us a rough estimate, at least more accurate than his predecessor's, of when those negotiations will conclude?</p></speech>

I share that view and that commitment.</p>  <p>  I expect to make substantial progress on a new GP contract this year, but I am also saying that should not be the end of the matter.  This will be a multi-annual process.  Let us try and have a number of wins for patients and indeed wins for GPs who we need to be able to have a viable career pathway so we can have GPs in every community this year.</p>  <p>  As well as expanding free GP care - in fairness the programme for Government commits to expanding free GP care to all children under the age of 18 subject to negotiations with GPs in the lifetime of a five-year programme - a priority for my Department and for me is to look at chronic disease management.  We need to look at things that could be done today in the community, and in other countries are done in the community, that are currently being done in the acute hospital setting.  I expect to make substantial progress within this calendar year.</p></speech>

Indeed, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his appointment.  I am sure if the Minister had been reassigned he would miss my repeated questions upon this exact subject.</p>  <p>  My question is straightforward.  It relates to staffing.  I would like an update.  I have received some updates but perhaps the Minister may be able to enlighten us as to where the nurses who are so vitally needed will come from.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100032#EE00600"><p>Deputy O'Reilly and I get to hang out another bit longer anyway.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for her repeated question on what is an important issue in relation to nurse and midwifery numbers in this country.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will probably be aware, nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of April this year stood at 36,549 whole-time equivalents, having increased by 625 whole-time equivalents in the 12 months from the end of the previous April, and by 1,870 in the three years from April 2014 to April 2017.</p>  <p>  Under an agreement, the Deputy knows well, reached with the INMO and SIPTU nursing, encompassing proposals put forward on 8 February and those in a related addendum on 4 March, health service management committed to increasing the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017 to deliver 1,208 additional permanent posts.  Delivery of these posts is possible through a combination of new development posts, for which additional funding is being provided in the current year, and the local conversion of agency employed staff into direct employees.  Nursing and midwifery numbers increased by 126 from the end of February to the end of March and by a further 113 from the end of March to the end of April.</p>  <p>  A broad range of measures is being implemented to give effect to the agreement.  These include the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees, offering all graduating nurses and midwives full-time contracts, ongoing recruitment campaigns in Ireland and abroad - I welcome the one in Glasgow recently - and the implementation of a range of retention measures.</p>  <p>  The recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs and a communication from the national director for HR to all nursing and midwifery graduates telling them how to apply for a full-time permanent post in the Irish health service.  A high level group with an independent chair has been established for the oversight of the implementation of this agreement and the first meeting of that group was held on 24 May 2017.</p>  <p>  Key retention measures include enhanced maternity leave cover, a career break scheme and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways.  In addition, 130 additional undergraduate places are being provided in 2017, which means we will train this year more nurses than we have ever trained, in terms of undergraduate places, in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  I also issued a written direction under section 10 of the Health Act 2004 - it has never been done before for nurse recruitment - to the Health Service Executive in order to emphasise the importance of the full implementation of this agreement.</p></speech>

Indeed, it is good news for Australia, America or wherever these bright young men and women will end up.  The simple fact is they do not want to work in the health service as it is currently constituted.  They are not only saying that to me.  They are voting with their feet and they are leaving.  For example, 22 nurses were trained as part of a co-operation between CUH and UCC.  These were 22 highly specialised nurses trained in paediatrics and general nursing - absolutely top quality, top notch front-line professionals - and all 22 of them have left.  That is a damning indictment of the efforts that have been made to date.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We all are hopeful of positive news from Government in that regard but we will not be able to do it without the staff.  I am not convinced that enough is being done.</p></speech>

Thankfully, when the INMO members had an opportunity to be balloted on this, over 80% of them voted in favour of these proposals, seeing them for what they are, which is a genuine and sincere effort by nurse representatives in this country, by my Department, by myself and by the HSE to try and increase recruitment and retention of nurses.</p>  <p>  I will give Deputy Louise O'Reilly another practical example.  The Deputy talks of her 22 nurses.  The HSE recently went to Glasgow to a nurse recruitment fair where it met 27 Irish nurses who had been working in Scotland now ready and willing, and wanting, to come home and talking to the HSE about how do they take up opportunities in this country.  The message needs to go out from all of us in this House that there are now opportunities for those nurses to come home.</p>  <p>  The Deputy and I have talked about the issue of pay previously.  There are now pay proposals on the table through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I am sure those issues will be debated by nursing unions in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  One cannot get away from the fact there are 625 more nurses working in the Irish health service at the end of April last than there were at the end of April 2016 and the numbers are growing.  It is not all about pay.  It is also about career pathways.  That is why there are measures such as taking on 120 new people to study and train up as advance nurse practitioners this September.  I genuinely believe those career pathways will encourage more people to stay in this country.</p></speech>

Brexit, in this regard, may be the Minister's friend.  We understand that a lot of nurses who may have chosen to go to England may be forced to remain here.</p>  <p>  When the Minister referred to the conversion of agency staff into directly employed staff, that does not add any extra bodies although it represents a saving to the taxpayer.  With regard to the projected figures, I understand that 1,200 was the target by the end of the year.  Is the Minister confident he will meet that target?  I refer to the 1,200 additional nurses, not necessarily 1,200 recruits, because we must consider the retention as well.</p></speech>

It is also right though, and indeed moral, that as a country we would go to some of the destinations where many of our best and brightest left to go to during the economic recession, meet them, make it easier for them to come home and let them know about the opportunities.  Certainly, we are getting a positive response in relation to that.  I am also grateful that the INMO has offered to assist with that.</p>  <p>  In terms of nurse numbers, on 30 April 2015 there were 35,080 whole-time equivalent nurses working in the Irish health service.  Exactly one year later, there were 35,924.  On 31 March this year, there were 36,436 and on 30 April this year, 36,549.  I am the first to acknowledge we have a way to go to get back to the levels we were at but we are genuinely making significant progress.</p></speech>

It is timely that the first question I get to answer in the House is for my constituency colleague.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 on the legal status of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grants scheme in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes in February 2013.  The Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments that support choice and independence.  In this regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the mobility allowance.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required on a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  A Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new transport support scheme.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure there will be a firm statutory basis to the scheme's operation; that there will be transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme; that resources will be targeted at those with greatest needs; and that the scheme will be capable of being costed and affordable on its introduction and an ongoing basis.  The next step is to seek Government approval for the drafting of a Bill for the new scheme.</p></speech>

In June that year it decided that new statutory provisions would be established to provide individual payments for people with a severe disability who required additional income to address the costs associated with their mobility needs.  An interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was asked to develop detailed proposals for the operation of the new scheme or schemes, including eligibility criteria and administration arrangements, and report back by October 2013.  On 26 November 2013 the Government decided that the work to prepare for the scheme or schemes should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Taoiseach who set up the interdepartmental group is gone and two Minsters have since left the Department of Health, yet we are still waiting.  There is extraordinary annoyance and frustration at the lack of progress being made on the replacement schemes for the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes.</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out that the Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health Transport Support Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, the background to it did not involve the Government deciding to scrap the scheme.  It was the result of the Ombudsman making a judgment on the operation of the scheme.  I take on board the Deputy's concerns.  It is a legislative priority for the Government and we intend to progress the Bill.</p></speech>

It is disheartening to see the same reply being given time and again.  I have raised the issue many times, but the same reply keeps being given.  It is even more frustrating for those who had qualified under the previous schemes.  They have simply been left with nothing to help them in their day-to-day lives.  More than 1,500 days later, we are still waiting.  That is longer than the duration of the War of Independence and the Civil War combined.  People with disabilities have waited for far too long for the supports they need and deserve.  It is not good enough that they are left to put up with temporary measures.  The absence of certainty on the future of these supports is causing immense distress for many.  It is yet another example of maladministration and lack of planning.  When will the wait be over?</p></speech>

It is a legislative priority for the Government.  I will take up the matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters, Deputy Finian McGrath, to try to ensure progress.  I will certainly convey to him the concerns expressed by the Deputy.</p></speech>

This is a preview of what I imagine will be a more substantive debate on the Sl&aacute;intecare report in the House tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Supporting the establishment of the cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare in June 2016 was one of the first actions I took on becoming Minister for Health.  I commend genuinely the great work done by all members of the committee, including Deputies Michael Harty, Billy Kelleher, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and Pat Buckley, as well as a number of others who worked extraordinarily hard on the committee.  Everyone involved across the political divide worked extraordinarily hard.  The committee's establishment was agreed to across the House, demonstrating a shared understanding of the scale of the challenges facing the health service, as well as recognition of the need for a fundamental reshaping of our vision and long-term strategy for health care.  It should be based on cross-party consensus that does not change every time the Minister, the Government or electoral cycle changes.  I have consistently supported this process which I firmly believe can provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the health service.</p>  <p>  The committee has lived up to its mandate and is to be commended for the significant achievement of developing a future vision, based on political consensus, for the health service.  The report is the culmination of a year-long process of unprecedented cross-party collaboration, dialogue and engagement.  It is testament to the desire across the political spectrum and the broader stakeholder community to work collaboratively to address the challenges in the health service.</p>  <p>  I have been clear in my view since the committee commenced its work that, out of respect for its work, I would not advance major structural reforms until it had reported.  It is vital that we now allow time to reflect and deliberate on the findings of the committee.  I do not envisage it being a substantial period.  I look forward to the D&aacute;il debate on the report tomorrow.  I will give full consideration to the recommendations made in the report when I have had the opportunity to hear views from across the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was very clear in his speech to the Chamber last week when he said delivering real improvements in the health service was a key priority for the Government.  He has tasked me with preparing a detailed response to the report, including proposed measures and timelines, to bring to the Government.  It is my intention to do so following the D&aacute;il debate.  I hope to bring a detailed analysis and proposals to the Government quickly.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt that the report will be an essential document for all Governments and parties in the fundamental reform of the health service in the next decade.  I look forward to talking with colleagues in more detail in the coming days about implementation and about how we can show the public that we intend to make quick progress in the areas where it is possible to do so, as well as how we intend to advance in the more challenging areas.</p></speech>

The public system is not fit for purpose.  It is fragmented, disjointed and incoherent.  Some areas work reasonably well, but all areas are under pressure and struggle to deliver quality care services.  There are lengthening waiting lists in outpatient departments, as well as lengthening inpatient lists for urgent and planned care.  Of course, there are also lengthening trolley queues.  In addition, there is an increase in the population, with a corresponding increase in the number of patients with a chronic illness or who have complex needs within the community.  We must reform the entire health service rather than only parts of it.  This process cannot be delayed any longer.  The Minister has a responsibility and a duty to deliver health service reform, starting in this D&aacute;il.  Delaying reform will only make it far more difficult and costly.  There was a common thread in all of the submissions received - that there should be a shift from secondary to primary care services.  The reform programme needs to include the entire health service.  There is a need for a universal single tier public health service to cover everyone based on need.</p></speech>

It deserves and requires more time.  The Deputy is correct that I do have a duty to deliver health reform.  Clearly I have to discharge that duty in terms of my membership of the Cabinet and the Government.  I formally received the report, which I am happy to describe as an excellent piece of work unprecedented in terms of cross-party effort.  There are many elements within it that reflect my own thinking, which I articulated when I had an opportunity to address the committee.  While I am eager that we put in place health care reform as outlined in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare, we need to discuss some elements of the report.  The Government will have a duty to do its own analysis of the costings, and to put in place implementation structures that can get on with delivering the report.  I am committed in that regard.</p>  <p>  While a number of elements of the report are in line with long-standing Government policy, such as e-health, integrated workforce planning, and clinical governance, it also puts forward a number of key policy changes, which I welcome.  The biggest is the clear indication of a desire to move towards the establishment of a universal single-tier system, where access to care is on the basis on need and not ability to pay.  That is going to require the introduction of a universal entitlement to health care services underpinned in legislation, at no or low cost, and the removal of private activity from public hospitals.  I am committed to doing this but it is a substantive body of work.  That is why it is a ten-year plan.</p></speech>

It contains strong recommendations on implementation.  To drive implementation forward, there needs to be political buy-in.  The first requirement we ask from Government is that there be strong political buy-in for this reform.  If that is not present, the reform programme and Sl&aacute;intecare report are not going to get off the ground.  Part of that is the provision of legislation to provide accountability, governance and responsibility in our health service, which is sadly lacking.  No longer can we have a shrug of the shoulders style of management whereby things that go wrong are blamed on system failure.  We must have strong governance underpinned by legislation.</p>  <p>  We need to restructure the HSE so that it is decentralised and devolved down to regions.  We need new contracts, as Deputy Kelleher said, not only for general practice but also for consultants.  We need an implementation office developed very quickly to drive this reform programme forward.</p></speech>

It is very important, and not just in the area of general practice.  There is political buy-in.  Every political party and grouping in this House, bar one, decided to sign off on the report.  There is a role for Government as well.  As the committee members have pointed out, while the committee has costed the proposals, it was not its role to decide how to fund those costs.  There might be very different views in the different political groupings as to how we might go about doing that.  The Government has to look at all of the resources available to it, the fiscal space and all these terms of which we are well aware.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I am determined to work with the Oireachtas to put in place an implementation structure to get on with progressing Sl&aacute;intecare.  One other point which I will discuss further in tomorrow's debate is the issue of capacity.  As a general practitioner, the Deputy, Dr. Harty will know very well that even if we had the funding to provide free entitlement to all general practice services tomorrow, we might not have the capacity within general practice.  The sequencing of change is very important if we are to make sure it is a sustainable model.  Where there are entitlements, there must also be the capacity of health care professionals to deliver them.  That view is shared by many health care professionals around the country.</p></speech>

There was widespread public controversy for a number of weeks and, at the end of April, the Minister asked for a month to consider this matter.  That month came and went.  While I appreciate that the Minister has been busy with other things, we are now three weeks over the deadline.  I would like to know what developments have taken place.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100034#GG01000"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and her ongoing interest in this very important matter.  I would strongly refute the suggestion that the month came and went.  As the Deputy will be aware, during that month there was significant engagement between myself, the chairs of the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's, and the CEOs and masters of both hospitals, as well as extensive engagement between the St Vincent's Healthcare Group and my officials.</p>  <p>  On 29 May, the Sisters of Charity announced their decision to relinquish their ownership of and involvement with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  This decision is an extremely significant development for the health care sector and for the National Maternity Hospital project.  It addresses not all but a number of the concerns that were articulated by many.  My Department has been briefed on this development.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's constitution will no longer refer to the Sisters of Charity and will be amended to reflect compliance with national and international best practice guidelines on medical ethics and the laws of the Republic of Ireland.  I know that despite the specific provisions in the Mulvey agreement, there was a concern on the part of some about the potential religious influence being brought to bear on the new maternity hospital, and the potential role of religious interests on its board.  The decision of the Sisters of Charity is extremely helpful in dispelling any such concerns.</p>  <p>  We need to resolve the issue of ownership.  I have made my views clear on this.  Discussions are continuing with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on the terms of the State's investment in the new hospital and, in particular, arrangements for the protection of this investment.  The Mulvey agreement envisaged that further consideration was required of the legal mechanisms necessary to protect the State's considerable investment.  My Department is actively engaged in devising suitable arrangements to ensure that these facilities are legally secured on an ongoing basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  I expect to be in a position to report significant progress on this shortly and will update the Government and the Oireachtas at that stage.  I will also be bringing proposals to Government in the coming weeks for a broader discussion of ownership within the health service and the role of the religious and voluntary hospitals, as has already taken place in the education sector through the forum on pluralism and patronage.</p></speech>

He will be well aware, I am sure, of ongoing concerns on the part of the HSE and his own Department in respect of the very unorthodox corporate structure in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, whereby it is not possible to identify where public money is actually going, or the extent to which there is intertwining of public and private in respect of consultants' use of facilities and spending of public money.  Tony O'Brien referred to the private hospital as having a parasitic relationship with the public hospital.</p>  <p>  This is a very real issue.  The audit done by the HSE is still under consideration.  Recently, the HSE announced that it was commencing the second part of that audit, covering the breach of contract arrangements by consultants.  In the context of that issue alone, does the Minister accept that it would not be appropriate to add a further public hospital to a very unorthodox, mixed group?  Does he agree that it would not be a good idea?</p></speech>

The structure proposed in respect of the new National Maternity Hospital is envisaged as standing apart from the current St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It retains the mastership structure.  We have had a lot of public discourse and debate about this.</p>  <p>  Although I always like to be forthcoming with information, I must be conscious of what I say as we are in the middle of ongoing discussions and negotiations between my Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  This is a potential investment of &euro;300 million by the taxpayer.  I am absolutely clear in my view that the issue of ownership is of paramount importance.  Absolute protection for the State's investment can be achieved in a number of ways.</p><p>The Deputy may have articulated a number of ways in which this can happen.  A number of ways are being explored and I expect to be able to revert to the matter very shortly when I hope to be able to announce significant progress in that regard.</p></speech>

Perhaps the issue of ethos has been addressed, but we do not know because we do not know the further details of the new entity proposed.  On the issue of ownership, people were outraged that a publicly owned facility, valued at &euro;300 million, could be handed over to private interests.  This was rejected outright by the public and that message came across very clearly.  On the use of public hospitals by public patients, does the Minister accept the principle that such a hospital must be retained in public ownership?</p></speech>

I am not sure what the Deputy's view was or what the views of many Members of the House were when the State invested &euro;266 million in the Mater hospital to provide new state-of-the-art facilities, a hospital that is not in the ownership of the State.  There are approximately 17 hospitals in the State that are either voluntary or joint board hospitals.  There is also the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  There are a number of hospitals that have not been owned by the State and at which Governments of various political colours sanctioned projects.  As I have described it previously, we have a rich tapestry when it comes to ownership.  There are a number of religious and non-religious voluntary hospitals.  The reason I want to have a broader discussion is that we need to identify the impact of the Deputy's statement, namely, that the State can only invest in what it owns.  That may be desirable but it would not be without consequence.  It would be quite significant and have an impact on the overall health budget.  On the building of a new national maternity hospital, the position is somewhat different.  I take the issue of ownership as being very important in that regard and have heard many people speak very clearly on the issue.  The views of members of the public are quite clear.  I hope to be able to report progress on it shortly.</p></speech>

The Deputy is welcome to come along and engage with Oireachtas Members, the group and me on the issues we discussed when I visited Letterkenny previously.</p>  <p>  Letterkenny and Sligo university hospitals provide essential high quality hospital care for patients in the north west.  I can assure the Deputy of the continued commitment to develop services in both hospitals, including those for patients with diabetes.</p>  <p>  Adult diabetes services at Letterkenny are provided by a consultant endocrinologist, supported by a locum consultant general physician with a diabetic interest.  In order to address waiting lists, additional clinics are provided on a monthly basis.  Furthermore, the Saolta University Healthcare Group has advised that it is making applications for the approval of a second consultant post and an advanced nurse practitioner post in insulin pump therapy to serve both adult and paediatric patients.  I can assure the Deputy that when the applications are made, they will be assessed with a degree of priority because of the importance of the matter.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of paediatric diabetes services, an insulin pump therapy service commenced at Sligo University Hospital in 2015, with outreach clinics delivered at Letterkenny.  However, in mid-April the consultant paediatrician with a special interest in paediatric diabetes post in Sligo became vacant and the Saolta University Healthcare Group has advised that it is actively engaged in recruiting a replacement.  That process is ongoing.  Pending completion of the recruitment process, consultant paediatricians at Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals have undertaken additional training and development to maintain the provision of the paediatric insulin pump therapy service at both hospitals.  Further additional support for these services has been arranged with another consultant, currently practising within the Saolta hospitals.</p>  <p>  Provision of a diabetes centre at Sligo hospital is included in the capital plan for this year.  HSE Estates advises that planning permission for the centre has been granted; construction is scheduled to commence by the end of the year and be completed in quarter three of next year.  Filling the permanent diabetes consultant post at Sligo will enable the group overall, including in County Donegal, to further advance its plan for the diabetes care centre.</p>  <p>  I will meet the Donegal branch of Diabetes Ireland, the HSE and the Saolta University Healthcare Group this month to discuss the current challenges and future development of diabetes services in the north west.</p></speech>

Services are quite limited and in no way sufficient to meet the number of children in the county or the north west who need them.  It is often considered at official level that if a service is provided in Galway, patients in County Donegal are covered.  I know that the Minister has been to Letterkenny a few times and will know that it is closer to Dublin than to Galway.  We need services in the north west.</p>  <p>  On the provision of a centre of excellence in paediatric diabetes care which would include a consultant endocrinologist and support staff such as a dietician and a psychologist, will the Minister give a firm commitment that such a centre will be developed in the north west to serve children from Donegal and neighbouring counties?  On the adult diabetes service, there is a need for an additional consultant in Letterkenny and a team to support him or her to deal with the number of patients in the county with diabetes.  A total of 7,000 people in County Donegal have been diagnosed as having diabetes, of whom 700 have type 1 diabetes.  The waiting time for a follow-up appointment is more than 20 months for patients with type 1 diabetes at a time when the recommended period is four months.  It is simply not acceptable.  The necessary resources and staff need to be provided to serve patients with diabetes in County Donegal.</p></speech>

The health service cannot presume that Letterkenny is just up the road from Galway.  It is a significant journey to travel.  We have talked previously about certain specialties, inlcuding cancer care, and the need at times for patients to travel to Galway, but, in general, as many clinics as possible should be held in Letterkenny to help patients in the north west.  As I said to the Deputy, active recruitment is under way to try to fill the vacant consultant paediatrician post.  Filling it would make a significant difference.  I have asked the HSE to come back to me with further information in advance of our meeting with the Donegal branch of Diabetes Ireland.  Obtaining a replacement to fill the post would be of significant assistance.  In the meantime it is worth saying, as I mentioned, that paediatricians in Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals have undertaken additional training in order that they can keep the paediatric insulin pump therapy service running at both hospitals.  There will be the development of a diabetes centre in the north west.  Funded is provided in the capital plan for this year.  I want to see paediatric services provided in the north west.  I will be happy to discuss the matter further with the Deputy and the group when we meet next week.</p></speech>

I highlight the impact on children with diabetes in County Donegal of not having a paediatric consultant endocrinologist in Sligo.  It means that insulin pump therapy is not available to newly presenting children under the age of five years with type 2 diabetes.  The service is struggling to provide a support service for the children who are receiving this therapy.  It is crucial that the post be filled soon to ensure a service will be available to all children with diabetes.  It is also crucial that Letterkenny University Hospital see an increase in staff numbers.  An additional consultant should be provided, with the necessary support staff, to serve adults with diabetes.  Teenagers who enter the adult diabetes service on reaching the age of 18 years are moving from having repeat appointments every three to four months to having to wait over 20 months for them.  That is simply not acceptable and is very distressing for them.  The problem can only be solved by having an additional consultant in Letterkenny University Hospital to ensure the service can be provided.  Having regard to the fact that there are 7,000 people in the county with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, it is crucial a service be available.  As we know, prevention is better than cure.  Therefore, the provision of support is critical for patients with diabetes.</p></speech>

I can confirm to the Deputy that the process in regard to the consultant paediatrician post which is vacant will be expedited through what is known as the CAAC, the consultant applications advisory committee, and the Public Appointments Service.  Saolta has confirmed that to me.  Saolta has also advised that a plan is being put in place to ensure that all existing paediatric patients on pump therapy will continue to be managed locally in Sligo and Letterkenny with existing paediatric consultant staff and continuation of existing clinics.  The locum paediatrician in place in Sligo and the existing consultant paediatrician in Letterkenny have undertaken additional training in order to continue provision of that service.  Further development of clinical staff will be scheduled in coming months in order to continue the delivery of this therapy.  All options both internal and external to the group are being explored to make sure that patients under the age of five years will have access to pump therapy.  The Saolta group advises that it is currently engaging with a consultant in another hospital in the group with a view to putting governance arrangements in place for the oversight and review of patients and the management of new patients.  This consultant has experience in the delivery of paediatric diabetic pump services.  Sligo is further developing its centre for diabetes care.  It is included in the capital plan for this year and this will ensure the facilitation of paediatric insulin pump services for people in the north west.</p></speech>

The Minister has the details which were supplied with the question.  The question has been tabled to initiate a discussion on that specific case but also on the general point of what happens when someone presents for medical help to their doctor or hospital.  What services are there for a person in a mental health crisis?</p></reply>

For that reason, this parliamentary question is being answered in unspecific terms in relation to the individual regarding mental health services in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</p>  <p>  The person was referred by a GP on 10 April 2017 and was assessed in the emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and subsequently seen by the psychiatric non-consultant hospital doctor in the department of psychiatry on the same day.  Following assessment the person was not admitted to the acute psychiatry department but was referred to the local community mental health team for further involvement in his care.  The person was offered a new patient outpatient appointment on 23 May 2017 in his local area which he had confirmed by phone but unfortunately did not attend.  He was offered an additional appointment on 13 June 2017, which he attended and he has a further review appointment pending which was offered by his local community mental health team.</p>  <p>  A new multi-million acute psychiatric inpatient unit opened last September in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  This is a significant new capital development for people with severe, enduring and disabling mental health issues.  Mental health remains a priority care programme for this Government.  We are committed to increasing the mental health budget annually, as shown by the substantial additional funding of some &euro;140 million since 2012.</p>  <p>  With regard to specific complaints in relation to experiences of individuals in our hospitals, there is a formal complaints policy, entitled Your Service Your Say, details of which are on the HSE website.  In accordance with this procedure, a complaint must be made in the first instance to the hospital in which the incident causing the complaint occurred.  If an individual is not satisfied with the response from the hospital, a review can be sought from the HSE director of advocacy and the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

Where would they be?  The referral for specialist help was six weeks after the initial appointment.  Luckily, this particular individual had considerable help from his community, family and friends that he was able to deal with this issue but he has made it a public locally and, I suspect, nationally, mainly to get assistance for people and to clarify what help is available when someone presents at our hospitals or GP services with a mental health crisis which could be a matter of life and death.  What treatment is available?</p><p>While the centre in Drogheda is welcome, the day centre in Navan, which was to replace the old centre in the town, has not been opened. <i>TheJournal.ie</i>has reported today that it is still closed, but that is known across the community.  The services are really inadequate.  Nobody seems to know what is available for someone at a point of crisis in mental health.</p></speech>

I was shown some of the background to it by officials in the Department.  It is obviously a very sensitive case and I do not want to dwell on it, nor does Deputy Thomas Byrne, but the gentleman in question has done the State some service for highlighting the difficulties he experienced in his case.  The Deputy asked what happens when somebody presents to a hospital.  The HSE mental health division has a clinical care programme which comes into effect when people present to the emergency department with suicidal ideation or self-harm.  All level four hospitals have a liaison psychiatry service available on-site of the acute hospital.  This service provides prompt assessments in the emergency department.  In this case, the individual presented to the emergency department.  I take on board the Deputy's concerns.  I am new to the role and I am anxious to see for myself what is available on the ground.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting its importance.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach will have heard from Deputy Browne and my party leader, Deputy Martin, one of the key priorities for our party is the whole issue of mental health and implementing A Vision for Change and the money required to pay for the resources needed, which is the key part of it and what was missing in this case.  The money was not there and the resource was not available to give the help when it was required.  I have no doubt that my colleagues will continue to press this issue with the Minister and with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, as a key priority for us and the country.  We are all very good at talking, at getting photographs taken and at promoting all sorts of fantastic initiatives but the role of politicians and of Government is to provide the resources needed to help people when they present in crisis, as happened in this case.</p></speech>

It is a matter of deep concern to him and his party.  In the continuance of the confidence and supply agreement he wants to see that this issue is dealt with.  He is aware of the many different steps being taken with the mental health task force.  I will meet it next Tuesday.  We are having a consultation with numerous bodies, which we hope to publish very shortly.  There is also A Vision for Change to which the Deputy referred.  The Deputy mentioned resources and, of course, we want to see more resources.  However, I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is not merely about resources but how we employ them.  It is about awareness, education and cross-sectoral involvement.  There are many issues to get right but I would welcome the Deputy continuing to keep the pressure on in regard to this issue during my time in this job.</p></speech>

While the HSE is exploring what additional supports could be by provided by Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, it has identified that the most immediate and effective means to alleviate pressure on the emergency department is the fit out of additional space for 11 trolley bays on the first floor of the hospital.  Local Deputies may have been briefed on this by hospital management in the last week.  This was prioritised for funding which was provided, and completed recently.  A recruitment process is under way to provide staff for this new area and it is hoped to have staff in place, recruited in advance of this winter.  It is anticipated that this additional capacity will open in September 2017.</p>  <p>  Another option under consideration is to provide additional surge capacity through a temporary inpatient solution, in line with the National Framework for Alternative Accommodation at Hospital Sites.  I understand that the HSE plans to address this issue in the context of the Estimates 2018 submission.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that in recognition of the significant increase in bed utilisation in recent times, a capacity review of the South Tipperary General Hospital by the South-South West Hospital Group is nearing completion.  This review will inform the precise level and nature of any additional capacity required to meet current and future needs.  The Department's national capacity review will also help identify service requirements and inform resourcing priorities.</p>  <p>  I note that a brief for the procurement of a master plan to provide for the orderly development of the South Tipperary General Hospital campus is currently being finalised.</p><p>This review will inform the precise level and nature of any additional capacity required to meet the needs of the people of Tipperary.  The Department's national capacity review will also help to identify service requirements.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to inform the Deputy that a brief for the procurement of a master plan for South Tipperary General Hospital to provide for the development of the hospital campus is being finalised.  This will enable us to consider further developments in respect of the capital plan.  I think it is fair to say this hospital over many years was overlooked for significant capital investment.  The completion of this master plan, which has proceeded to procurement, along with the 11 bays, will enable us to try to include measures in the forthcoming Government's capital plan.</p></speech>

The extra capacity was expected to be available from early May and could be used to accommodate a space for up to 11 trolley bays.  It should be remembered that these would only be on corridors.  It is almost certain the modular patient hotel for South Tipperary General Hospital will not be delivered for at least another year.  The Minister talked about many tendering processes and everything else.  If we get the modular hotel, as promised in a blaze of glory to my colleague, Deputy Lowry, a year ago this month, it is estimated that the 40-bed unit will cost &euro;60,000 per week to operate.  I note that the Minister in his reply tells me that the corridor issue is nearly solved, there is space there for 11 trolleys - not beds - and he now has recruitment ongoing for staff.  Why can he not do the two in tandem?  I understand from my colleague who visited last week that the place is ready now, and now the Minister is looking for the staff and hopes to have the unit ready for September.  Why can nothing be done in tandem?  The hospital has been operating at emergency status for the past 17 months.  It is under enormous pressure.  Why can the recruitment not go on in tandem with the construction work and mini tender?  Everything is just a matter of fobbing off and going back and forward.  We will have another review and another capacity review by the South/South West hospital group and another one at a national level.  It is just not good enough; it is not happening.  The Minister visited Cashel with me and saw the spaces and the capacity there.</p></speech>

We are seeing progress on South Tipperary General Hospital.  The 11 bays will open.  They will provide badly needed additional surge capacity for the winter.  We need to have a master plan for the development.  Successive Governments have failed to invest in the hospital and, as a result, it does not have enough capacity.  The master plan will enable the hospital group to say what it wants to do in Clonmel and ask the Government to include that in its capital plan.  That is the way the process works, it is the appropriate way and I hope the hospital group does that because I would like to see this included in the capital plan.</p>  <p>  The Deputy brought me to Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel, I was there with him and I think there is a possibility of alleviating pressure there.  I am about to run out of time, but I have already asked the HSE to develop a proposal in this regard and it has developed a proposal which is particularly focused on the development of the Cashel health campus to deliver integrated care, particularly for older people.

This will involve additional resource requirements, including specialist staffing, and I therefore expect this to be considered in the context of the budget.</p></speech>

Is the mini tender finished or has it become a major tender?  How could any mini tender take so long?  The HSE uses a particular vocabulary.  The Taoiseach has talked about his new scriptwriter or historian or whatever.  The Department of Health could get rid of half the speechwriters and scriptwriters it has for using multisyllabic words in the HSE to confuse people.  The Minister saw Cashel.  The HSE has no intention of placing patients in Cashel.  It is a patient-free area, full stop.  It is only being used for staff, as I said to the Minister before.  It is an emporial fiefdom for the people in there.  They do not want any patients in there.  The Minister was there and I know he was shocked to see the condition and the splendour of the unit, the chronic pressure on South Tipperary General Hospital down the road in Clonmel, which he visited afterwards, and the palatial rooms, offices and suites of furniture in Cashel, and to hell with the patient.  It is sickening, it is a disgrace, and he is not doing anything about it.  I am glad he is back in his job.  I will be holding him to account.  He can tell Deputy Lowry whatever d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i stories he likes but he will not tell them to me.  I will not take them at face value and go announcing a patient hotel that was supposed to be in place last October.  We have not even got the bed linen, not to mind the hotel.  We have not got the pillowcases and there are no staff to dress the beds anyway.</p></speech>

He is right that when I visited Cashel, I was taken aback by the underutilisation of what is a fine resource within the ownership of the HSE.  However, before I became Minister for Health, there was diddly-squat planned to do anything with it.</p></speech>

As a result, the proposal that the HSE has come up with for Cashel now predominantly focuses on older people and on the idea of developing the Cashel health campus to provide services for the local population.  These services can be developed in the existing accommodation at the former Our Lady's Hospital.  However, this will involve additional resource requirements including specialist staff.  Therefore, I am telling the Deputy today that this will be considered in the context of the budget for 2018 and I will keep in touch with him and other Oireachtas Members from Tipperary about that.</p></speech>

Indeed, I have read it many times at this stage.  I also assure the Deputy that I remain of the view that this process has provided us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform our health services.  People doubted that all the political parties in this House, and indeed Independent groupings, could come together and come up with a plan.  With the exception of Deputy Barry, whose decision in this regard I respect, that is exactly what happened.  This Government is committed to delivering real improvements in the area of health and our new Taoiseach made that very clear in one of his opening speeches last week.  The report of the committee now provides us with a solid framework for delivering these improvements over the next decade.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has rightly highlighted the issue of implementation.  How we go about delivering on the report must now come to the forefront.  This is acknowledged by the committee in its report when it states that "mechanisms for implementation are as important as the report's recommendations".</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the report's remit is wide-ranging and its recommendations far-reaching.  It is important, now that it has been published, that I give it careful and proper consideration in the context of how best we realise the vision and spirit of the report.  Success will very much depend on the formulation of an effective implementation pathway.  I assure Deputy Moynihan that I will move quickly on this process of consideration and following the D&aacute;il debate that will take place in this House tomorrow I will bring proposals to Government on this very shortly.</p></reply>

My experience of the health service over the past 12 months is that there is crisis in many aspects of it, but one that always evades me is home care packages and what the Government is doing about them.  There is also a discrepancy in how the packages are distributed.  The figures show that there are 1,200 in parts of Dublin north-west alone and only somewhere in the region of 200 in north Cork.  There is a huge discrepancy in how they are distributed.  The one question I have for the Minister in the limited amount of time I have is whether his Department has assessed the home care packages and if he can comment on the value for money in keeping people out of residential nursing homes and in their own homes.  From the layman's point of view, it would be good value for money from the Department's point of view and the State's point of view.  Has the Minister looked at these figures in real terms?  Can he confirm to the House that it makes sound economic sense from the State's point of view to have many more home care packages available than there has been heretofore?</p></speech>

As Deputy Moynihan will remember, we had a debate in this House recently during which his colleague, Deputy O'Dea, raised this very issue by way of a Bill.  We agreed at that stage that we would go forward with trying to develop a statutory home care scheme.  We all say we would like people to be able to grow old at home but the only statutory scheme available for someone who grows old and needs more support is the fair deal scheme, that is, the nursing home support scheme.</p><p>We intend to launch a public consultation process shortly to hear the views of older people on how that statutory home care scheme, an alternative to the fair deal scheme, for people in need of home help could work.</p> <p> While there are many elements of the report on which we will all agree, we may not all agree on how to fund its implementation.  For example, it proposes the removal of private work from public hospitals.  I believe in that proposal instinctively, but it would create a &euro;650 million hole in the health budget.  Reference is made to the cost of implementing the report, but it does not outline how we would fund its implementation.  The Deputy's party and mine might have a view, but the parties and groupings on the left might have a different one.  We will need to tease out these issues in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

When people seek additional home help hours and support within their communities, they have to dovetail with their families to ensure they can stay at home for as long as possible.  By and large, when they go into a nursing home, they are fully covered under the fair deal scheme, which costs the State approximately &euro;1,000 a week.  There is still a huge challenge for everybody working with elderly people to secure half an hour or an hour of home help provision.  The figures were debated recently in the House when we were told there had been no cut in the number of home help hours.  The same number of hours is being provided this year as in 2015 and 2016, but the number of people who require this support has increased substantially because of demographic changes.  From a constituency point of view, we find that we are constantly trying to make representations to secure additional help in order that families can work with the HSE to keep elderly people at home for much longer.</p></speech>

The population of the country is changing; it is not just increasing.  There will be 20,000 more people over the age of 65 years this year compared to last year and there will be 3,500 more over the age of 80.  That trend is likely to continue into the future and will place significant demands on the health service for which we need to plan.  The Deputy is correct that the home care system has largely developed with geographical inconsistencies and in an<i>ad hoc </i>way.  It is not underpinned by statute, unlike the nursing home support scheme which has a budget of almost &euro;1 billion a year.  We need to have a serious conversation about older people seeking assistance to enable them to grow old with dignity.  Should we have a statutory scheme that provides people with nursing home care if that is what they require or want but which can also veer in a different way if they wish to remain in their home and have the comfort and safety of knowing that they can avail of a consistent and sustainable model of care?  That is where we want to get to as a Government and where the Deputy's party also wants to get to based on what I have heard.  We will shortly launch proposals for public consultation in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to trends, demographics and <i>ad hoc</i>planning.  In the past 12 months the increase in the number last year has been reversed.  There has been a significant decrease this year.  That contradicts Government policy which is that the threshold should remain the same or increase.  It deserves an explanation.</p></reply>

Home supports provision is a key mechanism in enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals.  The HSE's national service plan for 2016 originally provided for a target of 10.4 million home help hours and 15,450 home care packages.  However, the numbers of patients who had completed their acute treatment but required home care in order to be discharged were very high in the early part of the year.  Without additional funding, this rate of hospital discharges could not have been sustained and the allocations for the rest of the year would have had to be reduced.  The Government responded to this challenge by providing an additional &euro;40 million for home care services in 2016.  Further resources were provided through the winter initiative, in particular, additional home care packages and an increase in the number of approvals for transitional care beds.</p><p>This year's national service plan provides for a target of 10.57 million home help hours, 16,750<b></b>home care packages<b></b>and<b></b>190<b></b>intensive home care packages for clients with complex needs.  While the January to April data for home help hours are lower than for the corresponding period in 2016, of more significance is that the HSE target for this year is to provide approximately 200,000 home help hours in Dublin West, an increase of 20% on the number of hours delivered in 2016.  A total of 509 people were in receipt of home care packages in Dublin West in April 2017, an increase of 8% on the expected target of 470.  This represents an increase of 19% on the number in receipt of a package at the end of 2016.</p></reply>

He has a challenging few months ahead, given the ageing demographic.  It is fundamental that we move away from the national picture he has outlined.  Despite the changing statistics in Dublin West to which he referred, we know from the raw figures that there has been a 20% reduction in provision year-on-year.  That is despite the ageing demographic and all of the challenges mentioned by previous speakers.  The core issue concerns HSE management.  Area managers are incentivised to balance their budgets and not to increase the provision of home care packages.  There is a rigid threshold which is not about service delivery but about meeting budgetary targets.  From a health service perspective, we need to move the management incentive away from an inhumane, rigid ceiling for different aspects of community-based health care and deliver for the individual.  That should be the reward for the manager.  Various area managers in Dublin West have been promoted on the back of cuts in the numbers of home care packages and community services, which have resulted in people being put into hospitals and nursing homes, resulting in a greater cost to the State.  They have been rewarded for this flaw in the Government's health policy.</p></speech>

There is no point in us arguing over and back about the statistics.  As the Minister alluded to previously, the number of hours has increased year-on-year, but there is also increased demand, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of available hours.  There are too many disparities geographically, with greater availability in some places.  We have to get to grips with this.  I would like the service to be put on a statutory footing similar to the fair deal scheme.  We spend &euro;373 million on home help provision, which is a large budget.  We can continue to increase it, but we need to put the service on a statutory footing with a level playing field.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to make sure everybody can access the service because it represents better value for money and, more importantly, a better quality of life for elderly people who wish to remain in their own homes.</p></speech>

We saw what happened with the Tory policy in the United Kingdom on a dementia tax.  It is fundamental that the Minister of State avoid imposing another tax obligation or levy on people's homes through a statutory scheme.  That would scare the living daylights out of people who want to stay in their own homes.  We will have to see what the Minister of State proposes in his scheme.  Caring for people in their own homes and ensuring they took their prescriptions delivered through the primary care or hospital system would save the State money.  The State should fund such a service and not impose a levy on the family home or the individual.  It should be willing to care for them in their own homes because that will keep them out of the hospital system or nursing homes, which are costly alternatives.  It is important that we incentivise the scheme by making it free for people and not examine it on a cost basis.</p></speech>

There is no argument from us.  The Deputy's party colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, proposed a similar statute to the one we are discussing.</p><p>We all want to get there.  Obviously, there is a cost and we have to deal with the reality that if we go with a demand-led scheme, we cannot have a limitless budget because the budget has to be allocated year-on-year with a certain amount of money.  It is a difficult challenge for us to get it right but I think we all want the same thing.  I thank the Deputy for his interest.</p></speech>

There are long-standing arrangements in place between the State and the 17 voluntary hospitals to allow for public investment in the development of health care facilities and for these facilities to be protected for publicly funded health care.  The Mulvey agreement envisaged that further consideration was required in regard to the precise legal mechanisms necessary to protect the State's considerable investment in the development of this much-needed national maternity hospital.  My Department is actively engaged in discussing suitable arrangements to ensure the facilities are legally secured on an ongoing basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  I hope to update the Government and the Oireachtas on this progress very shortly.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the allocation of private space in the new hospital, I would like to clarify that there is no differentiation between public and private inpatient rooms in the hospital designs.  All inpatient rooms are of a similar, high quality design given we want to build a state-of-the-art new hospital.  In terms of outpatient consulting space, some limited private space will be provided, based upon existing policy and subject to any policy development, in so far as this is necessary to support the commitment in the current consultant contract.  As the Deputy knows, the current consultant contract does envisage that consultants can carry out a degree of private work.  If that changes in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report or any consultant contract discussions, which I think is the Deputy's question, that will be reflected in the changes to policy development.</p>  <p>  In regard to the more general issue of private care in public hospitals, I look forward to the D&aacute;il debate on the Sl&aacute;intecare report tomorrow and I will give full consideration to the report's recommendations when I have had the opportunity to hear views from across the D&aacute;il.  Following the debate, it is my intention to bring detailed analysis and proposals to Government.  I have no doubt the report will be an essential document for this and future Governments and all parties in the fundamental reform of our health services over the next decade.  While I know the Deputy was not in a position to sign off on the report, I acknowledge he worked very hard with many colleagues on it.</p></speech>

There are five rooms on the plans marked "private consult".  We have a two-tier health service and it is two-tier in maternity services as well.  I reject the Minister's point that there is equality.  If anyone goes private, there is continuity of care.  If they go public, that is very unlikely.  A private patient who arrives for prenatal appointments does not have to wait whereas a public patient has to wait.  It is two-tier.  I am asking the Minister to comment and to state whether he agrees there is a two-tier care system within the health service or within maternity services in the context of planning for the future and the development of the national maternity hospital.</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which has received broad political consensus.  I do not know if the Deputy has walked the corridors of Holles Street hospital lately but I have been there many times.  The point I am making, which the Deputy seems to reject, is that at the moment public patients are receiving excellent care from staff in deplorable conditions.  Every patient, whether public or private, in this new state-of-the-art national maternity hospital will have the same high quality inpatient room.  That is very important and is a significant development.</p>  <p>  Yes, there will be rooms for consultants to see outpatients; in fact, there will be 32 consult examination rooms in total.  Under the current consultant contract, roughly proportionately, some five of them would be used for private clinics.  The point I am making in direct answer to the Deputy's question, which is how it is compatible with the Sl&aacute;intecare report, is that if policy changes in this area, so too will the allocation of those rooms.  I have to comply with the law today in terms of contracts but we are going to deliver the same rooms to the exact same specification as outpatient consult examination rooms and to the exact same specification as inpatient rooms as well.  That is very significant progress for women in this country in terms of their own treatment.</p></speech>

It is not something to be boasting about.</p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that does not have universal foetal anomaly screening and many pregnant women were not able to avail of that last year.  If a woman has concerns about genetic defects, she has to pay for the tests.  The nuchal translucency scan costs &euro;250 while non-invasive prenatal testing costs &euro;450.  This is really backward.</p>  <p>  I too look forward to the Sl&aacute;intecare debate tomorrow.

I have made it clear that my Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are now in discussions in regard to the ownership model.  We will get this right and we will build this.  I share the Deputy's view that we are coming from behind when compared to where many other countries are in terms of capital infrastructure and single inpatient rooms.  However, this is an example of good practice, which means we are going to deliver a high quality inpatient room to every woman, regardless of whether she is a public or private patient.</p></speech>

While that list is increasing, those people's quality of life continues to deteriorate.  People are afraid of moving around their own homes in case they trip and fall and break a hip, and they have reduced mobility and are not able to get out to get their driver's licence renewed, for example.  We need to establish what action will be taken to reduce the extraordinarily long waiting lists for those waiting for cataract operations in the south-west.</p></reply>

As he will be aware, NTPF data for May 2017, the last month for which figures are available, indicates that 6,607 patients are on ophthalmology outpatient waiting lists for hospitals in Cork and a total of 1,118 are on inpatient or daycase lists.  I acknowledge that waiting times are often unacceptably long and I am conscious of the burden this places on patients and their families.  There is no doubt that our public hospital system is challenged in meeting the growing demand for care.  In order to take action on this and do something about it, we have developed waiting list action plans for this year in the areas of inpatient-daycase and outpatient services.  These plans focus on reducing the number of patients waiting 15 months or more by the end of October.  Under these plans, approximately 14,200 patients have already come off the inpatient-daycase list and almost 49,000 off the outpatient lists.</p>  <p>  Last December I granted approval to the NTPF for funding in the region of &euro;5 million for those waiting longest for daycase treatment to ensure that in excess of 2,000 patients waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure will receive an offer of an appointment by the end this month.</p><p>The NTPF has advised that to date 2,500 patient files have been transferred to private hospitals under this initiative, 631 patients have accepted an offer of treatment and 178 patients have received their procedure.</p> <p> The inpatient and daycase waiting list action plan will be delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity from the HSE budget, funded under the national service plan, as well as insourcing initiatives through the NTPF in public hospitals and outsourcing initiatives in private hospitals using the &euro;15 million of budget 2017.  I assure the Deputy that ophthalmology waiting lists, including for people in Cork, will be progressed using insourcing initiatives while we will provide additional funding to public hospitals to provide more ophthalmology procedures using funding through the NTPF.  I expect this will show significant progress in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

At this stage, more than 87 people are waiting for inpatient procedures in Cork.  Are we still on target for this?  Is it realistic these people will get their procedures by then?  Has the Minister looked at, for example, the Sligo model in which far more community services are used?  This means instead of the consultant dealing with after-care this is done in the community and the consultant is free to deal with people who have cataracts and who are waiting for procedures.  It is a major concern to so many older people in my community who, for example, are afraid of losing their driver licences because of their eyesight.  This is not just about driving, it is about social isolation, a threat to the wider family and people being able to meet their grandchildren.  Will the Minister prioritise this?</p></speech>

In fairness, he has highlighted the seriousness of this issue to a person's quality of life, safety and well-being.  As I stated, the &euro;5 million was to treat in excess of 2,000 patients.  The NTPF has transferred 2,500 patient files, because not every patient will be in a position to accept treatment for a variety of personal reasons.  Today, 631 of these patients have accepted an offer of treatment and 178 of them have received their procedure.  I expect this number to continue to grow apace because it is fully funded and fully authorised.</p>  <p>  The point made by Deputy Moynihan about doing more in primary care hits the nail entirely on the head.  There is more we can do with regard to primary care by services in the community.  As the Deputy may know, the HSE is about to finalise a report on a review of primary care eye services, the aim of which is to look at how much more can be done in primary care, with an increased emphasis on maximising the delivery of a comprehensive service in primary care, which thereby, as the Deputy correctly said, creates capacity in hospitals to provide more complex ophthalmology services.  The programme for Government commits to developing a national eye care plan, including the evaluation of the Sligo model for cataract services.  The Sligo model is largely one where more services are carried out in the community.  I expect to have more information for the Deputy on this in the coming weeks and I will revert to him.</p></speech>

CUH has the largest number of people waiting more than 18 months, with 1,350 people.  Well over 7,000 people are waiting for inpatient and outpatient procedures.  Has the Minister looked at the option of hiring additional ophthalmic physicians?  Is there space in the Estimates?  If so, how many people will the Minister consider taking on, specifically in the Cork and Kerry region?</p></speech>

Obviously, included in this is meeting the longest waiters regardless of where they live in the country.  The figures that relate to the Deputy's region will be focused on in this regard.  The South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital is actively working with the NTPF in terms of ophthalmology to ensure a number of patients will have their procedures performed by private providers locally.  I have data specifically on Cork, which I am happy to share with the Deputy, but I would probably run out of time if I tried to get through it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's point on hiring additional staff is correct.  The Deputy's party wished to see the re-establishment of the NTPF.  It is very important in re-establishing the NTPF that we send out a message it is here to stay for a number of years and that hospitals, be they private or public, can hire additional staff.  I have already asked the NTPF to start planning for 2018.  The Government has already committed &euro;55 million, which is a significant increase in the budget of this year, and Deputy Kelleher is wagging his finger to make sure we get on with it.  That commitment should send a very important message and I have conveyed this to the HSE to ensure we have in place and actively recruit additional staff so they can hit the ground running with regard to spending the money.</p></speech>

A month later she said funding for the trial of the initiative simply went to Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary and that it will eventually be rolled out in Wexford.  Of all the areas in the country Wexford probably needs it more than most.  We have no emergency mental health services outside 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.  The programme is about empowering people to make decisions about how their care proceeds.  Surely autonomy is a human rights issue and the bedrock of self-respect, and it is something that is not available to people who are challenged in this area in Wexford at present, where we probably have the worst mental health services in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has responsibility for mental health policies since yesterday has had to go to the Seanad to take a Private Members' motion so he is already working hard.  I am taking this on his behalf.  I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very serious issue in Wexford.  I have received correspondence from the Mayor of Wexford town, among others, highlighting this important issue and the Deputy has been in touch with us regularly on it.</p>  <p>  The 2016 national mental health division's operational plan outlined an objective to introduce peer support workers in mental health services.  Peer support workers are people who have lived experience of mental distress and recovery.  The peer support workers will use their expertise gained through lived experience to promote recovery and share information to promote choice, self-determination and opportunities for connection with local communities.  In addition to working with other mental health multidisciplinary professionals, it is envisaged that the peer support worker will work alongside an agreed number of service users on a one to one group basis.</p>  <p>  Following a national competitive process for all HSE mental health service areas, an initial funding allocation to develop the national peer support initiative was allocated to a small number of multidisciplinary teams in the Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary area.  The pilot initiative began in February this year.  A review of the initiative is planned in September.  Following this, it is anticipated the peer support worker model will be developed, subject to additional resources, across an extended catchment area.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a commitment to peer support is outlined in the 2017 HSE national service plan.  Peer support workers are now working as part of 13 teams within mental health services.  The extension of this initiative and recruitment of more peer support workers will commence later this year, once the review in September is published.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to keep in touch with Deputy Wallace on this.</p></speech>

That people hold this position is pretty much at odds with the approach at the heart of the peer support initiative.  I wonder how the programme could take off when the executive clinical director for the area has zero regard for the integrity of those facing mental challenges.  I plead with the Minister and the Minister of State to look at this area.  We are not being well served by the personnel in the HSE in this region and that is a fact.</p></speech>

It seems extraordinarily logical that we would benefit from the experience of people who have been through mental distress and have gone on to recovery.</p><p>It is an invaluable tool.  Anecdotally, I hear there are good benefits from the pilot project in place.  The project was selected through a competitive process in which every HSE mental health services area had an opportunity to apply.  We will have the results of the review in September, which will be in advance of both the budget and the HSE's service plan, and I am sure my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will be eager to roll it out to an expanded area.

There are many competing crises under the Government's remit at present but, unfortunately, one crisis is the clear winner - the housing crisis.  This is a humanitarian crisis that has been building for many years and it still worsens today.</p>  <p>  I attend Trim district courthouse regularly.  It is chock-a-block with families in mortgage distress where banks are seeking to repossess their homes.  It is shocking that there is a property rent and price bubble in full swing in Meath at present while the collateral damage of the last Fianna F&aacute;il property crash is still weaving its way through the courts.  Hundreds of families in Meath are living with friends and family.  Dozens more are in emergency accommodation.  I am aware of people in Meath who have had to stay in tents, churches and Garda station cells so they could bridge the gaps between homes.  Currently, there are 3,800 people on the housing waiting list in Meath, despite the fact that there are 2,500 vacant or derelict buildings in the county.</p>  <p>  Rents in the county have spiralled over the last number of years, increasing by 50% in the last four years.  They increased by 15.8% last year and in the year to date they have increased by 16.7%.  They are spiralling out of control.  Indeed, they are increasing at a faster rate than in any other county in the State.  I wholeheartedly support the right of a landlord to charge a fair price for a decent house.  Indeed, it is a key component of the housing provision system in this country.  However, the rents we are discussing now are in the realm of super profits.  These are not the rents that are necessary to cover mortgages or to ensure that the landlord can provide a house and maintain its contents in a decent fashion.  Supernormal profits are being made.</p>  <p>  The average rent in Meath at present is &euro;1,050 for a house.  That makes renting a house unaffordable for many people on low incomes.  Perhaps the Minister of State will put himself in the shoes of a person working 40 hours per week and earning the minimum wage.  If that person is required to provide accommodation for their family and rent an average house in the county, they will spend 65% of their income on the rental of that property.  That is their income before it is taxed.  They are expected to spend the 35% that is left after paying the landlord on feeding their family and on providing electricity, warmth, clothing, education and health care for their family.</p>  <p>  The key point here, which is something that has been missed by the Government so far, is that the point at which rental accommodation becomes unaffordable is the point where homelessness begins.  That is the reason our party, since this crisis has manifested itself, has pleaded with the Government to link rent increases to the consumer price index.  At present, rent pressure zones have been designated in only a small part of this country.  Places such as Meath West are left outside of those zones.  I ask the Minister to ensure that towns in the commuter belt are considered part of the rent pressure zones.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100041#OO01500"><p>First, I beg the indulgence of the House as I have not read a script in 15 years, so if I get lost I will try to correct myself.</p>  <p>  The way in which an area is designated as a rent pressure zone is set out in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  The 2016 Act amends the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide that the Housing Agency, in consultation with local authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered for designation as a rent pressure zone.  On receipt of such a proposal, the Act provides that the Minister must then request the director of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether it meets the necessary criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a rent pressure zone.  Where the Residential Tenancies Board confirms that an area satisfies the criteria for the area to be designated, the Minister then has a statutory obligation to make an order designating that area as a rent pressure zone.</p>  <p>  An area cannot be designated as a rent pressure zone unless it meets the criteria set out in the legislation.  These criteria are that the annual rate of rent inflation in the area was 7% or more in four of the last six quarters and that the average rent for the area in the last quarter was above the average national rent in the RTB&rsquo;s rent index report in the last quarter, which is &euro;987 per month for the first quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  On 15 June 2017, the RTB published the rent index report relating to the first quarter of 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating rent pressure zones in respect of local electoral areas in the country.  This allows all interested parties to see where their area stands with regard to rents and possible designation.  The data from the rent index report relating to KelIs, Navan and Trim is included in the report and indicates that the annual rate of rent inflation in Trim and Navan was 7% or more in at least four of the last six quarters, while for Kells the report shows that there was growth of 7% or more in three of the last six quarters.  In all cases, however, the average rent for these areas was not above the RTB average national rent for the last quarter.  Therefore, these areas do not meet the criteria for designation at this time.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Minister has no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as rent pressure zones or in deciding whether they should be so designated.  The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.  The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as rent pressure zones.</p>  <p>  A review of the rent predictability measure and the system of rent pressure zones is currently under way.</p><p>The provisions have been in place for six months and data from the Residential Tenancies Board's rent index report for the first quarter of 2017 are now available.  This is the first rent index covering the period since the rent pressure zone measure was introduced.  Using these data, it will be possible to ascertain the effectiveness of the rent predictability measure and whether any changes need to be made - for example, to the qualifying criteria or the designation process.  As part of the review, a public consultation process on the effectiveness of the rent predictability measure and the rent pressure zones was launched on 15 June 2017 and will remain open until 30 June.  Further details on the consultation are available on the Departments website.</p></speech>

The Minister of State says they do not meet the full criteria, however, because the rent in question is not already an outlier, as in being too high.  In other words, the Government's mechanism is to wait until rent gets too high and then slow down the increase to 4%.  It does not put the brake on it or stop it but it waits until it gets too high and then decides, perhaps, to slow it down somewhat.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the thousands of people who are already in massive crisis with regard to housing.  There are thousands of other people living in houses today who are living in fear that their landlord will either increase the rent or decide to move them out of their home, thereby leaving them at the mercy of the market.  That is exactly where the Government is leaving them.  It is saying to them there are no brakes that it will apply to the rents in the towns of Navan, Kells, Athboy, Trim, Oldcastle and Enfield.  It is extremely frustrating.  Meath West is the home of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Damien English.  We would have believed there would have been some leverage there with regard to making the changes.  It is also the home of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, Shane Cassells, who abstained from voting on the legislation and, therefore, allowed for these Meath West towns to be excluded.</p>  <p>  The point the Minister of State made was that the Minister is prevented from participating.  He is not.  He has a mandate from the people to fix this problem.  He is not stopped by legislation because he can make sure it is changed.  If the Minister decides to change it, he will have willing helpers on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches to make sure the rent is linked to the consumer price index or the rate of inflation, and make sure that normal families can go to sleep easily in the knowledge that next year's rent will also be affordable.</p></speech>

He referred to there being 2,800 vacant buildings in County Meath.  While I am in this position, it is my intention to consider how we can get those vacant properties back into the housing market.  I have a particular, designated role in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to legislation.  It is clear.  The Minister must act if the criteria are met.  The Deputy is doing his job as a Deputy for Meath West but the criteria are not met.  It is a bit rich, in a way, for any Deputy to say a Minister of State - Deputy Cassells was mentioned also - should be in some position to manipulate the legislation.  It is quite clear that the criteria have not been met.  The legislation can be amended and I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  I indicated in my response that a full review was happening.  It is only six months since this was introduced.  It is not a universally recognised fact that rent controls work everywhere in the world.  It is appropriate that after six months we would review the arrangement.  As the Deputy clearly put to the House, there is a case for an extension to his area but we need to determine how the measure is working overall.  After six months, it is appropriate to have the review.  Certainly, the Deputy's representations arguing for an extension to other areas will be considered as part of the review of the legislation in this area.</p></speech>

As we know, Tom was buried this morning.  His death was very untimely.  As the Minister, Deputy Harris, is well aware, considering that we have raised this several times in the House, that cardiac services in University Hospital Waterford are time sensitive.  The cath lab opens from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday.  It is, therefore, open for eight hours per day and closed for 16 hours per day.  It is closed all day on Saturday and Sunday.  It is simply not acceptable that time restrictions play such a role in the day-to-day lives of our people.  Cardiology intervention at University Hospital Waterford is time sensitive so if any patient presents requiring cardiac intervention outside the opening hours, his or her only option is an ambulance to Cork.</p>  <p>  Last Sunday, Mr. Thomas Power, 39, recently married and expecting his first baby, presented at University Hospital Waterford with chest pains.  A decision was taken that he should be transferred to Cork University Hospital.  He died in Dungarvan, 30 minutes up the road.  As I said, he was laid to rest this morning.  The death has come as a huge shock to those of us living in Waterford and the south east.  Unfortunately, it has not come as a surprise.  Those of us campaigning for the second cath lab and for 24/7 cardiac care have warned for years of the dangers of transporting patients by ambulance for treatment.  Dr. Patrick Owens, consultant cardiologist, has warned time and again that this would happen.  It has happened.  It is one death too many and it can never be allowed to happen again.</p>  <p>  The Herity report has underestimated the impact of not having 24/7 cardiac care.  It has underestimated the single-point-of-failure situation that we saw at the weekend.  It has underestimated the commute time between University Hospital Waterford and Cork University Hospital.  How can the Minister continue to stand over the Herity report?</p></speech>

They are angry because of what happened to Thomas Power, who presented to the accident and emergency ward in University Hospital Waterford on Sunday with chest pains.  He was suffering from cardiac complications.  The cardiac unit, the emergency PPCI service, in the hospital was closed at the time.  It closes at 5.30 p.m. from Monday to Friday and it is closed for the weekend.  Rather than being admitted into the ward and treated by cardiologists, Mr. Power was put into an ambulance, in which he died 30 minutes outside Waterford.</p>  <p>  A number of months ago, a number of regional clinicians and consultants met in Buswells Hotel in Dublin and robustly challenged Dr. Herity's findings.  They said at the time that a decision not to enhance cardiology services in Waterford would cost lives.  I spoke to those consultants today and they are livid.  They are livid with the Department and HSE and they are also angry with the Minister.  They and I accept that medical services should be provided on the basis of clinical and medical need but there is no justification whatsoever for people in a region with a population of 500,000 not to have access to emergency cardiac services out of hours from Monday to Friday and over weekends.  Worse still, Dr. Herity recommended that all emergency services at the hospital cease.  How is that report justified, therefore?  How could it be stood over?  We need a new review.  Everything in the review is irrelevant unless it is based on the population of the south east.  I sympathise with the family, to whom I have spoken personally.  We have a job of work to do.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and Deputy Butler and all the regional politicians who work together on this.  If there is a new review, will it be based on the population of the region?</p></speech>

I believe that if he had taken ill on a Friday morning instead of a Sunday, he would have received cardiac intervention at University Hospital Waterford, which is about ten minutes from his home.</p><p>The Minister of Health and I have differed on the Herity report on a number of occasions.  I respect that.  He knows my firmly-held views that the calculations of the population were flawed and that it was incomplete on the basis that the experienced concerns and service needs of the consultants in south Tipperary and Wexford were not sought, despite the fact that there was a comprehensive input from the consultants in Cork.  Crucially, in the context of the death of Mr. Tom Power, the review did not address life and death clinical risk and safety concerns.  Pre-dating the Herity review, the HSE itself identified the lack of the second cath lab at UHW as being an extreme clinical risk under the HSE risk register.  That status was downgraded by an unknown person in the HSE prior to Dr. Herity commencing his review.  After the publication of the Herity report, further suggestions of interference in the review process emerged.  I believe that Dr. Herity was given flawed and biased information prior to commencing his work.  A briefing note prepared by unit 3 of the Department of Health explicitly stated that the second cath lab was not a priority.  It is my belief that the interference has continued.</p> <p> I commend the Minister on the work that he is trying to do at present by formally approving the deployment of a mobile cath lab on 8 May.  However, it was not until 12 June - five weeks later - that the Department of Health formally instructed the HSE to proceed to tender and notify the management of UHW.  For five weeks, I believe that a ministerial order was completely ignored.  For five weeks, the Minister's express instructions were treated with utter contempt by civil servants.  This is not fair to the Minister.  I believe that the HSE is a law unto itself and that unknown person or persons within the HSE are determined to put every obstacle possible in front of the expansion of the cardiac services in UHW.  I believe there is an agenda playing out that the extension of services at UHW has nothing to do with the clinical need.</p></speech>

Mr. Power's death is a devastating loss to his family.</p>  <p>  The death of Thomas Power is a heart-rending reminder of the desperate need for 24-7 cardiac services in the south-eastern region.  More than half a million people live in the south east.  The existing cath lab is the only one that operates on a part-time basis.  It is difficult to see how this is justifiable.  How can it be that when patients reach the largest hospital in the south-eastern region, a university hospital, they cannot be given the basic services that are necessary to keep them alive?  How can anyone stand over the fact that someone with chest pains who present him or herself at UHW before 5 p.m. on Friday is treated any differently to someone who presents after 5 p.m. or at the weekend?  Why are those people made to risk their lives by having to travel to Cork?</p>  <p>  Take my own county of Wexford for example.  The popular village of Fethard-on-Sea down in New Ross is 180 km from Cork University Hospital.  That is almost three hours of travel time.  How could anyone be expected to survive such a distance?  There have long been warnings of the risks of not having 24-7 cardiac services in Waterford.  These risks are posed by outsourcing cardiac patients down to Cork city.  It is simply indefensible.  The people of the south east are being treated as second-class citizens.  It is difficult to see how anyone can stand over a region of half a million people not having access to 24-7 services.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the Minister realising the Herity report, but that report ignores the real consequences of restricted cardiac services for the south east.  How can the State guarantee patient safety when critically ill patients present themselves at a hospital and are then expected to travel to a second hospital 130 km away?  It is not rational, acceptable or right.  A second review needs to be carried out on this situation.</p></speech>

I too was very saddened to hear of the tragic death of a young man, Mr. Power, who was being transferred between two hospitals at the weekend.  I offer my sincere condolences to his family.  I think it is important that we are sensitive to their needs at this time.  As Minister for Health, however, I cannot comment on individual cases and so will address the House on the wider cardiology service issue, except to say that I expect all the proper procedures will take place with regard to the circumstances of this tragic death.  I believe that is important.</p><p>Last year, in line with a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, an independent review of the need for a second cath lab at UHW was undertaken by Dr. Niall Herity, a world-renowned cardiology expert.  The review concluded that the needs of the effective catchment population of UHW could be accommodated from a single cath lab.  However, the review also recommended increased investment to enhance cardiology services at the hospital and to provide an additional eight hours cath lab activity per week to address waiting times and provide improved access for patients.</p><p>At the time of the publication of the report, I committed to providing those additional resources to the hospital.  I did so.  The HSE national service plan 2017 subsequently identified the implementation of the recommendations of the Herity report as a priority and additional funding of &euro;500,000 was provided for the hospital.  I should also mention, as the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, alluded to, that the HSE issued a tender this week for a mobile cath lab that will contribute on an interim basis to a further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists in UHW.</p><p>I also committed to a further review to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab and this review will take place at the end of the deployment of the mobile lab.  I commit to keeping Oireachtas colleagues from Waterford and the region briefed on plans for that review.</p><p>With regard to emergency work at the hospital, I want to stress again that all decisions on how we configure our health services must be evidence-based.  I think everybody accepts that and I appreciate that.  Dr. Herity recommended that emergency work should cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work and to contribute to improved patient outcomes.  That was the finding of the independent review.  I believe it is fair to say that the organisation of primary PCI services is an issue for the whole country.  It relates to how we provide services to our whole population taking account of the best evidence available.  While we are discussing Waterford and the south east today, it is indeed an issue beyond just the south east.  I would point out that patients in Monaghan are transferred to Dublin for primary PCI and patients in parts of Kerry go to CUH.  Highly-specialised services such as primary PCI need to be carried out in a small number of hospitals around the country where the volume of patients supports the provision of a safe service.  Low-volume services do not facilitate the ongoing and sustainable achievement of the patient outcomes required.  That has been the long-held clinical view.</p><p>  Based upon this country&rsquo;s population, we can only operate a limited number of primary PCI centres in order to ensure that services achieve required standards and are sustainable.  Clinical staff cannot maintain their skills where volumes are insufficient and staff will not be attracted to work in units that do not facilitate them producing the outcomes expected.</p><p>I believe it is time for a full national review of primary PCI services.  Therefore, I have now asked my Department to make arrangements for this national review to be undertaken based upon independent clinical expertise and this will obviously include the south east of the country.  This review will seek to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24-7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  The review will therefore address the wider implications for all services and all parts of the country of Dr. Herity&rsquo;s view regarding primary PCI services and will come up with a plan for the achievement of the best patient outcomes possible.  Clinical safety is paramount as part of that review.</p><p>I want to repeat that extra investment is being provided to allow additional activity at the existing cath lab.  The mobile cath lab is confirmed for Waterford and is on the way.  There will be a further review of UHW's situation following the deployment of this mobile Iab.  I will consult with Waterford Oireachtas Members at that stage with regard to that review.  In addition to that, there will be a national review recognising the importance of access to PPCI services for all our citizens.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he has said that it is time for a full national review of primary PCI.  Unfortunately, since five o'clock this evening, the cath lab is closed in Waterford while we are here discussing it.  If another Thomas Power presents, we are still going to have the same issue.  I ask that there would be no interference from the HSE with regard to the terms of reference for this report.  Clearly, as the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, pointed out, there was interference the last time.  We all saw copies of the letter and the dictat issued.  That cannot happen again.</p><p>With regard to the extra investment, the Herrity report was published in September 2016.  I spoke to management in the hospital before I came here.  Not one extra hour has been put in place.  The hospital is only advertising for staff now.  Those extra eight hours would be very important but they need to be in place as soon as possible.  The only solution is a second catheterisation laboratory and I will be sticking to my guns on that.</p></speech>

His response worries me because he is saying that highly specialised services such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, need to be carried out in a small number of hospitals.  He said that low-volume services do not facilitate the ongoing and sustainable achievement of the patient outcomes required and that based upon this country's population, we can only operate a limited number of primary PCI centres.  We are being teed up again for a report that will again tell us the same thing.  That is what I am reading from this because I have seen the documentation.  I received it under a freedom of information request.  The HSE, the Department, the acute coronary syndrome programme and the South-South West hospital group were all saying the same thing, which is that the population of Waterford and its environs does not justify emergency PCI.  Unless the Minister accepts that this is regional and unless the terms of reference are very clear that this is about the south east and the population of the south east, which is what was in the Higgins report where a clear commitment was given that enhanced cardiology services and interventional cardiology for all 500,000 patients in the south east would be provided at University Hospital Waterford, it will be a tee up by officials in the Department and the HSE.  We have been sold pup after pup on this issue and enough is enough.  While the Minister says he will consult, unless he agrees today on the regional nature of this issue, it will go nowhere and we will continue to be sold down the river time and again.</p></speech>

Outside of the national review, there is a commitment to a review in the south east, which will cover all of the south east.  The last review did not cover all of the south east.  I take into consideration what Deputy Cullinane is saying but I ask Members from the south east to meet with the Minister and me as we sit down to decide the terms of reference for this review.  For the first time ever, Members of the Oireachtas from the south east will have a say in how this review will be conducted.  I am convinced that if the regions that were not taken into consideration in the first review - the consultants in Wexford, Tipperary and so on - and the catchment area whose inclusion we will have a say about are included, the catchment area alone will carry the review over the line, which did not happen the last time.  I had a fruitful meeting with the Minister.  We do not always get on and we have our differences but I think there has been a change.  Let us get Members of the Oireachtas from the south east and the Minister together and see whether we can push this review over the line.</p></speech>

The south-east region needs 24-7 cardiac care.  It has the population 500,000 people but it also has large populations in geographically isolated areas.  I mentioned Fethard-on-Sea in County Wexford.  Other areas include Ramsgrange, Kilmore Quay and Our Lady's Island.  They are highly populated areas with high numbers of tourists yet they are up to three hours away from Cork.  It is simply not acceptable to say to those people in the south of Wexford, Waterford, Carlow and Kilkenny that they must travel to Cork to get services to which everybody else in the country has access.  A region with 500,000 people should have 24-7 cardiac services in its top hospital.</p></speech>

That is not the case.  I referenced two examples - Monaghan where people must travel to Dublin and parts of Kerry where people have to travel to Cork.

It is the same position as that held by officials in Northern Ireland.  If Deputy Cullinane asks the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in in Northern Ireland, who was a good colleague and counterpart of mine as Minister of Health, he will discover that the same procedure applies in respect of primary PCI in Northern Ireland.  I would not like it to be interpreted as a view in the Department or the HSE.  This is a long-established view on the island of Ireland regarding access to primary PCI.</p>  <p>  Leaving that aside, I am committed to doing the four things.  The additional investment has been provided.  The point made by Deputy Mary Butler is valid.  Management now needs to get on with expending that investment and putting those additional hours in place.  The mobile catheterisation laboratory is on the way.  When both of those things are in place, it makes sense to have a further review to see what the additional impact of the extra hours is in terms of the number of people using the catheterisation laboratory.  I think this is logical.  At that point, I will engage with Members of the Oireachtas in the south east.  I genuinely welcome that engagement.</p>  <p>  The fourth thing I am doing is talking about a national review because there are parts of this country where we need to make sure the spread of our primary PCI structure is at an optimum level for all our citizens.  I have instructed my Department to commence that national review and will keep in touch with Members of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Countless coastal communities are living in a state of constant dread and unease as their coasts face an uncertain future.  I speak, of course, about the imposition of large-scale, poorly planned and in some instances, unsightly aquaculture developments.  The prospect of trestles and other cultivation equipment on beaches and scenic locations for proposed oyster farms has created much anxiety in areas where it is felt that should such developments get the go head, much harm would be done to the local marine environment and its lure as a natural amenity with potential consequences for tourism, recreation and the wider local economy.</p>  <p>  Communities in my county of Donegal have been left in limbo for months on end while controversial decisions about licence applications for oyster farms are still pending while decisions on appeal have still to be reached for others.  Let us take the example of Cruit Strand.  A period of public and statutory consultation into the licence application ended last October.  I had the honour of addressing locals there at that time.  We prepared the submissions.  The area is not supportive of the type of large-scale aquaculture planned for that area.  The local community is still waiting for a determination.  The consultation ended in October yet we are now facing into July.  This is in spite of the Department having received over 3,200 individual submissions from the local community regarding the development at Cruit Strand and the neighbouring strand.  There is a legitimate question here.  When is the community going to get a decision from the Department?  Not only has the Department not made a decision, it cannot tell the community when a decision is likely.  At scenic points such as Rann na Feirste, Rann na M&oacute;nagh, Cionn Caslach and Charraig Fhinn, places where natural beauty has acted as an inspiration for countless literary works, artists and musicians and to which people continue to flock each year, there are real concerns at plans to erect major oyster farms on its foreshore.</p><p> At Carrickfinn, permission was granted by the Department for the development of some 99 acres of pristine coast land at Braade Strand and Gaoth Dobhair Bay.  If the Minister of State has ever flown into Carrickfinn, he will know all about it.  It has been labelled the second best airport landing strip in the world.  The local community there is still waiting to hear the outcome of appeals lodged earlier this year.  My question to the Minister of State is simple and I speak on behalf of the thousands of people who have lodged applications.  I speak for those who are waiting day after day to find out if this Department and the process is going to allow for their pristine strand and bay to be ruined and scarred in this way.  Why are these communities, and countless more like them, forced to endure months of uncertainty while the Minister of State and his Department have sat on their hands?</p> <p> All we have to do is look at the recent report from the independent review group, which was set up by the Department itself.  It has criticised the length of time that determinations are taking.  It has found that the current public and statutory consultation process is hugely flawed, including the method of informing the public of planned developments.  None of what I have said should be taken or interpreted as saying that we are opposed to aquaculture or that aquaculture is a bad thing.  No-one is against that in principle.  However, people are against developments which are disproportionately large in both size and scale, which are scattered along the coast without any thought to the impact it would have on the local community, and what we in Sinn F&eacute;in have continually called for is that these developments only be granted where it is deemed to be sustainable and commensurate with the area and locality in which these activities are to be carried out.</p> <p> What action is the Minister of State going to take to protect these communities, particularly with regard to the licence applications at Ranafast and at Cruit, and appeals against Carrickfinn.  When are communities going to be taken out of limbo and told that these large-scale aquaculture developments will not go ahead on the Minister of State's watch?</p></speech>

My Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, the Foreshore Act 1933 and applicable EU legislation.  The process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.  In addition, my Department must adhere to a wide range of regulatory requirements and other legislation which impact on the licensing process.</p>  <p>  A key component of the aquaculture licensing process is a series of measures designed to address the impact of aquaculture on the environment.  This series is known as appropriate assessment, AA.  This process arose from a European Court of Justice, ECJ, case against Ireland in 2007.  The Court of Justice declared that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with the EU habitats directive in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive.  The EU habitats and birds directives have resulted in the designation of certain bays by the National Parks and Wildlife Service as special areas of conservation or special protection areas for birds, or both.  These are known as NATURA 2000 sites and most aquaculture takes place within them, or adjacent to them.  In the negotiations to address the ECJ judgement, the Department agreed a process with the European Commission and the National Parks and Wildlife Service which would govern the State&rsquo;s processing of aquaculture licence applications.  The AA process is managed in the main by the Marine Institute via environmental and scientific contractors commissioned by the Institute to carry out the necessary field work and desk analysis.  To date, the Marine Institute has submitted appropriate assessments on 24 bays to my Department.</p>  <p>  On the environmental impact assessment and screening process, all aquaculture licence applications must be either accompanied by an environmental impact statement, EIS, which is mandatory in the case of marine finfish cultivation or, in the case of shellfish cultivation, applications must be the subject of a detailed screening process with a view to determining whether an EIS is required.  The screening process is managed by a screening group comprised of officials from the Marine Institute, Bord lascaigh Mhara, my Department&rsquo;s marine engineering division and my Department&rsquo;s aquaculture and foreshore management division.  This group examines in detail the characteristics, location and potential environmental impact of each application.  The screening assessment process complies fully with applicable European regulations, requirements and guidance documents.  In addition, the ministerial decision arising from the screening process is published on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  On statutory and public consultation, the legislation specifically provides for periods of statutory and public consultation in respect of aquaculture licence applications, and I can assure the Deputy that all observations received - he mentioned 3,200 in the case of two bays in County Donegal - are considered by the Department.  Furthermore, any member of the public who wishes to appeal a ministerial decision may do so by submitting an appeal to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, which is an independent body established by statue.  An applicant can also avail of this appeal process.</p></speech>

The Department waived the requirement for an EIS in this application, which 3,200 people in the community expressed concern about.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is familiar with the community, and I know he is still new to the Department.  I am not sure if the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, before he issued the ministerial direction which waived the requirement for an EIS to be carried out on that large-scale development, ever set foot in that part of our country.  If he stood on the bridge on the way to Cruit and looked at where the trestles would go on and on, he would not have put pen to paper.  If he stood in Ranafast, in Rann na M&oacute;nagh, in Annagry and Carrickfinn and looked out at the bay at what 99 acres of aquaculture would look like, and then thought about the Wild Atlantic Way, the tourism, the culture and the beauty of that area, he would not have put pen to paper.  It has given the inspiration for so many of our literary works, which are studied by our children at school, and music which is enjoyed by people not only the length and breadth of this island, but also further afield.  That natural environment is where people and artists draw their inspiration from.  He would never have put pen to paper to waive this requirement if he had looked at the area.</p>  <p>  The Minister's own review has shown that the process is flawed.  I and my party, including our local councillors, Ms Marie Therese Gallagher and Mr. John Sheamuis O&rsquo;Fearraigh, put together a serious submission to that review.  Thankfully, certain parts of it have been upheld.  This process is flawed.  It is taking too long to make determinations.  We want two things.  We want the Government to fix the process, to speed up the level of determination, and we want it to ensure that those communities will not be scarred indefinitely as a result of an aquaculture licence which is too large in scale and in nature.</p>  <p>  I support many communities and many small entrepreneurs in securing aquaculture licences.  I believe that oyster farming is a good thing in size and scale.  These applications are way out of the norm and should be refused.</p></speech>

Some 385 submissions were received.  There are 30 recommendations which are being considered.  I cannot pre-empt what decision will be made, but the Department is currently considering that report.  With regard to the Kincasslagh and Gaoth Dobhair bays, I understand the Keadue Strand application has been withdrawn, so it is down to 1,700 to do with the Cruit Strand.  I cannot answer why the EIS by the Department was not sanctioned, but nonetheless, 1,700 submissions are being considered, and I expect that is part of the reason for the slowness of the process.</p><p>I would also agree, no more than with an An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeal for planning, that at some stage we must have a definite horizon set on appeals for everybody's sake.</p> <p> Some of the 385 submissions on the licensing review group were from the industry who would say it is too prescriptive.  In the previous D&aacute;il, I chaired a sub-committee where one of the areas seen as really having potential was appropriate aquaculture.  Given that so many of the bays and inlets being designated under Natura 2000 and the applications relating either to them or adjacent to them, everybody agrees a lot of care is needed.</p> <p> I would make one final point.  It is not indefinite.  Every structure, such as trellises, that is put in is removable and much more easily removed than a lot of other big infrastructure developments.</p> <p> The idea behind the licensing review group's work was to try and make this work more efficiently for everybody, the industry, the developers - if one wants to call them that - and the local communities, so that they work in harmony.  Consultation at any stage at the earliest possible point in any process is the key to it.</p></speech>

and<br /><br />- there may be no defects insurance policy available to pay for the repair works;- these problems have not been addressed by the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, as while the regulations provide for mandatory inspections by certifiers appointed by building owners-developers and which require a certificate of compliance with building regulations to be lodged with the local building control authority before a new building is opened, occupied or used and are changing the culture of construction regulation, they do not create new legal remedies for homeowners;<br /><br />- the Law Reform Commission has proposed appropriate legislation on several occasions to deal with many of these issues and there is also a commitment in Construction 2020 &lsquo;to consider and report on potential forms of redress for consumers and homeowners, including the potential for latent defects insurance&rsquo; and that redress must include new legal remedies; and<br /><br />- many housing defects have ultimately been rectified at the expense of the State, rather than those responsible for those defects; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to:<br /><br />- introduce new primary legislation to include a transmissible warranty of quality and assignment of causes of action in negligence from builders and those involved in the building process in favour of the first and subsequent purchasers of houses;<br /><br />- direct the carrying out of a feasibility exercise and business case for the creation of an Irish building authority, to which the functions of the existing building control authorities would be transferred, that would administer building control on a nationwide basis and that would provide a supervisory regulatory function in relation to those involved in the construction industry, including contractors, subcontractors and others involved in the construction process, as appropriate;<br /><br />- consider the development and use of alternative forms of contract for delivery of housing;<br /><br />- engage with the Law Society and the CIF to initiate a review of the standard form building agreement used for residential construction, to consider amendments to the agreement to facilitate consumer protection, including amendment of the dispute resolution provision, and removal of the restriction on transfer of the agreement on sale of the unit;<br /><br />- establish a consumer-friendly system of dispute resolution for homeowners dealing with defective housing;<br /><br />- amend the Statute of Limitations 1957 to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to building defects;<br /><br />- review and evaluate the resourcing of building control for local authorities, recognising that their role and objectives are quite different from the role and objectives of private building control certifiers who are appointed to protect the interests of building owners rather than the interests of the general public in ensuring compliance with the Building Control Acts; and<br /><br />- prepare and publish options for the financing and carrying out of remedial works to defective housing units, that will form the basis for a nationwide scheme, enshrined in legislation, for the orderly remediation of legacy defects in housing.</blockquote><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Chathaoirleach.

T&aacute; d&uacute;algas orainn cinnti&uacute; nach f&eacute;idir a leith&eacute;id a tharl&uacute; in &Eacute;irinn.</p><p>I am pleased to bring the motion before the D&aacute;il.  The Green Party has been working on it in conjunction with leading experts in this field in recent months.  We published it weeks before the horrendous tragedy in west London last week.  I offer my deepest sympathy to the families and friends of loved ones who were caught up and engulfed in the horrific fire that occurred last week in the land of our nearest neighbours.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.  Cuimhn&iacute;mid orthu.</p><p>The motion calls on the Government to properly tackle the sorry legacy of defects in housing construction and to strengthen building standards and regulations in order to safeguard against this building and regulatory failure ever recurring.  This and the previous Government have shown no political appetite or given no priority to dealing effectively with serious problems and issues arising from appalling construction quality of so many homes built during the boom-time era.  There has been a series of crises, including the well documented Priory Hall debacle and the high profile Longboat Quay shambles, as well as many other serious and varied problems that have emerged the length and breadth of the country, including in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown.</p><p>I appreciate that the newly appointed Minister is new to his brief.  However, his party and Government colleagues certainly are not.  In the past four years we have had four Ministers with responsibility for housing.  This shows the level of genuine intent and respect for the role of this ministry which is at the centre of the biggest crisis of our time.  That is an indicator of how this critical ministry has been treated in recent times.  It has become the revolving door ministry, with no continuity, no stability and no appropriate demonstration of the level of priority and real action the crisis clearly and urgently merits.  It is nearly six years since the Priory Hall development was found to be gravely defective, yet there are no new remedies or proper building standards.  Instead, we are still operating on a trust-the-builder basis.  Homeowners and prospective homeowners are expected to put their faith in builders without an independent regulator.  In case the Minister is unaware, he should know that people do not trust builders to self-regulate.</p><p>We are in the middle of a housing crisis and new homes are urgently needed, on which we are all in agreement.  However, we cannot sacrifice the safety of people in their homes to pacify the construction industry lobby.  Safety must be paramount in any and all construction.  There is a duty on the Government to protect its people against greed-driven building standards and incompetent rogue cowboy builders.  I emphasise that I am not saying all builders are incompetent.  They are not all rogues either, but a number of builders and developers have done an extraordinary disservice to the many genuine, decent, hard-working people involved in the industry.  This evening we have an opportunity to take the first concrete steps in stopping rogue builders in their tracks by introducing measures that, once and for all, would put individuals and families first and protect them against these chancers.  In essence, that is the priority.  We need to protect ordinary consumers who buy their dream family home in good faith.</p><p>In January I asked the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, how many times the issue of defective buildings had to rear its ugly head before the people affected by it had some level of certainty about the relief they could seek.  Many months later, the same people are still in limbo and uncertain about what assistance, legal or financial, the State can provide for them.  In his reply to me in this House in January the former Taoiseach also said he could not guarantee that there would be no more Priory Halls or Longboat Quays.  Kevin Hollingsworth of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland recently said that in the past three or four years he had remediated 29 developments for fire safety issues.  Not all of these find their way into the media spotlight and many of those involved feel compelled to suffer in silence.  They are suffering at the hands of a Government which they believe is not listening to their needs and does not have the hunger or appetite to make a real difference in their lives.  In case the Minister is in any doubt, he should know that some individuals and families, including some of those in the Visitors Gallery, are suffering immense and ongoing stress and incredible financial pressure as a result of the State granting builders a type of <i>carte blanche</i>, giving them a near free-for-all to do what they want.  Must these homeowners and the many others who have yet to learn how they will be affected by defective buildings forever be reliant on a Government which continues to act in an <i>ad hoc</i>wait and see manner?</p><p>Last week we heard the horrifying news of the fire at Grenfell Tower in London.  Our hearts are with the families of those who lost their lives, but our minds must be set on ensuring it does not happen here.  In response to the tragedy Chi Onwurah, MP, wrote in <i>The Guardian</i>last week that for her, the souls of the dead were in every sub-clause of every tranche of health and safety legislation.  Health and safety are matters of dull box checking and red tape at times, but they are also absolutely vital.  At issue is the homes of people.  This is a matter of public health and safety, but sometimes, ultimately, it can also be a matter of life or death.  In order to ensure safety - the most fundamental of protections - we need radical change in how we view and value buildings.  We need to act with a safety first attitude, not simply talk about it.  As Members of this House, we need to stand up, once and for all, to the construction industry and put people's lives first.</p><p>It was reported recently that the Construction Industry Federation was writing the new building control Bill.</p><p>While that report has been noted by the Department as being incorrect, it still does not help dissuade us of the picture of a Government which has been for far too long too close to the influential construction industry and too passive in its willingness to enforce high standards.  This is not something we would tolerate in the food industry, road safety or car safety, where people's health is at stake.  There is no reason to tolerate it when it comes to the standards and safeties at which we build people's homes.  Our housing is a public safety issue.  We need a regulator, like our food regulator, with specialised statutory powers to name and shame dodgy builders who put people's health and safety at serious risk, which is empowered to put things right.</p> <p> In order to do this, in the motion before the House today, the Green Party is calling on the Government to create a new, strong, independent building regulator.  We need a properly funded national building regulation office wherein such a building regulator will oversee national building control and actively and robustly regulate those involved in construction.  We need to stop systematic failures in building control happening again and again by ensuring that building standards are raised and that there is appropriate building control compliance in this country, including fully resourcing the new building regulator office with a real and effective enforcement agency.  We must provide protection and support for homeowners who discover serious latent defects in their homes by improving existing legal remedies.  This country has been plagued by cowboy developers and there is very little in the current building control regime safeguarding against and stopping it from happening again.  There is no comfort for the consumer.</p> <p> We cannot say that we have not been warned.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 put in place an assigned certifier system, but there are still huge problems with this.  As Orla Hegarty of UCD has said, a self-builder or developer is effectively appointing someone to police him- or herself, while the appointed person does not have to be independent of the process and has no legal powers.  As it stands, there is no guarantee that the assigned certifier must be independent of the developer.  In fact, he or she can still be an employee of the developer and have other close links to the developer he or she is certifying.  This set up fails to instill trust and confidence for ordinary consumers.  It totally undermines the concept of independent regulation and is not something we would accept in any other industry, particularly one in which people&rsquo;s lives could be put at risk.</p> <p> We need to look at the regulation of the construction industry in terms of risk management.  We need to put the resources in place for ongoing inspections from fire services and fire safety authorities, not just a fire safety certificate before one starts.  I welcome the new statutory regulations which will come into effect soon, requiring houses to be built in such a way as to prevent the spread of fire internally and externally and to have an adequate means of escape.  These regulations will also impose obligations on landlords to ensure that rented properties meet certain standards.  However, they must be accompanied by adequate resourcing of building control authorities for ensuring compliance and dealing effectively with breaches.  How can the Government promise building standards will be adhered to if it cannot promise that independent inspections will actually be carried out?  All the rules in the world do not matter if there is no credible threat of enforcement.  How can the Minister assure the public and promise there will be no dangerous shortcuts if he provides no enforcement?  The enforcement agency must have real teeth and not be regarded as a harmless pushover by builders.  How many convictions have there been under the Building Control Act since it was introduced in 1992?  The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, could not answer that when I submitted a parliamentary question.  Nobody seems to know and that is very alarming.  Worse still, many innocent people who are caught up in this storm, which is not of their making, believe that this Government does not care.</p> <p> Local authority reports are light on detail when it comes to enforcement by building control authorities.  Again, when I put a parliamentary question to the Minister's predecessor earlier this year I was told that his Department is not responsible for the oversight of building control authorities.  How can the Minister be sure of the strength of the enforcement of building regulations if he does not have oversight over the actions of building control authorities?  At this stage people quite reasonably wish to judge the Minister on deeds and not mere words alone.</p> <p> There are 31 building control authorities in this country but they are not compelled to produce an annual report.  A leading academic in this field, Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn, examined all 31 annual local authority reports for 2015.  There was very little reference to enforcement, never mind prosecution.  That is simply not good enough.  Effective building regulation requires an independent regulator and that is why many experts in this field agree with the Green Party&rsquo;s call for the establishment of an Irish building authority at arm&rsquo;s length from the vested interest of the construction industry.  There is compelling evidence in support of initiating step this evening.  To do otherwise, however the Minister may dress it up, would be a cop out, an abdication of responsibility.  I urge the Minister not to abandon the people of Ireland who may not have the deep, wealthy pockets of some developers, who suffered most but whose voice is least heard as they do not have easy and ready access to the powers that be in this country.</p> <p> Alongside this, it is vital that we do not lose sight of the goal of a real and lasting, long-term solution for residents, some whom are listening attentively to tonight's debate, who are the innocent victims of defective buildings.  What redress and tangible support do these hard working people have when major defects are discovered in their homes?  In many cases the builder has gone bust but our forgiving corporate insolvency laws allow such builders to return to the workforce.  They are given a fresh start, a second chance, a bright new day.  Regrettably, in the proposed general scheme of the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill 2017, these rogue builders will continue to get second chances as it is proposed that a builder who is struck off for a period of time may apply to be restored to the register on merely demonstrating compliance with registration criteria and payment of the standard fee.  It is not good enough.  In contrast, the contractor responsible for the Berkeley balcony collapse has had its licence revoked for five years.  Its managing director must pay the California Registration Board investigation fees of $99,000 before the licence can be granted and may still in due course face a custodial sentence.  There are no second chances for the individual citizen in Ireland, for ordinary consumers when major defects are discovered in their homes.  They do not enjoy such corporate protections.  They are abandoned.  How many times must this issue rear its ugly head before the people who are so adversely affected by it have some level of certainty about the relief they can seek?</p> <p> Simple first steps would include clarification from the Minister as to whether the Government is serious about offering tax reliefs for the undertaking of essential repair works.  Giving income tax relief in respect of the repair costs incurred together with a suspension of local property tax and VAT relief along the lines of the home renovation initiative are all practical, reasonable measures which can, if the political will exists, be implemented quickly in order ease the burden on residents.  Second, the Government should consider creating a loan fund for those who cannot pay.  Section 71 of the 1966 Housing Act has a model for how this can work, and this needs to be adapted and rolled out by local authorities to give assistance to homeowners.  In conjunction with the implementation of these measures, as is stated in this evening&rsquo;s Green Party motion, it is crucial that the Government introduce a transmissible warranty of quality from builders or developers in favour of all subsequent purchasers so that damages can be sought from the original developers, ensuring there can no longer be any place to run and no shelter or place to hide for rogue builders.</p> <p> An inexpensive, consumer friendly dispute resolution mechanism for homeowners should be established.  Landlords and tenants who find themselves in dispute in respect of a tenancy have easy access free of charge to the RTB dispute resolution service.</p><p>However, what resolution do home owners have facing into this unprecedented storm?  They have none.  </p> <p> In order to ensure the State will never again be taken as a soft touch it is crucial that increased resources must be pooled into this arm of local government with responsibility for robustly monitoring new builds and in order to be taken seriously a properly resourced enforcement agency must work in tandem with a supervisory division to ensure that inadequate building standards will not be tolerated.  </p> <p> Twenty five years of evidence tells us that leaving the construction industry to its own devices results in widespread dangerous breaches.  Will one of the Minister's first acts as Minister with responsibility for housing be to support this motion, to stand up to the construction industry and in doing so stand up for the health and safety of the people or will it be to cave in to vested interests, given them their way and allowing them to continue to put lives at risk?</p> <p> The tragic inferno in west London last week is a stark reminder that the overriding priority underpinning all construction must be the safety of residents.  In the rush to build the houses so urgently needed in this country we must ensure that this time we do it right and that all houses are built to an acceptable and safe standard.  The Members of this House have a duty to create a legislative framework to support all those who are living the nightmare of having had defects discovered in their homes and to prevent this happening to another generation of home owners.  I ask them to consider these home owners and what they are going through, to help them and to stop it from happening to another generation of home owners.</p></speech>

No. 9 of 2014) and accompanying Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, empowering competence and professionalism in the design, construction, inspection and certification of building works through statutory certificates;<br /><br />&mdash; the new Building Control Management System, which facilitates the electronic administration of building control functions and provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters, and which is subject to ongoing improvement to achieve further efficiencies;<br /><br />&mdash; the new Framework for Building Control Authorities, which standardises work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to oversight of building control activity across the sector, to enhance consistency of approach nationally, and to move towards a risk-based approach to inspections by building control authorities;<br /><br />&mdash; the development of training programmes for building control officers; <br /><br />&mdash; the significant changes and clarification in legislation for construction products on foot of the European Union Construction Products Regulation (No. 305/2011); and<br /><br />&mdash; recent developments in the construction insurance market, including the introduction of products which offer first-party insurance cover, for damage and non-damage related claims; and requests that continuing priority is attached to the completion of further important steps as part of the building control reform agenda, particularly:&mdash; building on the preparatory work undertaken as part of the local government reform programme, the creation of a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of the building control functions of local authorities, through a shared service in a lead local authority;<br /><br />&mdash; the completion of an evaluation of the adequacy of building control resources at local level.

It addresses an area of fundamental concern, one that has a direct impact on the daily life of every individual living in the State.  </p><p>I would like to place on the record of the House our sympathies to all of those who have been so tragically affected by the devastating fire which took place in Grenfell Tower in London last  week.  The fire has brought into sharp focus the paramount importance not just of appropriate fire safety measures, but also the importance of appropriate and robust building standards. </p><p>As Minister with responsibility for both, one of my first priorities upon taking up my new role was to take immediate action to ensure life safety for all citizens living in flats and apartments here in Ireland.  On Friday I met with Dublin&rsquo;s chief fire officer to discuss fire safety and life safety issues in light of the London tragedy.  I requested that the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management convene and assess the readiness of the fire authorities to respond to such emergencies.  They have since reported back positively that we can have confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies in this State.  I have requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review its multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems, and means of escape, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, are fully functional and in place.  I have also requested that the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, issue a notification to remind all landlords of their responsibilities and obligations in this regard.  Furthermore, I have been assured that the RTB is co-ordinating with local authority fire departments, and the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, to provide detailed information directly and individually to all landlords in the coming days.  The RTB has also placed notices to this effect on its website and in the press.  In order to remind builders, assigned certifiers, designers and owners of their obligations in relation to compliance with the building regulations, I have requested that a notification be issued to all registered building control management system users. There are approximately 57,000 registered on that system.  This process commenced late last week and has now been completed.  I will continue to keep all of these matters under review as we move to a follow-up phase of work in the coming weeks.</p><p>While I am sure many of the Deputies in this House can agree with the sentiments of the motion proposed, it fails completely to recognise the significant progress which has been made over recent years in reforming the building control system.  For this reason I have tabled a counter motion.  It is one thing to say &quot;do more&quot; or &quot;do differently&quot; &ndash; that we can debate, but it is another thing to say that we have done nothing when that is not the case.  This is an important debate but I would urge Deputies contributing to it to avoid certain rhetoric that flies in the face of the facts here in Ireland, and I would remind them of their duty of care in this regard - not to unnecessarily spread fear where it may not be necessary to be fearful.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are all too well aware of the many incidences of building failures or severe non-compliance concerns that have come to light over the past decade.  They exist in my own constituency, as I know they do in Deputy Martin's constituency.  The economic and personal consequences of these situations have been very significant and they are deeply distressing for the individuals involved.  </p><p>A reform programme has been advanced by my Department to strengthen the system by improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the building regulations.  It was through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, commonly known as BCARS, that key deficits in the regulatory regime were addressed.  These regulations brought a new degree of competence and professionalism to construction projects, and established a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner.  Since 2014, the owner must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works that he or she has commissioned.  They, in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.  The statutory certificate of compliance on completion signed by both a registered construction professional and the builder must be in place prior to occupation.  Given the significant financial and professional implications attaching to signature of a statutory certificate of compliance on completion, there was considerable industry resistance to these reforms when they were first proposed, but they were introduced and three years on, they have brought a new order to bear on construction projects. </p><p>I have often heard the current system of building control described as self-certification and I believe that this is a misnomer.  Prior to the 2014 reforms a builder was required to obtain only an opinion of compliance with building regulations.  However, the new regulations since 2014 now require the owner to assign a competent person to act as an assigned certifier in relation to individual projects.  This person must develop an inspection plan and ensure physical inspections of the building works are carried out at key stages to satisfy themselves that the works are in compliance with the building regulations.  The assigned certifier must be a registered construction professional, that is, an architect, a chartered engineer or a building surveyor.  They must demonstrate the basis for the certification of compliance with the building regulations through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates with the local building control authority, and this is done through the centralised building control management system.  This is far more than obtaining an opinion of compliance, which was the previous practice.</p><p><b></b>The Government largely agrees with the sentiment of the motion tabled that proposes a national office to improve the effectiveness of the oversight and governance of the building control system.  The national building control management system has been put in place to facilitate the electronic administration of building control functions and provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  A BCMS module is currently being developed to collect data at commencement about construction works.  This will position building control authorities to carry out the risk-based targeted inspections that the Deputy spoke of, delivering more efficient and effective use of available resources.  In regard to the building control management project, a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of building control has been developed as a shared service, and will be embedded in a lead local authority.  A competitive process to select the lead authority for this is about to commence.  This will facilitate increased risk-based inspection activity, improving consistency and promoting a culture of compliance in the building sector with a single unified national approach.  This approach effectively draws on the wealth of experience that has been accumulated by local building control authorities, achieving progress more rapidly than would be the case with the establishment of a whole new separate regulatory entity.  We do not need a new quango to do this work; we can use shared IT services, the new building control management system and designate a lead local authority to achieve what the Deputy wants to achieve in her motion.</p><p>The Government also very much agrees with the sentiment of the motion tabled that proposes a national building regulation office to regulate those involved in construction.  However, it must be recognised that the Building Control Act 2007 established a statutory system of registration for architects and surveyors and as recently as the end of last month the Government approved the general scheme of the building control (construction industry register) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist subcontractors.  This is an essential consumer protection measure which will give consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  It will also provide a forum for the investigation of complaints against registered members and the imposition of proportionate sanctions.  Public tolerance for incompetent workmanship has been well and truly exhausted and the construction industry register will complement the reforms already in place and those that are planned. </p><p>Much improvement has taken place but there is no room for complacency.  We need to ensure on an ongoing basis that the system provides the best possible protections for our people.  The Japanese use a word &quot;<i>kaizen</i>&quot; which means continuous improvement.  We must have this concept at the heart of what we do in terms of building standards.  The performance of our buildings is contingent on a strong and evolving building code in support of quality, safe construction and sustainable development.  There has been much debate in the media in regard to cladding in light of the tragic fire in London, and the public have very justifiable concerns in this regard.  Building regulations set out the requirements for fire safety and the use of proper products and materials, among other issues.</p><p>While it has yet to be definitively confirmed what type of cladding was used in the renovation of Grenfell Tower, the United Kingdom Department of Communities and Local Government has confirmed that cladding using a composite aluminium panel with a polyethylene core would be non-compliant with current building regulations guidance as this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18 m in height.  I can confirm that the same restrictions apply under Irish building regulations. </p> <p> In the interests of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, a review was undertaken by an independent fire safety expert to develop a framework for general application in such situations.  The report is currently under consideration &ndash; it was received by my Department in May &ndash; and subject to clarification on a number of issues, it is intended that the arrangements necessary for publication will be made at the earliest opportunity. </p> <p> In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials to accept their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected homeowners.  It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility or liability for all legacy issues of defective building materials or workmanship.  More than that though, it would not send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance and it might lead to unnecessary risk taking given the financial liability for any failures would be borne by the taxpayer.  Why remove this responsibility from builders and put it on taxpayers when builders have a responsibility and a liability which can be effectively policed and controlled?  </p> <p> The failures in construction of the past have arisen largely due to inadequate design, poor workmanship or the use of improper products or a combination of these factors.  The significant reforms that I have described this evening are aimed squarely at addressing all three of these issues.  While, as I indicated earlier, I can subscribe to the sentiments underlying the motion that has been tabled this evening by the Green Party, I believe that the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion provides a fuller reflection of the reforms that have taken place, those that are in train, and the programme of actions initiated specifically in response to last weeks&rsquo; most tragic events in London. </p> <p> I therefore commend the Government&rsquo;s amending motion to the House. </p></speech>

Before I came into the Chamber, I went on the websites for Cork City Council and Dublin City Council to see how much independent oversight is taking place on fire certification.  One of the frequently asked questions on the Cork City Council website is, "Will Cork City Council inspect the development when it is completed?".  The answer states: "The building control authority has the power to inspect and your building may be inspected for compliance with building regulation".  On the Dublin City Council website, to the question, "Will Dublin City Council inspect and certify my building when it is finished?", the answer is "No.  You should employ your fire safety consultant to oversee the fire-related issues of the works.  When the works are finished, you should request the certificate of compliance from your consultant".</p>  <p>  This is why we are here tonight.  We have to move from the current system of what is still self-certification and move to a robust, independent and rigorous inspection system that is controlled by the State.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il is in agreement with much of the reasoning behind this motion but we are placing an amendment which in my view places additional concrete measures - no pun intended - to ensuring an independent, robust and manageable building regulations system that homeowners and the State can have confidence in.  If our motion is unsuccessful I am pleased that we can support the original motion by the Green Party.  </p>  <p>  In the midst of the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State we, as legislators, may be forgiven for concentrating solely on urgent measures to rapidly increase supply at all levels from social housing, affordable housing to private rental homes.  However, it is essential that we learn the lessons from the previous housing bubble and the resulting financial crash.  It is essential that we ensure that the increased supply of housing that is so badly needed and indeed the existing housing stock, is of the highest possible standard.   A house, at the end of the day, is a home for people that should be built to last.  At the very least every home in this Republic should be certified as safe for habitation.  The tragedy in London just one week ago today is a too horrific reminder of the consequences of poor materials and insufficient fire safety controls in buildings.  I offer my deepest condolences to the families involved in the Grenfell Tower disaster.  Our thoughts and prayers are with those in London still coming to terms with the enormous loss of life.  </p>  <p>  We also need to be clear about what exactly we are talking about, so as not to be in anyway cynical about raising people&rsquo;s fears about building standards in Ireland for political motives.  Everyone here tonight wants the best standards and is working towards that end.  The standards that we in Ireland currently have in place for the construction of homes are high.  Fire safety standards and building regulations are of a high quality and are on a par with best practice internationally and this has been confirmed by many experts in this area both at committee evidence and in external expertise that I have sought for policy development in this area.  However, there is little point in having very high standards and comprehensive building regulations that can be pulled off a shelf every time there is an issue.</p>  <p>  What is needed is a robust, independent and rigorous inspection system that is controlled by the State and that enforces the regulations with serious penalties for breaches.  We all know about infamous developments such as Priory Hall where the standards and regulations did not matter because they were not enforced during construction.  There was no independent oversight.  That, combined with research that has identified that the fire inspection regime in place for the rental sector in Dublin City has an inspection rate of less than 10%, then one can clearly see the serious failings in the current inspection regime for that sector.  I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il will insist that we work purposefully towards an independent inspection regime of 100%.  This will take a sea change in current thinking by this Fine Gael Government when it comes to the State's role in the housing sector and one that I genuinely hope will happen.  I have been working with my Deputy Barry Cowen and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il in drafting legislation that will ensure an independent inspection regime that is fit for purpose and can be trusted.  That is what is needed here.  </p>  <p>  We are also concerned about the lack of inspections in the private and public rental sector and through our vacant housing bill we will clamp down on abuses that are occurring.  The current building control model, commonly known as the BCAR system, has fatal flaws.  The current inspection model during construction involves an inspector known as an assigned certifier.  This assigned certifier is a person that is employed by the builder or developer of the housing development.  It does not take a brain surgeon or public policy expert to see the potential conflict of interest that exists between the assigned certifier and the fact that the person who is paying the assigned certifier is the developer of the development in question.  </p>  <p>  Another flaw is the prosecution of serious breaches in the inspection of building regulations.  There must be severe and appropriate penalties on failures of inspectors.  Currently under section 1.9 each professional body investigates complaints against their own members for example architects investigate architects, chartered surveyors investigate surveyors.  This is self-regulation and not appropriate in our view.  The fact that no sanction has been brought against an architect or surveyor for the last six years is evidence of the failures inherent in the current BCAR regime.  What is required here is obvious.  Independent and professional distance between the inspection regime and the developer and builders who construct our homes.  There are plenty of international examples of such systems and the model that we in Fianna F&aacute;il will be proposing ticks all of those boxes.  In our view the most appropriate platform for delivering this independent building inspection regime is an approved certifier list which can be managed by the local authority that will provide the independent framework with Departmental guidance.  It will be the local authority and the State who will provide the steel that is needed for a robust inspection regime and it will be the State that will sanction and penalise any failings on behalf of the developer or the inspection system.  A centralised national building authority as proposed by the Green Party motion while not intentional, will further contribute to the over-centralisation of public services and a further reduction in the role of local government in our view.</p><p>Irish local authorities are the appropriate platform to deliver these services, considering the role they already play in planning and housing, their management of the current BCAR process, their direct connection to the Department and their expertise.  They also serve to deepen the institutional knowledge local government in Ireland needs to regain when it comes to delivery and management of quality housing for all our people.</p> <p> Over time, as this new system beds in and develops, there is massive potential for the local authority, qualified inspectors, builders and developers to learn from one another and work in partnership to ensure that the homes built in Ireland are safe, built to an exceptionally high standard and can be trusted as having been independently verified as such.  This new model of building regulations and controls will also serve to restore trust in the State's ability to oversee important areas of social policy on an ongoing basis.  As legislators, that is what we are here for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-06-21a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062100051#BBB00200"><p>I take this opportunity to congratulate both Ministers on their appointments and wish them well.  They have a huge task of work ahead of them and we look forward both to working with them and to holding them to account regarding the many challenges on the way.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he wanted to avoid rhetoric and spreading fear in this debate.  I accept the point he made.  Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and Beacon Court are three schemes that have captured national attention over the past number of years.  Thankfully, there has never been a fire in any of them.  I wish to talk to the Ministers about a place where there was a fire.  I refer to Newbridge, where six houses were absolutely gutted within 35 minutes.  On 31 March 2015, just over two years ago, the six houses in Millfield Manor estate in Newbridge - six of a complex of 90 houses - burned to the ground after flames spread rapidly from a fire started in one of the houses.  It transpired that there were no proper fire barriers between the houses.  There were improper and badly constructed internal walls, and this terrace of two-storey - not multistorey - homes was ablaze within 20 minutes.  The houses were gutted to the ground in 35 minutes.  I have a photograph of the aftermath of the fire here.  Thankfully, this happened during the day and there was only one resident present in the six houses.  If it had occurred during the night, I think it would have been a very different state of affairs.  Between 20 and 35 residents live in each of these blocks of six houses, and it is almost certain that if this had occurred during the night, very sadly, people would have died.  The present home owners live with that fear every single day.  Six households fled for their lives, with only the clothes on their backs.  Not any other scrap of clothing, not a stick of furniture, not a family photograph, not a children's toy survived this inferno.  All of the families' hopes and dreams went up in the flames, which I witnessed myself.  Their lives - not only the lives of the six families, but also those of all the residents living in Millfield - changed forever.  Every property owner in Millfield is an innocent party, having bought a property in good faith, relying on the provided certification and the processes they believed existed in the associated areas of planning and inspection.</p>  <p>  Newbridge, in a sign of the wonderful community it is, responded in a hugely compassionate way that night and in the days and weeks that followed.  Our local hotel, the Keadeen Hotel, immediately provided emergency accommodation for the families, and the community immediately got together and responded by offering clothes, toiletries, finance and indeed comfort.  Since then, on many occasions and at many meetings, I have sat with grown men who have cried and women who held their children close and were afraid to bring them to their homes.  These people are trapped in negative equity, do not feel safe or secure and are not able to sleep at night.  This fire continues to cause grave concern and huge stress, and there are significant legacy issues for the remaining inhabitants, whose houses and apartments are now under serious question as to their safety compliance standards.</p>  <p>  The various statutory bodies have offered no comfort or guidance to the remaining house owners, and they have many questions.  Some of these questions are as follows.  Is it safe to continue living in these houses or apartments?  It is not.  How is their insurance impacted by the perception that the structures were non-compliant with fire regulations?  Many can no longer get insurance cover.  What recourse do they have to the planning authorities?  Of course, there is none.  What responsibility does national government have?  To date, no responsibility has been shown.  What sanctions are open against the developer, who is now involved in NAMA and who just took shortcuts to make a quick buck, and the management company?  There have been none.  What can be done to restore equity to these houses that have become virtually unsellable since the fire?  Of course, nothing has happened in that regard.</p>  <p>  I do not think I have ever felt as frustrated or helpless as when I have had to tell my constituents living there that no financial or practical assistance is available for the installation of life-saving fire barriers.  They have been told this work could cost approximately &euro;35,000, which is simply unaffordable for them.  They are struggling to meet their mortgages as it is.  Those living there have been told no funding is available to bring their properties up to fire safety standards.  They are unable to sell the properties or get home insurance as these are fire-risk houses.  I appreciate that the Minister has only been in his position for a few days, but the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, has had a report about Millfield Manor sitting on his desk for 15 months.  This report needs to be released and a surveyor appointed to quantify the works required on a sample block of six homes in Millfield Manor and the best way to proceed.</p>  <p>  The residents of Millfield Manor have contacted me again in the past few days after the recent horrific and tragic fire in Grenfell Tower - in respect of which I offer my deepest sympathies to all involved - highlighting how unsafe they feel in their homes and their frustration with our failed building inspection systems.  Building standards must be reformed.  I commend Deputy Martin for tabling this motion as building control regulations are inadequate and protect neither home owners nor subsequent home purchasers against negligent developers.  It is incredible that despite numerous high-profile building failures, there have been no sanctions against architects or surveyors for complaints in the past six years.  It is clear that self-regulation of design and construction standards simply does not work and it is necessary for independent State authorities to check every new development to ensure it is compliant with building control regulations.  Our party's amendment includes provision for this.  We are all aware of the current housing shortage but, in our rush to build new homes, safety must be paramount and grossly defective building standards must be a thing of the past.  The fire in Millfield, Newbridge, has shown the consequences of failure to meet minimum compliance standards.  The fear experienced by Millfield residents and homeowners daily is a legacy that cannot be ignored.  We talk about safe and secure houses.  We must make that happen.  My party will table a different Bill to deal with the issue of non-compliance with fire safety and other building regulations.</p>  <p>  I will leave my last words to the committee that has been formed regarding Millfield Manor: "This is a life-and-death issue within our community, and we have encountered serious obstacles in the last two years in remedying construction failures due to lack of clarity on standards and the cost associated with such works."  I appeal to the Ministers to do something radical about Millfield and to support the motion with our amendment.</p></speech>

I also commend Deputy Catherine Martin and her party for tabling this motion, which is very opportune, considering what has happened in London in recent weeks.  The motion focuses our minds on how we adhere to our responsibilities to provide the best possible security and safety to those who reside in properties that obtain planning permission from local authorities and officers of the State.</p></speech>
