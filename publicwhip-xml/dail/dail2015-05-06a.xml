This question seeks to explore with the T&aacute;naiste what plans, if any, she has to extend access to social welfare benefits to the self-employed.  The question is posed against the background of all of us in this House wishing to see the indigenous sector develop.  We see access to welfare benefits as part of that necessary change.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600003#A00500"><p>Self-employed people pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4%.  This entitles them to benefits such as a State contributory pension and contributory widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension, contributory guardian's payment, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  A combined PRSI rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of employees, who can access the full range of social insurance benefits.  This comprises 4% PRSI payable by employees and 10.75% by their employer, or there is an 8.5% employer PRSI rate for weekly earnings under &euro;356.</p>  <p>  The most recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, published in 2012, stated that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees.  The review found that a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State contributory pension to the self-employed.  This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  In addition, self-employed people with insufficient means can access social assistance payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance, subject to satisfying the qualifying means criteria.</p><p> In June 2011, I established the advisory group on tax and social welfare to examine a number of specific issues including the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for the self-employed.  It reported back that during the three year period from 2009 to 20011 nine out of every ten self-employed people who claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance received payment.  Therefore, it was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  However, the group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long-term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard, the group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only.  </p> <p> At the time, some employers&rsquo; groups called for the provision of social insurance benefits to the self-employed on an optional basis.  This was addressed by the advisory group which considered that allowing people a facility to opt in or opt out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks.  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and, if necessary, cover is available.  Allowing people to opt in or opt out could result in a negation of the social solidarity contributory principles which underline the system.  Any changes in  the PRSI system for the self-employed would have to be considered in a budgetary context and, in particular, the funding position of additional entitlements.  There are very valuable additional entitlements offered in the advisory group report which I accept, but the issue for self-employed people, or for their organisations, was that it would involve an additional contribution which they did not seem inclined to favour at the time.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1054" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600004#B00200"><p>Any of us in responding to this issue accepts that for the system to work a realistic contribution has to be made.  As we look to the future and to the sort of economy we want to develop, we find we are all committed to developing indigenous small and medium sized enterprises.  We all accept that in order to do that successfully the safety net of a social welfare benefit system does two things, that is, secures a measure of social justice, to which the T&aacute;naiste has alluded, but it also goes a little bit further in that it helps to reduce the level of risk that entrepreneurs are taking.  We need people to take risks and we need to incentivise them to do so.  Notwithstanding the advice the T&aacute;naiste has received from the advisory group which she will take on board, if there are changes to be made I accept they would need to be made in a budgetary context.  Does the T&aacute;naiste envisage changes being made in the near future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600004#B00300"><p>I favour the report of the advisory committee.  We have spoken in recent times of social dialogue in regard to the relationships between the Government and different groups.  As the Deputy and I are aware, the numbers of people involved in self-employment, contracting and sub-contracting work and setting up their own companies, in particular younger people, has been on the increase for well over ten years as we move to a more entrepreneurial style model for many local Irish businesses.  Therefore, the prospect of self-employed people getting cover for invalidity and partial capacity benefit for an extra 1.5 percentage points would be very good value.  As has happened in other jurisdictions where benefits have been extended, that could be brought in over a period of time so as not to excessively impact in one year.  However, it would mean that self-employed people and the organisations representing them would have to examine this.</p><p>The regrettable part is that self-employed people or business owners whose businesses are very profitable can pay for private income continuance plans, while those who are just starting out or who are just about keeping their heads above water cannot.  The offer from the social insurance system is actually very valuable, a point that has been made by a number of Deputies from all sides of the House.  Now that the economy is in recovery, I would welcome consideration of this by self-employed people and their representatives.  If implemented, it would add very significantly to the cover available to self-employed people.  At present, if somebody suffers a very serious illness, he or she is entitled to disability or invalidity payments on a means-tested basis.  If the person pays an insurance contribution, there will be some cover.  I welcome the Deputy's comments on the necessity of funding the contributions appropriately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1054" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600005#C00200"><p>In alluding to the means test, does the T&aacute;naiste accept that, even as things are, there needs to be a communications campaign to make people's entitlements clear?  Often, people do not distinguish between jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance.  For some time, the Fianna F&aacute;il position has been that we would favour the introduction on a voluntary basis of a phased scheme whereby jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit would be payable to the self-employed.  We see that as part of our commitment to developing an entrepreneurial culture.  The idea that the self-employed could opt into such a scheme seems to us to be practical, although the T&aacute;naiste is suggesting that an opt-in would not be a positive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600005#C00300"><p>I am going on the advice of the advisory group, which researched the matter very deeply, and also on the actuarial reviews which show that, for the 4% contribution that self-employed people currently make, they get widow's and widower's pensions, contributory retirement benefits, maternity benefit and guardian's benefit.  Those are significant benefits for 4%.  Many self-employed people are relatively young - for example, in the area of contracting in IT.  For this reason, perhaps we should do a further campaign.  I would certainly be prepared to look at that.</p>  <p>  As regards opting in, all the studies say there has to be a contribution on a social solidarity basis, given the risk the social insurance fund and taxpayers have to cover.  If it is only on an opt-in basis, instead of getting the general population, we will tend, for obvious reasons, to get the more risky element of the self-employed population, which would mean it would be very difficult to fund.  Bearing in mind where we have come from in terms of our financial difficulties, and even before we had difficulties, the principle of social insurance and social solidarity has always been that people pay in and the general population are entitled to claim.</p>  <p>  In case any self-employed people are listening, I must point out that after I became Minister for Social Protection we changed the basis of assessment significantly.  Previously, people had to go to great lengths to get extensive information about their tax affairs and the performance of their businesses in earlier years, precisely when they might have been doing well.  Now, for the self-employed, farmers or fisherman, if there is a catastrophic loss of income, they can go to the local Intreo office and present the information on what has happened to cause the catastrophic loss of income, and we will take it on a current basis and examine the information.  This has helped many people, particularly those formerly employed in construction.</p></speech>

It is certainly a priority of the Government that people are not left behind.  The Government is anxious to facilitate the increased participation in employment of persons with a disability.  It is committed to removing barriers which prevent those persons from availing of employment opportunities and will work closely with disability representative organisations in this regard.  As part of this strategy, the Department will develop the Intreo service to provide specific jobseeker supports to people with disabilities.  This process has already commenced in ten pilot locations across the country for those who wish to avail of the service.  Engagement with the Intreo service by people with disabilities is on a voluntary basis.  The Department already manages a wide range of specific employment-related supports for people with disabilities.  These include the wage subsidy scheme for employers and the EmployAbility service.  EmployAbility participants are people with disability who are job ready and need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  For those in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit for at least six months and who feel they have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to develop its supports for persons with a disability to increasing their opportunities of participation in employment and is committed to removing barriers which prevent those persons from availing of employment opportunities.  The Government expects to publish in the near future a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600006#D00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply and I look forward to the long-awaited and overdue comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  I hope it will include proposals which are acceptable to those who have a disability and are trying to access work.  In Switzerland 80% of those who have a spinal cord injury return to work but in Ireland 80% of those with a spinal cord injury are unemployed.  I can provide other figures.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has stated that approximately 40,000 disability allowance recipients would like to be in paid employment but at present, only 1,500 people avail of the wage subsidy scheme the Minister of State mentioned while 3,0000 people avail of the EmployAbility service.  There is duplication in many cases.  This leaves a huge number of people who are not being supported in getting back to work.  A significant job of work for the Government and any future Government is not to have laudable policies but to see them implemented so this figure is changed.  What specifically will the Government do to reduce the significant number of 40,000 people with disabilities who want to go back to work but cannot do so because the supports are not in place at present?</p></speech>

I have been around the country and I have seen excellent services being provided by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>I recently visited the EmployAbility programme in Galway, which is successful in helping people with disabilities into work.  The partial capacity scheme, which was introduced by the T&aacute;naiste, assists people to take up employment where they are not in a position to go back to full-time work.  We are not waiting for the final report as we have the ten Intreo offices providing support and services to people with disabilities.  Over the coming months, I look forward to the cross-departmental report and to implementing the measures within it.  For people who find themselves unemployed, not just those with disabilities, it is important that no one is left behind unlike what happened in the 1990s and 2000s, where we had significant numbers of jobless households where no one worked.  I look forward to working with the Deputy on that point.  This includes people who are long-term unemployed and those with disabilities, who want to contribute.  We will do everything we can to assist them in making a contribution to society.</p></speech>

This is a declaration that in the past people with disabilities were left behind and were most marginalised during the boom.  They continue to be marginalised since and are demanding a fair crack of the whip in advance of a recovery and into a future boom period.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1193" speakername="Joan Collins" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600007#E00400"><p>This has arisen on a number of occasions in questions to the Minister of State.  The Minister of State cannot control the rent situation in Dublin or elsewhere but rents have increased by 31% since 2010, particularly in Dublin and the commuter belt in Kildare, where people have been forced out of Dublin city because of high rents.  Rents also affect people who do not receive rent supplement and who are paying the full lash.  Will the Minister of State consider reviewing and increasing the rent supplement?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600007#E00600"><p>Rent supplement continues to play a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 70,000 people this year at a cost of &euro;298 million.  Over 4,700 claims have been awarded in 2015, of which 1,380 were in Dublin.  There are also over 1,600 people in receipt of the new housing assistance payment.  This shows that landlords are engaging with the State private rented sector schemes and that people are being accommodated under these schemes.  The Department&rsquo;s recent review of the maximum rent limits found that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation and, in an already distressed market, affect rent supplement recipients, those on lower incomes and students.  The impact of increasing limits will yield only a marginal increase in available supply, if at all, with the certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available.</p><p>On a national basis, officers administering the rent supplement scheme continue to provide flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs.  The Department is also working with Threshold&rsquo;s tenancy sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where the shortage of accommodation is most acute.  The primary objective of these initiatives is to ensure a speedy intervention for families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy through rising rents. </p> <p> I am keeping this matter under review and am satisfied that this approach is the appropriate response at this time.  These measures have assisted more than 1,500 households, 900 of which are in Dublin city and county, to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent supplements.</p></speech>

I have the report, which states "553 tenancies were protected, including 462 who were in receipt of an uplift in payment in their rent supplement with the remaining 91 tenancies sustaining their tenancy, as a result of TPS advocacy work."  However, more and more families are losing their homes and more and more families are in crisis accommodation.  The Simon Community stated last week that as many as 3,500 adults and children could be in emergency accommodation by June.  This is still going on and people are still losing their homes.  More direct intervention is required.  Government could put a cap on the rent landlords can charge and link that to an increase in rent supplement to keep people in their homes even for three years.  Housing emergency legislation should be brought in.  We brought in financial emergency legislation, so why should we not bring in housing emergency legislation for three years to hold rents as they are and to ease people over the next period of time in which the Government is going to build the 1,500 houses, for which it claims it has the money?  These measures must all be interlinked.  There must be a review of rent supplement.  It cannot keep going the way it is.</p></speech>

An increase in rent allowance probably will not result in a single additional unit.  We are in the middle of a supply crisis.  There are not enough units around the country.  This is not just the case in Dublin.  I was recently talking to councillors in Clonmel about the issue.  There were only four three-bedroom houses up for rent in that town, which has a huge demand.  The increase in rent allowance would not bring an additional unit on the market, but would inflate rent levels in the area.  It is challenging.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, will bring proposals on rent certainty.  However, what we must do is to increase supply as quickly as possible.  Very little has been built since 2008 and with the increase in the number of people in employment, demand has increased further, especially in the Dublin area.  The focus must be on the provision of additional units.  I do not believe at this stage that an increase in rent allowance would give us a single unit in the Dublin area.  It would just create a false bottom for prices.  A number of people who have come onto rent allowance this year have succeeded in getting rental accommodation in the Dublin area.  I gave the numbers earlier, but I think it was 1,300 new claims.  It is extremely stressful.  I am sure Deputy Collins's clinic is like mine in that we deal with people in dire need of accommodation.  What we need to do is to supply that as quickly as possible through a building programme.  That is the way forward.</p></speech>

We will be facing this crisis of families losing their homes because of rent increases.  I would be delighted if the Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced rent certainty and capped rent at a certain level even for three years on an emergency basis and then looked at how people can be protected with regard to rent supplement to keep them in their homes for that time, depending on enough housing coming on stream.</p></speech>

A recent study by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice acknowledged that after housing and child care costs, one of the biggest challenges facing the family budget is to provide food.  We know that one in five children in Ireland go to bed hungry and one in six children go to school hungry, without having had their breakfast.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a plan to address that particular challenge?</p></reply>

It is for that reason that the Government has protected primary weekly rates of welfare since it came into office, notwithstanding the economic difficulties.  In 2013, welfare payments and other social transfers, excluding pensions, reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 38.4% to 15.2%, thereby lifting almost a quarter of the population out of relative income poverty.  Ireland is among the best performing EU member states in that regard.</p>  <p>  The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,600 schools and organisations, benefiting more than 205,000 children.  A total of &euro;39 million has been provided for the scheme in 2015, which is an increase of &euro;2 million on that provided in the previous year.</p>  <p>  A new European initiative, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, FEAD, now supports the provision of food and basic consumer products to people considered to be most at risk.  A total of almost &euro;27 million in funding is available over the period to 2020, of which 65% is for food.  I expect the programme will be operational during the third quarter of this year.</p>  <p>  Under its social inclusion initiative funding schemes, the Department supports Healthy Food for All, a national charitable organisation which works to increase access to and availability of affordable healthy food by groups of people on a low income.</p></speech>

It affects their health, educational attainment and their behaviour in school.  I welcome the increase in the budget for the school meals programme in the current year.  That needs to be continued.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste also accept that there perhaps needs to be a restructuring of the school meals programme?  As I understand it, at present approximately 14% of the funding goes to breakfast clubs with the balance of the funding being spent on lunches, but studies have clearly indicated that the best outcomes for children come from having a substantial breakfast made available to them at the start of the day.  That is one of the things that is not happening because of the manner in which the school meals programme is organised.</p><p>Would the Minister agree that there must be an urgent restructuring of the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600010#H00200"><p>The Department spends &euro;39 million per year on the school meals programme.  I have been a strong supporter of the programme as well as the Healthy Food for All initiative, which is about all of us, including schoolchildren and their parents, learning about healthy food and how to eat healthily.  One of the issues with food is that sometimes a great deal of money might be spent on it, but the food might not be as nutritious as it could be.</p>  <p>  I am a strong supporter of the breakfast clubs, and I welcome the Deputy's remarks.  However, much depends on the school.  The breakfast clubs and the school meals programme are available to all schools designated as DEIS schools in urban or rural areas.  Interestingly, not all of the schools apply.  Over the last couple of years we have been in constant contact with the schools to advertise the fact that this is available.</p>  <p>  The other issue relates to the number of children.  This year we increased child benefit by &euro;5 to &euro;135 per month.  If a family is on social welfare it would also get almost &euro;30 per week per child.  In other words, for a family relying on a social welfare income, there is, in effect, approximately &euro;65 per week per child, not counting other payments the family may receive.  However, I agree with the Deputy and I would like if more schools availed of the breakfast clubs, but that is a choice for the schools.  Not all schools open early in the morning.  I have been talking about this to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  To get a breakfast club the school must facilitate being open half an hour or an hour earlier.  We also employ people, through different programmes, to assist with the school meals programme and they do a fantastic job.  I would be delighted if more school principals and boards of management were to avail of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The lunches that are provided are quite good but if a child has left the house without eating properly, it has an impact in terms of energy if their first meal is somewhat later.  I have visited many school meals programmes throughout the country.  Principals are enormously sensitive to identifying children who might have left home without getting a proper breakfast.</p></speech>

The Minister is missing my point.  The meals programme is structured to incentivise schools to provide the lunch, because the greater subsidy is available for the lunch.  There must be some reconfiguration of the system to incentivise the schools to provide the breakfast.  It is the provision of the breakfast that is of greatest benefit to the children and ultimately to the operation of the school.  I plead with the Minister to examine that critically, look at what is happening across the country, encourage principals and boards of management to make the transition from lunch to breakfast and ensure that the system is organised to make it expedient for them to provide the breakfast.</p></speech>

However, in many cases, not every child in the school will want or need a breakfast because, for the most part, they will have eaten a good, nourishing breakfast at home with their family.  The reason for the emphasis on lunch is that by lunchtime, when the children still have another couple of hours in school, they need food.</p><p>Perhaps we should agree to move to both breakfast and lunch being provided in school where appropriate.  Not every child may require a breakfast - it varies - but the option should be there, particularly for those children who most need it.  Other children might choose to join breakfast clubs.  I have seen principals who have done this extremely well.  If a school's starting time is 9 a.m., its principal is required to be on the premises to start the breakfast at approximately 8.30 a.m.  The other reason I am an extremely strong advocate of breakfast clubs is that it is a very nice social time for the children to sit down, get their breakfast and have a chat with their friends before the start of the school day.  Not all boards of management are in agreement.  Certainly, I would like to move to a situation where both options are available.  It should not be a case of one or the other.  In a tight funding situation, we have prioritised funding for the school meals programmes.  I anticipate being able to improve what is on offer.  It requires the permission of the board and of the principal.</p></speech>

JobPath companies will engage approximately 1,000 staff to provide services for up to 400,000 jobseekers over a four-year period.  Following the completion of a public procurement process, two companies were selected to provide JobPath - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The procurement process and the selection of the successful companies had specific regard to international experience of contracted out employment services.  An Irish model was designed from this.  The companies will deliver services directly and will engage a range of local subcontractors, including local training companies and local employment service providers.</p>  <p>  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath, including a service guarantee to ensure all participants receive a baseline level of service.  Penalties will be imposed on the companies if service performance or quality does not meet the set standard.  Most significantly, JobPath uses a payment-by-results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  JobPath is so structured that the companies cannot recover their costs or make any profits unless and until they get people into sustainable jobs.  These jobs must be for at least 30 hours per week.  The rates paid to contractors are also linked to the performance of the wider economy.  Automatic discounts or reductions in payments to contractors apply if employment growth exceeds our medium-term forecasts.  In addition, both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits to ensure JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.</p></speech>

If that figure is achieved at an earlier stage, will that result in the termination of the JobPath programme?</p><p>The Minister also mentioned that the jobs they will be placed in need to be for at least 30 hours per week, but there is no minimum pay rate apart from the minimum wage.  Given that these are workers, is it expected that - in contrast what happened in Britain, where most of those placed were put in the lowest-paid jobs available, with no view to long-term sustainability - they will benefit from the payment for the private company that wins the contract?</p> <p> There is a programme within the Department of Social Protection, which I have lauded, of retraining workers in the former Department of Social Protection offices, now called Intreo offices, to deliver what the Minister is employing private companies to do.  What will happen to those workers if the targets I expect she has set out for those companies are achieved?</p></speech>

The existing services of the Department are not sufficient to get as many as possible of those people back to work.  Our very valuable case officers, activation officers and other officials of the Department of Social Protection will remain employed because the ratio of case officers to unemployed people is much lower than is the case internationally.  They will be very busy, as are people who work in the local employment service, LES, and other local services that help people into employment and provide services to the Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the United Kingdom a couple of times.  I think he is aware that in general the Irish and UK models of social welfare have diverged very widely in recent years.  The Irish JobPath model was designed following a review of contracting parties internationally, including in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany, Sweden, France, the UK, and, in particular, Australia.  The Irish model, I am happy to say, will now be partially adopted by the Australians based on the work we have done, and a range of national and international experts are assisting in implementing a system under which people are supported in finding a job and getting back to work.  That is what it is all about.  It is overseen by people such as John Sweeney of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and is composed of a social partnership involving unions, the Government, employers and civil society, including Professor Philip O&rsquo;Connell of University College Dublin, Aed&iacute;n Doris from NUI Maynooth, and John Martin, the former director of employment, labour and social affairs at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD.  The Deputy is obviously an expert on the English and Northern Ireland model, but our social welfare system is very different.  I know the Deputy probably favours it, but I do not.</p></speech>

In the past, it was found that some of the companies, including one engaged by the Department of Social Protection, have appeared before the House of Commons committees that deal with wholesale fraud.  What are the standards and punishments for any company awarded a four-year tender by the Government to deliver a public service?  Will the Government end a company's tender if it is found to be engaged in wholesale fraud, as happened in Great Britain?  Examples of such fraud have included forging documents and signatures of participants in a scheme similar to that spoken about by the Minister.  In such instances, disabled people were called "lying, thieving bastards" by one of the companies with which the Minister hopes to have working links.  What steps will she take to ensure that what happened in Great Britain does not happen here and that if it does happen, the contract ends?  </p></speech>

A significant number of people are working in the Department and a number of companies like the local employment services are working with us.  Those resources are not sufficient to help all those who want to go back to work to get back to work.  We have looked at best practice around the world to see how we get the best value.  We have looked at countries like Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia to see how we get a system that works to the benefit of people who are unemployed and gets them back into work for at least 30 hours per week.  The companies do not get payments unless they get results.</p>  <p>  In his ignorance, the Deputy talks about people with a disability.  This has nothing to do with people with a disability.  It relates to people who are unemployed.  Our system is an IT-based system.  We have had a look at different schemes around the world.  My understanding is that during the period in Great Britain referred to by the Deputy, the system was paper-based and was unable to track.  We also have a feedback system from the people who are our clients and who participate in any of these programmes.  This feedback system is very important to us.  Our IT system is designed to tell us when somebody gets a job because if they get a job, they will, of course, appear in the Revenue Commissioners' data as being at work because they will have a commencement notice with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of starting work.  We actually have a very elaborate system of verifying what the companies are doing.</p><p>If the companies do not produce results that are positive for our customers they will not be paid.</p></speech>

One of the conditions of the child benefit scheme is that children up to the age of 16 must receive an appropriate education.  However, there is no link-up in this regard between the Department of Social Protection and the education welfare officers who are in charge of school attendance.  Can we break down the silo thinking and instead have joined-up thinking across the two Departments so that where children are missing from school this is linked with child benefit payments?</p></reply>

It is a universal payment paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years, or to the age of 18 if the child is in full-time education or has a disability.  It is paid to more than 615,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, at a cost of &euro;1.9 billion.  It is one of the biggest payments in our social welfare system.</p>  <p>  School attendance up to the age of 16 years is a statutory requirement under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  Consequently, all recipients of child benefit are legally required to attend school up to this age.  There is a national monitoring system for statutory school attendance via the National Educational Welfare Board, which is now part of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Policy responsibility for school attendance rests with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p>  <p>  For children over 16 years and less than 18 years, continued payment of child benefit is dependent on the children attending school for these two years.  Parents with children aged 16 and 17 years must, in respect of these two years, return to the Department of Social Protection on an annual basis a form confirming school attendance, signed by the principal of the school.  If the Deputy has specific concerns about school absenteeism, the competent authorities to address these are the National Educational Welfare Board and Child and Family Agency.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the existing steps that require children in receipt of child benefit to attend school up to 16 or 18 years of age, under both education and social protection policies.  As I said, parents of children aged 16 and 17 years must provide confirmation from their school principal that the children are in attendance at school.</p></speech>

Almost 1,500 children left primary school last year and never turned up in secondary school.  We are storing up a very serious social problem for the future.  The Department of Social Protection will have to foot the bill for these people when they come out of the education system.  Today I am asking the T&aacute;naiste, as I have done on numerous other occasions, if, rather than stating that this is not her problem but is a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, she will ensure that the IT system of the Department of Social Protection is linked with that of the National Education Welfare Board.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, it is a condition of the child benefit scheme that children receive an appropriate education up to the age of 16 years.  The Department of Social Protection issues more than 600,000 letters annually asking parents to verify that children are in the country.  All I am asking is that the two systems be linked so that where children are not attending school parents are issued with a notification indicating that if their children do not continue to attend school their child benefit payment will be under threat.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that school attendance is not the province of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>I politely suggest to the Deputy that this question would probably be more appropriately taken up with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p> As Deputy Naughten pointed out, the Minister for Education and Skills and that Department have a series of policies designed to monitor, report and assess attendance at school and a series of programmes to improve school completion rates in both primary and secondary schools.  The Deputy will know that the country has progressed enormously in that respect.  I share his concern that every child should attend school, but I am not clear as to why he would suggest that it become the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection rather than the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills.  The welfare element is dealt with in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In many cases where children do not attend school there may be welfare issues or family issues, but that is not within the remit of my Department.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is the deputy leader of this Government and she is washing her hands of this issue.  All I ask is that she link up the two IT systems so that where a child has, without good reason, missed school for 20 days, she can enforce the law under the child benefit scheme, under which a child must receive an appropriate education, by issuing a notification to the parent that if the child does not attend school his or her child benefit will be jeopardised.  It would make far more sense to send such letters than to send out 650,000 letters a year asking parents to verify that their children are in the country.  That is enough to wallpaper the pitch at Croke Park two and a half times.</p>  <p>  The reason I bring this issue to the Minister's attention is that teachers the length and breadth of the country have told me that some parents lack the motivation to ensure that their children attend school.  I have given the Minister examples of instances in which a threat to the payment of child benefit has motivated parents to ensure that their children attend school.  Even if it gives one child a chance, is it not worth doing?</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is in effect suggesting that a family which may already be on a low income or experiencing unemployment should have its child benefit removed-----</p></speech>

I refer to the small number of children who for some reason may not have had a proper breakfast before leaving home.  Several agencies and the Department of Education and Skills are dealing with those issues.  The Deputy is correct in his concern for the children, but I am not sure that his solution, which is baldly to eliminate part of the family's income, is the appropriate solution-----</p></speech>

Expenditure on this scheme is estimated at &euro;607 million in 2015 with almost 70,000 recipients.  The problem is that despite a major investment in the past in respect of lone parents and their children, lone parents remain particularly at risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The first phase of the one-parent family payment scheme age change reforms will take place this July, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a one-parent family payment recipient's payment ceases will be seven years of age.  Approximately 29,400 lone parents will transition from the scheme at that date.  Then, if the child is between the age of seven and 14 years, lone parents will transfer to a jobseeker's transitional payment.  They will get exactly the same amount of money, but all our services in education, training, work experience and community participation will become available if the lone parents want to take them up.  We will be talking to them to encourage them, where appropriate, to take it up.</p>  <p>  That is why lone parents are being provided, when their youngest child is seven years of age, with intensive support from the Department.  They will be supported to produce a personal development plan through one-to-one meetings with case officers.  They will have enhanced access to education, training and employment supports.  For example, if they take up employment, they will have the back-to-work family dividend and their employer will have the option of JobsPlus.  The back-to-work family dividend will give them an additional &euro;30 per week in addition to the family income supplement - a significant payment - if they get employment in excess of 19.5 hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600016#O00300"><p>I note the T&aacute;naiste referred to intensive support for lone parents.  In 2012 with a similar line she said that this cut would not go ahead unless she got a credible and bankable commitment on investment in a system of child care and that if this was not forthcoming, it would not proceed.  The T&aacute;naiste would have to admit that such an investment in child care has not taken place.  The result is that we have a back to work family dividend, which is &euro;120 over the course of a month, while the average monthly cost of child care is &euro;659, a cost that is simply unachievable for many.</p>  <p>  This is the point about the idea of a specific payment for lone parents.  We need to treat lone parents and the specific problems they have in terms of child care in a particular way as opposed to lumping them in with all others who are unemployed.  In particular, I call on the T&aacute;naiste to comment on those who are currently in part-time work and who would have been able to avail of the payment in advance of the threshold dropping to &euro;90.  That has meant a cut for some poorly-paid lone parents of approximately &euro;200.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600016#O00400"><p>Currently there are lone parents throughout the country calling into their local Intreo offices, which are provided by the Department of Social Protection, and looking at how they can significantly increase their income.  In particular, if they move to 19.5 hours or more they will qualify for the family income supplement which, depending on the number of children they have, is an extremely attractive payment, for which we have very significantly increased the funding.</p><p>That is important.</p> <p> I notice the Deputy did not deny that, notwithstanding the amount of money the State pays to help give lone parents an income, there is a problem with lone parents being at risk of poverty.  Over an extended period of time, our social welfare system anticipated that many lone parents, having had a child or children in their 20s, would stay on social welfare for up to 22 years in respect of each child.  What we are doing now is offering lone parents a very specific opportunity, when their youngest child is between seven and 14 years of age, to get enhanced support, particularly in regard to education and training but also in regard to going back into employment, if that is a possibility for them.  Some 17,000 lone parents have transited up to now and the feedback and the experience is extremely positive, unlike what the Deputy is suggesting.  At the end of the day, the best way out of poverty is to get a qualification, because people who have qualifications tend to get better paid jobs, and then to get employment, because being in employment is generally significantly better than having an income that is entirely made up of social welfare only.</p></speech>

They have the highest deprivation rate at 63% and the highest consistent poverty rate at 23%.  That is partly as a result of successive cuts by this Government and previous Governments, including cuts to child benefit, rent allowance and maternity allowance.  The answer to this poverty, however, is not more cuts and more attacks, which is what the Government is proposing.  It follows a Thatcherite logic that says the way to get people out to work is to say they will be cut unless they go to do it.  The logic is that those who do not go onto transitional allowance but go onto regular jobseeker's allowance, and whose youngest child is over 13, can now be faced with a situation where, if they refuse, for example, to engage in JobBridge or in Gateway, which would cost them huge amounts of money in terms of child care but yield them very little in terms of income, they can face a penalty rate cut in their social welfare.  Is that not the case?</p>  <p>  With regard to the evidence, I would take the evidence of the group One Family, which says that of the 95,000 parents in receipt of the one-parent family payment when reform was announced, none has benefited from the reform, approximately 10% are worse off financially as a direct result of being activated and all are worse off due to the cuts.  The calls total to One Family's "Ask One Family" helpline is approaching an increase of 50% in the past 15 months.  Is that a success?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that is true for them and their children.  My objective is to end that situation for lone parents and to move them out of the category of being at risk of poverty, and particularly to remove their children from that risk.  This will be achieved by first giving them opportunities in regard to education, training and qualification so that, when they do take up employment, whether full-time or part-time, particularly when their children are over 14 and settled in school, they will then be in a position to earn an income that can support them and their children.</p>  <p>  The irony is that during the Celtic tiger years, when this country was doing very well and we pretty much had full employment, unfortunately, because our social welfare system seemed to require people to stay on social welfare for up to 22 years for each child, as the Deputy is suggesting, the result was that we had more lone parents and their children at risk of poverty than we do now.  We are now going to put a significant additional amount of public funding from our taxes and PRSI into, for example, the back to work family dividend, where if a lone parent does take up employment he or she will get to keep all of the child welfare payments of up to &euro;30 a week that they receive in respect of each child for a year, and 50% for the next year.</p></speech>

I do not think we have adequately dealt with the under-16s or the 16 to 18 year olds and how they are recognised.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has called for this and has said there should be more leniency on this issue.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014 is to provide that a person&rsquo;s preferred gender will be fully recognised by the State for all purposes.  This is a significant step and one which requires that the applicant is sufficiently mature to understand the implications of securing such formal legal recognition.  The provisions contained in the Bill in regard to transgender children have been arrived at following extensive consideration of the issues involved, including pre-legislative scrutiny by the joint Oireachtas committee.  They reflect the requirement on the State to legislate to protect the best interests of all children.</p>  <p>  The provisions in the Bill to provide for the granting of a gender recognition certificate to a person aged between 16 and 18 go beyond what is available in most countries currently.  I have also brought forward an amendment to the Bill which provides for a formal review of its provisions after two years.  As I have already said in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, and have made clear at every stage, that review is not just a tick-box process.  This is one of the very positive suggestions made in the Seanad.  It is such a sensitive Bill that it should be reviewed within two years.  The appropriateness of the measures contained in regard to children, and the specific safeguards in place in regard to 16 and 17 year olds, will be assessed under that review.</p>  <p>  Separately, I am pleased that my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, has committed to taking steps, in consultation with the transgender community and other stakeholders within the education system, to explore the policy options available to address the needs of transgender children within the school system.</p></reply>

The fact a 16 to 18 year old has to get two medical consultants, convince his or her parents and go before a judge before getting a certificate is too onerous, and we should seriously look at accepting the self-certification of 16 to 18 year olds.  The fact those under 16 are not even recognised means they are going to be a hidden group of young children who have no opportunity to be recognised, even where their parents recognise they are transgender and would like to get a certificate for them, or even a half-way passport or something of that nature.</p>  <p>  If they are not recognised, they do not get services.  What if a transgender child is in State care?  How does a person looking after that child deal with the issues the child has in regard to their gender?  If the services are not being matched with recognition, they are not going to be really adjusted.  It is the same with regard to disability.</p><p>When a disability was legally recognised, the Government then had to link in services for the group of people who needed them.</p></speech>

It is a very sensitive matter.  As the Deputy made her contribution, several contributions were made in the Seanad on this matter.  That shows there is a lack of in-depth research on this area.  One country has recently reviewed its policies and while it has self-certification, it has not allowed anything for those under 18 years of age.  In contrast, we have a very limited process for those aged under 16 years.  </p>  <p>  It is very important that we continue the engagement on this issue once the Bill has been passed.  There has to be an ongoing debate and discussion because this does not just concern birth certificates.  Rather, it is about how transgender people and children are dealt with at all stages of their development.  It goes far beyond the right to a birth certificate and how we treat and interact with our citizens.  </p>  <p>  We have gained a better understanding of the issue since the Bill came before the House.   The Government and I have approached the issue with openness in listening to the concerns of different groups and taking the views on board.  The two year review is significant and we have put it on hold because we listened to other contributions in the House over two sessions.  </p>  <p>  I am looking forward to dealing with Committee Stage.  There is an onus and responsibility on us to try to make sure that the Bill is passed this year under the current Administration, and I and the T&aacute;naiste are committed to getting the Bill through as soon as possible.  I thank the Deputy for her contribution.</p></speech>

Subject to the ongoing consultation, I would hope to deal with Committee Stage as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  I have met almost everybody who has requested a meeting.  I have had ongoing meetings with TENI and, as soon as I have finished discussions with the Royal College of Physicians, I intend to consult it again.  I have also met parents.  It is an extremely sensitive issue and everybody in this House is trying to do their best to do the right thing as much as possible.  We may not always agree on this, but we have a responsibility to make sure that we do our utmost to protect children.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy has seen my efforts in this House to go as far as I can.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad have been extremely open in regard to the Bill.  There is an onus and responsibility on us to get legislation on the Statute Book this year and then carry out the review in a very consultative and informative way.</p></speech>

It primarily provides services to elderly people in County Clare.  There are equivalent hospitals in Limerick and Newcastle West, St. Ita's and St. Camillus's, respectively.  I raised the issue with the Health Service Executive, HSE, when I found out about it and I was told there had been an incidence of mumps and on that basis one member of staff had to stop working temporarily lest he or she transmit it to patients.</p>  <p>  I understand the term "cohort" was used.  The HSE used many different words and assigned new meanings to words.  I was told patients would have to be moved around the hospital, but there would be no reduction in services.  A week later I visited the hospital and there was a padlock on the rehabilitation unit.  Most of the patients had been moved to other units which were, to my non-informed eye, grossly overcrowded.  Staff morale was low.  It is entirely unacceptable that this happened in a week when the Government suspended the business of the D&aacute;il for three days to congratulate itself on having saved the country, if not the world.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that the country was in a very difficult financial situation and one cannot be in such a situation without a loss in services.  As we are now coming out of that and the country's finances are improving, various tax cuts are being discussed.  However, our services need to be addressed.  I am not raising this issue in the D&aacute;il to criticise the HSE or the director of nursing for the decision taken because I assume she took the only decision available to her, namely, to close the particular ward for reasons of patient safety.  There simply are not enough staff on duty in St. Joseph's to keep the ward open.  I speak as somebody who has had a family member in that ward in the past 12 months.  </p>  <p>  I know the service that is provided there and how essential rehabilitation is to people, in particular the elderly who have had accidents.  The service is indispensable to their progress and their ability to leave acute hospitals and return to their homes.  The patients have been dispersed to other wards and are now in with long stay patients and people who are in receipt of respite care.  It is having an impact across the hospital.</p><p>The fact that it is closed at present is unacceptable, as are the nature and timing of the closure.  It is not good enough in 2015 to announce one morning that a ward is to be temporarily closed, transfer the patients to other units and put a padlock on the door.  Even now, nobody can say for sure when it is going to reopen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600019#R00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.  Short-term beds, including rehabilitation beds, contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care or postponing admission to long stay residential care.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis.  St. Joseph's is registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The hospital has a total potential capacity of 142 beds.  This includes four separate residential units, a day hospital and a short stay rehabilitation unit.  The rehabilitation unit comprises 22 beds which are consultant led.  The occupancy levels of the unit are variable and quite often there are vacancies.  As of 30 April the occupancy of the rehabilitation unit was 14 patients.</p>  <p>  In recent days, in addition to the routine staffing pressures and limited agency availability, the HSE was presented with a significant additional staffing challenge at St. Joseph's.  Unfortunately this has resulted in a number of staff being unavailable for duty in the short-term.  As a result of this development, the director of nursing decided to temporarily move the 14 patients from the rehabilitation unit to other long stay units in St. Joseph's Hospital.  The patients will continue to receive their rehabilitation in these units.  This move will assist in providing appropriate levels of care to them, particularly at night.  It is important to stress that this is not a closure of the rehabilitation unit but only a temporary measure for the shortest period of time possible which will not affect the patients receiving their rehabilitation care.  The HSE expects the situation to be resolved within the next fortnight.  It will continue to monitor and review the situation and any decisions made will be to ensure the best possible care for all of the residents currently in the facility.</p>  <p>  The House will be aware that the management of resources and service planning is a matter for the HSE in the first instance.  Quality care and patient safety come first and the director of nursing is obligated in discharging her duties to take the appropriate steps for the management of patient profile and the staffing resources available to her.  The HSE has confirmed there is no intention to close services at St. Joseph's and this temporary cohorting of patients was considered in the best interest of their care.  The Minister for Health will continue to monitor this situation carefully and has asked the HSE to keep him updated on progress.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on two points from the Minister of State's response.  He said the House will be aware that the management of resources and service planning is a matter for the HSE in the first instance and that quality care and patient safety come first and the director of nursing is obligated in discharging her duties.  I have no problem whatsoever with the director of nursing and commend her for the difficult job she does given the resources available.</p>  <p>  This House allocates Exchequer funding and has a responsibility to maintain a level of decency in health care.  What I saw in St. Joseph's last night does not reflect that level of decency.  Like many services, St. Joseph's was not founded as a hospital but as a care facility.  It did not look like a hospital to me last night, such was the level of overcrowding.  I have argued in this House that the HIQA requirement that everybody be accommodated in one-bed or two-bed units is unnecessary.  I am still of the view that there are many patients who do not want to be accommodated in one-bed and two-bed units.  However, the level of overcrowding last night is certainly not what patients or the staff who care for them want, nor is it permitting the level of service staff were trained and wish to provide.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State also referred to the overarching policy of the Government to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities.  There are 2.7 hours of home help allocated in Limerick and north Tipperary for every person over 65, but only 1.6 hours in County Clare.  Is there a difference?  Are Clare people expected to be more resilient?  Does it simply reflect politics?  There is a Cabinet Minister in Limerick and one in north Tipperary and that is how we allocate resources in this House.  It is simply not good enough.  The people I am very proud to represent have exactly the same rights and expectations as those in north Tipperary or Limerick.  There is a whole of baloney about how much the Government believes in equality but why not provide equality for the over 65s?  I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, had to come into the House because I appreciate he is not the line Minister responsible.  Let us have a little bit of equality for the over-65s in the mid-west.  Let us have the same number of home help hours allocated to the people of County Clare as are allocated in Limerick and north Tipperary.  Since there is no Minister in County Clare, there is nobody to demand it.  That is how politics works in Ireland - so much for reform.</p></speech>

I wish to reiterate that there are genuine reasons for the decision taken by the director of nursing who, in law, is obligated to take decisions in the best interests of patients.  That is what she did in this instance.  The HSE has informed the Minister that it expects the situation to be resolved in the next fortnight.  It is a staffing issue and the approach of the director of nursing is a responsible one.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, under the current Government the programme has not received adequate recognition, support or funding.  It was moved from the Department of Education and Skills, where it was initially set up within the social inclusion unit as part of the DEIS programme, to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs when that Department was established.  Since then it has been moved to Tusla, very much removed from the Department under whose remit it should be, as an educational intervention, and in which it could be properly co-ordinated.</p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, the aim of the programme is to retain young people in the formal education system to complete senior cycle and to improve attendance and participation rates throughout primary and secondary school.  It is involved with 124 projects across the country in 470 primary schools and 220 post-primary schools, which is almost one third of our secondary schools.  Over the last number of years, the programme has seen a 25% reduction in its budget.  That has put significant pressure on school completion programmes as regards continuing the range of activities they had been providing and ensuring they are well placed to continue making inroads into school completion and educational outcomes.  Many of the key extra-curricular programmes, including those at holiday times, have had to be curtailed.</p><p>There is much concern at this stage about the future plans for the school completion programme within Tusla.  There is no certainty about what the budget will be for the next academic year starting in September.  The plans normally issued in February have not yet been issued by Tusla for submission by the school completion programmes.  A real issue of concern is what the plans are for next year and subsequent years.</p> <p> I ask the Minister for a number of commitments.  Will he commit, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to enter discussions with the Minister for Education and Skills with a view to putting the school completion programme back where it is best served and best placed, which is the Department of Education and Skills?  Will he also commit to supporting the expansion of the programme?  It has been identified as being successful, most recently in an ESRI review of the DEIS programme.  Will he commit to expanding further this successful model?  Will he also commit to implementing no further cuts to the school completion programme in the academic year starting this coming September?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600020#S00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The school completion programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle, and to improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort.  It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the DEIS action plan of the Department of Education and Skills.  It involves 124 projects and related initiatives operating in 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  These projects provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support approximately 36,000 children identified by local management committees as being at risk of educational disadvantage.  Typically, projects offer homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, social and personal development programmes, out-of-school supports including music, art and sports, and a range of activities during holiday periods.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the school completion programme, and the agency has indicated a similar allocation for the programme in 2015.  It has also approved the plans of local school retention projects for the 2014-15 academic year.  The first two instalments of 2014-15 funding have issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned this month.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme by the ESRI is almost complete.  The review is an important initiative for planning for the future development of the school completion programme.  It will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a suitable footing for the future.  The review is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials of the Child and Family Agency, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  It will, among other things, examine the school completion programme structures and their fitness for purpose to support an integrated approach to address early school leaving.  It will analyse the interventions provided and make recommendations for evidence-informed supports designed to secure the best educational outcomes for young people.  It is envisaged that its final report will be delivered very shortly.  The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the DEIS programme, which was also prepared by the ESRI and which refers to the school completion programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education.</p>  <p>  I have advised Tusla of my commitment to ensuring there is no diminution in the services provided by the school completion programme, which is an important constituent part of the agency's educational welfare services.  As the Deputy and many other Deputies on all sides of the House before him have pointed out, it is a highly regarded programme and, as such, is a key method of securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.  We all know that the outcome of early school leaving is reduced opportunities in later life.</p></speech>

On the ESRI review to be published shortly, the Minister indicated that he hoped it would assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future.  This is certainly not the language of someone who plans to expand the programme and bring the positive impact it has had in communities where it has been delivered into other areas where similar interventions are required.  The language of consolidation, unfortunately, is very different from the language of expansion, which is what we need to do with this programme.  As I mentioned, the ESRI report into the effectiveness of DEIS has shown that intervention in vulnerable communities with children at risk of falling out of the education system actually works, and this should be continued.  I hope the ESRI review, which we cannot prejudge, will back up the fact that the school completion programme has been an important element in this regard.</p>  <p>  In his reply, will the Minister comment on his personal view of the place of the school completion programme and its effectiveness and contribution to radically improving outcomes and retention rates in schools?  Will he also comment on the suitability of its current placement in Tusla?  Does he agree that it should be put back where it started and where it is best placed, which is under the Department of Education Skills and the DEIS programme?  Will the Minister also give assurance that the templates for the school completion programme plans for this coming September will be issued promptly?  We he also give an assurance on funding for these programmes for the coming September and the new academic year?</p></speech>

In his earlier contribution, the Deputy asked me to commit to talking to the Minister for Education and Skills about the appropriate location for the programme and about sending it back to that Department.  He then asked me to commit to expanding the funding.  There is a little contradiction in that.</p></speech>

Its value is very much proven.  I await the ESRI report, which I hope will vindicate my sense, and that of many Deputies in the House, of its value.  Education is critical for opportunities in later life and we want to encourage children to stay the course and stay in school until they reach their 18th birthday at least.</p>  <p>  Different things appeal to different children, and this programme has been very good at identifying those interests and using them to lead children back into the education system.  The Deputy may feel the programme properly belongs in the Department of Education and Skills, but I point out that learning support, mentoring programmes, personal development programmes, social programmes and out-of-school supports all sit well where they are, and there is a huge amount of combined action with For&oacute;ige and Youthreach with regard to how these children are supported in staying in school.  I do not have a closed mind, as I stated, but I certainly believe the programme should continue, and it needs to be expanded to wherever it is required and needed.</p><p>This year, we had no further cuts in our services in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The reason these programmes had to be cut was the financial disaster that befell this country.  </p></speech>

I do not want to rain on the parade of the Minister of State and his colleagues after yesterday's announcement, which is the fourth such announcement since October.  It seeks to promise the delivery of social housing units and, in the time allocated to me, there is not enough time to go through the dismal record of house construction under this Government.  Figures supplied to me in answer to a parliamentary question indicate why the crisis has become a scandal.  Waterford has had one unit over the past four years, Offaly received none, north Tipperary received none and there were 60 out of 100 in Dublin last year.  It makes dismal reading and I would have thought the Minister would have a more holistic approach to this crisis before now.  Even at this late stage, I would have thought the Minister would combine private sector and empowerment initiatives to assist that sector through the use of the strategic investment fund to fund developers, get house building going and address the difficulties, given the lack of houses available, the increasing crisis in mortgage arrears and the construction aspect of providing homes.  The Minister made no effort to address those issues when I thought he would.</p>  <p>  To deal with the specific issue raised here, it relates to previous Government announcements by the front-line Minister.  In particular, capital funding for 7,500 units includes new builds, acquisitions, refurbishments and voids was promised over a period of three years.  At a committee meeting a couple of months ago and in responses to parliamentary questions, we were informed that 1,400 would be new builds completed by the end of this year.  The announcement yesterday says it will be 1,700 by the end of 2017.  Will 300 be built in 2016 and 2017, with 1,400 this year?</p>  <p>  On foot of the announcement last yesterday and notwithstanding the difficulties arising from the management of the crisis over the past four years and the fact that it developed into a scandal involving 1,000 children living in emergency accommodation in Dublin, was the Minister and his colleagues convinced that 1,400 units were to be built this year?  What has changed in two months leading to the announcement yesterday of 1,700 over three years?  </p></speech>

Breaking it down by county, the announcement as part of the spring economic statement for my county involved 40 houses between now and the end of 2017.  There are 12 for Killarney, 12 for Tralee, four for Lixnaw, and 12 single rural cottages.  This amounts to 40 houses.  There are 4,000 people on the housing list waiting across the county, with 2,000 on the waiting list in the town of Tralee.  That puts things in perspective when the State is paying out &euro;6 million per year on rent supplement to private landlords in the county of Kerry.  A substantial number of former local authority houses are for sale.  I have asked the council to consider purchasing them.  It depends on what will come from the Exchequer to help.</p>  <p>  The people looking for transfers include those with disabilities living in upstairs apartments.  They are waiting to be housed and cannot get transfers from council apartments.  It is a shambles.  The Minister of State will argue that this is what he inherited from the previous Government and the crisis in the economy.  Having said that, there is an urgent need for this and I cannot understand why the Government pays &euro;6 million a year to private landlords for rental accommodation when a substantial amount of that money could be spent providing local authority housing for 2,000 people on the housing list in the county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600021#T00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address this matter but I was disappointed at the announcement by the Minister today.  There were multiple announcements over the past six months since the budget.  Many of the announcements were of housing building programmes, and at this stage I was expecting to see concrete being poured and hundreds of houses under way.  That is not what we see.  I have summed up the reams of paper on the back of a postage stamp, where I wrote out the housing programme.  Over 2015 to 2017, over three years, there will be &euro;312 million spent and 1,700 units built.  Some 49 houses will be built in Laois, 57 in Kildare and 33 in Offaly.  In County Kildare, almost 8,000 people are on the housing waiting list and almost 1,700 households are on the waiting list in Laois.  I have summed up the programme on the back of a postage stamp.  It is not nearly enough and I am concerned and disappointed.  The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, told the House about the massive house building programme.  However, the reality is that the needs of 98% of the people on the housing waiting list are not being addressed and the house building programme that fits on the back of the postage stamp will only address the needs of 2% of the households on the waiting list.  It is far too little too late.  In Dublin, in the middle of the crisis, 183 houses were built in 2013.  In three years from 2015 to 2017, the Labour Party and Fine Gael proposed building 167 houses over three years.  This is the answer to the housing crisis.  It is not of enough and I want to know what other measures will be put in place to address the crisis.</p></speech>

They miss the point.  Yesterday's announcement is but one strand of the Government's response under the social housing strategy.  The figures quoted are the direct builds by local authorities proposed by the same local authorities through the Department.  They have received the green light but it is only the first phase of direct building.  I expect the support of all Deputies in all of those projects.  The figures quoted do not take account of forthcoming proposals under the capital assistance scheme, CAS, under which voluntary housing bodies will provide a number of units, nor do they take account of the number of voids, vacant and boarded-up local authority units for which additional funding has been provided.  Over 2,000 units have been turned around and put back into beneficial use over the past year.  Further funding for 1,000 additional units will be provided to put them back into beneficial use.  It does not take account of the number of acquisition units, where local authorities from all over the country propose to the Department to buy units from the market at good value for money.  The announcement yesterday does not include that but the Deputies chose to ignore this fact.  Nor do they allow for the rental accommodation scheme or the housing assistance payment schemes that are up and running in local authorities around the country.</p><p>The HAP scheme has now been expanded into a further 12 local authorities.  The social housing strategy is targeted at providing over 110,000 social housing units through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the HAP and rental accommodation schemes.  In total, &euro;3.8 billion is being ring-fenced for the strategy.  This marks a fresh strategy in terms of the provision of social housing.  I find it hard to take lectures from those opposite, especially those in Fianna F&aacute;il.  It abdicated its responsibility in terms of direct build social housing in local authorities for over a decade.  Some 15,000 units were built in the previous four years.</p></speech>

That was two months ago.  The Government rushes to make so many announcements that it forgets what was said in the previous one.  That is what was said two months ago.  Yesterday it was back to 1,700 over three years.  Can the Minister of State confirm that it will be 1,400 this year and 300 in the next two years?  Is that the divide?

The busiest industry since the last budget has been the offices of the Minister of State and the Minister, churning out press releases and papers, which I have summarised on the back of this postage stamp.  The Taoiseach's house-building programme fits on the back of a stamp.  It is 1,700 units over three years.  That is the reality when one strips away the billions.  What is happening here is that the money the Minister of State is announcing has been taken from the Department of Social Protection.  He has brought it over to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and called it housing assistance payment, HAP, which some people are calling "hapless".  That is how he is calculating his billions.  He is not dealing with the housing crisis.  There is a serious housing crisis out there.

He ignored it and month after month since then he has ignored pleas from the Opposition to change the relationship between the banks and people in mortgage arrears and to change the veto the banks have over any debt resolution agreement resulting from any process.  There have been up to 586 repossessions since January.  That is a 500% increase on this time last year.  The majority of these are homes, not investment properties.  The Taoiseach will recall that it was Government legislation in 2013 circumventing the Dunne judgment that allowed the repossession train to start.  Research has already shown that 1,000 homes have been repossessed.  It is now estimated that there are up to 8,000 civil bills before the Circuit Court relating to repossessions.</p><p>We are facing a major crisis because of Government inaction in relation to people in mortgage arrears and the anxiety and distress that has happened as a result.  That is on top of the homelessness crisis and the appalling fact that up to 1,000 children are in emergency accommodation in this city alone.</p></speech>

When will the Government remove the veto the banks currently have on debt resolution mechanisms?  The Personal Insolvency Act has been very ineffective, and it has failed.  We hear leaks via the media that something will happen four years from the time Deputy Michael McGrath first tabled Private Member's legislation, which if the Government had accepted, would have paved the way for a far more reasonable approach to the issue.  It is a shocking indictment of what the Government has been doing for the past four years.</p></speech>

That is a decline of more than 3,000 compared to the January 2015 figure.  The total number of mortgage accounts that have been restructured stood at 106,402 at the end of February.  That means people were able to sit down and discuss the distress of the mortgage involved and in 106,402 cases, a sustainable solution for the future was arrived at.  The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,730 to 59,138, with a decrease of 482 mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 720 days, which stood at 28,900 at the end of this year.  The numbers in very long-term arrears is a matter of major concern.  It is important to note that the latest Central Bank data show the number in arrears for more than 720 days drop for the banks in quarter 4 of 2014 for the first time.  The Government wants the maximum number of mortgage holders in very long-term arrears to be able to afford their mortgage, to retain ownership of their houses where they can afford it, and if they cannot, to have viable and easily accessible options available to either stay in the house or to have access to alternative housing.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned repossessions.  The Government does not see repossessions as a policy solution, and every action that has been taken since coming to office has been designed to ensure that the maximum number of people and families can continue to live in their houses.  According to the Central Bank report from the final quarter of 2014, of the 429 properties that were taken into possession by the banks, less than one third, or 123, were repossessed as a result of a court order, while the remaining two thirds were voluntarily surrendered or were abandoned.  As Deputy Martin is aware, there has been much coverage of the increase in civil bills being lodged by financial institutions.  It is important to say that the commencement of the court process is not a signal or an end in itself that repossession will occur.  The Minister for Finance has stated that it may often be the case that the process prompts borrowers to re-engage with the lender in the first place to find a solution.  Often, those cases are adjourned.  I listened to a commentary on the news recently on actual cases which allows both parties time to find a solution and to remove the bank and the borrower from the legal process.  It is fair to say that while there are a number of options available involving, for example, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or the insolvency agency, such solutions do not work in a number of cases, and accordingly, the Government has committed to bring forward a number of further solutions that will deal with the question of really distressed mortgages where the option can be had for another alternative in respect of those borrowers so that in the vast majority of cases, the option will be there for families or tenants to remain in a house on foot of a variety of solutions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned the issue of the veto.  The further options that will be brought forward by the Government next week will deal with cases involving serious distress that are outside the scope of the discussions that have taken place to date, following which more than 100,000 cases have been sorted out.  However, we remain concerned about the long-term mortgage indebtedness in those cases.</p></speech>

The statistics revealed yesterday showed there were more than 586 repossessions since January, and 383 of those related to homes.  We know from research by Professor Seamus Coffey in UCC that 1,000 court-enforced repossessions have taken place already.  We also know that 8,000 civil bills are before the courts as we speak.  It is not good enough to say that the banks only take people to court so that they will engage in the process.  Banks take people to court because they load the trigger and they can pull the trigger whenever they want.  It puts the person who holds the mortgage in an impossible position and causes enormous distress and anxiety.  I have dealt with cases where people had engaged.  The Taoiseach takes the side of the banks at all times, as does the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach is doing it again today.</p></speech>

The sorry saga of the Taoiseach's efforts to impose an additional water tax on households and his establishment of the now totally discredited Irish Water is a metaphor for how this Government functions, or indeed does not function.  There was no need to impose an additional water charge in the first instance, but the Government did so.  There was no need to pay &euro;85 million of taxpayers' money to consultants but the Government did that as well.</p><p>The Government could have listened to suggestions from these benches, but instead it forced through the Water Services Bill.  Back then, the Government threatened to reduce household supplies to a trickle.  Popular anger grew and the protests got bigger, so the Government did a partial U-turn.  It also failed with that.  In the meantime, in the background the Siteserv scandal was being covered up by the Government and a subsidiary of Siteserv was given a lucrative contract for installing water meters across the State.  All of this happened on the Taoiseach's watch.</p> <p> Now we learn from the media that the Government is discussing draconian and unprecedented new powers to deduct water charges from citizens' wages, pensions and social welfare payments.  Is it not time to go back to the drawing board?  Will the Taoiseach now, belatedly, scrap the water charges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600024#W00200"><p>I have replied to the Deputy on this question on a number of occasions.  The Government does not intend to drop the establishment of Irish Water, with its capacity to borrow for investment to fix the many problems that have been associated with the water supply and wastewater throughout the country over a long period of time.  The Government has a requirement.  I recall the Deputy stating in public that he intended, as a legislator and a citizen, to pay his water charges.  He was very straightforward about that.  However, for whatever reason, he then changed his mind and said he would not pay it.</p>  <p>  It is about time the country confronted a situation that has been inadequate for many years.  We must deal with it.  There is a lack of water of sufficient quality in many places and a lack of investment to deal with wastewater.  There is clearly a difference between those who can pay but say they will not pay, and those who cannot pay.  The Government clearly recognises that.  We cannot have a situation in which huge numbers of citizens understand that they must make a contribution for the water supply, which is now very moderate at &euro;1.15 or &euro;3 per week, for which they register and pay and for which they will be in receipt of support from the Department of Social Protection, while others who receive the same water supply say they will not pay when they clearly can.  There will be a compliance regime to deal with that.  It is grossly unfair to expect one neighbour to pay while the other neighbour takes the view that he or she should not pay.  Again, I distinguish between those who can pay but will not and those who cannot pay.  The compliance regime will be in place to deal with that, so everybody can invest and contribute to having a country that has high-quality water supplies and high-grade capability to deal with wastewater, which is affecting our reputation in many places.</p></speech>

The latest plan, concocted by a Labour Party Minister who is greatly concerned about his legacy, also sets a very dangerous precedent.  If a company such as Irish Water can take money from people's private bank accounts or pensions, where will this end?  Will this legislation apply to Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB and Eircom?  What will stop a private company such as a car dealership from seeking an attachment order?</p>  <p>  This latest contortion in the long-running efforts to impose water charges is a direct contrast with the Government's compliant and subservient attitude to the banks, which refuse point blank to deal fairly with families in mortgage distress.  The Taoiseach refuses to introduce legislation to oblige them to do so.</p></speech>

Is this Government the bankers' party?  Will the Taoiseach explain why there is one set of values for dealing with ordinary citizens, for which he is prepared to legislate in the way he has put forward, although he refuses to do that in respect of the veto he has given to, and copperfastened for, the banks?</p></speech>

Also, with regard to reducing the tax burden, the Government has started to provide that whatever flexibility people have won will go to the most vulnerable categories of citizen.</p>  <p>  The difference between water and essential services such as gas, electricity and telecommunications is that the latter can be cut off, but the Government has legislated to provide that the water supply cannot and will not be cut off.  Every citizen will get a water supply.  There is a requirement to pay for it, however, as well as for the investment to create it and maintain it and the investment necessary for future services.  That is the reason the Government listened carefully to people and that the rates are now &euro;3 or &euro;1.15 per week.

One principle from the Proclamation is worth mentioning: that the Irish Republic is a sovereign, independent State.  It says, "We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies...".  We have had many threats to our sovereignty in the past, but I wish to mention a threat to our sovereignty today, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  It has been presented to us in glowing terms and we have been told it will raise EU GDP and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.  However, grave concerns are being raised by politicians, trade unions, civil society and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, throughout Europe and elsewhere.  The aim of TTIP is to remove any regulatory barrier to profits and the profit-making potential of multinational and transnational companies.  It will have massive implications for workers' rights, food safety, banking, the environment, and agriculture, to mention a few areas.  However, I wish to focus on education.  Including education in TTIP has the potential to do irreparable damage to the education system in Ireland.  The investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism will give foreign investors a right to sue a sovereign state, with a democratically elected government, for a loss of profit resulting from public policy decisions.  Secret decisions made in boardrooms overseas would have more control over our education system than the Minister or the Department of Education and Skills.  It will open the door to a proliferation of private and for-profit schools and colleges.</p>  <p>  An American congressional report on the for-profit education sector found that there was a 64% student drop-out rate.</p><p>It also found that 17% of funding in the area of education was spent on instruction.  We know there is considerable pressure to expand the scope of the education commitments in the TTIP.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that education is excluded from the agreement.  I wonder whether he has had any discussions with the Minister for Education and Skills on this matter.</p></speech>

The opportunity that exists for Europe and the United States, which are the two biggest trading blocs on the planet, to reach a series of trade agreements is nothing new.  It has been talked about for over 20 years.  If agreement can be reached, the opportunity exists to create approximately 2 million jobs on either side of the Atlantic and to set down the standards for world trade for many years to come.  This is not without difficulty.  Obviously, each side has a number of concerns that are very close to its individual policy positions.  Each side is finding it difficult to change or deal with those concerns, which have been outlined by various European countries and by the United States.  My feeling is that if TTIP is not dealt with by the end of this year, it is unlikely that it will be concluded in the lifetime of the Obama Administration.  There are two good teams working on this across a whole range of sectors.  The perception that Europe was afraid to table the difficult issues and the United States was afraid to table the difficult issues is not actually true.  Issues such as tariffs and procurement are being tabled and new offers are being made.  Quite a number of chapters of TTIP remain to be considered.  I would say, in respect of the education system, that we have a unique advantage in this country.  When one speaks to investors from abroad, one hears that one of the outstanding qualities of Ireland's attractiveness is the flexibility of our education system-----</p></speech>

That is exemplified by Science Foundation Ireland's investment in so many areas that measure up to challenges that other countries have not been able to meet.  I think that is an endorsement of the confidence of our young people and, indeed, of the tutors, teachers, parents and students in our education system.  I would not like our public education system, which has stood by this country for a very long time and has turned out exemplary students of exceptionally high quality in so many cases, to be a victim of the TTIP negotiations.  Ireland wants to maintain its system of education, which is able to measure up to these issues.  Obviously, the team negotiating the different elements of TTIP will have to give consideration to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  Ireland will be very vigilant in ensuring that nothing that would in any way damage our capacity to continue to operate at the highest level of educational standards will be tabled and agreed.</p></speech>

I was in the education system as a teacher for many years, so I know what our education system is about.  I think we have to be concerned about the possibility of increasing commercialisation and privatisation of our education system if TTIP includes education.  Approximately two weeks ago, I attended a seminar organised by the Irish Federation of University Teachers and the Teachers' Union of Ireland at which the topic of higher education as a public good was discussed.  Concern was expressed at the seminar, and the feeling was that our colleges, institutions of education and universities have to be independent in order to encourage, enable and facilitate independent, challenging and innovative thinking.  That will be threatened and undermined if education is part of TTIP, because the ability of the Government to frame public education policy in a way that ensures the public good would be limited.  We are all public representatives.  Surely our driving force is to serve the public good.  How can we possibly be involved in concluding a trade agreement that undermines and jeopardises the public good?  At the very least, can the Taoiseach allow for a debate in this Chamber on all the implications of TTIP?  Some presentations were made at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, but there is a need for a full debate here.  I am asking for that to happen.</p></speech>

We have been served very well in difficult times over the years by an education system that has been capable of changing direction to deal with new challenges as required.  There will be an even greater requirement for that in the future because of the rate of change in so many areas at present.  As someone who is involved in the system, Deputy O'Sullivan will understand that the confidence and capacity of our education system and students to deal with those changes is second to none.  I am very optimistic and pleased about the response I see on a regular basis from students who meet and beat these challenges in terms of their peers around the world.  No proposition with any potential to privatise the Irish education system has crossed the Government's desk.  This Government will not stand for that.</p></speech>

It is now predicted that there will be an overrun of hundreds of millions of euro by the end of the year.  It looks like the first-quarter financial deficit - that is, the deficit built up by the end of March - will be &euro;100 million.  The Minister told a Cabinet sub-committee last week that the HSE will exceed its allocation before the end of the year, or alternatively will have to face introducing cuts to patient services.  He also said it was drawing up measures to punish hospitals that have exceeded their allocations.  The House has long accepted the fraudulent presentation of financial figures in relation to health.  Over &euro;500 million was produced at the end of last year.  The same thing happened the year before.  Will the Taoiseach confirm honestly that there will be a significant Supplementary Estimate this year to cover the undoubted overruns that will occur in the health sector because of the fraudulent set of figures that were provided, yet again, in last year's budget for the health services?  If one travels out of this House and goes into the hospitals, one will see that morale is at an all-time low in the health services.  Staff are fed up with the lack of leadership and direction from the Government.  They do not know whether they are coming or going.  It seems this House does not know what the financial situation is in relation to health.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that a Supplementary Estimate for health will be brought before the House?</p></speech>

When I asked him about it some months later, because it had not been brought forward, on 1 July, he said the Government was working on a comprehensive motion which would be discussed with Deputies Martin and Adams shortly.  Again, time passed but n&iacute; tharla rud ar bith &oacute; shin.  In February of this year, he said he would have it in March.  It is now May and we still do not have this.  I would like a debate on the North.</p>  <p>  On 24 March of this year, the Taoiseach agreed to hold a debate on the North.  As he should know, in recent weeks there has been a sustained and concerted attack on Sinn F&eacute;in representatives.  There have been four attacks on the homes and property of Sinn F&eacute;in councillors and members.  There have been seven death threats.  The cars belonging to two Derry Sinn F&eacute;in councillors were destroyed last night outside their homes and the car of another activist, Sean McMonagle, was burned.  The Taoiseach knows that Frank McCabe junior, son of a Sinn F&eacute;in member, Frank McCabe in south Armagh, was blinded in one eye by a booby trap bomb on the family property.  The home of the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, was paint-bombed last week.  There were death threats yesterday and bomb alerts at the homes of Martina Anderson MEP, and Raymond McCartney, MLA.  This morning, when I was on my to the 1916 commemoration at Arbour Hill, there was a bomb alert at my home.  I got word that police sniffer dogs were there and they were checking out the precincts of the house.</p>  <p>  We need to discuss all of these matters, particularly in the light of tomorrow&rsquo;s election and its likely repercussions if the Tories get in because of their commitment to leave the EU but also their adherence to austerity and so on.  Will the Taoiseach set a date for the debate as soon as possible so that we can discuss all of these very important issues?  The silence on these attacks from the Government and others in this Chamber, who are sometimes very loud in making one-sided remarks about the North, is deafening.  Will the Taoiseach let us know the Government&rsquo;s position on these threats and attacks?</p></speech>

I deplore the paint-bombing of the home of the Deputy First Minister a couple of days ago, which I heard and read comment about, no more than the outrageous murder yesterday of a community worker on the streets of Belfast.  These are not matters that should be carried out where politics is concerned.  People can argue and have differences of opinion but democracy means that they can discuss these things and the electorate makes its decision.  That is the Government&rsquo;s position: we condemn these things unreservedly.</p>  <p>  In respect of Ballymurphy, I spoke to the Deputy about this before and he will recall that I wanted to meet the people there and the relatives of those who were shot dead in order that I would hear their views of a potential all-party motion.  The text is ready and I will circulate it to the party leaders for their consideration.  If they agree with that, or can agree on changes to an all-party motion in respect of Ballymurphy, I will be happy to go with it.  As soon as that is done we can arrange for a debate on Northern Ireland and the very serious issues arising from what is happening, and has happened in recent past there.  Nobody wants to see a return to that sort of an era.  There is a lot of opportunity and optimism opening up for Northern Ireland.  Who knows what the outcome of the election will be tomorrow and, in respect of those elected from Northern Ireland, what place or position they may have following the outcome of the election.  If the Deputy can work with us on the all-party motion, we can arrange with the Whips for a decent debate on Northern Ireland and all the issues that affect us North and South.</p></speech>

I was surprised to hear media reports this morning to the effect that the Government was going to introduce legislation to allow landlords withhold outstanding water charges from a deposit.  Is there a change in that plan or does the Government still intend to introduce the deposit protection scheme?</p>  <p>  A second matter relating to that legislation is the need for some kind of controls on rents.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has spoken about the need for rent certainty.  Others would say there is an absolutely urgent need for rent controls.

Landlords are required to register and to give details of their tenancies.</p>  <p>  The Government does not intend to legislate for rent control.  In respect of rent subsidy, where tenants are notified of an intention to have them removed from private tenancies the opportunity is there under the existing scheme to have that subsidy increased on a case-by-case basis so that the tenancy can be extended in order that housing can be provided for those tenants under a different scheme.</p></speech>

It relates to universal health insurance.  I have gone through the legislative programme for this summer session and I cannot find any reference in it to universal health insurance.  I know the ESRI has been charged with bringing about a costing model for this but in view of the fact that it is a central plank of Government policy on how it funds health services in the years ahead, when can we expect to see the legislation published so that we can have an informed debate on this issue prior to the general election?  Is it ever going to happen?  Are we going to pretend here week in and week out that the Government is pursuing a policy that will never see the light of day?</p></speech>

There is much talk about attention to rural areas and the country people of Ireland but precious little funding, resources or care are being provided to areas of this country located outside of the cities.  Every day, we hear of further cuts to, or the abolition of, services in rural areas and of the effect this is having on communities.  Deputy Durkan referred earlier to the isolation and fear factor among people living in rural areas as a consequence of the closure of rural Garda stations.  The actions of successive Governments, in terms of the closure of Garda stations, shows a lack of understanding on their part of the effect of this measure on the most vulnerable in our society.  Last night, I attended an IFA meeting in Kilkenny, during which a member of the audience spoke of how on three occasions his house had been broken into and he had been terrorised.  He made the point that all of this came about because there was no Garda presence in his area.</p> <p> We are all aware of the impact of the closure of post offices on people in rural communities.  I have heard several Deputies from the Government and Opposition benches speak about the social consequences of the closure of rural post offices, which are often the only point of connection in a community for elderly people, on the grounds that they are not viable and so forth.  With a little imagination, rural-proofing and political will, all of these issues could be dealt with.  </p> <p> Also of concern is the lack of transport in rural communities, which again impacts on the most vulnerable, including the many young people trying to get work in the morning who are not in a position to afford a car.  For many elderly people, their only mode of connecting with the community was through rural transport but it has now been taken from them.  The most affected areas in terms of a lack of rural transport, post office and Garda station closures and so on are coastal communities, including west Mayo in the Taoiseach's county.  This has led to emigration and the closure of almost all of the small shops in rural areas.  Again with a little imagination and rural-proofing, this could be reversed.</p> <p> The purpose of this Bill is to initiate debate on the need to ensure protection of our rural communities and to bring about equality for people living in rural Ireland.  I am sure the Taoiseach is so concerned about rural Ireland he will be only too glad to support this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600028#AA01400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 to this House.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and completed its passage through that House on 5 November last.  I am glad to say that it received general, cross-party support there.  There is no doubt that this is significant and timely legislation, particularly in view of the deplorable terrorist acts witnessed in Europe and beyond in recent times.</p>  <p>  The Bill creates three new offences in relation to terrorist activity, builds on an existing body of Irish legislation on counter-terrorism and focuses on preparatory terrorist activities.  The three new offences are public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism; and training for terrorism.  These new offences are particularly relevant to the nature of the current threat posed to Europe by international terrorism.  There are many who, while playing no part in actual acts of terrorism, encourage others to do so.  It is important to ensure that Ireland is not seen as a haven for such activities and that we have strong laws in place to deal with this threat.</p>  <p>  This Bill shows the Government&rsquo;s commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms.  The scourge of terrorism is, unfortunately, more evident in the world than ever.  I am sure that Deputies will appreciate the importance of tackling it at source so as to be able to deal, when necessary, with incitement, recruitment and training for terrorist activities.  From a broader legal standpoint, the Bill has two main objectives.  The first is to amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2005 to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2008/919/JHA, which amended Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism.  The framework decision is covered by the Lisbon treaty and is required to be transposed into Irish law.  Second, the Bill will facilitate ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism which has already been signed by Ireland.  Both the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe convention cover the three new offences in relation to terrorist activity which are prescribed in this Bill.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe is currently working on an additional protocol to the prevention of terrorism convention, which aims to focus on dealing with the &ldquo;foreign terrorist fighters&rdquo; phenomenon.  The protocol will encompass key measures identified in UN Security Council Resolution 2178 adopted last September in relation to foreign terrorist fighters.  The resolution places considerable emphasis on criminalising and facilitating the prosecution of recruitment and training for terrorism.  The protocol being developed by the Council of Europe will have regard to the UN resolution with a view to ensuring a co-ordinated approach between the two international organisations.  The need for any additional measures in this jurisdiction, legislative or otherwise, will be kept under review in light of developments internationally.  Terrorism is a global phenomenon and the need for international co-ordination and co-operation in combating it is paramount. </p>  <p>  Terrorism is a constant threat to the fundamental values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.  There is considerable concern across Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the potential threat they may present on their return from conflict areas.  The recent horrific events in France, Belgium and Denmark have illustrated the serious threat posed by violent extremists in a European context.  The number of European foreign fighters is currently estimated to be in the region of 3,500 to 4,000, although some have put it at a much higher figure than that, and the current focus of attention is on the conflict zones in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>The compilation of accurate statistics on the numbers of actual foreign fighters is problematic due to the secretive nature of those travelling and the many and circuitous routes some individuals take to reach their destination of choice.  The rise and popularity of Islamic State, ISIS, has greatly exacerbated the threat posed.  It is estimated that 80% of European foreign fighters are aligned with ISIS.  The events in France, Belgium and Denmark demonstrate the vulnerability of states to attack and highlight the challenges faced in countering terrorist attacks, even with sophisticated security and intelligence infrastructures.</p> <p> These terrorist attacks have moved the issues of counter-terrorism and the security of the EU and its member states to the top of the EU agenda.  The importance of having an internationally coherent and co-ordinated approach is essential.  The terrorist threat is multidimensional and it is necessary to adopt a multifaceted approach in dealing with it.  There are different aspects to terrorism and foreign fighters: some people engage in preparatory activities such as recruitment and training, while others are actually carrying out terrorist activities or engaging in foreign fighting, returning to their countries of origin in a radicalised state and encouraging others into extremist actions.  In order to break this cycle of terrorism, it is important to deal with each of its component elements.</p> <p> Strong, harmonised counter-terrorism legislation is one component.  This Bill implements a shared EU legal instrument.  Prevention is another element.  Online radicalisation must be dealt with, in co-operation with Internet service providers.  Those who would seek to destroy our democratic societies have not been slow to exploit the opportunities offered by modern means of communication.  The role of the Internet in radicalising people has long been recognised.  There is, unfortunately, no shortage of radical content online which encourages extreme forms of terrorism.  While the Internet and social media platforms have revolutionised communications for the good, we must also be conscious of the opportunities they offer to those with a malign intent.  The online images are often graphic and horrific and the messages that are conveyed often present distorted versions of the truth, not least in terms of how the Islamic faith is portrayed.</p> <p> The use of counter-narrative has a key part to play in dealing with this, through the involvement of credible sources and voices in communities most at risk, in order to counter the extremist message.  It is very important to promote the positive message at the expense of the negative.  In an Irish context, the Islamic community has made particular efforts to convey the message of Islam as being one of tolerance and enlightenment.  This is to be welcomed.  A counter-narrative has been developed by the Islamic Educational and Cultural Centre which not only disputes the extremist version of Islamic teaching, but seeks to dissuade potential recruits from travelling to Syria.  It is to the great credit of the Islamic community in Ireland that they have adopted this positive, proactive approach.</p> <p> Experience indicates that a combination of community relations approaches and traditional security techniques offers the most effective means of minimising the terrorist threat.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive community relations programme through its racial, intercultural and diversity office.  That office is in regular contact with our minority communities through its network of ethnic liaison officers and it is available to discuss all matters of concern to these communities, including those related to the conflict in the Middle East.  The office has received favourable comment on its operation from the UN counter-terrorism committee.  The work of this office is very important in breaking down any perceived cultural barriers between the State and its minority communities.  It is often these barriers which cause a sense of marginalisation which the extremists are keen to prey upon.  It could be said that the Garda approach to this issue is a form of counter-narrative in itself.</p> <p> Disrupting the travel of those seeking to engage in or return from foreign fighting is another aspect requiring attention.  Strengthening the security of our national and international borders is a key element in protecting our citizens from terrorist threats, particularly from radicalised individuals.  This has been strongly emphasised by the UN Security Council.  The tracking and early identification of terrorists will greatly assist in protecting our borders.  Ireland has expressed its full support for an EU directive on passenger name records, known as the PNR directive.  This will provide for the transmission of data by airlines to police and security authorities in respect of all flights in and out of the EU for the purposes of combatting terrorism and serious crime.  The importance of this proposal has been stressed by a number of member states, including Ireland, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in France and the arrests in Belgium.  It is clear that PNR data can be a tool of great value to police and security services in combatting serious crime and terrorism.  Such data is currently shared by EU member states, including Ireland, with Australia, Canada and the United States.  It would seem entirely logical, therefore, that EU member states should share this information among themselves within an EU framework.  Under the proposed PNR directive, air carriers will be required to send the passenger name record data in their reservation systems to the competent authorities of the member state into which or from which it operates flights.  This is data about passengers and their travel plans which the air carriers already collect and hold.  Member states will share data with other member states where such sharing is necessary for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime.  In addition, member states will have the right to request data from other member states in support of a specific investigation.  The proposed directive contains clear safeguards for data protection and data security and will require member states to put in place specific measures in this regard.  The European Parliament is currently considering the proposals, which I hope will be progressed in the near future.</p> <p> It has been recognised by the European Council of justice Ministers that another area requiring priority action is trafficking in firearms.  Fighting illicit firearms trafficking is one of the EU&rsquo;s crime priorities for the period 2014 to 2017, as agreed under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Preventive measures must be taken to make it more difficult for firearms to get into the hands of terrorists.  The trading of firearms over the Internet needs to be adequately addressed and the traceability of firearms needs to be improved.  Also, the rules across Europe for the deactivation of firearms vary greatly, which means that it is far easier than to reactivate those deactivated weapons in some member states than in others.  It will be important, therefore, to aim at establishing high minimum standards in this regard across the EU.  Engagement with third party states, most notably Turkey, which is the main gateway into the combat areas of Iraq and Syria, is also recognised at EU level as being of great importance.  The EU has been active in persuading Turkey to engage on this front.</p> <p> While the threat to Ireland from international terrorism is generally considered to be low, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keeps the level of threat under continual review in light of ongoing developments, and continues to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government, which is determined that all practical steps be taken to deal with any threat.  Assessment of the threat level is based on a range of factors, including current intelligence, recent events and what is known about terrorist intentions and capabilities.</p> <p> The Offences Against the State Acts and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, the latter which is updated by this Bill, contain offence provisions covering a broad range of terrorist and terrorist-related activities.  The 2005 Act incriminates terrorist offences as a separate category of crime and contains lists of offences which, with the requisite intent, would constitute terrorist offences.  Penalties for such offences are severe and, if sufficiently serious, include life imprisonment.</p> <p> The financing of terrorism is already an offence under the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  It is an offence for a person, either directly or indirectly, to collect, receive or provide funds knowing or intending that they be used for terrorism.  The penalty where a person is convicted of such an offence is imprisonment for up to 20 years, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p> The legislation before the House will enable Ireland to further fulfil its international commitments in the area of counter-terrorism and to stand united with our European colleagues, and with democratic nations across the globe, in combatting terrorist crimes and protecting innocent citizens everywhere.  Those who would threaten the lives of ordinary people by engaging in acts of terrorism, whether on this island or elsewhere - we have had our own experiences - must be brought to justice and know that the international community will not tolerate their activity and will take all possible action to prevent and punish it.</p><p> As I have said, there are three main elements to the Bill and it creates three new offences.  The first is public provocation to commit a terrorist offence.  The Bill sets out a description of what that means.  The second is the offence of recruitment; again, there is a description of this in the Bill.  The last offence is training for terrorism.  This is committed where a person provides instruction or training in the skills of making or using firearms or explosives, nuclear material, biological, chemical or prohibited weapons or other such weapons or noxious or hazardous substances as may be prescribed, knowing that the skills provided are intended to be used for the purpose of terrorist activity.  This offence also covers training in techniques or methods for use in terrorist activity.  A person convicted of this offence is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</p> <p> There are a number of standard provisions in the Bill, all of which allow us to comply with the European directive.  This is important legislation at this time and it is important that the Government is in a position to bring it forward.  I appeal for the support of Deputies across the House for this Bill.</p></speech>

We believe the Bill will assist in combatting so-called dissident republicans, as well as persons who hold Irish citizenship and who return from the current conflicts in Syria and Iraq.</p>  <p>  The Council framework decision on which this legislation builds was agreed in 2008 during the term of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Previously, Fianna F&aacute;il has called on the Government to be vigilant with regard to the possible return of combatants who claim Irish citizenship from the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.  It is vital that those individuals are suitable for reintegration into Irish society upon their return in order to prevent the radicalisation of any citizens here.  I understand this may be difficult task, but it is vital if we are to ensure that the safety of Irish citizens and citizens of other EU member states is protected from those who have been radicalised in the Middle East or Africa.</p>  <p>  There is growing concern among the settled Irish Muslim community that a small number of new members of that community are intent on propagating a more fundamentalist and violent vision of Islam which is at odds with the true values of that religion.  I imagine these concerns have been voiced to the Minister.  The danger is that our Muslim community may find itself being represented by a tiny minority in the mainstream media, undermining the great warmth and strong relationships that currently exist between our communities in Ireland.  We must not allow that to happen.  We cannot allow a community that has contributed a great deal to Irish life to be undermined by people who have no interest in integrating here, no interest in enhancing the Muslim community here and certainly no interest in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is clear that this proposed legislation will provide three key tools to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its fight against terrorism.  As the Minister has outlined, the Bill will transpose into Irish law an Council framework decision on combating terrorism agreed at Brussels in November 2008 and will provide for the new offences.  We acknowledge the fact that these offences reflect similar offences covered by the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, which Ireland signed in October 2008.  In particular, the Bill, when enacted, will amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 to create the new offences of a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  We welcome the fact that these offences will carry sentences of up to ten years' imprisonment upon conviction on indictment.  In particular, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the creation of the offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence.  This offence is committed when a person distributes or otherwise makes available, by whatever means of communication, a message to the public with the intention of encouraging, either directly or indirectly, the commission of a terrorist activity.  This reflects the change in how those engaged in terrorist offences have begun to use modern technology to promote their message in a highly effective manner.  A person who is convicted of the offence is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment of up to one year or both, and, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for up to ten years.  The stringent provisions at the more extreme end of this offence are necessary given the serious potential for disorder that may result from actions taken in this regard.</p>  <p>  The new offence of the recruitment for terrorism is also welcome.  Once this legislation is passed, if an individual recruits or attempts to recruit another person to engage in terrorist activity or other offences contained in section 6 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, that person is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine, or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.  Again, these severe provisions recognise the threat posed by those engaged in recruiting individuals, who are often vulnerable, to carry out terrorist activity.</p>  <p>  The provisions are welcome and necessary.  I understand the Garda is currently monitoring the movements of up to 30 Irish residents believed to be engaged in jihad or armed conflict in the Middle East and north Africa.  The International Centre for Study of Radicalisation at King's College, London, estimates that approximately 26 Irish citizens are fighting with various factions involved in the expansion of the Islamic State organisation from Syria to northern and western Iraq.  Approximately 5,500 foreign fighters are estimated to be participants in the brutal fighting and terror campaigns associated with Islamic State.  These are highly concerning figures and show in black and white why these legislative provisions are necessary.  Given the figures, I call on the Minister to outline any further co-ordinated actions she plans to take to address the jihad fighter phenomenon.  In August 2014, the Minister stated that she would not hesitate to revoke the citizenship of any Irish passport holder involved in illegal or terror-related jihad activities in Iraq or Syria.  I call on the Minister to update the House on this proposal.</p>  <p>  Long-established international research shows that approximately one third of all participants in combat will become psychological casualties, returning home with serious mental disorders or psycho-social behaviours.  These behaviours include classic combat stress reaction symptoms such as depression, hyper-vigilance, substance abuse and a propensity to self-harm and violent behaviour.</p>  <p>  Ireland's jihadists are most likely participating in military campaigns where systematic sexual violence against women and children, including mass rape as a weapon of war, as well as the torture, mutilation and summary execution of prisoners, are carried out by almost all parties to the conflict.  The United Nations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned all sides in the Syrian conflict for grave breaches of international law and crimes against humanity.  It is imperative, therefore, that Ireland prepares to deal with these returnees.  In this regard, it is clear that many returning fighters may require counselling and support.  Others may require investigation and screening for terrorist acts and breaches of international law.  In time, some may well be brought before international criminal courts to answer charges of war crimes.</p>  <p>  I am keen to highlight the excellent work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area.  Despite shrinking resources, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been proactive in its efforts to identify and engage with vulnerable young citizens targeted and groomed by Islamic radicals.  It has some experience in this regard.  The approach taken by contemporary radical Islamist groups is similar to the recruitment activities of the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary groups in the past.  Their work is to be condemned.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, Fianna F&aacute;il will support this legislation.  It is a welcome first step to address an increasingly difficult phenomenon.  I would appreciate if the Minister could update the House with regard to my request before the conclusion of Second Stage.</p></speech>

I am very happy the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is in the House to hear what we have to say directly.  I know the Minister will respond in due course as the debate proceeds up to 9 p.m. tonight.</p><p>The motion notes that, in 2012, Siteserv owed &euro;150 million to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and that it was sold in March 2012 for &euro;45 million; in the process, some bidders were excluded from the sale although they may have saved the taxpayer and State a lot of money; Siteserv shareholders received &euro;5 million at the time of sale; there are genuine concerns about the sale of Siteserv for &euro;45 million by IBRC; and the Department of Finance expressed serious concerns about the sale.  The motion acknowledges the huge public concern about this matter; the dissatisfaction that information obtained through freedom of information highlighted a breakdown in trust between IBRC and the Secretary General and other key officials in the Department of Finance; and the concerns about other sell-offs by IBRC.  While the Minister has sought to respond to this, our motion specifically condemns the direction by the Minister to appoint KPMG to undertake a review of the transactions in IBRC as KPMG advised Siteserv during the sale and there are public concerns about a possible conflict of interest.  As we have said from day one in this debate, we are calling for an independent commission of inquiry to be set up to examine the circumstances surrounding and leading to the sale of Siteserv in March 2012, and other company sell-offs by IBRC, so full information can be obtained in the interest of the taxpayer and the wider public interest.</p><p>Essentially, this started off as a business transaction.  On 16 January 2012, Siteserv told the Irish Stock Exchange that it was exploring its corporate options.  Everybody knew this was code and it was essentially up for restructuring, resale or takeover.  Two days later, a company called Better Capital wrote to Siteserv expressing an interest and stating it would be interested in purchasing.  It was never contacted, included in the process or asked to make a bid.  That is the first difficulty, in that people who were offering to come in, possibly with a decent price, were not even advised of the process.  Ultimately, the next Better Capital heard about it was after the Irish Stock Exchange announcement two months later, in March, that the company had been sold.  During the course of the sales process, another company, Rutland Partners, had offered &euro;55 million and there are reports that at least two other companies offered amounts greater than the &euro;45 million that was originally offered and ultimately accepted.  A key concern is why so many people were excluded from the process who could have reduced the loss to the taxpayer.</p><p>In simple English, Siteserv owed the taxpayer &euro;150 million through IBRC, yet it was ultimately sold for &euro;45 million, which is a loss of &euro;105 million.  If that was not bad enough, what happened next is that the shareholders of that company were given another &euro;5 million of taxpayers' money, bringing the total loss to the Irish taxpayer to &euro;110 million.</p><p>The Minister is the sole shareholder of IBRC.  He calls the shots, he owns the company and he directs the directors.  Everybody in IBRC was there on his behalf but he was oblivious to what was happening on his watch.  He was asleep at the wheel while this was going on and it is the taxpayer who is the loser in all of this.  That &euro;110 million has to be borrowed, given we are still borrowing money this year, and it has to be paid back with interest over the years to come because of the loss on that particular deal, which is aside from other losses that have also emerged during this process.</p><p>On 15 March 2012, as I said, the deal was done and announced to the Irish Stock Exchange.  KPMG, one of the major companies in town, was involved and advised Siteserv on the sale.  I will say here and now that I trained as a chartered accountant and qualified with a company that is now essentially a KPMG company.  However, I do not like the directive the Minister has given to that company.  Many people felt, when it was appointed to that job last Friday week, that in some way KPMG was interested in taking up the job and was willing to do it, despite the conflict of interest.  However, it is clear from the ministerial direction issued by the Minister that this is a direction to KPMG, the liquidator.  As the Minister has special powers under the liquidation legislation to direct the liquidator to carry out certain functions on his behalf, KPMG is caught having to do the Minister's bidding whether or not it thinks it a good idea.  The people in KPMG know it is not good for KPMG to be embroiled in this but they have no option and no say because the Minister has the legal powers in the legislation to direct them to do that.</p><p>The Minister has also directed that if there is <i>prima facie</i>evidence of any material deficiencies in the performance or functions of those acting for IBRC, KPMG is to include this in the review and report, and it will also examine the processes, procedures and controls which were operated by IBRC in regard to the relevant write-offs.  Finally, to be clear, the Minister directed the liquidator to appoint, with his prior approval, an appropriate independent person to monitor for any conflicts of interest.  That has been done and Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill has been appointed.  However, the fact the Minister had to do that proves he knew there was a conflict of interest issue.  He should not have taken this road and I think the road he took in appointing KPMG to do this was the wrong one.</p><p>I ask myself why he did it, given this has been a political controversy for some time.  First, the Taoiseach came into the D&aacute;il and said he knew nothing about it.  Then, he came back a few days later and said we will appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine it.  He did not know what he was talking about but we are used to the Taoiseach, when he strays into matters financial, never getting it right.  It happens on every occasion, and I refer to another example here last week.  He then realised the Comptroller and Auditor General had no legal power to do this.  The T&aacute;naiste came in the following day and said she wanted somebody else who was independent to do it.  The Minister then came into the fray and said he would get KPMG to do it.  Of all the options proposed, foolhardy and all as the Taoiseach's comments were, and light and all as the T&aacute;naiste's comments were, the Minister has actually come up with the worst option of the three of them.</p><p>The Minister's press release announcing this stated: &quot;The Special Liquidators are best placed to undertake such a review thoroughly and expeditiously &ndash; given their access to all books and records of IBRC [and] the resources at their disposal to conduct such a review.&quot;</p><p>He essentially said he appointed KPMG because it could do a short-cut.  It was working in the bank, could do a quick job and get things over with quickly.  He wanted it off the political agenda and asked for any old report.  He knew there was a conflict and then had to appoint a judge to try to clarify the issue.  Many people will object to the manner in which the Minister chose KPMG solely because it could do a quick job.  It is better to get things right.  We have always asked for an independent commission of inquiry.  I would prefer to get to the truth even if it takes a couple of months longer.  The people of Ireland want the truth.</p> <p> The process the Minister has started is tainted and will be tainted when the report is completed by KPMG on 31 August.  It will be tainted when the Minister publishes it and hands it to an Oireachtas committee to consider it further.  That process will be tainted for several reasons.  He started with a conflict of interest and appointed the wrong people because he wanted a report in a hurry.  It is a bad process and he is doing himself a lot of harm by going down this route.  Even at this late stage, I would support him if he was to pull back from the measures he has taken in appointing KPMG to do this job.</p> <p> The Minister has directed the special liquidator to review the transaction that occurred from 21 January 2009 until 7 February 2013, the date of the appointment of the special liquidator.  What about all of the deals that were ongoing when it was appointed?  What about the deals that were completed before it came in?  What about all the deals that have been completed since 7 February 2013 and those transactions in IBRC that have yet to be completed?  </p> <p> As the Minister knows, the House sat until all hours to deal with his emergency legislation.  There was some &euro;13 billion in debt on the books of the IBRC on the night the Minister put it into special liquidation.  How much taxpayers' money has been written off inappropriately as part of that &euro;13 billion?  It was the net amount on the balance sheet after provisions, but I am sure the level of gross debt was in the order of &euro;25 billion.  People will want to know not just what was written off prior to the liquidator arriving, but what happened after it arrived and how much of the original value of the loans has been written off.  </p> <p> The Department of Finance has had concerns all along.  As bad as the format of the inquiry is, the Minister would not have set it up unless he believed there was something to investigate.  These questions must be answered.  Some of the questions which have to be asked and answered as part of this process include why there was a surge in share dealing in Siteserv prior to the sale.  One of the reasons that has been publically stated is that some of the shareholders in Siteserv also owed money to IBRC.  It has a lien on the shareholders because it knew if it passed some money back to the shareholders, it might get some of it back off its loans.</p> <p> There is a clear conflict of interest between the role of IBRC, those who owe it money and the shareholders in Siteserv.  Why were the shareholders paid &euro;5 million of taxpayers' money for an insolvent company?  Why were bidders excluded from the process?  I do not know what the joke is; taxpayers are not laughing.  Taxpayers are paying for that write-off out of borrowed money with interest.  The Minister might think it is a joke, but there are people who are paying their mortgages and do not get a penny from the bank.  They see one set of rules for those on the inside and another for ordinary citizens.  They do not see that issue as a laughing matter.  I advise the Government to take this matter seriously.</p> <p> The longer the Minister laughs at this, the more harm he does to himself.  He should not be carrying on the way he is and making a joke of this.  Then again, this deal has characterised the Department of Finance.  Deputy Catherine Murphy tabled 18 or 20 parliamentary questions over many months, on which she is to be complimented.  When the Minister gave an interview, he said she did not ask the right questions.  That is no way to run one's business.  He said when she submitted the freedom of information request she got the right answers.  A senior Government Minister is dismissing, with the back of his hand, the relevance of the national Parliament and saying he will give information from his Department through freedom of information that he will not give by way of parliamentary questions and replies.  </p> <p> He has undermined the Government's claim of a democratic revolution and a change in how we do business.  It is the same old story in the Department of Finance, that is, to tell nobody nothing.  Deputies should not be forced to go through freedom of information when they ask a question in the Parliament.  There is still a culture of secrecy.  </p> <p> I refer to the amendment to the motion.  If I was IBRC, I would be very worried about it.  It is self-serving and implies that the Department of Finance knew, saw and heard nothing, that nobody told it anything, that it did not ask questions and that it heard about things from newspapers.  The Minister, as a shareholder, should have been on top of this.  We heard many times about regulators being asleep at the wheel.  The Minister was the sole shareholder of the company when this happened and the people expect better from him because he was managing the economy fairly well.  </p> <p> The troika did not oversee this, but it is another example of a difficulty.  When the Minister did business of his own, he was not doing the job on behalf of the taxpayer.  All of these losses occurred on his watch and after he appointed the special liquidator, further losses to the taxpayer continued to occur.  There will be a further writedown of the &euro;13 billion in loans, about which there is no word.  The Minister studiously prevented the liquidator or an independent commission, which we would like, from examining what happened to the &euro;13 billion.</p> <p> The amendment states that Department of Finance officials were not made aware of the details and goes on to state that the Minister received files, but no minutes were included and that the first he heard of the issue was when a member of the public wrote to him about media reports after something appeared in the Stock Exchange.  His defence is that he knew nothing.  The manner in which he went about this has elements of Bart Simpson, namely, that it is not his fault because he knew nothing.  That will not work.  People expect more from a Minister for Finance and for him or her to look after their interests and money, and not wash &euro;110 million of their money down the drain.  The Minister presided over that.  This issue is not going away and the Minister's actions have exacerbated the political problem for himself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600032#EE00200"><p>It does not stand up to any reasonable form of scrutiny for anybody to say with a degree of credibility that there is not a conflict of interest or a perception of one.  I have no axe to grind or connection with KPMG, but it was at the centre of this transaction before it became involved with IBRC.  It was appointed as the special liquidator without a tendering process on the night the Bill was passed.  It has had a vested interest throughout the process and was involved with Siteserv and now IBRC as a special liquidator.  It is front and centre in regard to these transactions.</p>  <p>  It is not credible to ask it to do a report into itself.  One has to ask whether it will write a report which will be critical of itself.  To offer by way of explanation that it is in possession of all the paperwork and has the knowledge, as a special liquidator, of handling the case does not stack up to any degree of scrutiny.  There is no reason that KPMG could not be ordered to hand over copies of the paperwork to an independent commission of investigation.  That is what rankles with people, namely, the fact that the common thread running through this issue is KPMG.</p>  <p>  People have made presentations to the effect that arms length commercial transactions, which they have tried to rationalise, were involved.  They have tried to provide explanations, for example, on "Prime Time" on RTE.  There was a haircut of &euro;105 million.  At the same time, other bidders were excluded.  When one adds everything up, people have a right to be worried.  One can contrast that with the parallel of distressed mortgage holders who are trying to negotiate with the banks.  They see big business getting haircuts and writedowns not on one, but on at least three occasions, for the company behind Siteserv.  When they try to negotiate with the banks they are met with a veto.  </p>  <p>  We have been told a retired High Court judge is overseeing the investigation by KPMG into the Siteserv transaction.</p><p>There is no independent oversight in a negotiation process for a mortgage holder who is trying to sit down and hammer out an arrangement with a bank.  The bank will exercise its veto, which was raised by our party leader during Leaders' Questions today.  My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has proposed legislation in that regard.  The difference of approach is so palpable when it comes to big business <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the citizens who are trying to get on with their lives but are saddled with mortgages they cannot pay.  The bank is screwing them to the wall and that is making people very angry.  <br/><br/>The only way to get to the bottom of this is to have an independent commission of investigation.  This would remove the conflict of interest from the equation and the argument.  The special liquidator is to report by the end of August and it would be opportune for the banking inquiry to look at that report.  The terms of reference of the banking inquiry include events after the crash up to December 2013, and include &quot;persons who were the recipients of commercial loans, including for commercial property, from the credit institutions within the scope&quot; of the schedule.<br/><br/>It is significant that there was such a large write-off in the Siteserv deal.  There was also a &euro;64 million write-off of debt in respect of Blue Ocean Associates and a reported write-off of &euro;150 million for Topaz.  The same individuals are behind all three transactions.  I am not happy that KPMG is doing the report because in my view there is a conflict of interest.  There is a perceived conflict of interest and people are not happy about it.  If the Government is minded to have a special commission of investigation, it should allow the banking inquiry to examine the matter when the special liquidator reports at the end of August.</p></speech>

I do not know if there was anything wrong with this transaction, but it is clear from the number of questions raised on all sides of and outside the House that it warrants further investigation.  It warrants an investigation with more credibility than KPMG can bring to the table.  I am not going to reiterate the points my colleagues have made but for the life of me I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance and the Government are not prepared to put in place a credible alternative to investigate this matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister and the Taoiseach have made many charges against my party over the last years.  Terms like "axis of evil" and "golden circle" were used to good effect at a time when the country was challenged in a very particular way.  The Government rode the crest of a wave on the back of those comments and platitudes.</p></speech>

I am not going to add to that but it should set the context for establishing a fully transparent and independent investigation.</p>  <p>  The Minister should look at the way in which people were treated; &euro;105 million is a hell of a lot of money and &euro;5 million to the directors of a burst company is a phenomenal amount.  Yesterday I was in the home of a family that has been evicted by a bank.  They owed &euro;140,000 and were thrown out in January and are living in rented accommodation.  They got nothing when they were pushed out the door.  The State will not even give them rent allowance because they have to be renting for six months to qualify for it.  The Minister should try to convince the woman of that family that she is being treated fairly and equitably by the State.</p>  <p>  We have a burst company that gets a debt haircut of &euro;105 million and the shareholders walk away with &euro;5 million.  Deputy Fleming has talked about the transactions that happened in the days preceding the final deal, which will be dealt with through some form of investigation later, if not now.  The special liquidator will come back in due course and say he does not have the powers to address all of this.  What about the other companies that have had their loans sold by IBRC and did not get that exclusion from hawking their books around between their competitors?  There are many small to medium enterprises that were funded through Anglo and, by virtue of the Minister's decision to liquidate IBRC, found their loans being offered to their competitors.  They did not get the kind of protection this company got.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to help me explain to that housewife the notion that he is dealing with this fairly and equitably.  He should help me explain it to the small to medium-sized enterprises that have had their books opened to their competitors in an effort to sell on their loans.  Some of the Minister's colleagues have indicated that receivership would have damaged the value of Siteserv.  Why was its loan book not traded and offered around like others?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister help me explain to a very annoyed public how somebody who apparently represented IBRC and by extension the Government could go on "Prime Time" and say that votes had to be bought and that is the reason &euro;5 million needed to be ponied up?  What was the rush to get this deal executed?  I do not understand it and I sure as hell know that there are very few people outside the doors of this House who understand it.  I remind the Minister that senior officials in his own Department certainly do not understand it.  At the end of tonight's debate, I ask the Minister to accept that there is a problem here, perhaps not of his making, and to put in place an appropriate independent investigation that will give some sense of credibility to what we are all trying to do in this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600033#FF00600"><p>I wish to address four key issues in respect of this affair.  First, the sale of Siteserv itself; second, the relationship between IBRC and the Department of Finance; third, the nature and narrow remit of the proposed inquiry; and, fourth, why vital concerns raised by Department of Finance officials were effectively withheld from the D&aacute;il for so long.</p>  <p>  The sale of Siteserv is an important issue of public interest.  A subsidiary of this company subsequently went on to win three contracts linked to water metering, totalling &euro;62 million each.  The fundamental error was made when the company itself and its directors were given the sale to conduct, at arm's length from IBRC.  Everything else stems from that wrong decision.  Indeed, civil servants in the Minister's Department raised that very point.  There was no logical reason to exclude trade dealers.  What has been said in public about that - the idea of confidentiality being a cause for concern - is a load of nonsense.  </p><p>There are numerous confidentiality templates and clauses which cover situations like this across the board, in banks and elsewhere, when it comes to the disposal and sale of companies.  The idea a raft of people in the market, and market leaders in this field, were excluded from any chance to purchase the company makes no sense and there is no logic attached to it.  The exclusivity period was also wrong and higher bids were excluded.  <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>reported last weekend that UK private equity fund, Rutland Partners, tabled a bid of &euro;55 million but it was rejected due to conditions attached.  Better Capital claims it was shut out of the process.  We also had Altrad, Anchorage and others who equally feel they were shut out.<br/><br/>There is also the &euro;5 million payout which was shocking and scandalous.  The fundamental rule is that if a company is gone, the shareholders' equity is gone with it.  The idea that &euro;5 million would be paid to bribe the shareholders and get them to agree to the sale does not wash.  There is no justification for it.  When we consider that people in mortgage arrears and people with all sorts of issues with banks do not get anything like this treatment, we begin to see and understand the sense of resentment in society when this kind of thing goes on and the whole idea that if one is on the inside and people know each other, things can get done.<br/><br/>We know about the share dealing in advance of the sale itself.  Why did people buy shares in a bust company?  There was a sudden upsurge in share sales in the month before IBRC began to receive the first bids for Siteserv as part of a confidential sales process.  In November 2011, some 6.4 million shares were sold in the firm, compared to 121,000 in October 2011 and 4.76 million between January and October the same year.  Who were these investors?  Will we find out?  Will the inquiry cover this issue?  On what information were these investors acting?  These are legitimate questions.<br/><br/>Another key issue is the relationship between IBRC and the Department of Finance.  Will this be covered by the inquiry?  Will civil servants be brought in by the inquiry and asked very basic questions?  We have learned from the freedom of information documentation that civil servants in the Department of Finance raised a range of significant issues about the conduct and behaviour of IBRC.  There was, for example, the hiring of Blackstone without public procurement.  Blackstone is a company which is well used to buying distressed assets.  It had full visibility of everything in IBRC.  I learned through a parliamentary question replied to today by the Minister that officials in the Department &quot;are aware that IBRC proceeded with the appointment of the company referred to in the question without following a standard procurement process&quot;.<blockquote>The CEO of IBRC at the time used his authority under bank policy to waive the requirement of Board approval for the engagement.  IBRC felt that given the sensitivities around the piece of work which the company referred to in the question was engaged to undertake, they decided that a targeted selection process for this limited piece of work was the best approach to take.</blockquote>One individual, the CEO, decided to hire Blackstone and gave it full visibility of every portfolio in IBRC.  It made millions out of the assignment.  Was it &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million it made out of it?  This very serious issue was raised with the Minister.<br/><br/>We also have the Apthorp deal, where the adverse deviation from valuation norms was between $25 million and $50 million.  Again, officials at the Department were very concerned about it.  This was raised by an executive in IBRC and the Department was alerted.  There were issues pertaining to how IBRC dealt with Topaz when Mr. O'Leary was the majority shareholder.  There were issues about how major clients were handled by IBRC, such as the Quinn family, Denis O'Brien and Paddy McKillen.  This is all in the freedom of information documents.  There was the Siteserv deal itself, which necessitated an entire memo from the Department of Finance such was its concern about how the company was sold.<br/><br/>We also have the failure to sell IBRC Wealth Management and the relationship between it and IBRC proper.  There were perceived conflicts of interest between them in terms of how transactions were conducted.  William Fry was brought in to do a report on the relationship between IBRC Wealth Management which managed a lot of wealth on behalf of many individuals and IBRC, and how the two operated as two separate legal entities, apparently, in the one edifice.  What was that about?  Last week, I asked the Taoiseach if he would publish the report from William Fry on the perceived conflict of interest.  Will the Minister take steps in this regard?  Will the inquiry encompass this issue, which was of such concern to the Department of Finance that it necessitated the secondment of a departmental official to the bank?<br/><br/>The Minister knows there was a lot of hostility about that decision between the Department and the chairman, the CEO and the bank itself.  Last week, we read the chairman, Alan Dukes, wrote serious letters complaining about the individual to the Department.  This hostility was not good enough from the bank's perspective.  On whose behalf did it think it was acting?  Did these people forget they were acting essentially as agents of the State?  It was outrageous carry on and the demonisation of the Department of Finance which has happened subsequently is equally outrageous.  I have not noted anyone from the Government contradicting what the chairman, Alan Dukes, said about Department of Finance officials in any shape or form and this is wrong.  Someone should stand up for the civil servants who raised legitimate questions.<br/><br/>Why were these concerns withheld from the D&aacute;il for so long?  Four months and 13 parliamentary questions later, Deputy Murphy eventually got some detail because freedom of information was hurriedly coming down the tracks.  Why did the Minister not tell the D&aacute;il about the list of concerns which has now been documented in freedom of information documents?  Why was it withheld from the D&aacute;il?  Was the Minister afraid of upsetting somebody or upsetting the apple cart?  Was it better to leave well alone?  No one can quite understand why this information was withheld for so long from the D&aacute;il, and Deputy Catherine Murphy in particular, in the context of the liquidation of IBRC when we were told everything was grand and everybody was good and behaving.  We then learned from the documents much later that everything was not grand.<br/><br/>This brings me to the nature and type of the investigation.  It is a fundamental error of judgment to appoint the same company involved in advising on the sale to investigate the sale.  Do not give me the stuff about Chinese walls and different divisions; with regard to a conflict of interest and the perception of a conflict of interest, it is a no-brainer and an error of judgment on the Minister's behalf.  The Labour Party is going along with it, although the T&aacute;naiste told me she wanted an independent competent authority.  I do not understand why the Government is ramming through this particular mode of inquiry.  It suggests an arrogance and a detachment from public anger.  There is arrogance, perhaps because of the overall majority, that the Government can ram through whatever it likes and can stitch this into an inquiry with a narrow remit, because many of the issues I have outlined will not be covered, and we will be told whether there are material deficiencies and that it meets normal commercial sale standards.  This is all it will be asked to come up with.  It is a stitch up in many respects to get the outcome the Government wants in the time covered.<br/><br/>It is wrong to proceed on the basis the Minister has decided to proceed with regard to satisfying genuine public interest provoked by the concerns of civil servants in the Department of Finance, primarily with regard to the conduct of IBRC in these large transactions and the sale of Siteserv.</p></speech>

Very often in politics perception can be confused with reality.  A number of very serious questions remained unanswered despite freedom of information requests, several parliamentary questions and the issue being raised copious times by our leader during Leaders' Questions.  I will refrain from discussing my opinion on what happened in the lead-up to the deal and the deal itself.</p><p>Given the level of uncertainty, and the mistrust between the Department and IBRC, there is an urgent need for the issue to be dealt with in an open and transparent manner.</p> <p> When the Government came into office, it promised that everything would be dealt with in an open and transparent manner.  There is a perception of sweetheart deals and we want to ensure that it did not happen.  We want to ensure no favourable treatment was afforded to certain individuals because of their relationships with members of the Government and we want to ensure there was no insider trading.  A State-owned financial institution was dealing with a commercial entity.  The primary aim of a commercial entity is to make a profit.  We want to ensure that what happened was carried out in an appropriate manner, that there was no favourable treatment and that the best value for money was returned to the taxpayer.  The only way we can ensure this happens is for a fully independent investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act to be carried out.  This would ensure it is removed from all levels of uncertainty.  In my constituency office, or walking down the streets of Mullingar, Longford or Athlone, I meet people and they ask me why a big business can get a &euro;100 million writedown but they cannot afford to pay their mortgages to keep the roof over their heads.  Why is there one treatment for a State-owned financial institution or big business and different treatment for the ordinary individual trying to keep a roof over the family?  We have repeatedly raised the issue of 300,000 people paying in excess of 2% above the average interest rate in the rest of the EU.  Why is that happening while big business gets a reduction of &euro;100 million in a sweetheart deal?  It is important the Minister comes out and ensures openness and transparency so that everyone can have confidence.  There is no confidence at the moment.</p></speech>

The April 2012 pack contained the minutes of the meetings held on 20 March, 21 March, 28 March and 13 April 2012. However, there were no minutes included in the April pack of the meeting of 15 March 2012, which the Department of Finance subsequently learned, had occurred and had approved the sale of Siteserv;<br /><br />&mdash; the first record relating to the sale of Siteserv which the Department of Finance received is dated 23 March 2012, and was an e-mail from a member of the public relating to media reports around the sale of Siteserv;<br /><br />&mdash; following a review of the transaction, the Department of Finance had concerns about certain aspects of the transaction;<br /><br />&mdash; the Minister for Finance met with the CEO and chairman of IBRC in July 2012 to discuss, among other matters, the concerns raised following the review of the Siteserv<br /><br />transaction. At this meeting, the chairman provided the Minister for Finance with strong assurances that the transaction, including those aspects of the transaction with which there were concerns, had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC board and that they were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State;<br /><br />&mdash; the IBRC board had a fiduciary responsibility to the bank's stakeholders and so, in light of this legal responsibility, the chairman and the board would have considered and provided such assurances following serious and careful consideration; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Minister for Finance accepted the assurances from the chairman of IBRC that the transaction had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC board and that they were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State;acknowledges that:&mdash; the Department of Finance had no role in the sale of Siteserv to Millington or any decisions taken during the sale process and they only became aware of the transaction after the proposed sale of the company was announced to the Irish Stock Exchange;<br /><br />&mdash; given the recent public concerns and questions raised regarding the Siteserv transaction, the Minister for Finance has directed the special liquidators of IBRC to review and report on all transactions, activities and management decisions which occurred between the date of nationalisation and the date that IBRC entered into liquidation, that resulted in a capital loss to IBRC of at least &euro;10 million; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Minister for Finance has also directed the appointment of retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill, to monitor any actual or perceived conflicts of interests that may arise as part of this review; andcalls on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to support the review which the special liquidators have been directed to conduct and which retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill, will monitor for any<br /><br />actual or perceived conflicts of interest.&rdquo;</blockquote>I propose to share time with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes.</p><p>The mismanagement of the economy and the financial system by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government wrecked the country.  Anglo Irish Bank, more recently called IBRC, and the billions of taxpayers' money put into that bank in 2009 and 2010 will never be recovered.  The impact on this country of the decisions taken by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to support Anglo Irish Bank, more recently called IBRC, with &euro;34.7 billion of taxpayers' money has been immense.  We are not talking about &euro;105 million but about the &euro;34.7 billion from the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government when the current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il was a Minister.</p><p>Today's motion in the D&aacute;il arises as a consequence of those decisions.  The legislation that provided for the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank allowed the bank commercial freedom in its operations under the direction of its chairman and board of directors.  There was no day to day role for the Minister for Finance and no reporting requirement to the Department of Finance for transactions such as the Siteserv transaction.  The legislation introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2009, in nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, made it difficult for the Minister and the Department of Finance to exercise governance over IBRC and to ensure its accountability.  Under the oversight or relationship framework that applied prior to 29 March 2012, the period during which the board approved the Siteserv transaction, the board of IBRC was not required to consult with the Minister for Finance on transactions such as Siteserv and did not do so.  The relationship framework was put in place by the Government of which Deputy Martin was a member and created governance difficulties for the Department of Finance.  It was difficult, under this system the Deputy put in place, to hold IBRC to account.</p><p>A relationship framework dated 8 July 2009 was in place at the time the board of IBRC approved the sale of Siteserv.  Under this relationship framework, the board of IBRC were required to engage with the Minister for Finance on certain key issues, which included any material acquisitions, disposals, investments, realisations or other transactions, other than in the ordinary course of Anglo Irish Bank's banking business.  It should be noted that this relationship framework did not include any specific monetary thresholds which would trigger mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It should also be noted that at that time the ordinary course of the bank's business was to conduct an orderly wind-down of the bank.  As such, IBRC's efforts, as a secured lender, to maximise the recovery on its loans to Siteserv was considered to be in the ordinary course of business.  For that reason, and under the relationship framework in place at that time, IBRC was not required to consult with the Minister for Finance on this matter in advance of making the decision to approve the sale of Siteserv and it did not do so.  The Department and the Minister operated in accordance with the legislation and the relationship framework put in place by the previous Government.  The chairman of the board quoted by Deputy Martin was appointed to the board of IBRC by my predecessor, Brian Lenihan, and was subsequently made chairman of the board by the late Brian Lenihan.</p></speech>

This was a condition following Ireland's third review under the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  This was a requirement for all banks who benefited from capital injections to protect the commercial basis for the banks' operations while under Government ownership.  The revised relationship framework and operational protocol contained specific consent-consultation procedures between the bank and me, as Minister for Finance, which included monetary thresholds.</p>  <p>  The revised relationship framework and operational protocol outlined the instances in which IBRC was required to gain consent from me or consult with me, as Minister for Finance, and these instances went beyond individual transactions and-or disposals; they also included consent for board approvals, management appointments and litigation matters.  Following the introduction of the new relationship framework and operational framework, the board of IBRC commenced forwarding board packs and minutes of board meetings to the Department of Finance.  The April 2012 board pack contained the minutes of the board meetings held on 20 March 2012, 21 March 2012, 28 March 2012 and 13 April 2012.  However, there were no minutes included in the April board pack of the board meeting of 15 March 2012, at which we subsequently learned the sale of Siteserv had been approved.  This pack of board documents, including minutes to which I referred, was the first pack of board documents and the first minutes forwarded to the Department of Finance under the new relationship framework.  IBRC was previously not required to provide this information under the old relationship framework, which Deputy Martin approved when he was a Minister in government.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance was not involved in the sale process or any of the decisions taken during the sale process.  I have been informed that my officials were not made aware of the details of the transaction during their monthly meetings with IBRC management in advance of the decision of the board to approve the sale.</p><p>Following a thorough search of the records and correspondence received, I have been informed that the Department of Finance did not receive board packs or minutes of the IBRC board meetings prior to the introduction of the revised relationship framework that came into operation on 29 March 2012.  As I have stated, under the relationship framework that was in place prior to 29 March 2012, the board of IBRC was not required to consult with the Minister for Finance on transactions such as the sale of Siteserv and it did not do so.  Following the approval of the board and the sale of the company, my officials requested and were provided by IBRC with details and a timetable for the transactions.<br/><br/>In June 2011, following an independent review of the strategic options for the business and the level of debt in the company, the IBRC credit committee approved Siteserv's commencement of an orderly process to sell itself.  IBRC was a creditor of Siteserv and had an interest in the maximisation of the proceeds of sale of the company to maximise the recovery of the company's debts to IBRC.  Following IBRC's approval, the sale process was run by Siteserv, along with its advisers, KPMG Corporate Finance and Davy Corporate Finance.  IBRC appointed Walter Hobbs as its observer to the sale process.  Anyone who has been following this in detail heard Mr. Hobbs explain the position as he understood it on a recent &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  The board of IBRC met and approved the sale of Siteserv on 15 March 2012.  On 16 March 2012, given that Siteserv was a member of the enterprise securities market, the proposed disposal of Siteserv to Millington was announced at the Irish Stock Exchange.  As per the RNS on the Irish Stock Exchange, completion of the sale was subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of approval of the transaction from the Irish Competition Authority.  After this announcement to the stock exchange, there would have been media attention around the transaction.<br/><br/>Following a thorough search of e-mails and documents held by the Department of Finance and discussions with the Department officials involved, I am informed that the first record relating to the sale of Siteserv is dated 23 March 2012.  This was an e-mail from a member of the public relating to media reports around the sale of Siteserv.  The first parliamentary question was answered on the sale of Siteserv on 3 April 2012 with a further question on the matter answered on 18 April 2012.  It is important to note that my Department conducted a review of the transaction in June 2012 so any concerns around the transaction were not known either to me or to my officials when answering parliamentary questions prior to June 2012.  No further parliamentary questions were answered regarding Siteserv in 2012 or 2013.<br/><br/>Two parliamentary questions were answered on Siteserv in 2014.  The first parliamentary question answered on Siteserv in 2014 was on 21 October 2014, with a further parliamentary question answered on 16 December 2014, which stated &quot;The sale process involved two stages and IBRC was briefed after each stage&rdquo;.  Remember, Siteserv was doing the sale.  Siteserv briefed IBRC after each stage.  It goes on: <blockquote>The board of Siteserv, as advised by KPMG Corporate Finance and Davy Corporate Finance, recommended the successful bid as representing the best return for IBRC.  I am advised that the board of the bank at that time were satisfied that this was the case.  </blockquote>It was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s board, with a chairman appointed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It had fiduciary responsibilities and it assured everybody that the best value was achieved on the sale in the manner in which it was conducted.  Its advisers supported it in this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600036#JJ01300"><p>On 4 March 2015, I next answered a parliamentary question on the relationship framework that was in place when the sale of Siteserv took place.  On 26 March 2015, I next answered three parliamentary questions on Siteserv in which I detailed meetings held between my Department and IBRC on Siteserv and also around the steps that were taken when reports of certain details around the transaction came to the attention of my Department.  A further 30 parliamentary questions have been answered by me since 1 April 2015 up to 30 April 2015 on Siteserv and details relating to the transaction.</p>  <p>  Returning to the period when the deal was first brought to my attention and that of my officials, as my officials became aware of reports of certain aspects of the Siteserv transaction in April and May 2012, they inquired about the transaction with IBRC management as part of their regular engagement.  Following initial discussions, they agreed with IBRC's chairman and CEO on 31 May 2012 that the Department would review the available information on the transaction involving Siteserv in greater detail to better understand the decisions taken and the impact these decisions had on the process and the final recovery for the bank.  This review by Department of Finance officials took place on 11 June 2012.  Through this review, Department of Finance officials became concerned with certain aspects of the transaction.  Details of the concerns were set out in the memos and briefing notes that have been released under recent freedom of information requests and which are available on the Department of Finance website.</p>  <p>  Following this review, on the 25 July 2012, I met with IBRC's chairman and CEO to discuss, among other things, the concerns regarding this transaction which were raised following Department engagement with IBRC management.  At this meeting, the chairman provided me with strong assurances that the transaction had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC board and that the board of IBRC was satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State.  It should be noted that the IBRC board had a fiduciary responsibility to the bank's stakeholders and so, in light of this legal responsibility, the chairman and the board would have considered and provided such assurances following serious and careful consideration.  I accepted these assurances from the chairman of IBRC.  However, as is also evidenced in the information released under freedom of information, engagement continued between Department of Finance officials and senior management of IBRC to improve upon the working relationship with IBRC and to help protect against such concerns arising in the future, including the implementation of the revised relationship framework and the secondment of a senior Department of Finance official to IBRC as a senior executive to facilitate IBRC's ongoing deleveraging.  The senior official remained seconded to IBRC until the liquidation of the bank in February 2013.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in light of the recent concerns raised before the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere regarding the Siteserv transaction and the public discourse this has caused surrounding the handling of other transactions undertaken by IBRC, I have directed the special liquidators of IBRC to review certain transactions which occurred between 21 January 2009, the date of the nationalisation of IBRC, and 7 February 2013, the date of the appointment of the special liquidators to IBRC. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-06a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600036#JJ01500"><p>I will take back a little time.</p>  <p>  The review will cover transactions that resulted in a capital loss to IBRC of at least &euro;10 million during that period or which are specifically identified by the special liquidator as likely to give rise to potential public concern, in respect of the ultimate returns to the taxpayer.  Retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill, will monitor any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the review.  The review and report will evaluate whether there is any evidence of material deficiencies in the performance of their functions by those acting on behalf of IBRC, including the board, directors, management, employees and agents of IBRC and whether it can be concluded that any of the transactions were not commercially sound.  I have asked that the special liquidators carry out this review and provide a report of their findings before 31 August 2015.  Following this, I will make this report available to relevant committees of the Oireachtas.  If the committees still have concerns, they may proceed as they see fit.</p>  <p>  I stress that the commission of this review and report is to serve the public interest in light of recent speculation and is not being undertaken as a result of any evidence that such deficiencies existed or that transactions were not commercially sound.  The special liquidators are best placed to undertake such a review thoroughly and expeditiously given their access to all books and records of IBRC, the resources at their disposal to conduct such a review and the power set out under the IBRC Act, which allows me to make this direction in the public interest.  As I have said, in order to manage and-or mitigate against any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, I have directed, with the agreement of the special liquidators, that retired High Court judge, Mr Justice larfhlaith O'Neill, monitor any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the review.  I am confident that this will ensure that the review process is robust.</p>  <p>  As mentioned, I have given the special liquidators a deadline of 31 August 2015 to complete the review and report their findings.  I have already received correspondence from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform requesting a copy of the full report once completed and a copy will be made available to the committee for its consideration.  Depending on the findings of the review, further investigations will be initiated as and if appropriate.  The Government is fully committed to taking whatever steps are deemed necessary to facilitate this, including legislative change.</p></speech>
