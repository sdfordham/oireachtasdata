    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500003#A00200"><p>Parents of children with special needs simply face too many barriers and obstacles to accessing services, including school placements, respite, proper and timely assessments, and basic equipment and aids to help their children get through the daily tasks of life.</p>  <p>  For example, the number of children who are waiting for appropriate occupational therapy assessment is extraordinary.  Nationally, 4,640 children have been waiting for more than a year for their first OT assessment despite the Disability Act 2005 stipulating a statutory requirement of three months.  In counties Cork and Kerry, which are the worst, well over 1,700 have been waiting for longer than that period for occupational therapy assessment.  Up to 60 children in one school are on a waiting list with no special school placement available to them.  Some 14,000 are waiting for speech and language assessment.  There is no certainty and parents are facing terrible anxiety.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, the therapy services are critical.  The assessment and the subsequent access to services are critical to children.  Those awaiting OT assessment include children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, dyspraxia and spina bifida.  The lack of prioritisation in this area is a shocking indictment of what is going on.</p>  <p>  Up to 30 parents have been waiting for two years to get a single weekend of respite.  Due to cuts to its funding, the disability organisation had to apply a chronological dividing line.  That was only resolved last week after we had to bring the parents' representatives to Dublin to meet the Minister of State with responsibility for those with special needs, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Those parents of children with severe and profound autism have been without respite for two to three years.  It should not take that long and the dynamic of a meeting to kick the system into action to provide for them.</p><p> Last week I met parents of a young child with muscular dystrophy.  There is an extraordinary rationing and medieval bureaucratic system around applications for aids and appliances.  I am talking about wheelchairs, specialist footwear for a child with muscular dystrophy and particular body suits that prevent scoliosis or other complications arising.  I put it to the Taoiseach that a fundamental and comprehensive look needs to be taken at timely access for such services for children.  The mindset and the attitude has to change and the barriers have to be taken down.  Parents of children with special needs are still saying that they are facing too many barriers as well as huge stress and anxiety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500004#B00200"><p>I agree this is a matter that has been examined over the years.  The Government has adopted the findings of Eamon Stack's report in respect of access to services in schools for children with intellectual challenges which will eliminate many of the problems that have been around for a long time.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of the existing therapy resources which are available to teams and spread geographically for children from birth to 18 years.  As the Deputy is aware, the objective of that model of assessment is to provide a single and clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend, in order to streamline this.  Evidence from the areas will show that implementation of the programme will have a positive impact.  It has taken quite a while to get to this point.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned respite.  The HSE and the agencies it funds provide respite care to children and adults with disabilities.  It is clear there are challenges.  Respite can occur in a variety of settings for any length of time depending on the needs of the family and the resources that are available.  It is not always centre-based.  It can be provided in a number of ways, including out of home, in home, home to home, home support and family support.  As part of the continuum of services for families, respite helps prevent out-of-home placements, preserves the family unit and supports family stability.  While the situation outlined by the Deputy is not as satisfactory as one would wish, the HSE is aware of the importance of the provision of respite to families of both children and adults with disabilities and the impact of the absence of respite service provision on other services.</p>  <p>  It does not necessarily cease once a person reaches the age of 18 but this will depend on the availability of resources.  As a result of the number of respite beds being used for long-term residential placements, the number of people with disabilities in receipt of residential respite services and the corresponding number of respite nights are down against previous activity.  This reflects new models of respite care that are now being delivered to home respite and extended day care, etc.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raises an important consideration, particularly for the families and the young people involved.  However, it depends on the availability of trained staff and resources which is why the structure has changed.  It is hoped that over time it will be far more streamlined and deliver a more effective service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500004#B00300"><p>The bottom line is that it simply is not working.  I refer to the case of a young child of two and a half years who needs an assessment application.  The child attended in June 2016 and the family were told it would be dealt with on 23 September.  They were then told in November by an assessment officer that there was a five month delay and that she was processing number 482.  This child was number 981.  Eventually, the family got a private assessment only to be told that an early intervention ASD unit cannot be made available because there must be a HSE assessment.  These are the kind of cases that Deputies are picking up throughout the country.  There are long waits for assessment and an inability to access services.</p><p>Marian House is the autism centre for assessment in Cork South Lee.  The last paragraph of a letter that admittedly was sent last year reads:</p><blockquote>Currently in Marian House there are only 8 whole time equivalent post to 770 children.  This scarce resource is divided into three teams to support children from time of diagnosis...  The situation is out of ... control ... we are sorry we are unable to offer a comprehensive service which you and your child deserve and require.</blockquote><p>Last year, it sent a letter in which it stated it had only eight whole-time equivalent posts for 770 children.  This scarce resource, the letter continued, is divided into three teams to support children from timely diagnosis.  It describes the situation as out of control and apologises for being unable to offer the comprehensive service the recipient and child deserve and require. </p> <p> A similar story applies in other areas.  In one area, 800 children are waiting for an autism assessment.  I could go on.  The system is not working.  There is no point in talking about models when urgent intervention is required.  It should not have to be deputation after deputation going to Ministers to get these issues resolved.  The issues must be dealt with comprehensively. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500005#C00200"><p>The Deputy will be aware of the very close collaboration between the health and education sectors on children's disabilities in general.  This is facilitated by the cross-sectoral team on the implementation of the Disability Act comprised of representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which has been established to progress specific cases.</p>  <p>  The full implementation of the progressing disability services programme is expected before the end of 2017.  A total of &euro;8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014-15 to fund 200 additional posts to deal with the backlog to which the Deputy referred.  A further &euro;4 million in additional funding was provided for 75 therapy posts in 2016.  It is expected that the reconfiguration of these services will have a significant impact. </p>  <p>  In 2013, there were 260 prioritised front-line primary care posts, including 52 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists.  The aim was to address the waiting list to which the Deputy referred.  In 2016, &euro;4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary and social care for children aged up to 18 years.  This represents a long-term investment in speech and language capacity which will be maintained through this year and in the years ahead. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500005#C00300"><p>The Good Friday Agreement is the institutional, constitutional and legal framework which defines the relationship within the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  I do not believe for one moment that the Government has truly absorbed this new reality.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty.  The Taoiseach has co-equal status with the British Prime Minister and a co-equal responsibility to uphold, implement and promote all aspects of this new relationship.  The biggest threat to the Agreement, the new relationship and the social and economic future of the people of this island is presented by Brexit.  I am sure the Taoiseach and I agree on that at least.  The British Government has ignored the vote of people in the North and London is intent on pulling that part of our island out of the European Union despite the dire consequences this will have for everyone across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been critical of the Government's failure to hold the British Government to account for its polices in Ireland.  Its approach to Brexit, the vote in the North and the Border is a monumental example of this failure.  There is a crying need for a special designated status for the North within the European Union, but the Taoiseach has refused to accept or promote this position despite the vote of the people of the North and the majority support for this position in the Oireachtas and Assembly.  He has also refused to advocate this position despite the fact that every citizen of the North has a right to Irish citizenship and a legal expectation that the Government will uphold his or her rights, which include the right to European citizenship after Brexit. </p>  <p>  Let us contrast the Government's position, which is contained in Article 11 of the draft European Council negotiating guidelines, with Article 22, which contains the Spanish Government's position.  Article 11 is ambiguous, opaque, conditional and qualified, whereas Article 22 is extremely clear, stating that after Brexit, no agreement between the European Union and British Government may apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the Spanish and British Governments.  This is exactly the type of veto the Government should have sought in keeping with its responsibilities for the North under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is also the best negotiating position to minimise the dire consequences of Brexit for all the people of this island. </p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach ever said to the British Government that is should accept the vote of the people of the North?  He can tell me; nobody else is listening.</p><p>Has the Taoiseach ever put that point to the British Government?<br/><br/>These are draft EU Council guidelines and, therefore, they can be amended.  The Taoiseach has the time to amend them.  Will he commit to looking for an amendment as I have set out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500006#D00200"><p>The Deputy and I differ on a number of issues in this regard.  He does not believe that the Government is serious about dealing with Northern Ireland and the citizens of Northern Ireland.  I disagree fundamentally with his political comment in that regard.  He is the president and leader of his party and he has a specific responsibility now to see that an Executive is put in place in Northern Ireland, irrespective of his differences with the DUP, in order that we can have a functioning Executive that will, hopefully, put together a set of common objectives as to what the people of Northern Ireland regard as their priorities in respect of the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be well aware the people in the Republic voted for the abolition of Articles 2 and 3 on the basis that the Good Friday Agreement means that Northern Ireland is regarded as part of the United Kingdom until the people decide otherwise.  The position there is that what I want to see in the final outcome of the negotiated documents is the language of the Agreement, which allows for the opportunity at some future time for the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic to vote in a referendum to have a united Ireland and that there can be a seamless readmission of an area that is part of the United Kingdom by virtue of the Good Friday Agreement being recognised, in the same as Scotland is, as a member of the European Union without having to invoke Article 49.  I hope the Deputy in his discussions with his party will see to it that, irrespective of political differences, a functioning Executive is put together as quickly as possible, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is available to help in every way in that regard because it is important.</p>  <p>  I pointed out yesterday that Northern Ireland is different from Gibraltar.  Gibraltar joined the EU as part of the UK and any change in its status is a matter for bilateral consideration between the Kingdom of Spain and the UK.  It is very different from Northern Ireland where we have an internationally legally binding agreement voted on by referendum, North and South.  The people of Northern Ireland voted in the expectation and the understanding that their EU membership benefits would continue and they will continue.  I have said to the British Prime Minister and her predecessor that the people in Northern Ireland have a very definite point of view and that since the Brexit referendum, of course, I recognise that Northern Ireland voted to stay, as did the people in Scotland.  First Minister Sturgeon is now on the path of looking for a second independence referendum.</p>  <p>  I follow the Good Friday Agreement and our job as co-guarantor of that is to see that all the issues relevant to the Agreement are implemented in full.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500006#D00300"><p>I will not take lectures from the Taoiseach about my responsibilities or, indeed, the responsibilities of Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are very aware of those and we look to his Government to uphold its end of all that.</p>  <p>  However, he refused to answer my question.  I asked him where he has said to the British Government that it should accept the vote of the people of the North.  The Taoiseach clearly did not put that position but the main thrust of what I was trying to say was that these are draft negotiating guidelines and he has the opportunity to secure a stronger position.  For example, he may know that the European Parliament voted earlier on a joint resolution, which contains stronger commitments about the North and the island of Ireland than either the Government's position or these guidelines.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Taoiseach knows that the only way to stop a hard economic border on the island of Ireland is to have special status for the North within the EU.  I come back to what I said previously.  The Taoiseach should have been seeking the type of position which the Spanish secured.  His answer shows he does not understand his responsibility as Taoiseach under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement because there is now a new relationship.  He has equal responsibility along with the British Government for all of this new relationship.  Will the Taoiseach commit to looking for an amendment between now and 29 April?  He should say "yes" or "no".</p><p>Will the Taoiseach commit to that?  Will he say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;?</p></speech>

I fully understand my responsibilities here.  These are draft guidelines and they are to be signed off by the Council of the European Union on 29 April.  They are draft guidelines.  There are 26 other countries involved with their particular points of view and one of those countries is Spain.  The Spanish position in respect of Gibraltar is an entirely different concept from that which applies in the case of Northern Ireland.  The Deputy is aware of the Good Friday Agreement.  He is aware of a referendum, North and South.  He is aware -----</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is aware that the Labour Party published draft terms of reference for such a review last weekend.  We have seen no similar draft terms of reference from the Government.  I will meet with the T&aacute;naiste later today and I understand other bilateral meetings with the other leaders will also happen.  We will support this process if we are satisfied it is fully independent and will lead to the necessary reforms that there is a consensus on in the House and among the public.  At this stage, it is important the review gets under way.  What I have not seen in the papers is any urgency to implement the existing proposals for reform.</p>  <p>  We have spoken in this Chamber many times about the many existing recommendations the Garda Inspectorate has published.  We debated them during my time in Government and more recently in this House.  There is no recent implementation update on those groundbreaking, important, specific recommendations.  It is clear to me the commitment to reform at management level within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is limited.  In addition to our proposals on an independent review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we proposed that the powers of the Policing Authority be expanded.  These powers must include giving the Policing Authority the capacity to direct An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the proposals made by the Garda Inspectorate.  I am glad to see this proposal has gathered support from other parties in the House.  Does the Taoiseach agree this change to the powers of the Policing Authority is needed?  Will he task the T&aacute;naiste with drafting the necessary legislative changes to allow this as a matter of urgency and in the meantime will he arrange for an urgent implementation update to be published on each of the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate setting out what has been implemented to date, which ones are in the process of being implemented, including a clear timeline for each, and what are simply being ignored?</p></speech>

One of the reasons the Government did not sign off finally yesterday in respect of a root and branch reform of the structure and future policing operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that, as I informed the House yesterday, I received the final report of the Fennelly commission last Friday at 6 p.m.</p><p>I am duty-bound by law to refer that report to the Attorney General, and I intend to publish that report as soon as the Attorney General informs me that it is in order to do so.  The reason that it has to go to the Attorney General is as to whether a question arises that there might be implications in respect of any pending case, legal or whatever.  I hope that can apply this week, and it would be wrong of me to come into the House, or for the T&aacute;naiste to come into the House, and say that we are now signing off on all of the issues in respect of future structures for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, policing arrangements and so on without taking into account the potential impact of the recommendations that are contained in the final report of the Fennelly commission.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste has undertaken to talk to the Opposition Members and spokespersons on justice so that the Oireachtas can have a complete view on this, and that is why I say that, when I receive authorisation to publish Fennelly in its final entity, everybody should have an opportunity to read that and see whether people have views as to how that impacts on the-----</p></speech>

That is a five-year programme with 73 recommendations in it.  The current district model of policing will be replaced on a phased basis with a divisional one, where responsibilities are allocated on a functional rather than a geographical basis subject to modifications to meet the needs of large rural divisions and ensure that the close relationship with communities is maintained, which is so important.  In line with international experience, a mid-term goal of 20% of civilians for the overall Garda workforce is to be achieved through a civilian-by-default policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, a redeployment of garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  Mr. Olson, who is in charge of the inspectorate, has been very clear on these things.  Ongoing work to increase the Garda workforce to 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians, is all under way.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about publishing the progress that there has been, and that is very important.  I will see that the T&aacute;naiste responds to that comprehensively.</p></speech>

A number of vacancies have been advertised by the Policing Authority.  Following the Government's decision, the nature of appointments at senior level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the future will be independent of the Garda Commissioner and Government of the day.

These are the same banks that we, the public, bailed out to the tune of billions of euro.  Some 17,000 mortgages have been found to be affected thus far and there are more than 2 million accounts being queried and examined.  This has the potential to be a &euro;500 million scandal.  Mortgage holders have been over-charged to the tune of &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000.  All 15 lenders are involved, including Allied Irish Bank and Permanent TSB which we, the State, own.  Two of the 15 lenders have confirmed that 15 families have lost their homes and a further 14 are facing repossessions.  As we have details from only two banks, this is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg.  Most, if not all, of the houses repossessed have been repossessed by the original lenders, the banks which did the damage originally.</p>  <p>  According to a statement made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Lane, there is a systemic and widespread aspect to the tracker scandal.  He has said, "Underneath it all ... this is a cultural issue which is interpreting contracts in favour of the lender and not in favour of the customer".  He has further stated that he could not rule out the hypothesis of collusion between some lenders.  In view of those statements and this scandal will the Taoiseach ensure that free, professional legal and financial advice is made available to the mortgage holders affected?  Will he give an assurance that the banks will be instructed to stop insisting that hard pressed families sign away their legal rights in order to access any degree of compensation and that any such signature already provided by defrauded borrowers will be rendered null and avoid?  Will he also, through the Minister for Justice and Equality, ask the Garda fraud squad to call in the chief executives of the banks concerned for questioning with a view to prosecution for fraud?</p></speech>

Nobody wants to see people lose their homes.  The number of mortgages in distress has fallen substantially from what it was a number of years ago because of the various options put in place by Government at different times to help different categories of mortgage holders under pressure and cases in distress.  A number of people have voluntarily given up their homes and others have availed of the services of MABS and other elements of support that have been provided by Government and the line Department.  The  allegation of illegal activities in respect of tracker mortgages will be followed-through.</p>  <p>  Deputy Healy will be aware that any person who has a difficulty with his or her mortgage is eligible for assistance in terms of financial and legal advice and to have representation made available to them to negotiate directly with the lenders in these cases.</p><p>Unfortunately, in some cases there have not been any consultations or conversations between lenders and borrowers.  At the end of the day, these things always have to be sorted out through some mediation facility.  The Government has made a range of such facilities available.  I hope people continue to avail of them.  We would like to see as many of these cases as possible sorted out so that people can continue to live in their own homes.</p></speech>

We are talking about illegality on the part of the banks leading to mortgage distress and, in many cases, to the repossession of family homes and borrowers losing their properties.  We learned from the banking inquiry that the culture permeating the banks was also endemic in the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  There is no guarantee that existing regulations will be implemented by any branch of the financial elites.  The Government's task is to prevent fraud and, when fraud takes place, to prosecute those responsible.  It is possible that the delay in ordering a Garda fraud investigation into this matter has already led to the destruction or alteration of relevant records with a view to blaming subordinates.  Will the Taoiseach order an immediate criminal investigation to prevent any further cover-ups in this regard?  Will he sack the highly paid public interest directors and Government nominees on the boards of these banks who failed to bring this matter to the attention of the Legislature?</p></speech>

In other words, the criminal law will rightly apply in all cases where illegal activity has taken place.</p></speech>

Everybody will have been absolutely appalled and horrified by yesterday's barbaric attack on innocent civilians, including many children, in Syria.  Up to 100 people were killed and over 250 people were injured.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline what the Government intends to do to fulfil the programme for Government commitment with respect to the UN and the OSCE.  Certain key countries that have been supportive of Syria must be held to account.  There must be a degree of accountability regarding chemical attacks of this kind.  As we all recall, the then US President said in 2012 that this was a red-line issue.  Nothing happened as a result of that.  People think they can act with impunity.  It is important for the international community to stand firm on this issue.  It needs to begin to engage in mechanisms to deal with it.</p></speech>

He has attended all the Foreign Affairs Council meetings.  Syria has always been on the agenda.  From an Irish point of view, the Minister has been very forthright in his comments at these meetings.  The entire UN, which was created for a world that no longer exists, needs to be able to reflect on what is happening.  The situation in Syria is appalling.  According to news reports, the war has gone on longer than the lives of many of the young children who are now the victims of chemical attacks.  This is absolutely appalling.  It has to be condemned unreservedly by right-thinking people.  The Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union, on which we are represented by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is very forthright in its views.  My view is that the UN needs reform to be far more effective in dealing with appalling actions like this.</p></speech>

In that context and in the context of dealing for once and for all with the very delicate and sensitive issue of the horrific legacy in Northern Ireland, in what is not a post-conflict society, there is a need to ensure that the many thousands of victims and families, and survivors are dealt with in a way that real.  The international treaty to which the Deputy referred is an important component of that, but other issues are the subject matter of discussions today in Belfast.  I intend to be present at a meeting tomorrow.  It is incumbent on everybody involved to ensure that the legacy institutions, as established under the Stormont House Agreement, are up and running and implemented at the earliest opportunity.

It is shocking that at least 100 families may have lost their homes because they were wrongly moved from tracker mortgages.  When this matter was raised with the Governor of the Central Bank yesterday in a question posed by Deputy Sean Sherlock, the Governor said he cannot name and shame the 15 lending institutions or the number of accounts involved, or the details of how much compensation was paid, because of a legislative barrier.  In this regard I refer to the financial services and pensions ombudsman Bill, which is on the Government's priority list.  Will this matter be addressed so that the important issues raised by Deputy Healy and me can be dealt with?  People are scandalised that obvious wrongdoing will not only not be investigated but cannot even be reported.</p></speech>

It was an act that I and my party, and more ordinary people than one might think, are prepared to defend because they are appalled by the role of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  Under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, a piece of anti-union legislation inspired by the policies of Mrs. Thatcher's Government in the UK, the action was outside of the law.  Many people said they supported the action but felt it would have been better if some notice had been given. </p><p>However, under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act it is impossible for workers to give advance notice of solidarity action because injunctions can, and will, be put in place.  My question is as follows.  Our party, in the tradition of James Larkin, is in favour of repealing anti-union legislation, including the Industrial Relations Act.

However, her visit here today is on a slightly different and more positive outlook.  Having been in hospital for many years and unable to work, she is now in a position, as a result of Orkambi, where her life is changed and she is trying to get back into the workforce.  On behalf of her and others who are suffering from cystic fibrosis, is the Taoiseach in a position to update us on the progress being made to make Orkambi available to those who would benefit from it?  I recognise it is probably not an appropriate question for the Order of Business.</p></speech>

Eir said that it will do a further 300,000 houses in an area that it was not originally intended to include.  The commercial body will do 300,000 more houses than it had originally intended.  That means that the nature of the contract and tender for areas outside that, to which Deputy McLoughlin refers, is now the subject of an increased focus.  The Minister has pointed out the timescale for the bringing of fibre to each home over the next years, which will ensure that every region of the country, however spread out, will have the opportunity to avail of what is the equivalent of electricity in this day and age.</p></speech>

That is not envisaged here.  What is envisaged is that the outcome of the negotiations will be for the United Kingdom to have as close as possible a relationship with the European Union, of which we are a member.  However, given our traditional connections both with Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom on a bilateral basis we want to hold on to those very close trading, social and political relationships.  It is only in those circumstances that this would apply, and that is not envisaged.</p></speech>

We have had huge problems over a number of years in this country.  Today, in Buswell's hotel across the road, the IFA are launching a framework for negotiations with vulture funds.  We have a situation today where there are hundreds of farmers around the country whose loans have been sold to vulture funds and who cannot get a deal done, as they would have been able to do with the standard banks.  We find that they are now outside the scrutiny of the Central Bank.  It is a huge problem, and one of the things that the IFA has sought is that the Government would publically commit to a rebalancing of the power between the borrowers and these new owners of the loans.  This is having a huge impact.  The vulture funds want a quick turnaround and they are prepared to sell out the farm over the heads of the farmer.  It is a big problem around the country.</p></speech>

This programme covered the situation in Bessborough.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the publication of the second interim report from the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, had indicated that the report would be published at the end of March.  She has now resiled from that commitment and is stalling the publication of the report.  She says that both herself and the Government need more time to consider the recommendations.  That is an entirely unacceptable position to adopt.  The Taoiseach is aware of the trauma that was caused by the discoveries at Tuam.  Naturally, it has triggered deep, personal concerns for the survivors of these awful regimes across the State, and the least the Government owe to society at large is the prompt publication of this interim report so that we can collectively take stock and move forward in the most constructive way possible.</p></speech>

It is right and proper for Government to assess carefully every interim report that comes before it, this one included.  The question arising from the mother and baby homes, as one of a whole series in this general area, is one that needs to be considered very carefully.  I expect that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will bring a memo on this matter before the Government next week, and the report, once Government adopts it, will be published then.</p></speech>

The strategy recommends that appropriately trained staff should be available at primary care level to provide programmes to prevent mental health problems and to promote well being.  Has there been sign-off regarding these counselling or psychological services at primary care level for 2017, and if so how many have been signed off?

It pledged to update the guidelines within three to six months but we are ten months on from its publication and wind farms are being foisted on communities, with plans for more.  There is more stress and division than ever in those communities and they are asking when the Government will get off its hands and publish the guidelines as promised ten months ago.  In my own community in the Finn valley in Donegal, those concerned have already mobilised against and defeated a wind farm application which would have imposed a major wind farm very close to residential premises.  Now, a second wave of applications is coming in for the same type of proposal and residents are looking to Government to protect individuals.  Nobody is against renewable energy, development or infrastructure but we are against these farms being imposed on a community against its will in very close proximity to individuals where there are ample other opportunities to site them.  Can the Taoiseach give clarity on this to the communities in the Finn valley and across the State, who are looking for the Government to fulfil the commitment it gave to them in the programme for Government ten months ago?</p></speech>

In some cases, parents decide that a school is so small they need their children to go to a larger school with better facilities but the Government has a long-standing position of not closing small schools.  Whoever sent the text message needs to be clear about that.  It was not a Government direction.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach says it is not an issue for the Order of Business but it is definitely an issue for this part of today's schedule.  My Bill will, once and for all, regulate vulture funds.</p><p>After a long period of procrastination the previous Government eventually acted to regulate the so-called vulture funds when they were buying up much of the country through the purchase of commercial and residential loan books.  We all know that those are the loan books the banks want off their books.  They are made up of small businesses, farm holdings and mortgage holders struggling with arrears.  In recent years tens of thousands of families woke up to a letter through the door informing them that they now owed money to a company they had not taken out a loan with and one they never heard of or engaged with.  When they tried to contact this company, they could not find an address or even a phone number to make such contact.</p> <p> There was no regulation in place and after much pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in and others in many campaign groups, the previous Government eventually moved to regulate the vultures.  However, what happened next was that the vultures began to lobby.  From responses to parliamentary questions I tabled, we all know the Minister for Finance met the vultures on many occasions and his officials met them even more frequently.  That continues even to this day.</p> <p> Subsequently, the legislation that had originally set out to regulate the vultures was weakened.  It was decided not to regulate the owner of the debt, but instead the middleperson.  Sinn F&eacute;in on Committee Stage defended the interests of those struggling to pay their mortgages and we sought to ensure the owners were regulated.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael and Labour Party members voted against our amendments and the Fianna F&aacute;il members did not turn up at the committee for that part of the proceedings.</p> <p> As a result the vulture funds are not regulated and the middlemen are.  The Central Bank's latest figures, indicating 41% of family mortgages owned by unregulated vulture funds are now in deep arrears, are extremely worrying.  When we hear about banks turning profits and bankers getting grotesque bonuses, we have to remember that they have sold many of the tough cases to the unregulated vultures to deal with.</p> <p> Today I am moving a Bill that seeks to regulate the owners which have bought up and continue to buy up much of the credit of this State.  The half-hearted approach of regulating the middleman has not been enough.  The Central Bank has indicated its support for the approach I have set out, which my party has called for since the issue first raised its head.  The Bill returns to the heads of Bill that the Department of Finance itself produced when it first assessed how to deal with the issue.  This was the plan before the vultures got in the ear of our policymakers.</p> <p> Today I am putting forward one part of a plan, a Bill that I hope can get cross-party support.  However, we need to do far more to clip the vultures' wings.  The Minister needs to take direct and immediate action based on the powers he has.  He needs to direct the banks, in which we have major shareholdings, and NAMA to stop selling to the vultures - no ifs or buts.  He should also act immediately to close down the remaining tax loopholes, such as the CGT exemption that is still open to the vultures that are buying up much of the country tax-free or at a reduced tax rate.</p> <p> I believe there is scope for the Minister to follow Belgium's lead in introducing laws that prevent the use of this country as a base for vulture funds as they attack developing countries throughout the world.  There is a clear set of policies that can clip the vultures' wings, but unfortunately to date the political will has not existed on Government benches to take them on.  That must change and I hope that can begin today.  I hope the Bill can win cross-party support and send out a clear message that a free hand will no longer be given to the vulture funds.</p></speech>

The Bill, as introduced, aims to set up a specially designated commission to review the establishment and boundaries of a demographically proportional town council system.  At the outset, it is important to set out the motivation for a restoration of town councils because many would ask why we would bother with bringing back this level of government.  It is simply because so many other ordinary people have been asking about the neglect and lack of focus for our town centres across Ireland since the town councils were done away with and with them the special budgets for town cores which were vaporised into thin air.</p><p>A democratic system that represents people living in our towns is needed now more than ever because we are moving towards an ever more urbanised Ireland.  Debates in this Chamber concerning rural Ireland are frequent and rightly so but there have been very few about urban Ireland.  When one takes account of the new national framework plan, which will see higher densities and increased urbanisation, the requirement to have people representing these large towns is all the more pressing and critical.</p><p>At the time of the dissolution of more than 80 town councils in 2014 the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, hailed it as reform, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Of course, nobody would mourn the loss of 700 politicians from the political field, but suddenly people living in these towns found that they also lost much more than just councillors as they were part of a much larger geographical electoral area under the reformed system.</p><p>A host of different things went with those councillors.  The dedicated budgets for their towns, in many cases over &euro;10 million per annum, are gone.  Their statutory powers in respect of their own town centres are gone.  The power to set their own rates for their town is gone.  This year small businesses across the country are seeing their rates increased above and beyond normal rates because of equalisation.  The special focus on the urban space is gone.  In the three years since the abolition of town councils people have now realised what a crucial role these bodies actually played in developing life in these urban spaces.</p><p>I unashamedly have a huge passion for the local government system in this country having spent 17 years in it serving at both town and county level, many of those years alongside the Government Chief Whip during her time on Meath County Council.  I understand the value of having a strong town council structure that can look after the many urban areas in our country, and the unique challenges and requirements for people living in our towns.</p><p>During my time on both councils I can recall when our county council was mired in debt but our town council was actually running a surplus.  This meant we were able to raise our own finance to develop a new arts centre, parks and enhanced urban spaces.  We did not have to go to elected members from other areas to sanction finance for what was needed in our own town for our own people.</p><p>The rest of Europe embraces the local government structure.  In the United Kingdom efforts are under way to try to reinvigorate this very local layer of government.  However, in this country instead of embracing it we squeeze the life out of it and then mock its corpse by calling it reform as we continue the drive towards centralisation.  Despite the constitutional guarantees that buttress local authorities in Ireland it remains susceptible to the legislative reforms from central government.  The perceived control that central government has over the local level was the focus of a report from the Council of Europe in 2013 which highlighted the need for greater protection for the subsidiarity principle in government.  In addition to the structural changes implemented in the Local Government Reform Act, it also did very little to reverse the overarching power that central government has over the policy framework for local government.</p><p>As I outlined earlier, the Bill as introduced aims to set up a specially designated commission to review the establishment and boundaries of a demographically proportional town council system.  The commission will also be tasked with setting out the proposed functions, responsibilities and rating powers of a town council and their composition and size.  The commission will be required to report to the Minister within six months of its establishment.</p><p>The Bill is designed to set up a new town council system on a fair and equitable basis across Ireland in time for the 2019 local elections.  It will help to empower communities in our towns to take control of their local areas.  It will ensure the new structure recognises the major population shift in Ireland and put forward a new range of powers for a tier of governance closest to our citizens.  This measure will help give power back to local communities at a time when more and more people feel alienated and removed from the decision-making process that affects them.</p></speech>

It is absolutely extraordinary.  Even more extraordinary, the Taoiseach does not know when the next meeting will be.</p> <p> I want an answer to a very specific question.  In my experience, it is unprecedented to table a parliamentary question and not get an answer within four or five days.  I have raised this on several occasions.  I tabled a parliamentary question on 23 February - I want to know if the Taoiseach's committee discussed this - asking how many people under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality were suspended on full pay pending investigation.  I received an answer stating it was 26.  I asked a follow-up question, which was whether the Minister could give a breakdown of the agencies under the Department of Justice and Equality in which these suspensions took place, the grade involved and the length of time the suspensions were in play.  The Minister told me that she could not answer me.  I find it completely unacceptable that she refuses to give me information.  I do not believe that she does not have the information.  To be frank, I suspect the information is being withheld because it is relevant to the question of whether N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan should remain in position when she is under investigation for very serious matters.</p></speech>

The Government has responded to the issues that have arisen in recent times in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in terms of fixed charge notices and mandatory alcohol testing.  The Government has responded and not just a Cabinet sub-committee, which is a feature of Government that allows for issues to be discussed and recommendations to be made for consideration by Cabinet.  As I pointed out, the Government has decided that there should be a root and branch analysis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of its structures and the policing role and responsibility.  This will deal with the management and structures for all functions carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the composition, recruitment and training of personnel; the culture and the ethos of policing; and the structures and the legislative basis for oversight and accountability.  This is to be carried out completely independently of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I assume the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers is one that he tabled.  The committee does not discuss questions submitted by Deputies to the relevant Minister which go through the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

It is clear that all reform efforts up to now have failed and the Garda Inspectorate reforms have not been implemented.  I put it to the Taoiseach that it is extraordinary given the revelations about the latest debacle of 146,000 being wrongly summonsed to court, 14,700 being wrongly convicted and close to 1 million breathalyser tests that never took place having been falsely recorded.  The Garda Commissioner stated that they are organisationally shameful, were false and, at worst, there was deception, and, at best, incompetence.  Given the scale of the falsehoods involved and the disruption to the criminal justice system, does the Taoiseach consider it acceptable that the Garda Commissioner did not inform the Minister of it and did not inform the Policing Authority that such an audit was under way?    Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Policing Authority about it?  What is the Government's sense of the failure of the Commissioner to inform the Policing Authority?  I do not want to be fobbed off with "an administrative oversight" because I do not buy it.  Given the scale of the falsehoods and the undermining of the criminal justice system, why the Policing Authority was not informed about this matter is a very serious issue.</p></speech>

I was a member of the last justice reform committee.  The Government does not have at its meetings the Garda Commissioner, the chairperson of the Policing Authority or the senior administrators in the Department of Justice and Equality, all of whom should have been there to answer questions of key Ministers in advance of any decisions being made at Cabinet.  Did the Taoiseach not see it as appropriate to convene a meeting where all those principals would be present to answer questions such as the one just asked by Deputy Martin?  Before the Cabinet could come to profound decisions such as whether to have a Patten-style root and branch commission, surely the precursor would have been to have at least one but probably a series of meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee asking the views of the Policing Authority, asking the Commissioner questions directly and asking the Department of Justice and Equality those questions.  I welcome the Taoiseach's response this morning that he will shortly publish an implementation plan.  However, does he agree that in the interim we also need amendments to the powers of the Policing Authority to make directions on reform to be implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

The Garda Inspectorate has made its views known and we considered those views at the Cabinet sub-committee.  The question now is one of getting on with implementing those changes and that work is under way.  The programme is for a couple of years, as the Deputy is aware.  We discussed the issue of civilianisation, which means taking garda&iacute; out of the system so that they can be on the beat by replacing them with civilians.  The Olson report is very comprehensive and is being followed through.  I will provide everyone with an update on that. </p></speech>

The reputation of the whole system of justice has never been so low, yet the Taoiseach has not bothered to convene a committee on which key players sit and is choosing not to use the forum in question.  If the Government is looking after all of this, why is the Taoiseach persisting with the fallacy that it is possible to investigate the most senior garda in the land, while leaving her <i>in situ</i>, with all of her authority, to undermine the investigation?</p><p>We had the recent revelations, with Sergeant Maurice McCabe and others being blackguarded.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the position of Garda Superintendent Dave Taylor who, having been arrested over leaking information about another Garda scandal four years ago, returned to work on 14 February last only to have a fresh disciplinary case brought against him on the very same matter by the same Commissioner?</p><p>It seems Fine Gael is doing its best to defend the Garda Commissioner and keep her in place, with Fianna F&aacute;il seemingly happy to facilitate it in doing so.  We are hearing disturbing reports of what garda&iacute; are describing internally as a praetorian guard around the Commissioner.  Two retired garda&iacute; have been brought in to protect the Commissioner.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a communication has been sent to every single garda who could testify to the Charleton investigation stating that he or she must liaise with the internal committee the Taoiseach was not even told about before testifying to the commission?  Was the Taoiseach aware of this or did the Commissioner not bother telling him about it?  The Commissioner hired two retired garda&iacute; and did not bother informing the Government about it.  She is clearly giving the proverbial two fingers to any idea that she will be neutral while this investigation takes place.  I am surprised the Taoiseach has not convened the committee to ask her about this matter.</p></speech>

The Labour Party is now proposing a root and branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, having voted against such a review in government when we made a similar proposal.  Some of this goes back before my time.  According to the 2015 report from the Garda Inspectorate, a significant number of the recommendations in its report had been made in one form or another over the past two decades.  This takes us back to Fianna F&aacute;il whose position is that it is unable to express confidence in the Commissioner and would remove her if it was in government.  However, the party has also indicated it will not support a motion requiring the Government to do exactly that.</p><p>As a result of the Government's rejection of root and branch, Patten style reform, the Commissioner is answerable to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than an independent policing authority with real powers.  The Government is not approaching this issue as it should, nor did it deal with the case of the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, and previous Garda Commissioner as it should have.  I do not have any great confidence that it will approach this issue properly.</p><p>While we were told the Cabinet was briefed on the establishment of a commission to examine the future of policing, we were not told whether this came from the Cabinet committee on justice reform.  Did the committee discuss this issue at its meeting of 7 March?  The Taoiseach does not even have a date for the next meeting of the committee.  </p><p>This is a case of &quot;I told you so&quot; because the previous Government dismissed our proposal in the most defensive, triumphalist and dismissive way when it had a large majority and did not have to listen to Sinn F&eacute;in or anyone else in opposition.  Now the decent members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those who depend on them to keep the peace and keep us safe have been let down.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the Cabinet is the body which makes the ultimate decisions in respect of all Cabinet committees.  That is why it was one of the many discussions that took place at Cabinet and the decision was to have a root and branch analysis of the future of policing, the structure, role and responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on.  The decision involved the Oireachtas which is the reason Opposition spokespersons and leaders, including Deputy Adams, will have their say.  When the Attorney General advises publication of the second Fennelly report, they will be given copies and will be able to take the report into account.  This is to ensure that we, as an Oireachtas, get the future structure, role, responsibility and work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na right and citizens can have confidence and trust in the body.</p>  <p>  That is not to say that this is a whole new body of work.  As I pointed out to Deputy Howlin, the recommendations of the independent inspectorate are now being implemented.  The independent Policing Authority, with which Deputy Howlin had a very close association when it was being set up, came into effect last year under the supervision of its chairperson, Josephine Feehily, who is doing a first class job in its independence and oversight.  The T&aacute;naiste is not averse to giving the authority extra powers and she will take advice from Members on that matter.</p></speech>

I acknowledged the constructive tone of the Article 50 letter and the references to Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We discussed the next steps in the Brexit process and agreed to maintain close contact at political and official level.  We also discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland.</p><p>It has been clear from the start that the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union will have significant economic, political and social implications for Ireland.  The Government has been working very hard for more than two years, even before the UK referendum, to engage with all sectors across the island of Ireland, fully analyse our main areas of concern and develop our negotiating priorities.  These are to minimise the impact on our trade and the economy; protect the Northern Ireland peace process, including through maintaining an open Border; continue the common travel area with the United Kingdom; and work for a positive future for the European Union.</p><p>The Government and UK Government are agreed that a close and friction-free economic and trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, is in our best interests.  We note that our particular concerns, including in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, were acknowledged by Prime Minister May in her letter.  They were also reflected in last week's resolution on Brexit by the European Parliament and they are set out in the draft guidelines circulated by President Tusk, which are to be finalised at a meeting of the 27 member states on 29 April.  The consistent, strong acknowledgement of the Irish issues in each of these documents is evidence of the extensive engagement by Ireland with our partners at political, democratic and official level in recent months.  As I stated the other day, now that Article 50 has been triggered, we will publish shortly before the European Council meeting on 29 April a consolidated paper providing more detail about our priorities and approach to the negotiations ahead.</p><p>A report on the civic dialogue process to date is available on <i>merrionstreet.ie</i>.  Further all-island civic dialogue events and consultations will be held, as required, in the coming months.</p></reply>

We spent some time on this yesterday and we had a debate on Brexit.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on a question I asked?  Will he seek an explicit reference to the continued EU citizenship of Northern Ireland residents post-2019 in the Union's negotiation instructions?  This has implications far beyond what would happen if there was reunification.  The German unification which the Taoiseach referenced yesterday involved the creation of new EU citizens.  In this case, we are talking about people who today are EU citizens and we want their continued rights to that citizenship protected.  That has many practical implications for the negotiations, including freedom of residence in the Union and guaranteeing access to services.  Will the Taoiseach propose an amendment in the draft negotiating guidelines to include an explicit reference to the continued EU citizenship of residents of Northern Ireland?</p>  <p>  With regard to the consolidated paper, what are the key areas that need to be addressed?  Has the Taoiseach pursued special status and a special trading zone on this island?  Will the paper detail the Government's approach to key issues such as trade between the island of Ireland and the UK in a post-Brexit scenario where there could be tariffs and where Britain could be outside the customs union?</p></speech>

Since the referendum outcome, our priority has been to ensure the terms of the Agreement are both recognised and accommodated in the final settlement between the UK and the EU.  We have engaged extensively with the EU and its institutions about this and there is now a recognition at European level of the importance of the Agreement and its understanding.  As co-guarantor of that, we will work to see that those provisions are protected.</p>  <p>  The legal provisions governing citizenship and citizenship through naturalisation are set out in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Any person living on the island of Ireland, one of whose parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen, is entitled to Irish citizenship by descent and may make an application for a passport directly to the Passport Office.  Similarly, any person born on the island of Ireland prior to 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship and, therefore, European citizenship and may also make an application for a passport directly to the Passport Office.  Post 1 January 2005, the entitlement to Irish citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland to non-national parents is governed by sections 6A and 6B of the 1956 Act, as amended.  The Act states: "A person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years."</p>  <p>  Citizenship through the naturalisation process, on the other hand, is based, among other factors, on the individual having the required lawful residence in the jurisdiction of the State.  The Act requires a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application for naturalisation and during the eight years immediately preceding that period to have a further total residence in the State amounting to four years.  That relates to the technical issues.</p>  <p>  We want to protect the common travel area arrangements.  The point the Deputy raised will be followed through by me in these negotiations.</p></speech>

That has to be done in sufficient time to allow those of us who want to persuade the Government of the need to make amendments to the draft EU guidelines to do so because, as I said during Leaders' Questions, we are not satisfied that these guidelines are clear enough or that they go far enough.  It remains my position - I do not mean this to be offensive - that the Taoiseach and the Government do not understand the huge shift in the relationships within the island and between the two islands since the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government is not just able to make declarations at this time without the Government having co-equal status to deal with it on that basis.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach earlier differentiated between the case of Gibraltar and that of the North.  Of course, there is a difference.  The difference is that the Spanish Government believes that Gibraltar is part of its sovereign territory.  Whether it is or not is another issue but that is what the government believes.  However, our Government has to believe, as many of the people of the island believe, that the island of Ireland should have territorial sovereignty and in the processes set out under the Good Friday Agreement, we have a responsibility - the Government specifically has a constitutional responsibility - to advance that objective.  On Saturday last, on a radio programme with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he reminded us that Fine Gael is The United Ireland Party.  Let us see some evidence of that.</p>  <p>  We need to have the time, the forum and the ability to look again at what the Government will bring forward and the space that will allow us to make specific amendments in order that we can influence the outcome.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that he will do all of this in that spirit?</p></speech>

He has written to some Members of the European Parliament and has expressed his view that both the Irish and British Governments have reneged on their responsibilities in so far as the Good Friday Agreement is concerned.

However, in respect of the potential for a united Ireland, the visionaries who put the Good Friday Agreement together foresaw a time when that may become a decision to be made by the people of the North and the people of the Republic.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that there will be time to consider the consolidated paper, and rightly so, because these are the most important negotiations, both between Ireland and the UK and between the UK and the EU, of which we will continue to be a member, for many years.  They will impact on all our citizens for many years to come and, therefore, everybody should have their say.</p></speech>

Prime Minister May is in the <i>Financial Times</i>today saying a trade deal will not come until after the Brexit talks are finished and that is probably right.  There is a whole range of other standards we will have to get co-operation on in energy, digital services, environmental rules and so on.  It does not make sense for our strategy to be, first, to talk for six months about whether the UK will pay its exit bill and on the divorce terms and then to start talking about certain areas of co-operation.  The Taoiseach should be proactive when it comes to the Council meeting.  His officials should set up a safe space in advance in which to discuss some of the standards that are set by the European Union.  They should not go into the sensitive area of tariffs or the detailed trade arrangements.  There are certain key standards we need agreement on in how energy markets work and in how digital services, privacy and other rules are set and agreed.  It is in our interests, with the greatest risk at play, to get those standards and a safe space in which to talk about them straight away in the negotiations rather than waiting six months in what is already a very tight timetable.  Would the Taoiseach agree to such a negotiating approach?  Will he push it at the Council?</p></speech>

Article 50 sets out the process for the so-called divorce proceedings over a two-year period.  If they are not concluded within that period, an extension can only happen with the unanimous support of the European Council which I assume would be given.  The article also clearly states the future framework of the future relationship must be taken into account.  These two things confuse lots of people because on the one hand we say we will talk only about the exit strategy and wait until it is concluded before we start talking about the future strategy and yet, on the other hand, Article 50 itself says we must take into account what the future framework is.  It may well be that when the European Council comes together on 29 April to sign off on the negotiating foundations there will be some discussion about whether we do this on the basis of a series of pillars that move forward together in respect of the divorce proceedings as distinct from the future trading relationship which is the fundamental issue that will follow.  My view is if we focus exclusively on the question of what the assessment of charges might be for the British Government and these are principles and modalities to be followed it would be far better to talk about a range of issues in respect of the exit process by the United Kingdom before we run into any particular stone walls.  The Deputy raised a question about common positions.  Energy, water and animal health are issues that could be considered for an all-island situation here.</p>  <p>  The European Union of 27 has its own agenda - the Single Market, the single digital market, the capital markets and how we continue to invest for prosperity and future job opportunities.  It is the European Union agenda for the future.  The question here is to negotiate what the future relationship of the United Kingdom will be with those 27, one of which will be Ireland.  It is a common agenda of the 27.  The future framework and that structure of negotiation between the UK and the European Union is one where the negotiations will obviously get into serious detail in the time ahead.</p></speech>

Right now, the European Parliament is debating its comprehensive resolution.  It is interesting to hear Deputy Ryan talk about bilateral discussions on key elements of what would be a new <i>acquis</i>.  The European Parliament points out it would be contrary to European law for any individual country to have any such bilateral discussions and that it can only be done on a unilateral-multilateral basis through the 27.  Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator, speaking in the European Parliament today, said very incisively of the trade agreement that the devil will be in the detail.  There is no expectation that this will be done within the timeframe.  The reality is if there is no deal and no withdrawal agreement there will be an automatic disorderly exit on 30 March 2019 which is now under two years away.  Does the Taoiseach expect there to be a withdrawal agreement within the two-year timeframe?  Does he expect that subsequent to that there will be a transition agreement?  Is it his understanding it is what will currently be worked upon?  What sort of a timeframe does he envisage for transitional arrangements before the complete exit from the European Union, the end of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the full severance of connections between the United Kingdom and the European Union?</p></speech>

While the tone of her letter, which we discussed last week, is quite emollient, there is absolutely no sign from the British Government that the people who are pro-Brexit, who seem to be in the majority, have moved away from that position.  In that context, it is very difficult to see at this point how the negotiations will be successfully concluded.</p>  <p>  We now have a situation where Northern Ireland is not represented at all in the negotiations.  It does not sound like it will become engaged any time soon as a result of the collapse of the power sharing institutions and with both parties seemingly determined to avoid, in practice, any recommencement of the institutions, notwithstanding the fact that they are talking.  It is unfortunate but it seems to be a very dug-in position by both parties to the previous power sharing executives.  How does the Taoiseach envisage Northern Ireland will be represented?  The Taoiseach talked a number of minutes ago about negotiations between Britain and Ireland but, as the Taoiseach has been at pains to say to us, Ireland is very much in the EU 27.</p>  <p>  Last week, Michael O'Leary said he saw a situation in which it was possible that air travel arrangements could be severely disrupted for a number of months in the event of a total British leaving.  There was also an interesting comment by one of the Taoiseach's potential successors when the Minister for Social Protection said the Border would be a camera on a pole.  I do not know if that was him acknowledging there was going to be a Border.  For a lot of us, a camera on a pole could potentially be quite a hard Border and quite a difficult development.  Was he speaking for the Government or was he just giving us the benefit of his thinking aloud?</p></speech>

It is with the Union that this happens.  That is why I have explained to others internationally that it is important to understand what the European Union is, what it stands for, how it functions and how trade deals are put together.</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier has commented on a few occasions that he thinks it would be possible to conclude the "divorce proceedings", as they are called, within the two-year framework.  Whether that is possible or not is anybody's guess.  When these negotiations start in earnest, both about the withdrawal and the future relationship, I expect them to become complicated.  Article 50 is clear, however, in that, if it is not concluded, one either has the option of blunt removal with all that entails or an extension of time granted unanimously by the members of the European Council, which I would expect would be granted were that situation to arise.

The trading area has become quite complicated.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Burton, I remain optimistic that the politicians in Northern Ireland will accept their responsibilities and that, in respect of the two main parties, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, we will get out of that a functioning executive authority, which is very important for Northern Ireland.  I assume that Secretary of State Brokenshire would be able to legislate for that retrospectively when the Commons returned after the Easter recess.  I hope that the main parties can put this together and that we will have a functioning Executive.  It may hold differences of opinion but at least it could have a common set of objectives for the people that it represents across the North.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Border, the position is that, on behalf of the Irish Government and the British Government, we have a clear understanding of there being no return to a hard Border.  By that I mean customs posts on the Border as traditionally applied.  My reason for being so clear and so strong about this is that it brought with it sectarian violence and all of the issues that arose in the troubled past that we had in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  We are not going back there.  That is the political groundwork.  It is a political challenge to deal with that, not just a matter of mere technology.</p></speech>

The Cabinet committees on housing and on health have met three times each, the committees on economy, trade and jobs and on Brexit twice each, and the committees on social policy and public service reform, on justice reform, on European affairs, on infrastructure, environment and climate action, and on arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht have each met once.  A further round of Cabinet sub-committee meetings takes place next Monday.</p></reply>

It was revealed that the justice reform committee had not met since March, but the extraordinary debacle concerning the drink driving tests and the undermining of the criminal justice system via 146,000 people being wrongfully summonsed to court happened under that committee's watch apparently without it or the T&aacute;naiste knowing about it.  We have been hearing about justice reform since the days of the former Minister, Alan Shatter.  Clearly, the committee has not been working.  Likewise with health.  The health system has been experiencing significant issues and incredible pressures since 1 January and the full scale of last year's funding gap has been confirmed.  The commitments on mental health that were made in the confidence and supply agreement have not been realised.  Waiting times for children to access the child and adolescent units are growing.  The shortage of staff is as high as 50% in some places.</p>  <p>  In many respects, the efficacy of these Cabinet committees are highly questionable.  For example, recent years are characterised by an underwhelming commitment to physical infrastructure, with many announcements but little in the way of delivery.  The capital plan that was announced just before the general election was very much about that election, with everything backloaded to the last two years.</p>  <p>  Broadband has been an issue.  There have been many delays.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, or someone else should explain to the House how his announcement yesterday regarding eir tallies with the tender situation.  When we met the officials with some of the Independents at the time of the Government's formation, ensuring that the tender was undertaken properly and carefully so that it would not be subject to legal action was a major issue.  Unless I am reading the situation wrongly, and I would appreciate clarification, yesterday's announcement seemed to run counter to the advice that we were given at the time.  It was strange, given that everyone had been waiting for the tender's announcement so that we could progress the wider issue of broadband access in rural Ireland.  We have had too many false dawns and announcements.  People's hopes have been raised but little has happened.  There must be scrutiny of whether yesterday's announcement was in line with the Department's broadband tender operation.</p></speech>

I am trying to establish which sub-committee, if any, deals with international affairs.  In particular, I am concerned about Ibrahim Halawa, who begins his 21st trial today.  Where does the Government deal with that major miscarriage of justice?  The family argues that the Government needs to consider other options now, for example, hiring an Egyptian lawyer to file a suit in the Egyptian administrative court, having Rule 140 applied or beginning an international legal challenge against Egypt on the grounds of human rights violations against an Irish citizen.  Will the Taoiseach examine these options urgently and can he confirm if they would they be presented before a sub-committee and in which forum would they be addressed?</p></speech>

Cabinet sub-committees have an important role in bringing in Ministers or agencies to progress matters through to a point where they can be sent to Cabinet for decision by Government.  I will let nobody run away with the idea that Cabinet sub-committees make a stream of decisions.  It is the Government that actually decides on recommendations or propositions that come through Cabinet sub-committees.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality was not made aware of the figures referred to by Deputy Martin on the fixed charges and the mandatory alcohol testing until 23 March, which was very recent.  The Government responded immediately in respect of these issues and the Government would have finalised its position except that I wanted Members to have access to the second Fennelly report when it could be published.  I hope that will be in the near future once the Attorney General authorises me as the receiving Minister to do so.  At that point everybody can include his or her reflections on that in the context of the overall analysis of what we have to do for policing and the structure and role of the Garda for the time ahead.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's point about mental health.  We did have a meeting about that with one of his spokespersons.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to respond.  I will follow up on that for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In respect of broadband, there have been many hundreds of hours put together by officials from the Department with the companies involved in the drafting of the tender.  Two years ago, the number of high-speed broadband connections stood at 566,000.  It will be 300,000 higher than that.</p><p>In 2016, the figure represented only 52% of premises.  Traditional private sector investment by end 2018 is expected to increase to 77%.  </p> <p> The Minister has agreed that the map for the State intervention should be revised to reflect the fact that he has accepted a commitment by eir to build a high-speed broadband network to cover an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland by the end of 2018, with penalties built it should it not do so.  This project will be undertaken on a fully commercial basis, with the commitment underpinned by a formal agreement.  Also, 84,500 premises previously identified as being in the commercial area are being taken back into the State intervention area of the high-speed broadband map as plans by commercial operators to provide services to these premises did not materialise.  It is intended to finalise the map at 542,000 premises for the remainder of the procurement process.  In addition, eir has signed an agreement with the Minister to provide access to high-speed broadband to 300,000 additional premises by the end of 2018.  This is a binding contract with detailed quarterly milestones to be published.  If eir does not deliver fully, premises will be brought back into the intervention area and will be delivered under the Government contract with eir compensating the Minister in respect of the costs involved.</p> <p> The evidence suggests that the Government's commitment has acted as a catalyst in encouraging accelerated investment by commercial operators.</p></speech>

The groups that wish to tender will be made aware that 300,000 premises previously outside the tendered area are being taken back into the commercial zone.  As such, they will understand the changed nature of the tender to be conducted now.  Furthermore, eir has committed to service provision for the additional 300,000 premises.  There are penalties built into the agreement between eir and the Minister which will come into play if eir does not deliver.  I will ask the Minister to circulate to everybody a detailed report on the changed position arising from the agreement which he has negotiated with the companies.</p></speech>

We have heard a lot about census figures and the HP deprivation index and what it comprises but we have not heard on what basis it was applied to individual schools.  There has been a real failing in that regard.  Since I last raised this issue in the D&aacute;il, there has been a controversy around schools wrongly on the list and schools that were not included.  There has been controversy in the media this week by one of the originators of the HP Deprivation Index, Mr. Haase, in terms of how the Minister is proceeding in this matter.  There is huge concern about the roll-out of this programme.</p></reply>

The new identification model is designed to be transparent.  Basically, it takes into account the children enrolled in the school and the places where they live and then the HP deprivation index is applied.  As the Deputy knows, the variables involved in that index are demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in a fair and objective way to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.</p>  <p>  Full details of the process involved in the assessment of schools are available on my Department's website.  It is also my intention to communicate with all schools to provide information on the identification model.  Information provided will include details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for detailed and up-to-date information from schools.   </p>  <p>  There is no discrepancy in the schools listed for inclusion in DEIS.  The only alteration to the lists published involved a change in rural-urban categorisation of four primary schools arising from an improved method of measurement.  It is important to note that the urban-rural categorisation of schools relates to geographical location only and has no bearing on the levels of disadvantage identified within those schools.  In the case of the schools in question, there was no impact on the overall resources allocated. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the DEIS programme has been in place since 2005.  The publication in February last of the DEIS plan was the outcome of a comprehensive review process undertaken over an 18-month period and represents an updated action plan for future delivery in this critical policy area.</p></reply>

He also said that the schools will be given that information.  What I want to know now is how the HP Deprivation Index is applied to schools.  In other words, what level of deprivation or areas must children come from for schools to be included in the DEIS programme?  Earlier this week, Mr. Haase criticised the application of this index to the DEIS programme and how the programme is being operated.  That is very significant criticism.  We have heard a lot about this index but the Minister has never explained to schools how it is applied.  We all know about formulas.  We learned theory in maths class.  This is a theory.  The Minister has never explained to us or the schools how it is applied to this particular area.  There is a huge lack of confidence in this scheme because of the mistakes made.  The changes made in this area were made not because of the model being used but because of media inquiries.  The Minister purported to put out an approved method thereafter.  I put it to the Minister that this scheme was rolled out before it was ready because he was extremely keen to get a good news political announcement out as quickly as possible.  It was rushed out, problems have arisen and the details as to why a particular school is included or not in the scheme have never been given.</p></speech>

Its scheme was based on random collection of information.  Political information was also brought to bear, which was not satisfactory.  The current scheme is transparent.  I have just explained to the Deputy how it is put together.  In other words, the children in the school and their home addresses are taken in conjunction with the deprivation index, which is used widely, to assess a location.  That is the composite index.</p></speech>

In terms of the cut-off point, we use the same cut-off point to find the highest level of concentration.  I would very liked to have been able to extend that to more schools but the budget I had available had to be used to support the areas with the highest level of concentration.  As the Deputy knows, there was no school included since 2009.  We have been able to include 79 or 2% of schools in the country because they were at the highest level of concentration of disadvantage.  Those are the schools that we are helping.</p>  <p>  This was not rushed.  It was developed over an 18 month period when the statistical system was developed.  The commentator, Mr. Haase, did not criticise the selection method rather he said that we should be looking again at some of the schools.  We did not take any school out of DEIS.  I do not know whether the Deputy is advocating that we should remove schools who have had DEIS.  If that is what he is suggesting, he should state that clearly.  </p></speech>

He will either have to put up or shut up.  That is an extremely serious allegation to make.  The Minister should name the schools included in DEIS that should not be included.  If there are schools included in the scheme on a political basis they need to be removed because they do not deserve to be there.  That is the logical consequence.  Nobody would disagree with that.  However, I believe the Minister is only saying that because he has not been able to explain how the current scheme operates and on what basis schools are included.  How many children in a school must come from a disadvantaged area in order that that school can qualify for the DEIS programme?  Is it one child or all children?  We do not know that.  I am asking the Minister for that information.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the Minister's statement that there are schools in the DEIS programme that are wrongly included, I call on him to prove that.</p></speech>

The whole enrolment in a school is taken into account.  We do not designate children as disadvantaged.  We take the entire enrolment of the school and we develop a composite index for all of the enrolment in the school based on the areas from which the children come.  They are based on objective, scientific criteria, including demographic growth, dependency ratios, the education level of parents, the single parent rate, over-crowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  These are objective criteria that are used everywhere.</p><p>As the Deputy has acknowledged, this was not done in the past because the system was not objective.  Some schools applied and others did not.  Some principals were very industrious in collecting data and others were not.  All sorts of people were involved in collecting data and making submissions.  This will now be done on an objective basis that is independent of all political involvement and defined by criteria.  Of course we will need to refine and improve it over time.  This is an absolutely fair and objective basis for making selections.</p></speech>

There are significant concerns about how this will operate, particularly where the needs of specific children are not captured under the model or where those needs are subsequently identified after allocations have been made to schools.  I remind the Minister that such allocations are fixed for two years.  I ask him to outline the supports that will be available under the new model to children in the circumstances I have described.</p></reply>

It captures a more comprehensive range of needs in schools, including complex needs, measured learning difficulties and social needs, than the previous model.  An additional 900 posts will be delivered to reflect this change.  This year, more than half of special needs teaching resources will be allocated to meet the requirements of children with complex needs.  The new model no longer requires an assessment to be submitted, which means that children who need support can get that support immediately.  Indeed, the allocations to the schools are front-loaded so that they are in a position to meet the needs of children without having to get detailed diagnostic tests in respect of them.  One of the benefits of this approach is that each school will be able to use its professional judgment and expertise to determine how best to support its students.  Schools will be supported by the guidance of the integrated support service in the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  The new model will allow for some additional provision in exceptional circumstances prior to the next review.  The NCSE will support schools in managing their allocations in the first instance.  If a school's enrolment of new pupils involves a substantially greater level of need than was previously the case, it will be able to seek assistance from the NCSE.</p></speech>

This is an issue of huge concern.  I have been informed of many cases.  Parents are not happy with this.  They are worried about their children, many of whom have special needs and are already facing too many barriers in areas like speech therapy and occupational therapy.  I am one of a number of Deputies who have raised this issue on the floor of this House.  The new resource allocation model has the potential to create another insurmountable barrier for these parents.</p>  <p>  I would like to give an example of what is happening.  I have been made aware that a child with special educational needs was refused admission to a school because of a lack of resources.  This is concrete evidence of what children and parents are facing in this day and age.  I sent the details of another case, in respect of which my office has been contacted by the parent of two children with special needs, to the Minister last week and I hope some action will be taken on foot of that.  One of the children in this case has autism and is transferring from an autism unit to a small rural mainstream school, which is good.  If we truly believe in inclusion, such children should not be encountering barriers.  Resources should be made available in such cases.  None of the children to whom I refer, including the child who is transferring to a mainstream school, has been captured under the new resource model.  Parents have very real concerns that schools will not be in a position to support their children.  I ask the Minister to consider that such cases will arise under the new approach.</p></speech>

No school will see a child with complex needs lose any of his or her support.  No diagnostic tests are required by the parents described by the Deputy to get supports from schools for the learning needs of their children.  As the allocations are front-loaded, the big financial barrier that was in the way of parents is being removed.  The Deputy has raised the issue of schools' admission policies.  We will look at such matters in the context of the new admissions process we are introducing, which will give the NCSE the power to require schools to accept children with special educational needs.  Schools will not be allowed to refuse children in these circumstances.  As I said in my initial reply, if a school's new enrolment exhibits a far greater level of special need than the level among the children who are already in the school, the NCSE will be able to examine that issue upon the demonstration by such a school of a substantial increase in the level of special need among the new cohort.</p></speech>

My point is that there is no flexibility and there are no additional resources for children.  The fact of the matter is that children will lose out because of the manner in which schools will have their resources fixed for two years under the new model.  It is extremely worrying that some relevant features, such as the inclusion support service and the model for identification of future complex needs, have not yet been put in place.  The Minister needs to take this on board.  I know from the response to a parliamentary question I have received this morning that 519 schools have appealed their allocations under this model.  This figure is evidence that there are concerns that need to be addressed.  It is vital for us to get this right, especially given that the resources to be allocated to a school in two years' time will be based on its current profile.  Things are changing quickly.  The upcoming admissions legislation needs to ensure children with special educational needs can access their local schools.  At the same time, we are introducing a model that fixes the resources given to schools to cater for special educational needs.  Will the Minister advise the House of the circumstances in which schools will be provided with additional resource hours that are clearly needed?  Does he intend to establish the inclusion support service?  Will resource teachers be available to schools under this service?</p></speech>

We are putting extra money and extra staff into resource teaching in a way that will ensure no school loses out.  Schools that require a high level of support for children with complex learning needs, as identified by these tests, will get more.  None of the existing schools will get less.  This approach is designed to see more resources going to the schools with the greatest levels of need.  That is what we are doing here.  We are removing the diagnostic tests.  I know the Deputy was sympathetic to the view that the requirement for expensive diagnostic tests to be done before any resources could be allocated in respect of children with special needs was putting an obstacle in the way of the parents of such children.  Under the new model, the school will be front-loaded with the resources from day one and will be able to use its own discretion.  I have been to Marino College to see where the new model was piloted and I suggest the Deputy should do likewise.  The adoption of this approach there created a much better and genuinely integrated service for children with special needs and enhanced the education of all children in the school.  I believe this model has many positive aspects, including extra resources.</p></speech>

The Minister is aware that there are key shortages of teachers in certain subjects at second level.  I suspect that these shortages are most acute in languages, including Irish.  There are surpluses of teachers of other subjects, such as business studies.  A report on these issues is sitting on the Minister's desk, just as it sat on his predecessor's desk.  We need action now because there are serious concerns in schools about how children are going to be taught some subjects on a continuous and proper basis.</p></reply>

I intend to publish the report shortly.  While the Department of Education and Skills has no evidence of an overall shortage of teachers, it is aware of certain pinch points to which the Deputy has adverted.  The aim of the Department&rsquo;s policy is to achieve a balance between the supply of and demand for teachers.  When the report is published, the Deputy will see that this is a particularly complex issue at post-primary level because of the absence of a central mechanism for matching the overall subject need requirements of schools with the output from the initial teacher education providers.  In addition, schools have significant autonomy in providing a mix of subjects and choices for students.  The final report of the technical working group sets out an approach to planning which scopes out the work needed to develop a model for forecasting teacher supply in the medium to long term.  Engagement with the providers of initial teacher education programmes will be necessary to ensure supply meets demand and we have the correct balance of teachers in the each of the various subject areas.</p><p>The report is of value in regard to building data models for predicting future requirements in the longer term.  However, it does not address the short-term issues to which the Deputy referred.  In the meantime, I am committed to advancing short-term measures to address teacher shortages, including the employment by schools of retired teachers and those on career break, and an increase in the number of days per school year that a post-primary teacher on career break may work as a substitute.</p></speech>

If that is the Minister's answer to this problem, it is deeply unsatisfactory and very worrying.  This is a serious issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister said his Department does not have evidence, but there is significant anecdotal evidence.  Any teaching organisation or principal will tell the Minister that there is a major problem.  They simply do not have the teachers they need.  </p>  <p>  Career breaks are being refused left, right and centre.  This is not central Government policy, rather it is a practical reality for school principals at second level.  If they advertise a career break post, which is temporary, they will not get any applicants, except perhaps for business studies.  They would rather have a teacher leave a school completely and advertise a new role.</p>  <p>  Things are at crisis point.  Principals are engaged in a balancing act.  Teachers are not available for key subjects.  The problem is very serious in gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; freisin, mar nach f&eacute;idir leo m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; a fh&aacute;il a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a gcumais acu na h&aacute;bhair uilig a mh&uacute;ineadh.</p>  <p>  It is a problem throughout the system.

Training of teachers involves about 3,800 students, which is split roughly half and half between post-primary and primary schools.  About 1,600 teachers retire each year.  There is a substantial net increase in supply each year.  We are recruiting more now than we were.  The current levels are far in excess of those of previous years, and we are now moving to match those levels.</p>  <p>  The technical working group has not offered any open and shut solution.  It said that planning to develop a model is extremely complex and we need to check and develop new data sources and invest in a mini CSO for teaching.  This is not a quick or easy fix.  </p>  <p>  We will consider putting on short-term courses, as happened in the case of mathematics in the past, in order to meet particular pinch points.  We will consider initiatives that are put forward.  If the Deputy is aware of specific initiatives, we will examine them in order to fill identifiable gaps.</p></speech>

As far as I know, a permanently employed business studies teacher can study a maths course that will bring him or her up to the required level.  However, those not in permanent jobs face a difficulty.  The retraining of business studies teachers offers a significant opportunity.</p>  <p>  The Minister could easily offer a number of solutions.  One would be for the Minister to advise students of the subjects for which there is a surplus of teachers.  I will not name them on the floor of the D&aacute;il because I would rather the Minister provide official statistics.  Perhaps the Minister could encourage people to study maths or provide them with more opportunities to upskill in other subjects in order to improve balance.  At the moment, the system is skewed.</p>  <p>  Fundamentally, the Minister needs to in some way take control of the second level teacher education system because it is too open.  The colleges have too much autonomy.  The Minister is supposed to be setting national priorities for key subjects for the national education system and economy.  The truth is that the Minister cannot stand over any particular targets on languages, maths, business or coding because he does not know what teachers will be available to teach those subjects.</p></speech>

It is only when they do a masters that they enter the teaching channel.  The working group examined whether it could introduce a model which could identify an objective intake for subjects such as chemistry, physics, maths or business studies that would feed into the system.  So far, it has been unable to produce such a model.</p>  <p>  I am open to considering specific subject areas where we could have particular interventions.

The former Minister, Mary Hanafin, effectively sabotaged that effort by commissioning a curriculum that required the religious segregation of schoolchildren for a substantial part of the year.</p>  <p>  Some nine of the 11 community national schools are now refusing to implement that curriculum and are rebelling against it because they consider it to be completely unworkable, unfair and unacceptable, yet the Minister seems to be refusing to commission a new curriculum that would end the unacceptable practice of religious segregation of children in those schools.</p></reply>

The community national school model is a new model of multidenominational school which is not that well-known among the public.  However, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it and a major role to play in providing choice to parents in the future.</p>  <p>  Community national schools are multidenominational and provide for belief nurturing during the school day.  The aim of the model has been to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting.  The philosophy of the community national school as a multidenominational school is based on best practice in this area, and on each child better understanding and ultimately celebrating their and their friends&rsquo; belief and cultural identities.  Belief identity is explicitly not left at the school gate, but used as a means of enriching the learning experience on the basis of mutual understanding and integration. </p>  <p>  Goodness Me, Goodness You is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of these schools.  It is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none.  In junior infants to second class, the children follow the programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four-week period during the programme according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents.  Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping. </p>  <p>  In third to sixth class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together.  Belief-specific teaching is integrated for these classes.  The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in junior infants to second class has evolved.  The majority of community national schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four-week period.  Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all groups remain together throughout.  </p>  <p>  As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach.  This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events, for example, communion and confirmation in the case of Catholic families, but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multidenominational education.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence a review of the Goodness Me, Goodness You programme for junior infants to second class, starting in September 2017.  As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined.  The education and training boards, as patrons, are also examining how Goodness Me, Goodness You can be delivered in schools in the most inclusive fashion possible.  I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.</p></speech>

There has been a rebellion against the religious segregation required by the Goodness Me, Goodness You curriculum that was set.  The Minister should confirm that programme was not set by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, although the community national schools' brochure claim it was.  In fact, it was commissioned to Dr. Clare Maloney of the Marino Institute of Education, probably under the influence of the Catholic bishops at the time.  The Catholic Church was the only religious denomination to intervene in the process.</p><p>At the time, it said the basic requirement would be that religious instruction and formation of Catholic children in the faith by a qualified teacher during the school day would be a minimum non-negotiable requirement for new multi-denominational primary schools.</p> <p> No other religious denomination wanted to interfere or felt it was even appropriate to bring this into the schools, but the Catholic Church demanded that.  At the time, Mary Hanafin took it away from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and gave it to the Marino Institute which came up with a curriculum that required religious segregation.  However, those schools are now rebelling, voting with their feet and saying it is not acceptable.  Will the Minister rewrite the curriculum or get the NCCA to do it?</p></speech>

As I said in my reply, it is currently undertaking a review of that particular patron programme.  I also said it is evolving, as the Deputy rightly said too.  Increasingly there is no period of the day during which children are withdrawn.  However, parents are offered the opportunity, if they wish, to have their children taught in their own faith.  That is an option.  The class remains intact, but if they wish to withdraw their children for certain elements that can be arranged.  The arrangement is evolving and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is now undertaking that work.  It is moving to a model that will be more appropriate and more welcomed by parents.  I value the idea that they invite and celebrate all religions.</p>  <p>  I was in Saggart recently and saw it on the ground.  It is a really good model.  There is an integrated approach to religion and there is great respect for diversity.  It is a model that is worth giving impetus for the future.</p></speech>

What is totally unacceptable, however, is the religious segregation of young children, particularly in a country where one religious denomination dominates.  What was supposed to be a curriculum for multi-denominational schools, which was all inclusive, was then given over to a Catholic college that drew up a curriculum which effectively required segregation.  The reason it is "evolving", to use the Minister's nice word, is because nine of the 11 schools established have opted out and have refused to implement the segregation that the "goodness me, goodness you" curriculum tried to force on them.</p>  <p>  We need to acknowledge what has happened here and scrap that curriculum.  We should get the NCCA to draw up what should have been drawn up 11 years ago, which is a genuinely all-inclusive, non-sectarian, non-discriminatory, non-segregative curriculum that does not involve segregating children on the basis of some requirement to have faith formation within the school.  That should be kept outside the school gates.</p></speech>

It took over responsibility in 2012 and is commencing a review of that programme.  I support the change in practice whereby children in most community national schools remain intact as a group and all religions are considered in a common programme.  That is a good evolution of the programme which will fulfil more parents' wishes.  I am keen to see more such schools evolve.  It will be one element in our promotion of diversity.  I am committed to seeing more diversity in schools and this is one such element.  I welcome the work of the NCCA and the way in which it has evolved itself.</p></speech>

However, as regards the substance of the Deputy's question, Caranua is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to oversee the use of cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million, pledged by religious congregations, to support the needs of survivors of institutional child abuse.  The legislation provides that supports may be available in the areas of health and personal social services, mental health services, education and housing.  It is a matter for Caranua itself to determine the range of approved services it will support and the criteria by reference to which decisions may be made in respect of applications.</p>  <p>  Following its establishment, Caranua determined the approved services to be provided by it and determined the applications criteria.  I understand that in 2016 Caranua expanded the approved services it provides and amended its criteria to include a range of additional housing and health-related supports.  I have no role in regard to Caranua&rsquo;s day-to-day activities or matters such as the determination of criteria.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been concerns raised regarding Caranua in the media and elsewhere.  I have met with survivors and I appreciate their concerns.  It is vital that in all our dealings with victims of abuse they are dealt with in a sensitive, fair and compassionate manner.</p>  <p>  I believe that Caranua has tried to put in place a process that is responsive to the needs of applicants.  It has acknowledged the difficulties it has faced especially in the early period when it first began to accept applications.  It is required to meet the obligations set out in the 2012 Act and to be accountable.  In that regard it should be noted that Caranua will be appearing before the D&aacute;il's Committee of Public Accounts next week.</p>  <p>  Caranua's aim is to provide a responsive, friendly and professional service and it has informed me that it takes all complaints seriously.  It has a customer service charter, and feedback and complaints policy.  There is an independent appeals mechanism and Caranua&rsquo;s administrative actions are subject to review by the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to carry out a review of eligibility for services provided by Caranua and in that regard draft terms of reference were recently published.  A number of submissions were received and these are being considered.  It is hoped to finalise the terms of reference shortly and proceed to the review in the near future.  Any change in the eligibility requirement would require legislation.</p>  <p>  I will be meeting the new board of Caranua when it is appointed and I will be impressing on it the need to ensure that it continues to be responsive to the needs of applicants.</p></speech>

She reportedly said:</p><blockquote>Some applicants will never be happy and grievances suit a narrative.  It suits a narrative of the big bad State and the big bad religious congregations, and so on.  We have to face the facts that the damage that has been done to these people [these are the words used by the CEO] is so deep that it does not matter what anybody does.</blockquote><p>I will not insult the survivors by finishing the quotation because it is simply appalling.  I thank the Minister for clarifying that a review is under way on eligibility.  Can he tell me when it started and when it will be completed?  There has been a 110% increase in appeals since last year.  That in itself speaks volumes about the unease that survivors have with the way they are being treated. </p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly put forward a Bill that was supported on Second Stage with a time delay, which gives us an opportunity to conduct this review.  It is therefore being done according to a tight timeframe.  Obviously, I want to ensure that we hear submissions into the review's terms of reference.</p>  <p>  As I have acknowledged, I think the comments as reported were unfortunate and could certainly be open to misinterpretation.  I also recognise that Caranua has had a difficult job to do.  In its initial phase it had a number of logistical difficulties which gave rise to genuine frustration for many people.  Some of its administrative requirements can be irksome for applicants.  To be fair to Caranua, however, it made improvements in the processes last year.  Clearly, the review needs to look afresh at whether we can do more to improve those processes and make them user friendly, while at the same time ensuring that Caranua can fulfil its obligations to the House and show that the moneys it has spent were incurred as per the criteria set out in the legislation. </p>  <p>  This is an important piece of work and I regard it as something that should be completed quickly.  I know from other speakers in the House that it is regarded as a priority.</p></speech>

It is a misuse of the Irish language because the experience of all these survivors is not that they have met a friend.</p><p>They have met with delay, obfuscation and the phone not being answered.</p> <p> There is absolutely no consistency in what survivors get.  Sometimes they get a washing machine and sometimes they do not.  Sometimes they get a bed which is suited to their needs, and a little bigger than a normal bed, but they do not get the blankets to cover it.  This is the level of miserliness with which the scheme has been administered.  It gives me no pleasure to repeat this here.  I am very familiar with the redress board from a previous life and the survivors, having gone through the board, now having to go through the miserliness of this system, with its total inconsistency and the scale of appeals, speaks volumes.  At the very least the CEO on that enormous salary should be asked to apologise.</p></speech>

These are the ones who will be subject to the review.  Of course there is a customer service charter, a feedback and complaints policy, an appeal mechanism and recourse to the Ombudsman.  There are mechanisms in place to try to deal with these inconsistencies.  These are standard good practices in any organisation.  Part of the review will be to look at why these elements of support are not working in this particular circumstance.  This is why it is timely to have a review and ensure we deliver the best we possibly can.  I am conscious, having reread some of the Ryan report reviews recently on the way in which the State let down these individuals so badly in the past, that we have an obligation to make sure we support them now in a fair and equitable way.  At the same time, I realise Caranua will come before the Committee of Public Accounts and must be able to account for the way it spends its money.  There is a balance that must be struck, but I take the Deputy's points and they will be factored into the review.</p></speech>

This is a running issue.  I acknowledge some progress has been made on it, and I was pleased to be able to utilise the pressure of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in this regard.  We have a commitment on this.  It is an issue that is affecting morale in many schools, despite the progress, because people will not be happy, and rightly so, until full equality of payscales is achieved.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500027#Z00500"><p>Equality and fairness are, of course, at the heart of everything this Government is trying to do, particularly in the education area where I am particularly focused on creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged communities in our schools system and in higher education.  The recent budget included measures seek to do this.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with the TUI and the INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15% and 22%, that is between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700, for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were, of course, also available to ASTI members but unfortunately in a recent ballot they were not carried.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly for example enhanced services for children with special educational needs, disadvantaged schools, growing schools, higher education and apprenticeships.  I could list many more.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission, and it will look at individual sectors such as teaching.  I accept the teachers' unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Negotiations on a successor agreement to the Lansdowne Road agreement will shortly get under way.</p></speech>

While this is an issue across the public sector the number of public servants affected by this is disproportionately large in the Minister's Department and among teachers.  This is why the Minister for Education and Skills needs to be at the vanguard of this, making the case at the Cabinet table and making the case publicly for our newly qualified teachers.  This in itself will be a signal of seriousness of intent and hope for newly qualified teachers that they can get to a situation where their payscales are equal.  It would also send out a strong message to the ASTI.  There would be no excuse for rejection of what is on the table if the Minister was to make these types of statements.  He has not done this and it has not helped the situation.  He could do it in the way Fianna F&aacute;il has done it, and perhaps offer a pathway to full equality and state this is when it can happen, that it will take time and that we have the public sector pay commission.  Giving this indication as to how it will happen would mean a lot in terms of teacher morale.</p></speech>

Under existing arrangements we are making a commitment of not far off &euro;1 billion in restoration over the period of this agreement.  We have the public pay commission and I know the INTO and TUI will pursue the cases the Deputy has made.  From my point of view, I have to deal with public pay policy and I also have to try to deliver equity to those who have need and a call on the Department.  With regard to what we can achieve in any given year, we have to balance the rightful ambition for teachers and young teachers to see restoration of pay with the other demands on the Department.  These issues are encapsulated in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  This is the arena within which we seek to resolve these balances and it is continuing with the Public Service Pay Commission and the successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  This is the arena where we have to address the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

This time last year at their conferences, young teachers got together and demanded progress and the political system reacted.  Fianna F&aacute;il certainly used its position to make this progress happen with the INTO and the TUI and I congratulate their negotiators for the work they have done and which they continue to do in terms of putting pressure on the political system and forcing us to make sure their demands are heard.  This was progress.  There is nothing to say the Minister cannot say that as a political system and Government we need to acknowledge that pay equality is what we need to achieve.  Nobody is expecting the Minister to write a cheque this year because we know there has already been an uplift in January and there will be another one next January.  Nobody is expecting the Minister to write a cheque immediately, but he should give a signal that he is serious about this and that it can happen.  The Minister gave this signal last summer when those negotiations started.  We are at an early stage, but it is very important that in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann we continue to advocate on behalf of those newly qualified teachers and to state what has been going on with regard to their salaries is wrong, and that the Minister joins in this call, particularly at the Cabinet table.</p></speech>

In the event, one of them was not able to carry the agreement.  It has restored 75% of pay and delivered full equality at later points in the payscale.  I know the trade unions representing teachers will go to the Public Service Pay Commission, which is an objective, fair and independent body, to assess the very issues on the table.  There will be various issues put forward by the trade unions in various parts of the sector.  We must rely on the trade unions, the commission and the subsequent successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement to deal with these issues fairly and deal with the various elements of the demands for various parts of the public service unions.  This is the arena we have created and it allows us not only to meet the rightful ambitions of workers in the public service but also to deliver the improved services for which the Deputy's party also asks.  We are trying to strike this balance.  We are doing the best we can with the available resources and we have a good process that gives people an avenue to pursue their concerns.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500028#AA00300"><p>My Department's circular has set out details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  The new special education teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for schools, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of the new model. There has been a progressive improvement in resource teaching over the years since 2011.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy in his question had a general allocation of 50 hours - that is the general allocation model, GAM, element for 2016 to 2017.  This, combined with 30.18 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, for children with complex needs, gave a total allocation of 80.18 additional teaching hours for 2016 to 2017.  As the profiled allocation for this school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school in 2017 to 2018, the school maintained its existing level of allocation.  The special education teaching allocation for this school is 80.18 hours for the coming year.  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school as a result of the introduction of the model.  The NCSE has announced the commencement of an independent appeal process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.</p></speech>

I am looking at the figures he quoted.  To be specific, he mentioned that the figure for last year was 80 hours and that it will be the same next year.  He makes the point that this is not a reduction.  The problem is that in this particular school in 2016 and 2017, the information is that there were 30 hours.  However, if one looks back to 2015 and 2016, the same school had 60 hours in that allocation and had been at 50 hours over the five-year period.  Effectively, the 30 hours that the Minister refers to in his answer to me today was the smallest recorded in any of the last five years.  That is the basis for next year's allocation and is the issue that the school is complaining about.  It is saying that it is not reflective of what had happened last year or over the previous five years.  It is not out of kilter by a small bit, but is substantially out of kilter.  That is the crux of the problem when averaging over a one year period only and only taking last year's figure into account.</p></speech>

The school will have to demonstrate to the NCSE that this has been the case.  The NCSE will work with the school to seek to resolve those issues.  Additional hours may be made available to the school where it can be demonstrated.  The merit of this is that the school has resources now.  It does not have to wait for the assessment.  This diagnostic test has been taken away.  There are many advantages in the new model.  If, as the Deputy says, there is exceptional change in the profile of the school, that is something that the NCSE will look at.</p></speech>

The exceptional profile in this case was that the resource teaching hours for the single year in question dipped to 30.  It had been 60 hours in the previous year and the average over five years had been 50 hours.  The exceptional circumstance was the dip.  That is the concern with this general allocation model.  One particular year is being taken on its own, which may not be representative, and is clearly not representative of what has happened in this case.  I acknowledge that there is an 80 hour allocation, but that is under what would have been the norm for the previous years.  I welcome that the appeal mechanism is in place.</p></speech>

There are four years from junior infants right up to second class.  It looks at the complex needs profile of those schools.  That complex needs profile is delivered to the school.  For that to be dramatically wrong, the cohort leaving the school must have dramatically lower special education needs than the cohort joining the school.  If the school can demonstrate that the situation is that the new intake is dramatically different from the children who have moved on into third class and into another school, then that is the material that the NCSE would look at, and it would work with the school to resolve the situation.  We need to see the actual enrolment.  That would have to be evaluated exactly, based on the children concerned.</p></speech>

It is currently being examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills with a view to making recommendations on a long-term sustainable funding model for higher education.  This process includes receiving input from relevant stakeholders.  It will be important to obtain political and societal consensus on achieving a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the future and my Department and I continue to work with the committee as it undertakes its deliberations.</p>  <p>  In a follow-up to the expert group report, appropriate technical work will be undertaken by an inter-departmental group chaired by my Department on income contingent student loans in order to inform future funding policy options, including in light of recommendations from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  In advance of these recommendations, however, I have taken immediate steps to increase funding for higher education, the first such increase in nine years.  Increased Exchequer funding of &euro;36.5 million was secured in this budget for the higher education sector.  This includes an increase in funding available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups to assist them in overcoming financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education.  Provision is also being made in the Department's expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases which cumulatively represent an additional &euro;160 million investment in the sector in the period 2017 to 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  It is estimated that the mechanism, which proposes an increase in the national training fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional &euro;200 million revenue in 2020.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Department by 5 p.m. on Thursday, 13 April.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments.  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors.</p></speech>

It seems from his response that the Department is going ahead and doing much work on how student income contingency loans would work in practice alongside the work the Oireachtas committee is doing.  The Department has not actually contributed to the work the committee is doing at the moment.  It has not given evidence there.  Why is the Minister developing the system parallel to the work the committee is doing if the committee might recommend that there should not be income contingency loans?  Is it a case that it is actually a <i>fait accompli</i>and the decision has been already taken within the Department?</p></speech>

We should prepare if it is intended to make a move.  Part of the Cassells report is that, over the last number of years, the higher education sector grew by something like 25% with no increased State funding.  The report is anticipating another 25% growth and recognises that doing nothing about this is not satisfactory.  It outlines three sources of potential funding.  One is the Exchequer, which we are pursuing.  The second is employers, which we are pursuing.  The third is the possibility of this student contribution mechanism.  It would be imprudent of us not to look at the technical side of that, should it be decided by the Oireachtas that this is the direction we want to go.  It is prudent to do that preparation.</p>  <p>  This is something the Oireachtas has to look at as a group, just like we are looking at health funding and pension funding in the long term.  The Cassells report has set out issues that should be looked at, such as the extra earnings that someone who graduates gets, and whether it is fair to ask such a person to make a contribution back.  We also have to look at access for students who do not come from backgrounds or families who can afford it.  Would they be put off or could their needs be dealt with by other mechanisms?  Might collection problems arise?  All these are issues that we need to assess.  That is why the Oireachtas is taking its time.  We are available at any time to answer questions on any issues the committee wishes to raise.</p></speech>

I take it from his response that the Department is pursuing the income contingency loans.  That is regrettable and should not be done because it places a huge burden on students and does not contribute anything to accessibility or affordability for students.  There is ample evidence from across the world that most student debt is made of interest charges that accrue at a later stage through the income contingency loans.  The Union of Students in Ireland is implacably opposed to it.  Many of the Members of the House are opposed to it.  I am seriously worried that the Minister is pursuing option three in parallel with options one and two and is going to try to develop some sort of hybrid of all three as a way of lessening the burden.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

That has come as news to me, as a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  We had decided to do a technical study because Peter Cassells recommended it . This is a new departure from the Minister.  The best thing to do is that the Department fund an expert who joint committee would then hire through public tender who would then carry out a technical study.  That would be the best and most independent way of doing it.  We need resources to do that.  I agree that it should be done fairly.  It is shocking that the Minister would announce that this is going ahead given that all previous replies were that every issue relating to the Cassells report was being referred to the Oireachtas committee.</p></speech>

We are looking at the employer mechanism, which obviously can be assessed by the committee, and the Exchequer mechanism.  I am not sitting on my hands and waiting for the assessment work to be carried out.  I am moving immediately because there is a crisis, and I am acting to deliver cash straight away, to put an employer's mechanism in place which hopefully will be agreed in the budget, and I am making contingency preparations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should it be decided that this is the route to go.  I can assure the House that the budget is not exhaustive.  We are looking at issues such as cashflow impact, which is the sort of thing that clearly is an issue if this is to be a workable operation.  That is wise planning, but we are not making any assumptions about what the Oireachtas committee might recommend to us.</p></speech>

These people have spent four or five years in college, depending on whether they are primary or secondary teachers.  They then go out, very enthusiastically, to teach in the classroom at primary level or secondary level, and unless there is a really good programme of continuing professional development, once they have gone into the classroom, they can be left very isolated.  The Minister addressed an excellent conference last week on the forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum which take into account the fact that 95% of children who have gone to primary school have already been at pre-school.  There is a disconnect - a shock, in fact, for many kids - when they move from the play and activity-orientated pre-school into a much more regimented primary system.  Some excellent ideas were put forward by people like Fergus Finlay as to how it might become more child friendly.  What is going to be the role of continuing professional education to make some of the proposed changes work?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that this is a very important area.  We need to look more deeply at its impact and at the quantity and quality, and that is why this review is being carried out.  At the moment we have 206,000 CPD deliveries, which is up by 23% in the last four or five years.  It includes substantial elements for new teachers, including induction under Droichead.  It has special education, curricular support and the junior cycle.  It also has school leadership as a significant element, with a new centre for school leadership.  I share the Deputy's view that transitions are absolutely crucial, and we should look more closely at those transitions between pre-school and primary and between primary and secondary.  Those are points where children can get lost in the system.  The purpose of the review of the curriculum the NCCA is talking about is to see if we can better aligned those, both at the start and end of primary education, to ensure that children make those transitions more successfully.  I agree with the upskilling of our teaching workforce in a time of very rapid change in education.  The advent of technology and the power that can have to change the learning environment is an area we need to focus on and get good value from.</p></speech>

He also spoke about a potentially very significant new role for education and training boards, ETBs, particularly at primary level.  ETBs only have a small number of primary schools in the country.  Is the Minister suggesting that the ETBs might in some way become the vehicle for the education centres?  Will the Minister ensure that the different levels of the teaching profession are consulted in full about any changes?  The Minister spoke about remedial education and special education.   Many people who go into careers in education and develop an interest in those areas would be unable to reach the level of skill and training they have without CPD.</p></speech>

It needs to look at best practice in the delivery of upskilling for teachers.</p><p>At the moment it is divided into a number of education centres and it does not have a central directorate which would identify the direction we should take in the longer term.  We need to ask if we need more central policy direction in this area.</p> <p> The education and training boards are a new creation and they are now developing a diversity of services and supporting clustering in different areas.  It is worth examining whether they should have a new role in this area.  Over time they will evolve additional support services for schools in their neighbourhoods and I am keen to consider that so that we have a local response to local needs on an even greater scale.  This is open ended and there will be opportunities for all interest groups to contribute.  It is of intimate interest to teachers and all stakeholders in education.  We can deliver better in this area, over time, and I will continue to assess the situation accordingly.</p></speech>

The south east is probably one of the more deprived regions in the country but Wexford is the most deprived county in the south east.  According to the Department's projection, there will be an increase of some 57,000 students seeking full-time education soon, which does not take into account part-time demand or attracting more international students.  This is equivalent to four DCUs.  Waterford and Carlow have been fighting over which of them should become a university but there is a good argument for starting anew in Wexford.  It is an incredibly deprived county with 18.5% on the live register, which is shocking when compared to the national figure.  Education is a way out of this and putting a new third level institution in Wexford would make a lot of sense in this context. </p>  <p>  Nothing comes cheap but the costs of construction are not the biggest costs.  The biggest costs are running it on a day-to-day basis so there is a good argument for putting it in Wexford.  I know the national strategy does not think along those lines but that does not mean the Minister should not take a broader view.</p></speech>

I regard human resource and talent development as core to the development of any region, including the south east.  Any fair assessment would advise against creating myriad new institutions that do not have a solid foundation and cannot make a solid offering.  This is from where the technological universities approach came.  It is about merging a number of institutions under one body that can give the strength, width and depth that modern regional development needs.  We need to move more into applied research and need more level 9 and 10 qualifications, as well as a deeper engagement with the enterprise and public service sectors to develop genuine regional competitive advantage.  This approach does not involve "one for everyone in the audience" but tries to create a model that can bring a region to a higher level.  This is important from the point of view of regional development because we cannot plan to have a university in every one of our 26 counties.  We have to build on resources that will be strong and resilient and will deliver the quality service we need in the regions.  Technological universities require mergers and multi-campus locations.</p></speech>

The national strategy for higher education report of 2011 stated that any such move would reduce the diversity in the overall system and have a negative impact on its ability to respond to the country's innovation needs and development opportunities.  I wonder if this thinking is driven by university league tables.  The thinking the Minister is offering delivers an outcome in which the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.  Wexford needs to play catch-up but it is falling further behind all the time.  As long as the philosophy of the Minister is applied we will fall further behind.  We will be in a worse situation in ten years' time unless there is a change of thinking.  There is a really good, rational argument for thinking outside the box and looking at areas that need more help.  The primary obligation of a State should be to take best care of those who most need its help, whether they be deprived communities or regions.  Wexford is among the three most deprived counties in Ireland, with the county of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Donegal, also in the top three.

To enable this development, my Department will carry out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in schools to deliver the curriculum.  This will also determine whether individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school.  When completed, this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced.</p><p>It is intended that this assessment when finalised will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019.  A funding provision of &euro;180 million is being made available from 2019 for this initiative in the programme.</p> <p> As the Deputy will be also aware, it can be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools, when an immediate or short-term need arises.  For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned.  Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.</p></reply>

Based on responses I received to parliamentary questions, I am aware that an assessment was due to be carried out.  I understand this assessment process has not commenced.  I ask the Minister to confirm if that is the case.  I ask him to give an indicative timeframe for the assessment process because we cannot eliminate them until this process is complete.</p>  <p>  It is a serious issue.  As the Minister is aware, money is needed in all sectors of our education system.  However, &euro;128 million has been wasted on prefabs over the past five years.  That figure came from data recently reported in the media following a freedom of information request.  The issue needs to be tackled.  Approximately 950 prefab units are being rented in primary and post primary schools.  I have been informed that the process of replacing the prefabs will not commence until 2018.  Along with many parents and teachers, I feel this is not good enough.  Will the Minister commit to giving the matter urgent consideration and put in place a clear timeframe for the issue to be addressed?  I also ask for clarity on the assessment issue.</p></speech>

However, we recognise this is an area we need to address.  Obviously, there is pressure on the education capital budget to ensure there is provision for every child.  We are going through a period where 20,000 additional places need to be delivered every year, which has absorbed the majority of the budget.  Notwithstanding that, we are making provision for this and it will commence.  The target is that this will start in 2019.  The review will be undertaken in a timely manner to deal with that.</p>  <p>  The figure I have for the cost of renting the 950 prefabs is &euro;25 million.  As I said in the original reply, in any system there will be a requirement for temporary accommodation because populations wax and wane.  We are clearly committed to bringing it down to a lower figure than the current level over time.</p></speech>

I welcome the reduction.  The &euro;128 million figure relates to the past five years and came from the media, based on freedom of information data.  I remain unconvinced that the issue is being given the priority it deserves.  We are wasting millions of euro that could be channelled into special education, for example, as we mentioned earlier and many other different areas.  Building schools will save money in the long term because we will not be wasting millions on prefabs that provide substandard conditions.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to principals who have informed me that they could have had their extension built three times over for the same amount they have poured down the drain for their prefabs.  Further money is being wasted on maintenance of these prefabs.  As the Minister knows, many of the prefabs deteriorate over time.  I have seen many of them in a dilapidated state - I am sure the Minister also has - and they are simply not fit to accommodate children and teachers.  It is also a huge waste of money.  The Minister continually refers to money and budgets, and this needs to be considered over the long term.</p></speech>

That &euro;25 million being spent on 950 prefabs would probably build one secondary school and one primary school.  Switching that sort of a budget to building would not replace 950 prefabs.  We are trying to strike a balance.  We want to minimise the number, but in the short term a big population bulge requires flexible responses.  In an ideal world we would keep these down to just transitional arrangements.  My predecessors and I inherited a situation where 2,000 temporary prefabs were in use.  It is now down to half of that and we have a programme to reduce it to much lower levels over time.  However, a balance needs to be struck in allocating the capital budget.</p></speech>

The student representatives have grave concern that the Minister is strongly considering the third option in the Cassells report of income-contingent loans as a system of funding higher education.  They outlined to us forcefully how such a system would badly impact on the lives of students well into the future.</p></reply>

Deputy Pringle earlier raised a rather similar question and I do not want to repeat myself.  Peter Cassells chaired that expert group and looked at the pressure on higher education over the recent period where funding was effectively frozen and numbers increased.  That has put the system under considerable strain.  We are now considering how to establish a sustainable funding model for the future.  Peter Cassells indicated a number of options, as the Deputy knows.  I have not been sitting on my hands.  I immediately worked on an Exchequer option with &euro;36.5 million this year, a three-year programme with demographics built in increasing to &euro;160 million over the three years.</p>  <p>  With the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, I have set up an Exchequer-employer mechanism which will generate an additional &euro;200 million by 2020, if approved in the budget.</p>  <p>  The option of income-contingent loans involving the contribution of students is being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  Clearly we need to have political and social consensus on how we proceed.  Peter Cassells has set out the merits of it in that people get a very substantially increased livelihood.  If they get a third-level qualification, it dramatically improves their lifetime earnings and he is asking if people should contribute back.</p>  <p>  People have raised other concerns, such as the cashflow impact and whether it would create a barrier for people from disadvantaged areas or whether there are other ways to ensure people from disadvantaged areas get access.  Those issues are being thrashed out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  We are doing a technical evaluation of how it would work if it were selected.  As Peter Cassells said, doing nothing is not an option.  Therefore I have not done nothing.  I am moving immediately on the areas where I have potential to act and have, I think, the support of the House.  The view on the remaining element remains to be seen.</p></speech>

It is a huge struggle to get through college in the first place with the rents and other living costs, given the existing registration fee the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government dramatically increased.  All of that adds to making it very difficult, particularly for people from disadvantaged areas.  The Minister and I both represent a number of areas where the uptake of third level education is still below 15% or 20%, which needs to be the Minister's first task even as an ordinary Deputy.</p>  <p>  We have had analysis on the economic front and the Minister mentioned his liaison with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  A recent report by Dr. Charles Larkin shows that income-contingent loans could cost the Exchequer up to &euro;10 billion, thereby adding significantly to our national debt.  Because so many young Irish people traditionally emigrate, there could be a very negative impact on our national debt over which there are grave concerns, particularly in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Overall it is clear that it would be disastrous, particularly for children, second chance education, maturer students, students with disabilities and so on.  I urge the Minister not to go down that route.</p></speech>

I appreciate people will have different views and suppose Peter Cassells put this out so that it would be seriously considered.  It is important people consider the case as it is made.  I have an open mind on it, as do others.   Deputy Broughan criticised the increase in fees but part of Peter Cassells's vision is that there would be no fees at the point of entry and that there would be substantial income support for those from low income families to get into college.  No one has a monopoly and advocates are not hard-headed capitalists who view education as being for the privileged.  Peter Cassells has envisaged zero fees and is examining this.</p>  <p>  We need to have an honest debate.  This is like the issues of health and pensions.  We need to examine how we will fund these areas, which will place increasing demands on all our families.  Will it be through the public purse or otherwise?  We need to examine viable and sustainable funding models and I am trying to take the actions within my area that I can.</p></speech>

The rise in Exchequer funding is dismal compared to the level of funding before austerity began.  What are the Minister's plans for the 2018 budget?  Is the Minister considering any specific additional thing?  The Minister's party seems to be the one party that does not have a clear view on the issue.  One has not been articulated.  Before the general election, it was shy about stating where it stood.   Will the Minister promote a full-scale D&aacute;il debate on this subject before the end of this term or the next one?</p></speech>

One should not decide that one's mind is made up before evaluating the issue, which is the danger with the Deputy's line of questioning.  We need to consider any proposal on its merits.  As the Deputy is aware, I have specific proposals for 2018.  I have indicated already that I have received a commitment for a demographic increase.  In other words, additional money will follow the additional students in the coming year.  This has not happened for the past nine years.  Therefore, there is an additional commitment.  On top of this, we will have an employer contribution.  It is out to consultation but it is hoped that it will start next year and rise over time to 2020, when it will be &euro;200 million.  Those are two substantial commitments - &euro;160 million from the Exchequer and &euro;200 million from employers.  What else the Oireachtas wants to do remains in issue.  We are a minority Government.  We have to work with others to see what is the consensus approach to the issue.  Much like the health area, we must do it on the basis of how we will fund needs in a decade's time and not just say that we do not like the cut of a particular proposal.</p></speech>

The greatest numbers are being seen in Italy and Romania.  In light of Brexit, it is important to point out that viruses are not in any way aware of borders.  It is important we have good vaccination policy in this country.</p>  <p>  There is a responsibility on us as elected members to dispel some of the myths that are out there.  We are what has been described as a post-knowledge economy.  There is much information available to us but we are seeing the work of someone on Wikipedia having the same status as information and science from a reputable agency.  There is a rise in populism and emerging mistrust of scientific facts.  We have excellent research in Ireland and across Europe.  It is worth noting that a significant amount of taxpayers' money is spent in this country and in Europe on scientific research.  There seems to be an issue with disseminating the information from the scientific and research field to the public.  It is our duty as elected representatives as well as that of those in the Department of Health to try to get the message out.</p>  <p>  It is funny to hear of ridiculous studies in some publications that outline the positive effects of red wine, chocolate or sex on one's longevity when real scientific facts and strong scientific data that have been peer reviewed and assessed as being fact seem to be lost.  Vaccinations prevent many diseases.  Notably, these days the issues surround the MMR vaccine, which I am referring to specifically today, as well as other vaccines such as the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  On measles, we need approximately 95% coverage to get what is called herd immunity.  If we start to drop below that level, we will get measles outbreaks.  We spend much time in this Chamber discussing issues such as waiting lists and hospital bed waits but, if we have a measles outbreak in Ireland, we will have something far more serious than capacity in our health service on our hands.  Anyone who was around when measles were around knows that it can cause deafness, blindness and death.  It is a very serious illness.  Over the passage of time, sometimes people forget how serious are these issues.</p>  <p>  Back in the day, in 1796, which was 220 years ago, Edward Jenner took from cattle the cowpox vaccine and started to give it to humans.  This was deemed heresy and there were cartoons published at the time depicting people with animal heads.  In my view, we are kind of heading back to that situation, so it is important that we as elected representatives and the Department do not lionise ignorance or applaud conspiracy theories that would do anything to harm public health.</p></speech>

I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.</p>  <p>  The announcement by the World Health Organization concerning the increase in measles outbreaks in Europe has brought this issue to the attention of the media and the wider public.  However, we were already aware of the issue and had been taking appropriate response measures.  The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, issued a rapid risk assessment concerning the risk of spread of measles and sustained transmission in EU countries related to an ongoing outbreak in Romania on 3 March 2017.  It noted measles outbreaks in a number of EU countries in 2016 and the continued increase in the number of cases this year.  It also noted that outbreaks in three other EU countries have been linked to the current one in Romania.</p>  <p>  Actions have been taken at both EU and national level.  The EU Health Security Committee met on 10 March to discuss the outbreaks and to ensure a co-ordinated response across member states.  The ECDC continues to monitor the situation and can provide technical assistance to the member states if needed.  The health system in Ireland is aware of the outbreak and has put in place measures to identify any threat and treat any cases.</p><p>The HSE health protection surveillance centre circulated an update on 28 March to departments of public health as well as general practitioners, consultants in infectious diseases, emergency medicine and microbiology and other health professionals.  This notification provided an update on the risk of measles in Europe and the risk of importation into Ireland, and reminded health professionals of what to do if they encounter suspected cases of measles.</p> <p> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's rapid risk assessment noted that immunisation is the only effective preventative measure against acquiring measles.  Immunisation against measles was introduced in Ireland in 1985 and from 1988 onwards, the MMR vaccine was used to replace the single measles vaccine.  The vaccine is included in the primary childhood immunisation programme, with the first dose given at 12 months and the second dose given at between four and five years of age.  It can also be given at any age to those who need it for travel for work or to protect vulnerable children or adults.</p> <p> Immunisation rates in Ireland remain high.  Vaccination rates for MMR at 24 months were 93% in 2015 and have been above 90% since 2008.  I note the Deputy's point in this regard.  The MMR vaccination rate is slightly lower than 95%, standing at 92% in the third quarter of 2015.  Vaccination rates fell when links between MMR and autism were first reported in the 1990s.  At that time, people falsely linked the development of autism with MMR but, as the Deputy noted, these claims have been fully discredited.</p> <p> More than 500 million doses of MMR have been used in more than 90 countries around the world since the early 1970s.  The World Health Organization recognises MMR as a highly effective vaccine with an outstanding safety record.  Although uptake rates are high, we must not be complacent.  A number of imported cases of measles were recorded in Ireland last year.  The only protection against the condition is vaccination and I encourage all children, teenagers and young adults who have not been immunised with MMR to protect themselves by getting this important vaccine.  I concur with Deputy O'Connell that all public representatives must play their part in ensuring people get this message.</p></speech>

We will be in serious trouble if it falls much further.</p>  <p>  Andrew Wakefield, a discredited doctor, is taking part in a roadshow that will soon visit this country.  It is important that a message is sent to parents that the study carried out by this individual was completely discredited and he was struck off the register of medical practitioners in the United Kingdom.  Mr. Wakefield is due to visit Ireland on tour with his anti-vaccine story.  These anti-vaccine campaigners prey on vulnerable people and public concerns.  Clearly, no one wants to give a child anything that is perceived as doing harm.  It is important that public representatives and the Department of Health get the message across to parents that the individual in question, who bizarrely continues to use his title, has been discredited.  I thought witch doctors and magic spells had gone out with the Dark Ages.</p>  <p>  We must work hard to increase the MMR vaccination rate to 95% because if it falls much further from the current rate of 92%, the concept of herd immunity will be lost and we and the rest of Europe will have a problem with the spread of infectious diseases.  As the Minister stated, the way to deal with the problem is to vaccinate children.</p></speech>

Last year's outbreak, when almost 50 cases of measles were recorded in May and June, demonstrates the need to continue to send out a message on this issue and try to increase the MMR vaccination rate to 95% or higher.  In that regard, the Health Service Executive continues to try to increase all vaccination rates, including MMR.  Ongoing training is provided for health professions and meetings take place with key stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Skills and school management bodies.  Articles have been placed in magazines directed at parents and various health professions.  Specifically on MMR, letters have been sent to all language and summer schools as well as the Central Applications Office highlighting measles outbreaks in Europe and the importance of the MMR vaccination.  Activities are also planned for European immunisation week, which runs from 24 until 30 April, to highlight measles outbreaks in Europe and the importance of the vaccination.  Significant work remains to be done in this matter on which we must not become complacent.  I thank Deputy O'Connell again for raising this matter.</p></speech>

In early January, I joined a delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle which visited Ibrahim Halawa in prison in Egypt.  At that time, Mr. Halawa had been going on and off hunger strike.  All members of the delegation strongly advised him not to do so but his actions in this regard were born of despair.</p>  <p>  I thank and commend our ambassador to Egypt, Damien Cole, and his team in Cairo on the work they are doing.  I also commend the Minister and his staff on their efforts.  This is a humanitarian rather than political issue on which all of us must work together to achieve a resolution. </p>  <p>   I am concerned for Ibrahim Halawa, a young man who has spent more than three years in prison and whose trials has been delayed or adjourned 20 times.  Mr. Halawa's trial is due to recommence on 6 April.  I have learned from contact with his family that his physical and mental health are deteriorating.  I hope the Minister is in a position to provide an update on his health without breaching confidence.  I understand an independent medical assessment of his condition was carried out by an Irish doctor with the assistance of the Department.  While we were in Cairo, a doctor visited Mr. Halawa and carried out some rudimentary tests and we requested that an electrocardiogram be performed.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on what action is being taken in this case.  I also urge the Government to insist to the Egyptian authorities that Mr. Halawa is released on humanitarian grounds without further delay.  </p></speech>

The Taoiseach, in reply to a question from Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett yesterday, indicated he had written to President el-Sisi of Egypt.  President el-Sisi's statement that he cannot release people before their trial is a lie.  Some 200 young students were released by the el-Sisi government shortly before Christmas.  At that time, we pleaded with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to appeal for Ibrahim Halawi's release under the same programme.  It is not true, therefore, that President el-Sisi cannot release Mr. Halawi.</p>  <p>  I will focus on an entirely different aspect of the case.  The European neighbourhood instrument is an EU programme under which Egypt has received &euro;320 million to date from Europe.  Ireland makes a financial contribution to this programme, the purpose of which is to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of association and assembly.  What the hell are we giving money to Egypt under this programme for when the country has interned an extremely ill young Irishman without trial?  Mr. Halawi's trial is due to start again for the 21st time today. </p>  <p>  In addition to giving it money, we are promoting a beef trade with Egypt.  Live cattle exports to the country resumed for the first time in 17 years after the Minister's visit to Egypt.  The trade is worth approximately &euro;40 million and is expected to rise in value to &euro;200 million.  Is the export of beef more important than this young man's life?  Why are we using the European neighbourhood instrument, under which the EU provides money to Egypt for human rights, under false pretences?  Why are we exporting beef to Egypt in the hope of making substantial profits for big ranchers and sacrificing Ibrahim Halawa on the altar of profit?  I ask the Minister to address those questions.</p></speech>

Last Monday, the Taoiseach renewed his appeal to the Egyptian President to release its Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay.  This is the Government&rsquo;s objective, and we are working day in and day out to seek to secure that outcome.</p>  <p>  lbrahim Halawa was back in court today for the latest hearing in the case in which he is a defendant along with more than 400 other accused persons.  Our embassy officials were at the court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing in the case to date and before coming to the Chamber, I received a report on the case.  Some progress was made today as 11 more witnesses gave evidence.  At the end of the hearing, Ibrahim's lawyers requested his release on medical grounds and the judge undertook to examine the matter.  I very much welcome that development.  The next hearing in the case will take place on 26 April.</p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I have been disappointed and frustrated by the slow progress in the court case.  Recent hearings, however, have generally been more substantive, with witnesses called and cross-examined, giving rise to cautious optimism that the trial may now, at last, be moving towards a conclusion.  This is crucially important because, as Deputies will be aware, particularly those who visited Cairo earlier in the year, the Egyptian authorities have consistently said that they cannot intervene in a matter that is before the courts, and that this issue can only be resolved after the trial concludes.</p>  <p>  This complex and sensitive consular case has been a priority matter for me since my appointment as Minister.  No stone has been left unturned by the Government and our diplomatic service in our efforts to secure Ibrahim's release and his return to Ireland to his family and, indeed, to resume his studies.  Our embassy in Cairo has dedicated exceptional work to this case with an unprecedented number of prison visits to ensure his health and welfare is monitored and that any concerns are immediately followed up in an appropriate and proper manner.  Reports about lbrahim Halawa's health are a matter of the utmost concern for me and my Government colleagues.  In light of these concerns the Government took the unprecedented step last week of making arrangements for an Irish medical doctor, nominated by the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health, to visit Ibrahim in prison and to undertake an assessment of his health.  The doctor also had an opportunity to speak with Ibrahim at length.  The Egyptian authorities have a clear responsibility to ensure the health and welfare of Ibrahim Halawa.  The Government and the Department have consistently underlined this in all contacts with Egyptian interlocutors.  Ireland's embassy in Cairo is maintaining ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities on issues relating to Ibrahim&rsquo;s welfare and health.</p>  <p>  I have raised these issues repeatedly with Egyptian counterparts, including in a further recent face-to-face meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry.  I am concerned at persistent reports that lbrahim Halawa is on hunger strike.  I urge him in the strongest terms not to pursue such a course of action, and to protect his health in every way.  I also urge all parties who are in contact with him or who have influence with him to dissuade him from any actions that would be detrimental to his health.  In this regard, I welcome Deputy O'Brien's comments.  The Department maintains open lines of communication with the Halawa family and has been keeping family members fully informed of all developments and updates received from the Egyptian authorities.  The most recent face-to-face meeting between family representatives and officers from the Department was on Monday, 3 April.  I assure the House that we will continue to keep pressure on Egypt until we see the release and return home of Ibrahim Halawa.</p></speech>

While I do not doubt anyone's bona fides and that everyone cares about his situation, some of the comments that have been made from time to time have done more damage than good to him.  People should be aware of that and should temper their remarks in that regard.  They are very aware in Egypt-----</p></speech>

Nobody goes on hunger strike unless he or she is utterly driven to it by frustration and is left with no other choice.  That is why this young man has gone on hunger strike.  For almost four years, we have been polite and nice, praising the ambassador and President el-Sisi's Government and telling them how wonderful they are without any result.  I have every right to raise the question of the influence of economics on political decisions.  It is a political decision to be nice to the Egyptian Government instead of telling them like the Australian Government did, "You do not do this to our citizen; we will not tolerate it".  That is the attitude the Government needs to take.  Ibrahim also suffers from a dangerous illness called Leishmaniasis, which kills 2 million people a year globally.  It is spread through overpopulation in places like prisons and places which are poorly sanitised.  He needs to be released and, although the doctor sent by the Minister to examine him has made a recommendation that he be released on humanitarian grounds, we are told the judge is considering it.  We need more than consideration; we need this young man released, looked after medically and returned home.</p></speech>

I assure Members that the Government continues to do everything it can to ensure the authorities in Egypt are in absolutely no doubt about our determination to see this young man returned to his home and family.  There is no question of the Government or, indeed, this House forgetting about or neglecting the welfare and health of our citizen.  It is my solemn duty as Minister to be responsible for the health and welfare of our citizens abroad.  No consular case is receiving the type of engagement Ibrahim Halawa's case is.</p>  <p>  However, the Egyptian authorities continue to detain our citizen, and only they can make a decision to facilitate his return home.  I assure the Deputies that we will continue at every level to do everything possible and appropriate to apply pressure on Cairo on behalf of our citizen and also through our contacts with international colleagues and the EU.  Only last Monday, I addressed this issue with EU High Representative Mogherini and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Mr. Aboul-Gheit.  Our embassy will continue to follow up thoroughly on all the issues to ensure Ibrahim's health and welfare are looked after.  I reiterate my appeal to him to take food and nourishment.  I assure the House we are active on the matter of the independent medical report which was undertaken, received and is now being acted upon at the highest level.</p><p> In response to Deputy O'Brien, I expect over the next few days to have a further conversation with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry.  In the meantime, the Government continues to provide extensive consular support in the case.  I wish to again underline the fact that the Department remains in close contact with both the Halawa family and the citizen's legal representatives.</p></speech>

In February, Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, Deputy Mick Barry, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, Deputy Billy Kelleher, I and others attended a presentation by the Cork Early Years Alliance.  It was a very powerful presentation.  On a visit to Cork, the Minister had an opportunity to meet with some members of the alliance.  It was a stark and frightening presentation.  The alliance informed us of the services being provided by 13 different member organisations in terms of early years care for children up to the age of three.  There are 348 children in Cork receiving a service from 13 different organisations.  These areas have significant disadvantage and in many cases the children involved have complex needs.  We are told by the alliance that 233 of these children will lose a service by September.  The critical immediate issue is the emergency funding promised by the Minister's Department in respect of the change in the regulations around the qualifications required by the child care workers who are in these services.  That is the key immediate issue.  I will come back on the long-term issues in a moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-04-05a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500035#HH00400"><p>It was a very stark presentation.  I have raised this issue with the Minister previously.  I thank her for her presence.  There are 13 services looking at potentially closing in September 2018 and seven of those are concerned they will have to close this September.  They offer a vitally important service to children aged from naught to three years.  It is at that age that early intervention is most crucial and makes the most difference.  I anticipate the Minister will say she announced &euro;1 million in sustainability funding, which is welcome.  There are longer term issues.</p>  <p>  On the &euro;1 million funding, the latest position is that services received contracts on 24 March and were asked to return them.  They were asked the same thing and received the same forms well over a month ago.  This funding was announced back in January and February at the latest.  The services have not been in a position to draw down any of that funding.  The services have had to borrow, use their own savings and come up with all sorts of arrangements just to keep the thing on the road.  They need to be able to access, in the first instance, the funding that has been committed to but which they cannot get their hands on.  That is the most crucial issue to ensure these are sustainable even into the summer.</p></speech>

There are 87 jobs at stake and 349 children involved: 44% of those children come from one-parent families; 73% come from families that can only continue on the basis of State income support; and 33% have specific disadvantage.  The demands of the campaigners are straightforward.  Apart from the emergency funding already mentioned there are three demands.  First, the universal payment per child per hour should increase from &euro;4.60 to &euro;9.20, that is, it should be doubled.  Second, there should be additional staff grants.  Third, their work should be recognised not just in terms of value for labour activation but in terms of what it is, that is crucial early years intervention.  I would like the Minister to comment on those demands from these campaigners who provide such a vital service within these communities.</p></speech>

Child care in Ireland is changing, and changing forever.  Sustainable community services have a place in our ambitious plans.  There should be no doubt about that.  Services in Cork city have been proactive in producing research that makes clear the unique benefits of high quality care and education for children living in areas of urban disadvantage and elsewhere.  This research is an important part of the long overdue national debate on child care, which is now under way.  When I visited Togher in Cork six weeks ago, I met representatives of the community sector.  As someone who has campaigned and worked in this area for over three decades, I could immediately identify with the challenges they face.  It was a productive discussion with a sharing of information and views.  The providers are also in regular contact with my Department.</p>  <p>  The challenges which have been identified are not unique.  They are issues that were raised by community providers in my constituency in Dublin South-West and by community and other providers last weekend when I attended and addressed the Early Childhood Ireland conference.  I assure Deputies we are aware of the concerns and are taking action.  Commitment and passion for child care is admirable but it is not enough if we are serious about child safety, as I am.  Training, education and qualifications are needed so parents can be confident their child is being looked after in safety.  Some community services, including in Cork, were impacted by recent changes in regulations.  The rules were changed to prevent an over-reliance on community employment scheme participants who did not hold qualifications in child care.  I accept this has caused short-term difficulties and my Department has now concluded arrangements for up to &euro;1 million of additional funding to be made to these services.  The first payments under this programme will be received by services this week, including in five Cork services.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of securing the assistance of expert financial analysts to undertake work with services to assist them with assessing their sustainability.  This work will link with the programme for Government commitment to conduct and publish an independent review of the cost of providing quality child care in Ireland.  This commitment aligns closely with the work on the development of the affordable childcare scheme, including options for further development of the scheme over time.  Initial scoping work on the independent review is being progressed in that context.</p>  <p>  The independent review is a priority action for my Department in 2017.  The affordable childcare scheme will deliver significantly increased rates of subvention to the most disadvantaged families.  This scheme will lift the barrier that prevents parents from taking up offers of work, training and education because they cannot afford child care.  Deputies will be aware that this is an ambitious task.  We also have to get the IT systems right which will require more work.  My officials are examining how parents and community child care services will benefit from the additional investment I obtained in budget 2017 for September.  I hope to update Deputies in that regard in the very near future.  </p>  <p>  In budget 2017, I was pleased to secure &euro;14.5 million to help ease the burden of administration on child care providers by paying for non-contact time on top of existing payments.  Providers will receive payments this summer.  Community child care services that provide the various funding schemes operated by my Department will receive payments.  The average ECCE service with 25 children will receive approximately an additional &euro;2,200.  My Department and its agents, Pobal and the 30 city and county childcare committees work closely with services that are experiencing financial difficulty offering a range of supports and expertise.</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep in contact with community services regarding the challenges they face.  My officials are also working with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and other support services, to ensure we have the proper funding and supports in place for children and families to ensure that community child care providers can provide their unique role in our communities.</p></speech>

I think the Minister appreciates how vital these services are.  The reality is that without them many of those children will be completely left behind by our society.  They are in areas of disadvantage and many of the children have complex needs, including special needs and issues in terms of the home environment and so on.  That is the reality.  I think the Minister appreciates that.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the first payments are being issued this week.  Can the Minister give a commitment that all relevant payments will be issued immediately on receipt of contracts?  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, the contracts have been submitted by the Cork providers.  More fundamentally, when will the overall independent review be completed by?  The emergency funding is a stopgap.  It will probably get them to September.  We are being told by these providers that seven of them are in grave danger.  They are at imminent risk of closure in the autumn.  It is not a position we can stand over.</p><p>Please, work with the providers on these issues in a genuine spirit of co-operation and ensure that their funding is on a sustainable footing so that these crucial services are maintained into the future.</p></speech>

I recognise that she has a long and well-known background in early years services dating back to An Cos&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  There are two major parts - the short and long terms - to this issue.  In the short term, we were trying to address the urgent matter of access to funding.  A commitment was made in that regard.  I welcome that some of that funding will come on stream this week and I hope the remainder of the services, not only in Cork but nationally, will see it entering their accounts in the coming week. However, the longer term issue remains.  I hope the Minister takes account of the research conducted in Cork by various organisations and ensures that this matter is resolved on an ongoing basis.  Some services will not benefit from the funding, including one in Cork that deals primarily with Travellers and has no entitlement to sustainability funding because it was not reliant on community employment, CE, schemes to that extent.  A number of such community services will need additional subventions on an ongoing basis.  I hope the Minister will commit to keeping an eye on this matter.</p></speech>

The first payments under this programme will be received by services this week, including five in Cork.  Better late than never, I suppose, and it is welcome news, but what of the others?  Will they receive their money by Easter or by the end of April?  I am referring to centres that have submitted all of the paperwork and are just waiting for what they were promised and what has been announced in no fewer than three separate press statements to the Evening Echo.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister three questions about the demands of the campaigners, but she did not reply.  Could she reply to this supplementary question?</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to qualifications, which are important.  Qualified staff should be well paid, but the average pay for child care professionals is &euro;10.26 per hour.  I support the Big Start campaign's call for &euro;15 per hour.  Will the Minister comment on the issues of low pay among these professionals and increase the rate to &euro;15?</p></speech>

I would love to see that, but it will require significant additional investment.  I have indicated that I am committed to doing that in the next budget.  I achieved a significant increase in investment for this year and am looking for something similar in 2018.  We are far behind where we want to be in terms of Government investment in child care.  That happened as a result of how recent Governments responded to this issue.  I anticipate that Deputies will support the request for additional investment in September as I work on budget 2018.  That is how we will increase the universal payment.</p>  <p>  As to an additional staff grant, we are examining that issue in the context of assigning financial analysts to work one-on-one with services with a view to assessing their business models and their requests for money or more staff supports to provide child care in light of levels of need in their respective areas.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the commitment to the early years sector to which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred.  I understand that the grants are taking a while.  That is disappointing, but they are coming.  As I indicated, money is being made available and financial analysts to work directly with those services that need them will be appointed.  We will provide non-contact time grants again, probably this June.  Those are additional moneys.  We hope to progress our independent review in 2017.</p></speech>

I have met him and his officials regarding it a couple of times.  I thank them for giving of their time over the past year or more.  It was one of the first issues I raised when I first joined the D&aacute;il.  I did so because of the importance of such schemes to individuals and communities, not just in my constituency of Kildare North, but elsewhere.  This is a problem nationally, as I am sure the Minister is aware.  It has also been raised by my colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p>  <p>  We must examine the current T&uacute;s schemes and I want to determine with the Minister how their timeframes can be extended in certain circumstances.  This matter is included in the programme for Government, which is welcome.  The intention of these schemes is to reintroduce people to full and gainful employment.  Unfortunately, that is not the outcome, and may never be, for all participants.  We must focus on delivering improvements in that regard.</p>  <p>  The system is not working well.  Participants on T&uacute;s schemes are carrying out valuable work for their communities.  The difficulty is that, although they must leave the schemes after a year, no one is coming through to replace them and allow their work to continue and their communities and hosts - football clubs, soccer clubs, athletics clubs, etc. - to gain.  This problem is having a negative effect on participants, communities and groups.  Participants are engaging in JobPath schemes and the like because they are not able to continue with T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister extend the T&uacute;s schemes for people in particular age brackets who know that, realistically, they will not be able to return to full-time employment but who nevertheless provide a much-valued social contribution to their schemes and communities?  That contribution needs to be extended.  I am unsure as to whether the problem in this regard is that unemployment is decreasing and people are not coming through or whether there is an issue with getting on lists, but the lists are not coming through.  I engage with the hosts and scheme administrators on the ground.  They are not getting the lists or a continuity of people, which has a detrimental effect on everyone involved.</p>  <p>  Given the age profile in question - over 55, 57 or 60 years, for example - we need to consider extending the schemes for these individuals.  The schemes have brought benefits and advantages, but they need to be reviewed in certain areas in order to help their participants.  The current system is not working because of a major issue.  If it is not addressed, I would be concerned for all involved.  Some schemes have no participants.  The main sufferers of that are the communities, groups and those participants who had to leave their schemes.</p></speech>
