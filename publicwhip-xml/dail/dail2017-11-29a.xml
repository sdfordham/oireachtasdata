All participants on the formal workshops and CV preparation must be referred by the Department or LES.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity provided through Intreo and JobPath and the reduction of the live register means the LES can now focus on offering an enhanced service to jobseekers.  In line with best practice, and OECD benchmarks, smaller caseloads are key to the provision of the type of one-to-one intensive support and assistance that jobseekers benefit the most from, particularly the long-term unemployed.  </p>  <p>  The funding and total value of these contracts for the provision of the services has been continually maintained over the years, both through periods of economic downturn and in more recent years during a period where we have seen a welcome reduction in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, from a peak of 15.2% to 6.0%.</p>  <p>The LES and jobs clubs contracts are for a maximum of one year, January to December inclusive, and I can now advise the Deputy that we are committed to the provision of those services.  The contract bid process for 2018 is underway and it is anticipated that there will be no changes, apart from the enhanced services.  The volume of money and the number of people providing the service will be no different than heretofore. </p></speech>

She will be aware that the local employment service deals with people other than those on the live register.  It deals with walk-in clients and people who are genuinely seeking employment but who are not on the live register, for whatever reason.  The Minister will agree that it is important to provide a public employment service for everybody seeking employment, irrespective of whether they are on the live register.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister comment on the status of the Indecon report on the local employment service?  Has she received the report and when is it proposed to publish it?</p></speech>

I did this just to be nosey and see exactly what was happening first hand.</p><p>The reception I got from those in receipt of the services was exceptionally good.  By their own accounts, the services are exceptionally valuable.  There is real value in the service.  I want to confirm to the Deputy and the House that I and the Department recognise that and there is no change to those services.</p> <p> I can confirm that the total contract value last year was just over &euro;20 million for the LES and just over &euro;6 million for jobs clubs, and I do not expect there to be any change next year.  While there may be a reduction in the numbers of participants in the centres, we can have more bang for our buck in terms of giving an enhanced service to those availing of it.</p> <p> I have not received the INDECON report on the LES and I will inquire today as to when it will be ready.  As soon as I know, I will revert to the Deputy directly or indirectly.</p></speech>

Would the Minister agree that, in view of the drop in unemployment and the fact that the LES generally deals with people at the furthest distance from the labour market who, for one reason or another, find it very difficult to get long-term employment, that this is rather onerous and should be changed to include people placed in part-time jobs?  Many people will initially get part-time employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900004#B00300"><p>I know why the Deputy is saying that, but the answer is "No" because we will not reduce our ambition to provide people with assistance in getting full-time jobs.  The 30% figure is a target.  It is not set in stone.  If a service reaches 28.5% we will not cut the legs off it.  The LES and every single jobs club does extremely valuable work.</p>  <p>  In some cases, services have been reconfigured or clubs have been merged because of a reduction in numbers, but not because there has been a reduction in the value of the money, commitment or services provided by the contract and Department.  It is simply about reorganisation.  There is no club which does not have the ability to come and make a case if it does not reach the minimum target in terms of why, where, when and what it will do to make sure it meets it next year.  It is not about reducing standards.  We are committed to working together to make sure that we address clubs where there are particular difficulties.  That does not really happen because the commitment and ambition of the LES and all jobs clubs are to help people who are jobs ready to match the skills they have with the jobs which are available.</p>  <p>  The system is working and some LES centres have a jobs finding rate far in excess of 30%.  The Deputy may know of one particular case.  We are always willing to talk if changes are required.  It would be silly for us to make a change to the ambition of what was set down.</p></speech>

I am well aware that retained firefighters provide services which are vital to the communities they serve.  They are very well respected.  We may engage in a cat-and-mouse exchange.  I am not aware of any specific difficulties with retained firefighters with regard to INTREO or JobPath.</p>  <p>  Retained firefighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of the days that they are engaged in firefighting and-or training, subject to the usual qualification conditions pertaining to means or social insurance contributions.  They are also required to satisfy the statutory conditions to receive jobseeker's payments of being available for the days they are not training or on call and genuinely seeking full-time work.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 included amendments to jobseeker's benefit and allowance which put the treatment of retained firefighters on a legislative basis.  We did not make individual exceptions for them; the rules are now on a statutory footing.  The amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by these men and women, in particular in rural communities where, as I said, fire safety is exclusively provided by retained firefighters.</p>  <p>  The legislation now provides that when a retained firefighter is on call, this does not result in the disallowance of a jobseeker's payment on the grounds of being available for work because he or she is available.  However, all retained firefighters in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's various activation units, including those delivered by the Deputy's favourite organisation, JobPath.  During the course of the engagement between the case officer and the jobseeker, all possible pro-employment incentives are explored and discussed with jobseekers.  Retained firefighters referred to activation services have every opportunity during the course of those meetings with their personal advisor to schedule around their firefighting, training and on-call duties.  I can guarantee that the case officer should be as flexible as he or she possibly can and need to be in regard to dealing retained firefighters.</p>  <p>  Activation is intended to be a positive experience.  If the Deputy is aware of any difficulties I would be very grateful if he told me about them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900004#B00700"><p>I thank the Minister for the response.  A recent reply from the Department to a parliamentary question stated that 482 retained firefighters are in receipt of jobseeker's payment.  That shows the difficulty retained firefighters have in holding down full-time employment due to the nature of their work.  The legislation introduced to reflect that in 2013 states that the legislation and associated regulations allow retained firefighters a reasonable and fair level of access to jobseeker's schemes, given the unique circumstances of the service they provide to communities.</p>  <p>  I have met retained firefighters in rural areas who do not have access to employment or flexible employers, given the nature of their retained services.  Retained firefighters in many areas are on call 24-7.  They are engaging with case officers in INTREO offices and are being put under severe pressure to find employment, no matter where it is, or be moved to JobPath which, they are told, will get them jobs.  </p>  <p>  Has provision been made for the special circumstance of retained firefighters by INTREO offices and JobPath?  Are their unique employment circumstances taken into account?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900004#B00800"><p>As I said in my initial reply, the legislation was changed in 2013 to reflect the special status of firefighters, which carries through to all of the activation measures in which we engage.  As I said, they are in the main a positive experience which result in people who are unemployed getting work or people who are under-employed getting more work.</p>  <p>  Those working in any of our activation processes in INTREO, JobPath, jobs clubs, JobsPlus or any other organisation which fulfils contracts for the Department are well aware of the conditions under which firefighters have to work and work around them.  I am not sure whether the Deputy is suggesting that we should treat retained firefighting as a full-time job and not help firefighters to get more employment.  Is he suggesting that they are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week and, therefore, are not available?</p>  <p>  If either of those things happen, retained firefighters do not satisfy the conditions of jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  A large number of the 482 retained firefighters to whom the Deputy referred rely on jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  Therefore, they need to satisfy the conditions in order to avail of those payments, exclusive of any activation programmes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900004#B00900"><p>I thank the Minister.  I do not think she is getting the point I am making.  The legislation introduced in 2013 dealt with the specific circumstances around the employment of retained firefighters who are on call 24-7.  That does not mean that they are dealing with emergency situations every day of the week.  They may get a call once a week or, in certain circumstances, every six months.  They do not know what will happen from one week to the next.</p><p>I will cite a specific local case, which is replicated across the State.  I met retained firefighters in Dunlavin in my constituency of Wicklow, half of whom are in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  They have been dealing with case officers for up to 12 months.  As they reach the end of the process, they are coming under pressure from case officers to take a job anywhere or they will be moved on to JobPath and that service will find a job for them.  No consideration is given to the nature of their employment as retained firefighters and the requirement to be able to reach their local fire station from home or work within five minutes of a call-out.</p></speech>

There are no places available on the community employment scheme in the town.  Two retained firefighters are on the scheme and there are no other employment opportunities locally.  They are being forced to take employment in neighbouring counties, which places their jobs in the retained fire service in jeopardy.</p></speech>

I decided to speak slowly today but perhaps I will speed up.</p>  <p>  The issue the Deputy raises is genuinely not in contention.  We return to the fact that one of the conditions of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance is that the recipient must be available for work.  A special condition was inserted in the legislation to recognise that retained firefighters are not always available for work.  In all of the activation programmes, whether community employment, the T&uacute;s scheme, the rural social scheme, jobs clubs, JobPath or the Intreo services, there is a recognition that retained firefighters are not available for work on the days they are on call or in training.  However, we cannot discount the days on which they are not on call or in training because these days are the reason they qualify for jobseeker's payment in the first instance.  The ambition of all those in receipt of a jobseeker's payment is to secure a job.  That is not my ambition but their ambition, which is the reason the support schemes and payments were set up as they were.  The purpose of the payment is to keep recipients ticking over, albeit at a basic level, until they find a job.  The Deputy appears to suggest we should leave retained firefighters alone.  I am not sure that would be the right thing to do. </p></speech>

My understanding is that it is the policy of the Department that people will not be required to pursue an ex-partner who has been violent or abusive.  Unfortunately, while this may be the general policy, the Department does not appear to have protocols or procedures in place to ensure this occurs.  I have dealt with cases of people being told in fairly blunt terms to seek maintenance against a violent or abusive former partner or else lose the lone parent allowance.  What is the up-to-date position in this regard?</p></reply>

It is nice to see them again.</p>  <p>  I will provide a little background before informing the House of developments in the past week.  The Family Law Acts, which are under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, place a legal obligation on parents to maintain and mind their children.  This is a civil law matter.  In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply to the mother and father.  Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either through family mediation, the Legal Aid Board or the courts, all of which are under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  It is a condition of the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment schemes that lone parents must make efforts to seek maintenance from the other parent, for example, evidence of a private maintenance arrangement or court proceedings, a court summons or a mediation process.  The condition to make efforts to seek maintenance is regarded as having been satisfied once appropriate efforts are made, even if they do not result in a maintenance payment being made.</p>  <p>  My Department takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously.  We are in the middle of Women's Aid's "16 Days" campaign which I fully support every year.  I also recognise that the maintenance recovery unit does a worthwhile job in assisting people where its assistance is required.  The guidelines in place in my Department with regard to seeking maintenance are clear in respect of circumstances involving domestic abuse or violence.  Claims should be processed without delay to the individual who presents and without the lone parent who has the child ever having to contact the former partner.</p>  <p>  Historically, for reasons of data protection, when a person presented to a local social welfare office indicating that he or she was in a difficult or vulnerable position, a flag was not placed on his or her electronic record because the Department did not want him or her to be known for that particular flag.  In the past week, a case was brought to my attention by a very brave young woman.  Last Friday, I met the young woman in question and her beautiful little boy and we had a long conversation about what had happened to her in order that I could learn about what broke down in the delivery of the Department's services.  We have learned a couple of things, the first of which is that there is a disconnect between local offices and the maintenance recovery section caused by the lack of a flag on the electronic record.  My information technology staff and I have a window at the beginning of December to change the position.  Once this has been done, it will be possible to tick a box indicating that a letter should not be sent out.  No reason or explanation will be given for flagging the person's record.  However, when the maintenance recovery section receives the file the ticked box will indicate that a letter will not be required. </p>  <p>  I also had the privilege of meeting representatives of Women's Aid in the Department yesterday.  I rang the organisation last week requesting a meeting and we had the launch of the "16 Days" campaign on Friday.  We gave Women's Aid copies of all the letters and correspondence the Department sends to lone parents, with a view to having these documents adapted and changed through the lens of someone who is in a vulnerable position and to ensure that no one, even through human error, will receive a letter that causes pain or distress, such as occurred last week.  Women's Aid agreed to come back to me within a week with suggestions on the wording of the correspondence.  We also agreed that Women's Aid will develop an accredited training course for the Department to be delivered to all front-line staff who may deal with a person who is in a vulnerable or precarious position.  The training course will be delivered by Women's Aid in conjunction with the Department's staff development and training unit.  We agreed at our meeting yesterday to set this process in train and it will be completed in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  On the back of yesterday's meeting, the Department also established a working group to recommence work it was doing on maintenance recovery last year.  This work was interrupted by the delivery of the Indecon report on the one-parent family payment because the same group of officials was doing the work in both areas.  We are now back where we were seven months ago in terms of reflecting on the collection of maintenance payments, the reasons for current practice in this area and how best to move forward with the process, where necessary.  I will seek suggestions on this issue in future.  Some Deputies and Senators have already contacted me with a view to making an input in the process.  I will be grateful to receive helpful submissions on the issue. </p></speech>

She is correct that there is a disconnect within the Department, centrally and locally.  I have come across cases where barring or protection orders had been submitted, yet a local social welfare officer insisted on the person in question pursuing a maintenance claim.</p>  <p>  On the liable relative provisions, traditionally it has been possible for a person in receipt of one-parent's payment, in conjunction with the Department, to get the recovery maintenance unit involved in collecting money from a former partner.  This no longer occurs when the youngest child reaches his or her seventh birthday and the lone parent transfers to the jobseeker's transition payment.  Why are the services of the maintenance recovery unit not available to people who have been in receipt of one-parent's allowance who transition to the jobseeker's transition payment because the youngest child reaches the age of seven?</p></speech>

When she produced a safety order, the staff member said such orders were quite easy to obtain and intimated that some people got them to avoid having maintenance payments factored in.  That is completely and utterly unacceptable.  This issue has been highlighted and the Minister has met the person involved, as well as a number of organisations.  However, we need a need a clear protocol to be issued in order that a victim simply stating he or she is a victim will be enough.  I press the Minister to state this is the instruction that is being issued to all local offices because many victims do not obtain safety orders.  It is estimated that 79% of victims do not obtain them.  We know that many victims experience financial, emotional and other forms of abuse and having to make any contact with an abusive partner can get them into so much difficulty.  We should not be re-victimising them in this way.  We should also recognise that when women become pregnant, it can, unfortunately, be a red flag for further abuse.  Often fathers seek to control women.  A study carried out in the Rotunda Hospital showed that one in eight women attending had experienced some form of abuse during pregnancy.  Much of this emanates from the Government's welfare cheats campaign.  I know that the Minister is now taking action to resolve the issue, but a philosophy is spreading within the Department that staff check, question and do everything that it is possible to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900006#D01000"><p>I welcome the progress the Minister is making.  However, I deplore the fact that it took a courageous mother, a report in <i>The Irish</i><i>Times, </i>coverage in various media, particularly an interview with the Minister on the Se&aacute;n O'Rourke radio programme, and questions in the D&aacute;il to bring about change.  That is most unfortunate, given the appalling statistics.  Have officials in the Department read the report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection that was produced in June?  It mentions specific problems experienced by lone parents and other mothers in the context of domestic violence.  It also references the need for a national maintenance agency.  That is one element of my question, namely, what is the situation with regard to the establishment of such an agency?  The second part of my question relates to training.  The Minister has confirmed that training will be provided for staff.  I hope such training will be ongoing and would like more details on it.  I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery whom I do not want to identify.  I praise their courage.  We have raised this issue repeatedly in the context of the SAVI report and so on.  If we extrapolate from the 2016 figures, we find that 4,831 requests for refuge were refused because there was no space available.  That represents approximately 14 unmet requests every single day, yet we have the Department writing letters of this nature.  Will the Minister confirm that such letters will never be written and sent ever again?  As regards the grey area, is the Minister telling us that only those who produce orders will receive payments?  Will she clarify the matter?  In summary, I have asked about the establishment of a national maintenance agency, the nature of the ongoing training provided and what must be produced by claimants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900006#D01100"><p>In response to Deputy Willie O'Dea's question, I do not know why the maintenance recovery division does not operate after a child reaches the age of seven years, but I will find out.  The Deputy is aware that under section 12 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, we have the ability, through the maintenance recovery division, to go after somebody for maintenance.  To be honest, I question why we even do that.  The whole idea in having a Department of Social Protection is to protect people who are vulnerable.  There may be a requirement to establish a national maintenance agency, but, to be honest, I do not see where it would fall into the space of my Department.  The issue will form part of the exploratory work we will do in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Ruth Coppinger, I have two comments to make, one of which will go some way towards also answering Deputy Catherine Connolly's question.  There are clear protocols in place for any woman - in the main, we are talking about women, although, obviously, there are some exceptions - who comes to our office looking to receive the one-parent family payment and who is in a vulnerable position.  My job is to lead a Department that believes women, not one that makes a woman to prove something or get a piece of paper but one that listens to her story and believes her.  If there is any woman who is finding it difficult, it may be because front-line staff have not received the correct training, but that issue is being resolved.  I assure Deputy Catherine Connolly that it will not be me who will devise the training course but Women's Aid which has specific knowledge and experience.  Its trainers, with their specific knowledge, training and experience, will train our staff.  </p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about the letter, because of the way the law stands, parents have a responsibility to their children.  The State does not step in to take over that responsibility where parents have the means and ability to be responsible for their children.  Therefore, letters will be sent.  However, I suggest such letters be sent to the neglectful parent rather than the parent who is raising the children.  Again, that issue will form part of the discussions we will have in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  There are clear protocols in place.  We do believe women and I will not tolerate a situation where we do not.  No woman who expresses the view that she is in a vulnerable position will receive a letter.  However, there are other letters that are sent by the maintenance recovery division and we need to have a wider conversation about whether a national agency is required to provide for maintenance recovery and, more importantly, whether my Department should have any hand, act or part in that process.  That is the course of the conversation that should have in the coming weeks.  On the actions I have taken, the letters will be modified.  I hope the language used in them will never cause the distress caused in the last week.  The IT systems will change.  When a person presents at a local office to relate his or her experience, without a shadow of a doubt, he or she will be believed, and the IT systems will reflect this in order that no person in a vulnerable position will receive one of the Department's letters.  We will also pursue the provision of training for all of our staff who, in the main, provide an empathetic and human response and try to provide people with assistance during periods of their lives in which they cannot afford to mind themselves.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have plans to amend the legislation to provide for this?  It makes no sense that the maintenance recovery division can operate up to a child's seventh birthday and that once the child reaches the age of seven years, the parent is more or less on his or her own.  At the same time, the ex-partner will have received a letter from the Department stating he or she is no longer liable to pay maintenance.  By any standard, that is undesirable.  I argue having a national maintenance agency is very relevant in the context of the Department of Social Protection.  We are talking about a mechanism to compel people to discharge their responsibilities, which responsibilities have resulted in the Department paying out money.  We are asking the people in question to make a contribution.</p><p>If there is an effective national agency recovering money from those people, the Department will have more money to redirect to other areas, such as that relating to disabilities.</p></speech>

Obviously, not everyone would be in a position to do that.  I also acknowledge SPARK, which provided assistance.  How many other women have received these letters or verbal messages from local Department offices?</p>  <p>  The most dangerous time for any victim of abuse is when she leaves a relationship, yet society questions why women stay in abusive relationships.  Ending a relationship and severing contact are extremely dangerous steps for women who are victims of domestic violence to take.  We need an education campaign on this matter across society.  It should not only be addressed in the Department.  I acknowledge that this is not strictly under the remit of the Minister's Department but women will come into contact with the Department.  Some 80% of people who are abused are abused by partners or ex-partners according to Women's Aid.  At the extreme end, 55% of murders of women are by partners or ex-partners.  One in three women will experience psychological abuse in her lifetime.  We are seeing an increase in stalking by means of social media. There are many ways in which an abuser may maintain control over a victim of domestic violence.  Unless we fund refuges, it will be extremely difficult for women to leave abusive situations.  Rape crisis centres have had their funding cut by 30%.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is not a clear practice and that is why we are here.  I would be more reassured if the Minister told me there is now a clear practice, that she has given direction in this regard and that letters of the kind in question will never be sent out again.  The letter we referred to, brought to our attention and the attention of SPARK by the courageous woman involved, was not an aberration; it was a reflection of the practice in the Minister's Department in respect of people, mostly women, in receipt of the lone parent's allowance and also suffering as a result of domestic violence.  The extent of domestic violence is absolutely extraordinary.  Some 12,500 people per year are affected.  The Safe Ireland document is worth reading.  Deputy Coppinger and I have mentioned this, as have other female Deputies.  Perhaps when the male Deputies come on board, we will have some change in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I did not doubt the training being provided by Women's Aid or Safe Ireland.  I asked the Minister about the types of procedures that are in place for ongoing training.  An understanding of domestic violence is extraordinarily complex to get across.  It seems simple but it is a matter of bringing it home to staff.  On top of that, 79% of those affected simply do not report domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Let me return to the question by my colleague from Fianna F&aacute;il.  Could the Minister please confirm, given the extraordinary extent of domestic violence, that one does not need a protection order, barring order or safety order in one's hand to receive the payment?  Could the Minister confirm that there is training ongoing?</p></speech>

There is no need for a piece of paper or a barring order.  I must state very clearly, as I did a few minutes ago, that we believe women.  The inference is otherwise, that somebody might make up a story of domestic violence.  That is so distasteful it is not funny.  Very clearly, we believe women.  If a woman or a man arrives at a local office anywhere in the country and tells the staff about a vulnerable situation, that will be the end of his or her story.</p>  <p>  I have already explained to the Deputy that I cannot guarantee her that people will not get letters because it is a function of the maintenance recovery department.</p></speech>

When I read the letter, it actually seemed relatively benign.  I have never been in a vulnerable position, thankfully, and that is why I called Ursula Regan from Women's Aid and asked her to come in with Margaret Martin to go through the letters and look at them from their perspective as people who deal with vulnerable women and men on a daily basis.  They will write the letters; I am not going to write them.  This will form part of what will be provided as part of a protocol in our office.</p>  <p>  As I have told the Deputy, we are going to change the IT system so that, irrespective of the wording of the letters, anybody vulnerable who has ever presented with a case will never get a letter.  Right now, however, there is a requirement to receive a one-parent family payment to pursue the parent who is not contributing to the maintenance of his or her child.  I actually had to question why we are using the person who is maintaining the child as the conduit to chase the person who is not.  I say this for all the reasons Deputy Coppinger raised, not least of which is that the undesirable arrangement referred to puts women back in the position of being under the control and power of men.  Although most men are not abusive, why should a woman be under the control or power of a man because she has chosen to leave him and rear her children on her own?  I have so many questions on the maintenance recovery section of my Department but, as I said, we will pursue in the coming weeks the best way to go forward with regard to maintenance recovery.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea is correct that it is absolutely ludicrous that we should be sending a letter to a man to say that just because Mary is seven and a half now, he has no more responsibility for her.  That does not reflect the way I was reared, nor the way most people were reared.  If one has a child, one has a responsibility to that child until he or she is 18 and, as most parents will tell one, long after that.  That should be true for every single person who has a child, irrespective of whether he or she is living in the house with the child.  The obligation we have towards our children stands for many years after the age of seven.</p>  <p>  To be honest with the Deputy, I was made aware of the letter only yesterday.  The situation is ludicrous and that is why we need to reflect on the role our Department should play, if any, in maintenance recovery in respect of welfare payments to children by the parents who are no longer in their lives on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The most recent data show that the unemployment rate fell from a peak of 15% in 2012 to just over 6% in mid-2017.  The number at work has increased from just over 1.8 million in quarter 2 of 2012 to over 2 million in quarter 2 of 2017.  That is an increase of just under 230,000 people with new jobs.  Within the south-east region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a staggering 19% to 8.1% over the same period, and the number in employment has increased by 29,000 to 214,900.</p>  <p>  While the data from the QNHS are not available at county level, trends in the live register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.  Overall, the live register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in five years, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to October 2017, the live register number in Wexford has fallen by 1,741 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend.</p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 has been twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, the objective is to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  The policy now includes a specific regional action plan for jobs for the south east that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the area over the past two years.  Second, through Pathways to Work, we ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the live register.  Under this policy, the employment service and activation supports provided by my Department are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.  For example, case officers in Wexford are currently working with over 1,400 people in identifying suitable employment and training opportunities.  Almost 3,000 referrals to training and educational opportunities took place in 2016.  A total of 1,165 of those training opportunities have been made to date in 2017, an increase of over 33% on the same period in 2016.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy is concerned about his region but the policies we have put in place, both through activation and the Action Plan for Jobs, are working.  We will continue to give extra support to Wexford until its figures are in line with the national trend.</p></speech>

The south east in general and parts of Wexford in particular continue to suffer unnecessarily from high unemployment.  I say unnecessarily because there is a huge untapped potential in terms of the economy in County Wexford, particularly in light of its proximity to Dublin and Europe.  I am particularly concerned that, in the broader statistics of decreasing unemployment, local areas with persistent unemployment will be lost in the statistics and forgotten.  It will take targeted measures to address the high levels of unemployment in certain parts of Wexford.  I am especially concerned about unemployed people under the age of 25 and those over the age of 55.  Will the Minister outline the specific programmes to target youth unemployment and unemployment among those aged over 55, particularly in circumstances where individuals have been unemployed long term?</p></speech>

Specific care, attention and extra resources are being given to the south east.  The unemployment rate in the south east is still relatively high at 8.1% given that the national average is 6%.</p>  <p>  In terms of the identification of unemployment black spots identified in the census, it is important to recognise that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's services through the Intreo offices, jobs clubs, JobPath and other activation measures are focused on unemployed individuals as opposed to specific areas.  This means that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated get the most supports.  That is currently what happens and it will continue to happen in the south east.  We will work to ensure that the success realised in recent years in terms of the improvement of employment levels in Deputy Browne's area will continue.  We will keep working until everybody who wants a job can get a job.</p></speech>

High rates of unemployment continue to be a feature in parts of County Wexford.</p>  <p>  In the context of activation programmes and trying to get individuals back into the workforce, I am concerned that some of the activity in this regard is not being pursued in an intelligent manner.  I am aware of many people both under the age of 25 and over the age of 55 who suffer from obvious mental health problems.  They have difficulties remaining in mainstream employment but they are being taken off community employment, CE, schemes in circumstances where, for example, they are contributing to local society.  I refer to meals on wheels schemes, village renewal schemes and work in community centres.  Those people are being forced into training and start-your-own-business schemes for which they are plainly not suitable when it would be good for their mental health and for the community if they were allowed to remain on the schemes to which I refer.  The concerns of individuals who are experiencing difficulties should be addressed.</p></speech>

People come to the end of their term and have to go to other activation programmes, as is the norm.  The CE schemes are under review in the context of changing those terms and conditions to reflect some of the things Deputy Browne suggested.

The result is a loss of PRSI contributions and a loss to the Exchequer in general.  There are also major implications for workers' rights and entitlements.</p></reply>

Bogus self-employment arises when an employer wrongly treats a worker as an independent contractor in order to avoid paying tax and social insurance contributions.  There are no official data on the extent of bogus self-employment but I wish there was.  It is not clear whether the problem is growing but, anecdotally, we are all aware that the norms within working environments are changing.</p><p>The recent data from the  quarterly national household survey records 312,000 individuals as self-employed in 2017, which accounts for 15% of the overall number of people in employment.  The survey does not show any significant increase in the numbers claiming to be self-employed, nor does it show any significant disparity between Ireland and other European countries.  It is a case that we all have a problem and that we have had it for a long time and have just not addressed it.  I hope the House collectively wants to fix that.</p><p>Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses as part of the ongoing compliance operations.  Inspections are conducted jointly between the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, the matter is pursued.  Officials also investigate specific claims brought to the Department's attention by either individuals or organisations.  The relevant section in the Department is the scope insurability section.  The section determines the employment status of individuals at their request or on the request of a company.  Where a misclassification of a worker as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class are determined and social insurance arrears are collected.  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences concerning employment contributions.  On conviction, fines and-or imprisonment can ultimately imposed.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Any worker who has concerns about his or her employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated.</p><p>The classification of a worker for PRSI purposes is increasingly complicated by what is termed &quot;disguised employment&quot;.  The latter involves intermediary employment structures and certain self-employment arrangements.  My Department is concerned that such mechanisms are being used to reduce the amount of PRSI and tax being paid, with a subsequent loss to the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.  An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners has completed a report on this issue.  The Minister for Finance and I are considering the report with a view to its publication in the near future.</p></speech>

There is not just anecdotal evidence of bogus self-employment in the construction sector, it is also a feature in the information technology, IT, and media sectors.  In January 2016, the then Ministers for Social Protection and Finance launched a joint consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements.  A public consultation process was initiated and a total of 23 submissions were made to it.  Last month, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and was informed that the two Departments are working on the issue and that the submissions are still being assessed.  The public consultation took place 20 months ago.  We need action.  What is the status of the report and when will it be published?  The issue is very serious.  I will refer to other areas in a moment but I would first like the Minister to respond.</p></speech>

They have been considered.  My real concern is that there were only 23 in The report is being considered by me and the Minister for Finance.  I expect to be able to publish it in the next couple of weeks with a view to determining actions we will take at the beginning of next year to address the issue.</p>  <p>  My concerns are twofold.  It is not my job to collect social insurance contributions but it is my job to spend the money from those contributions.</p><p>If I had what we all perceive to be the shortfall of employers' PRSI to spend, we could have a really different conversation in this House on how to spend it.  Equally important to me are employment rights, which is my responsibility for those people who find themselves in positions where they are forced into self-employment, as opposed to real employment.  I am determined to fix that early next year.  If there is a bonus of getting a couple of million euro or a couple of hundred million euro extra in social insurance contributions, I will enjoy having that conversation at the committee on how to spend it.</p></speech>

Has that happened?  We know there is much money lost to Revenue and through potential social insurance contributions.  The overall loss to the Exchequer could be &euro;80 million.</p>  <p>  The Minister also touched on inspections being carried out by the Department but I ask for specifics on that.  I am not sure what exactly officials or inspectors from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are looking for when they go into check this type of employment, whether it is on a building site or elsewhere.  Perhaps in the first instance they check if somebody is in receipt of a jobseeker's payment and working as well.  That does not cut to the chase.  There are people who are forced into self-employment who are losing out on their entitlements as an employee.  For example, they should be entitled to sick pay, holiday pay and all the other entitlements that go along with that.  It is a serious problem not just in the construction industry, as I stated, but in other areas.</p>  <p>  How many of these inspections have been carried out and in what type of employment?  Have they just targeted the construction industry?  Have they gone to places such as RT&Eacute;, for example, and what exactly are the inspectors looking for?  I would like more specifics on the inspectors.</p></speech>

The inspectors who look after this have nothing to do with trying to figure out if a person is on a jobseeker's payment.  That is somebody else's job.  The inspectors involved with assessing insurability contributions go into a job and see that a person is in class S when he or she should be in class K.  They will reflect that and get it changed.  It is about working with both the employer and employee to ensure the right classification of a social insurance contribution is made on behalf of employees, and if it is not, to back-track it and ensure dues to the State are paid.</p>  <p>  There is also the scope section within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Any of the people suggested by the Deputy who may find themselves in positions where they know they are not really self-employed can make a complaint or inquiry to the Department any day of the week and we will follow it up.  The problem is these people do not do so.  They do it in small numbers.  My belief is many of the 312,000 people perhaps do not know about the scope unit and we will address that in the new year.</p>  <p>  I am not sure I said the report was going to a sub-committee of the Cabinet.  That might have been the other report on the pensions anomaly.  I have so many reports coming out of my ears at this stage, it is not funny.  This report is not going to a sub-committee of the Cabinet but it is going to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks.  The only reason I am holding off is because I am not prepared to send a report to the Cabinet without clear, precise, specific recommendations as to how we can address the matter.  That is what I am considering now with the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

In my head, it covers two elements.  The first is a progress report on the investigation sought by the Minister from the Pensions Authority into the Aer Lingus second supplementary pension scheme.  It could also potentially address the review of the annuity matter we discussed in a Topical Issue some time ago.</p></reply>

The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  I had previously confirmed that the matter relating to the scheme we spoke about recently has been raised by my Department with the Pensions Authority.  It has informed me that an examination of the scheme is being actively pursued.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a breach of any legal obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach is found.  I am not in a position to tell the Deputy when this will happen, and I know that is probably frustrating.  In fairness, the authority is doing a good deed for us and it is not within my gift to tell it to hurry up.  The authority will revert as quickly as it can.</p>  <p>  There is another matter that is not reflected in the question.  I know the Deputy has some amendments to the Social Welfare Bill and I spoke to her colleague yesterday evening when we were debating the Bill.  The amendments will be ruled out of order in regard to this Bill.  They are not suitable for this Bill and they would be more appropriate for the social welfare and pensions Bill.  I ask her to put down the amendments again to that Bill.</p></speech>

I suppose the reassurance that staff and members of the scheme want is to know the investigation is still being actively pursued.  There is a worry about a time delay.  I remind the House we were dealing with a case where a second supplementary pension scheme had &euro;100 million in it was sitting there for two years, belonging to people who had retired in the mean time and other people who had a right to access those benefits.  It was being bled by management charges, payments and so on, basically haemorrhaging value.  The big concern for staff is that after pushing for assets to be distributed for almost two years, finally getting the most appalling distribution mechanism that anyone could have thought and putting a block on that, the danger is that the investigation may lead to moneys not being distributed for a further period.  I ask that we keep the pressure on.  It is probably the reason for this question.  There are many people with entitlements who have been treated quite shabbily.</p></speech>

I am very happy to have done that.  We saw this parliamentary question come in this week and we contacted the authority again, which gave us the assurance that the investigation is being actively pursued.

There are broader matters linking to this scheme, the wind-up and annuities being purchased for pensioners.  This morning, a joint life annuity allowing for 1.5% inflation per year would cost &euro;37 for every &euro;1 of pension.  We discussed last week the need to seriously address that area.  There is some form of consultation that the Department will initiate in that respect.  It is incredibly urgent, given the number of pensioners who need to access funds, who are essentially being bled dry and whose schemes are losing money because of what needs to go to annuity purchases.  The only winners in that are the big companies and so and it is to the detriment of others with the reduction of benefits in the scheme.  We need an urgent review of all aspects of the area.  Many of the issues with this scheme are linked to the so-called minimum funding standard and liabilities being calculated on annuity prices.  This is quite urgent and we must progress the matter.</p></speech>

The Pensions Act 1990 is the legislation that must be amended but the Taxes Consolidation Act allows flexible options.  That is the area where what we are discussing must be reflected.  I have written to the Minister to ask him to do so.  When we launch the public consultation on pension reform, it will be the time to sit down and determine exactly what is in the best interests of the people the Deputy and I represent so we can make the changes reflecting what they want and need.</p></speech>

In order to receive the telephone allowance one has to qualify for a social welfare payment and the fuel allowance, but it is not right that the opportunity to apply for the fuel allowance only arises twice a year.

Customers referred to JobPath who are also working part time will have all activities, including meetings with their personal adviser, scheduled around their work commitments.  The JobPath contractors are required to be flexible in the provision of the service in that respect.  For those customers who take up seasonal work when engaged with JobPath, the service will offer in-work support and customers will not be required to attend meetings with their personal adviser until the employment ends.  The customer effectively comes off JobPath for the period of their seasonal work and come back onto the scheme when they are finished.</p>  <p>  In the case of jobseekers already in part-time or seasonal employment, the focus will be on opportunities to increase the level of employment in their current role, or look at possibilities in other areas, including training, which may provide a more sustainable income and for a move away from jobseeker payments. </p>  <p>  On the number of clients who have gained employment, it will take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients who have completed their engagement period with the service for complete and robust outcome data to be available.

This issue has been raised a number of times, including in my office in recent days.  There is a constant flow of queries and many Deputies will have had the same experience.  If a person has a guarantee of a job or an opportunity to participate in a community employment scheme or avail of various other opportunities and is then pulled towards Turas Nua, he or she feels obliged to take that route.  People believe they are losing out on the opportunity to participate in community employment schemes or the opportunity to avail of an internship or participate in the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and that they are being excluded from what would be an opportunity to up-skill in being pulled into a one-size-that-does-not-fit-all scheme such as Turas Nua.  The scheme has been in place for a number of years and is due for review.  The original contract was for four years.  The provision of flexibility to allow people to take the other routes, without having to enter the Turas Nua scheme, as some feel pressured to do, is one of the issues that must be identified.</p></speech>

With respect, each of them provides a different level of training or work experience to make sure people are job-ready.  JobPath provides participants with a guaranteed service which includes not only one to one support and training but also a continual counselling and advice service to make sure they will be matched with the jobs available or that they will be retrained in order that they can make themselves available to fill the jobs available.  However, there is no competition across the range of employment schemes.  Each has been designed to specifically address a particular section of the market.</p>  <p>  There have been some complaints in recent months that people are finding it harder to fill CE schemes because people are on another activation measure, but no one has ever told me that there is a problem filling CE schemes because they are on T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme, RSS, a partial capacity payment or an invalidity payment.  There is no draw here from one section to another.  We offer services in this Department which suit the needs of particular people at particular times.  JobPath is doing its job particularly admirably, considering that it has a 16% rate.</p></speech>

My officials have recently completed a report on these issues which I am considering in detail.</p>  <p>  To qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, a person must be unemployed, be available for and genuinely seeking work, have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least four days out of seven every week.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme provides significant support for individuals who can work up to three days a week and receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  Seasonal work can be full time, part time or casual, depending on the type of work involved.  A seasonal worker who is employed on a full-time basis would not be entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while in that seasonal employment.  Contributions paid during this time can be used to re-qualify for jobseeker's benefit, subject to scheme conditionality. </p>  <p>  My Department operates a fast-tracking system for customers who sign-off on their jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim to take up work or a training course for a period of up to 12 weeks, which reflects the seasonal nature of the work in some instances.</p><p>In these cases, the claim is not closed but payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course.  When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored.  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to re-qualify.  The 13 contributions needed to re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can be paid in respect of full-time employment, seasonal employment, part-time employment or casual employment.  If a seasonal or a part-time worker meets this requirement, he or she may re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  If a person does not re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, he or she can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p> <p> It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of a jobseeker's payment apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.</p></reply>

That was 12 months ago.  It is very hard to explain this to those on seasonal or part-time work who make a very important contribution to farming, fishing and tourism, and something has to be done about it.</p>  <p>  The Minister met with a delegation of seasonal and part-time workers during the IFA briefings here in Dublin some months ago so she is familiar with the case.  These people play an essential part in the various sectors to which I referred.  I am aware of the need to build up contributions for 13 weeks after a claim but these things are not practical for those people and the whole purpose of the report is to allow the Minister to consider introducing new regulations that would be practical.</p>  <p>  The subsidiary income threshold of &euro;12.70 per day, or &euro;63 per week, is totally unfair and this must be dealt with.  I know the Minister is committed to looking at this but there can be no further procrastination.  Can she give us a definite date when she will have the report and will make recommendations?</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy all the recommendations because the report is incredibly complex.  I did meet the representatives of these workers, although I do not know if it was the Deputy or somebody else who organised it for me.  I understand the exact situation that pertains to the people in the Deputy's county but one cannot make changes to a scheme just to reflect a small number of people in a small part of the country without having far-reaching effects on everybody else.  I need to consider the report very carefully, which I will do this weekend, and I will come back to the Deputy with the recommendations I am planning to make to address the issue affecting the people he represents.</p>  <p>  I agree that the subsidiary payment is small and this might be one of the easier things to reflect on in the report.  I ask the Deputy to give me a little time to reflect on the report.  I will come back to it and we will resolve this issue.</p></speech>

We are different in Donegal but we are not that different and we have the same seasonal workers in various parts of the country such as Wexford, Waterford, etc.  We have waited 12 months so we can wait another few weeks for the Minister to reflect on the report, as long as she is prepared to introduce the realistic recommendations which are contained within the report.

The Family Law Acts are the civil legislation that requires a man or woman, who wants to claim maintenance from their spouse, to go to family mediation or seek redress through the courts.  There is a condition in the one-parent family payment in my Department that a parent must make all reasonable efforts to get maintenance from the other parent for the upbringing of their children, which is as it should be.  However, in the past week a very brave young woman went public with her story of how she fell between the cracks of what should have been a robust process but was a process which actually failed her.</p>  <p>  I met that lovely lady and her gorgeous little man on Friday and we spoke at length of her experience.  I heard of the language that was used towards her and the letters she received and I gave her my commitment that I would resolve the issue.  Since then, I have met with Women's Aid which is kindly going to take the letters away and redraft them so that, if they were accidentally received by someone in a vulnerable position, they would not make that person as fearful and full of dread as Kate - which is not her real name - was during the week.  They will return the new draft to me in the next couple of weeks.</p>  <p>  We also agreed that Women's Aid would draw up an accredited training programme for me and give it, in conjunction with our staff development unit, to anyone who is involved in front-line services in the Department so that they are equipped to deal with specific instances of domestic or sexual abuse when people present for that purpose.</p>  <p>  If a woman or a man arrives in a local office and tells us of an experience of domestic violence, we will believe them - end of story.  There will be no requirement for court orders or protection orders or other legal structures in such cases.  We will believe the person presenting and we will make changes to our internal IT systems so that their electronic record shows no letters for maintenance recovery will ever again be sent to them.</p></reply>

The SWA can be paid while a person is awaiting the decision on another payment, for example, disability allowance or jobseeker's allowance.  People who are unable to provide evidence of address can access the basic SWA during the period when they engage with homeless services and seek to stabilise their situation.</p><p> In Dublin, where the homelessness situation is probably at its most acute, there are arrangements in place that focus on maintaining individuals on their primary weekly social welfare payments for a period.  This gives them some flexibility while they are seeking to regularise their accommodation arrangements.  This approach means they maintain access to the other services that are made available by the Department, including activation programmes, CE schemes and the T&uacute;s initiative.</p> <p> People experiencing homelessness who have queries about their entitlement to weekly social welfare payments should contact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection through their local Intreo offices, where they will receive the same level of care and assistance that we hope to provide to everyone who presents at our local offices.</p></reply>

It would be remiss of us not to express our condolences on the deaths of two homeless people on the streets of the capital city over the past 24 hours.  I do not think anybody really wants to be homeless.  The provision of a payment is an essential tool in trying to help people to get off the streets.  We need to put money directly into people's pockets.  There is an element of discrimination here.  The Minister mentioned that specific provision has been made for homeless people in Dublin to access social welfare payments, but such provision is not being made in any other part of the State.  Homeless people in 25 counties cannot access minimum or basic social welfare payments.  I ask the Minister to explain the discrimination or discrepancy that seems to exist in this regard.</p></speech>

A specific protocol was established for Dublin because, unfortunately, the problem of homelessness is more prevalent here than in other parts of the country.  I reiterate that anyone in any part of the country who is experiencing homelessness can avail of weekly social welfare payments and supplementary welfare allowance payments through their local Intreo offices.  Payments are maintained for a number of weeks until people can regularise their position with some sort of relatively normal accommodation through the homeless agencies around the country.  Specific protocols have been established for Dublin because the Dublin divisions experience homelessness on a greater scale than other areas of the country.  We are focusing on maintaining individuals' primary social welfare payments, as well as other services, such as those relating to activation, that they receive, while they are engaging with homeless services in Dublin.  We want to ensure that they are in a position to regularise their accommodation.  Our overarching principle is to ensure that the services of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including weekly payments, are available to people in these circumstances.  Our primary ambition is to help people to get back into employment, thereby enabling them to afford to look after themselves.  It is not the case that people have to be in regular accommodation before they can get weekly payments.  We will do everything we can to assist people to get into regular accommodation and to regularise their housing arrangements.</p></speech>

In his instruction, he declared in very stark language:</p><blockquote>No other overtime is authorised and any operations intended on an overtime basis are hereby cancelled ... The Garda Budget for 2017 has been exhausted.  All other operations, events, searches, arrest etc for the remainder of 2017, will be performed by the working units.</blockquote><p>The Taoiseach might enlighten me on what the reference to &quot;working units&quot; means for policing capacity.  Other Garda communications have referred to decommissioning burglary response units and reducing mobile patrols.  The only people in the country who could possibly be pleased with this are criminals.  Why incentivise them at this juncture?</p><p>According to the Garda Representative Association, it is simply not possible to police the State without overtime.  The association has suggested that thefts and burglaries will increase over Christmas.  It is worried that the cancellation of Garda overtime could have major implications for local feuds in Blanchardstown and Finglas, for security operations involving cash-in-transit escorts and retail takings and for public order and roads policing.  Will we have enough garda&iacute; to police the severe traffic congestion that is expected over the next six weeks and the drink-driving campaign?  Why have drink-driving laws if we will not have garda&iacute; to enforce them over the crucial Christmas period?  We are getting reports that similar overtime bans are now being applied in Galway and Cork.</p><p>Can the Taoiseach explain how we have reached a point at which an assistant commissioner would issue a direction of this nature?  I understand that the Select Committee on Justice and Equality will meet tomorrow to consider a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;130 million.</p></speech>

Did the Garda inform the Department of Justice and Equality that it intended to make this announcement to all garda&iacute; across the country?  Surely proper planning would dictate that something like this should not occur at this time of the year.  I have a key question.  Is the assistant commissioner aware that a Supplementary Estimate is coming before a D&aacute;il committee tomorrow?  Has the assistant commissioner already factored in that figure when considering the operational budgets of the force?  Has the Garda, even with the knowledge of what it is going to get tomorrow, decided that an overtime ban will be needed in any event?  I would like an answer to that question.</p></speech>

I share the concerns about any ban on overtime in December.  As the Deputy mentioned, December is a very busy period.  Traffic is very heavy in the run-up to Christmas.  There can be a spike in burglaries during this period because it is so dark and because many people tend to be out of their homes.  Burglars also need money in the run-up to Christmas.  There is often a spike in burglaries at this time.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that there is funding for overtime in December.  I can say that for a number of reasons.  The Cabinet agreed yesterday morning that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda.  That covers overtime.  Tomorrow morning, the Select Committee on Justice and Equality will be asked to approve a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;50.489 million under the pay subhead of the Department of Justice and Equality.  That includes &euro;42 million for overtime, which will bring the total Garda overtime budget for 2017 to &euro;130 million.  I think people will appreciate that &euro;130 million is a very big budget for overtime.</p>  <p>  This is happening at a time when the number of garda&iacute; is increasing again.  For example, approximately 200 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest next month.  This will increase Garda numbers to approximately 13,500 by the end of the year when projected retirements are taken into account.  An additional 200 full-time garda&iacute; will be available to police the State next month, which is December.  In addition, the Supplementary Estimate will cover overtime.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that almost all pay, including overtime, is paid a month in arrears.  This is why I am also keen to understand yesterday's public announcement a bit better.  December overtime would never have been paid from the 2017 budget.  The Supplementary Estimate is for the 2017 period.  While December overtime is worked in December, it is paid in January.  This means that next month's overtime will come out of the 2018 budget.  I would have hoped or assumed that Garda management would have been aware of that.  Any overtime done in December comes out of the 2018 budget, which ,of course, is substantial.</p></speech>

He has said he would have assumed that Garda management knew about these arrangements.  This instruction was issued by an assistant commissioner on the basis that "the Garda Budget for 2017 has been exhausted".  I think we need a better explanation of how this has happened within our security and policing system.</p><p>There is an issue at the heart of the administration of security and justice in the country.  Something like this should not happen if sufficient funds are available.  This needs to be resolved and we need to get answers because people's fears can be heightened in situations like these.  The original question I asked the Taoiseach was whether an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had already factored the Supplementary Estimate, which will be provided tomorrow, into its budget and yet still finds itself short.  It says here that much of the additional Supplementary Estimate is required as a result of the Labour Court agreement.  Overtime is involved, but the cost associated with the implementation of the Labour Court agreement in respect of Garda pay is also a contributory factor as are the off-setting of additional requirements, departmental underspends and so on.  It is not yet clear to me that what will be provided in the Vote tomorrow will cover the entirety of what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs.  Otherwise I presume the assistant commissioner would not have given the instruction he gave to all stations and ranks across the Dublin metropolitan region.</p></speech>

The number of garda&iacute; is increasing.  We will have 200 more garda&iacute; next month.  Since 2014 we have seen the number of garda&iacute; continuously increase.  We will also have a recruitment campaign for the Garda Reserve next year.  We are seeing an increased number of garda&iacute;.  With more garda&iacute; joining the force and more garda&iacute; on the streets, one would expect that the need for overtime would fall.  Nonetheless, overtime will always be necessary for policing operations, although with increasing numbers of garda&iacute; one would expect the need for overtime to decrease.  To answer the Deputy's question, the Supplementary Estimate which will be voted through tomorrow with the agreement of the House provides additional funds for Garda overtime but, as I mentioned earlier, Garda overtime for December is paid out of the 2018 budget anyway, so no Supplementary Estimate is required for that.  The very substantial &euro;100 million Garda budget for 2018 covers it.</p></speech>

If one has a budget of &euro;100 million for overtime, one has to spread it out over a period of 12 months.  There is a responsibility to do that.  It is very easy to run out of funds for overtime in November if 9% of the budget is spent every month.  Some 99% will have been spent by the end of November and the funds will run out.  If 8.3% is spent every month, it will last the full 12 months.  Therefore, Garda management have a responsibility to manage the overtime budget in such a way that the money does not run out.  However, as I have said, there is a Supplementary Estimate going through tomorrow which will cover all of the overtime costs to the end of November.  Funding for December, which as the Deputy knows starts next week, comes out of the budget for 2018 anyway.  The 2018 budget for Garda overtime is &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900013#L00600"><p>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment that there will be funding for Garda overtime.  I am however very disappointed at the way he has handled the recent revelations about the dysfunction at the heart of our justice system.  His Government refused to take appropriate actions which would have avoided all of the recent difficulties, not least for Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family.  In many ways the Taoiseach repeated the mistakes which Deputy Enda Kenny made when he was Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will recall the fatal shooting of Garda Tony Golden, the serious wounding of Siobh&aacute;n Phillips and the death by suicide of Crevan Mackin in Omeath on 11 October 2015.  Crevan Mackin was arrested for possession of weapons and explosives and admitted to such possession.  He was released without being charged with theses offences, despite some detectives knowing that he had access to four other weapons.  It is believed he used one of these weapons to murder Garda Tony Golden and seriously wound Ms Phillips, whom he had also brutally beaten, before killing himself.  In October 2015 I gave a file on these matters to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, and the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I wrote to Deputy Kenny four times.  I spoke to him directly on a number of occasions.  I wrote to Deputy Fitzgerald eight times.  I also spoke to her.  I gave information to the senior Garda officer investigating the case and I wrote to GSOC.  When Deputy Varadkar took over as Taoiseach I sent the same file to him.  Like Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach gave me no substantive response until I raised the issue with him here.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has yet to reply to me.  When I asked him informally about this case he said there was something seriously wrong and he committed to meeting with me.  He has yet to do so.</p>  <p>  The answer I received from the previous Taoiseach, from Deputy Varadkar and from the Minister for Justice and Equality is that an investigation and review of these tragic events is ongoing.  There are no other suspects.  There are no other lines of inquiry.  The real issue is that Crevan Mackin was arrested for the possession of weapons and explosives and admitted to that.  He was released without being charged with these offences despite some detectives knowing he had access to four other weapons.  He used one of these weapons to murder Garda Tony Golden and injure Siobh&aacute;n Phillips.  It is not enough to say that processes are ongoing.  This is about accountability or in this case, once again, the lack of accountability.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality to speak to the acting Garda Commissioner as a matter of urgency.  If the Taoiseach has read this file he will know the questions he should ask of the acting Garda Commissioner.  I ask the Taoiseach to meet with the family of Siobh&aacute;n Phillips and to establish a public inquiry as the family has requested.</p></speech>

I appreciate fully that has never been the approach of Deputy Adams or his party.  In the Sinn F&eacute;in view of the world people do not deserve a fair hearing, people are executed without trial and punished without getting a fair hearing.  I will never operate on that basis.  I will always ensure that allegations are taken seriously and are also properly investigated before we rush to judgment.  I know that is the kind of approach which Maurice McCabe and his family would support and which should have always been followed in respect of the allegations which he made.  It was certainly the approach which I followed when he came to me a number of years ago with allegations in respect of penalty points and with evidence to back them up.  That is why on this occasion, before jumping to judgment, we should once again make sure that we know the facts and that allegations are taken seriously and are properly investigated.</p>  <p>  As it stands with this case, there is an investigation under way.  That investigation will not be carried out here in the D&aacute;il, nor should it be.  It should be carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which is the body set up and empowered by the Oireachtas to investigate complaints against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The GSOC investigation report is still awaited.  We should allow that investigation to happen, get the report and then consider the outcome.  That is the appropriate role for ourselves as politicians and for this House.  I am advised by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that he would be happy to meet Deputy Adams today to discuss the matter further.  It is very much my view, however, that we should allow GSOC to carry out its investigation.  When we have a report, we can then consider it.</p></speech>

We are told agreement has also largely been reached on citizenship issues.  It seems, therefore, that two of the three phase 1 issues are approaching resolution and that only the Irish question remains to be decided.  All we hear on that issue are generalities such as "seamless borders", "frictionless borders" and "technology solutions".  Such phrases have popped up again and again, but they have little real meaning.  During a ridiculous interview that he gave last night Iain Duncan Smith said there was a great deal of showboating.  It is clear that significant efforts are being made by some to downplay the Irish issue.  It is also clear that the Conservative Party in Britain, unsurprisingly, continues to have a very weak understanding of the Irish Border issue.</p>  <p>  All Members understand there is a trade aspect to the Border, but many have expressed concerns that if things are allowed to advance to phase 2 without meaningful and clear commitments on the Irish question, we will lose our leverage.  France, Germany and others have clearly prioritised the divorce bill and the rights of citizens.  Now that these issues are close to being resolved, Irish concerns might be brushed aside.  Technically, there is no veto during these talks as under law decisions will be made by qualified majority vote.  We also know that the EU27 have so far indicated that Ireland will be allowed to hold what amounts to a veto on these matters.  However, if that is the case, the Taoiseach must make a moral rather than a legal argument in order to hold the EU27 together and he will not be prepared to do so.  When faced with implacable opposition, however, he will need to stand firm and not blink.</p>  <p>  There is to be a Brexit stakeholder forum meeting tomorrow morning and there are valuable opportunities for perspectives to be shared.  At this juncture, there is a need for a collective political effort.  For months I have been asking the Taoiseach to brief Opposition leaders in detail in advance of European Council meetings and I reiterate that request today.  When approaching a meeting as crucial as this one, Deputies of all parties and none should come together to show the EU27 that we stand united together in the interests of the nation.  Will the Taoiseach reassure the House that he is willing to deploy what would, in effect, be a veto if meaningful progress to his satisfaction is not achieved on the Irish issue at the next European Council meeting?  Will he agree to meet the leaders of all parties to share his plans on a confidential basis and discuss how each of them might assist by directly lobbying our sister parties and organisations throughout Europe to support what is a vital Irish position?</p></speech>

I have set up a system under which a very senior official in my Department is available to brief party leaders on the current state of the negotiations.  Some party leaders have availed of it, although I am not sure if each of them has.  I have committed to meeting party leaders in that regard and will do so when we are at decision point, but we are not yet at that stage.  Things are evolving rapidly and changing on a daily basis.  We are in daily contact with the task force headed by Michel Barnier.  Much progress is being made on the financial settlement, but it has not yet been agreed to.  None of the three items on which sufficient agreement is required before we can move to phase 2 has reached the necessary point.  Progress is being made, but it is insufficient at this stage.  We are in regular contact with other Foreign Ministers and Prime Ministers and solidarity remains strong with Ireland on our specific issues, including avoiding a hard border.  I am very confident that the European Council will operate by consensus and that there will be no need to use or threaten to use a veto because we have and will continue to have the support of our European colleagues on the issue of the Border.</p></speech>

In advance of this most critical European Council meeting, I ask the Taoiseach to meet the leaders of parties represented in the House to discuss the strategy and see how we can play a part by talking to socialists and democrats within the European institutions in the case of the Labour Party and liberals in the case of Fianna F&aacute;il and so on in order that we will have a collective, joined-up and manifestly united effort on this vital issue for Ireland.

Two families came to my constituency office having been served with termination notices in respect of their homes in the private rental sector.  These families are facing the nightmare of eviction and potential homelessness.  One or two such families come to my office every week and it is likely that similar situations take place in the constituency offices of all Dublin Deputies.  During the same week Threshold released its annual report which showed a massive increase in the number of people who were contacting it because of a fear of losing their homes, most of whom were in the private rental sector.  A total of 71,000 calls were made to Threshold last year, more than double the number made in 2015.  A report issued shortly before stated 40,000 homes could be built on public land that had been zoned for housing.  Some 12,000 houses could be built on public land in Dublin alone.  Considering that the average cost of building a home, leaving aside land costs, is between &euro;180,000 and &euro;200,000, the cost of building 40,000 such homes would be in the region of &euro;7 billion to &euro;8 billion.  If that were to be done over a four to five year period, it would cost between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion per year.  If there was the political, the money would be found.  For example, in the past three budgets income tax revenue has been reduced by some &euro;3 billion.  These tax cuts are largely irrelevant to the living standards of those on low to moderate incomes.  That is not a once-off cost of &euro;3 billion but rather the amount of State revenue that would be forgone every year.  I have no doubt that people would forgo these minimal cuts in income tax in return for a serious attempt to solve the housing crisis.  Another potential source of funds is the &euro;1.3 billion that has been set aside for a rainy day.  If having over 3,000 homeless children in the State is not a rainy day, I do not know what is.  Perhaps the Government is saving it for a new developer or bank bailout.</p>  <p>  The Nevin Economic Research Institute produced a report last year which outlined the potential adoption of the European cost recovery model which could be a game changer in dealing with the housing crisis.  It would involve building homes to be rented at below market rates but at a sufficient amount to recover the initial investment in time.  The programme for Government states expert groups should be established to consider developing a viable cost rental model for Ireland.</p><p>The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the previous Minister and the Department are all considering this.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is time for them to get up off their backsides and implement a programme of public housing on public land?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900015#N00200"><p>I want to say how deeply saddened I am, as I think everyone is, to hear of the deaths in recent days of two people who were homeless.  On my behalf and on behalf of the entire House, I express my condolences to the families and friends of those affected.  We understand that one homeless man in his late 30s who had been sleeping rough at the Four Courts has passed away; <i>The Irish Times</i>reports he was a Lithuanian national and may have died as a result of a drug overdose.  The other death occurred in Ranelagh.  The cause of the latter death is unknown at this time, but we understand that he had been offered shelter.</p><p>Regarding the actions that are taking place, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has already announced a number of very important measures to ensure that more beds and more shelter are available over the next couple of weeks.  Twenty-six additional permanent beds will be provided tonight on Little Britain Street, 25 additional permanent beds in Cabra will be available on Thursday night, and an additional 67 temporary beds will come on stream this week.  Therefore, by 18 December we will have 200 more beds available, and by beds I mean single beds or double beds in rooms, not cots.  We want to be assured that there is, or at least will be, a bed and shelter available for everyone who needs them in the city not just for the winter period, but beyond into the spring and summer as well.  We are also stepping up our actions when it comes to the Housing First programme, whereby not only homes and apartments are provided for people who are homeless, but also wraparound services in order that they are able to stay in the homes or apartments they are given.  Since we introduced Housing First solutions, 180 people have already gone from rough sleeping into those solutions.  These people were sleeping rough and now have housing with support and have managed to stay in that housing.  The Minister will appoint a Housing First director quite soon in order to ensure we can move more people off the streets and into homes through that programme.</p><p>The Government's plan to build more housing is very much under way.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million was also approved at Cabinet on Tuesday morning for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This will enable the Department to meet the costs that have been run up by local authorities in building housing over the past year.  Deputies will be aware that 2,000 houses will have been built directly by local authorities by the end of this year, which is a major increase on only a few hundred a year or two ago.  We have a &euro;1.8 billion social housing budget for next year for housing, which will allow us to increase the number of social homes built to 3,800.  This is almost a doubling and does not include additional social housing acquired by renovating voids, purchasing them from developers, long-term leasing or Part V.  This will bring the total number closer to 7,000.  Therefore, the issue we will run into is not money at all but rather the capacity of the construction sector to build all these homes.  Housebuilding is now ramping up.  We can see this from the numbers and we are starting to see it around us, all around the country.  The constraining factor will not be money from the Government, but rather the availability of sites and construction workers and others to build the houses we desperately need.</p></speech>

That was the main content of my question.  He sort of half dealt with it.  Part of the approach of Rebuilding Ireland includes the proposal to have 125,000 people in HAP households.  By 2021, that will cost the State &euro;1 billion a year.  Providing these 120,000 social housing units through HAP will cost &euro;32.9 billion over 30 years.  That money would be much more deservedly put into public housing on public lands.  We know that Dublin City Council has public lands on which to build at least 12,000 houses.  It should get more land through other methods of acquiring land in Dublin.  The Taoiseach opened a housing development recently at which he mentioned that it contained affordable homes but he forgot to mention that these houses were selling for between &euro;320,000 and &euro;390,000, which is certainly not affordable.  We need affordable homes for workers in Tesco and Dunnes, on construction sites and in the general economy who earn under &euro;50,000.  This can be done through the plan put forward by Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute.</p></speech>

It allows them to live in private rented accommodation, often - almost always, in fact - in a private housing estate or private apartment block.  I know from my experience in my own constituency that many people living with a HAP tenancy or with rent supplement in a private housing estate or a private housing development, when offered social housing, decide not to take it because they would prefer to stay where they are as their children are in the local school, they have connections to the area and they want to stay in the housing they are in at that time.  Many people make this decision because it works for them to stay in private rented accommodation on occasion.  It also helps to bring about integrated communities.  We do not particularly want to go back to the era of huge social housing estates which generate or become a focus for social problems.  We want integrated developments as much as possible.  It is our intention to reduce our reliance on rent supplement initially and HAP as we build more social housing.  There will be a &euro;25 million funded affordability scheme for public lands, and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, will produce the information on this as soon as he possibly can with new income limits.</p></speech>

Amid everything that has happened in the past two weeks, there was a very serious breach and leak of foreign affairs documentation.  Our diplomats, as he knows, tour capitals across Europe and the rest of the world.  They interview people, including senior people in governments, politicians, civil servants, judges and stakeholders in society.  They do so to get some understanding of what drives policy in different capitals across Europe.  I am a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and those documents are invaluable in building up what one could call low-grade intelligence in terms of understanding what is going on in other capitals to inform policy and the Government's response.

Obviously, there is a lot of feedback on Brexit at present.  In this case that weekly briefing documentation, which is circulated quite widely within not only the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but also some other Departments in order to keep people informed of the state of play as we get feedback from our various different consulates and embassies was leaked to a journalist.</p><p>It should not have happened and we are engaged in an internal investigation within the Department to discover how it was.

The Government, which had until tomorrow to respond to the court's imposed deadline, announced plans several weeks ago to opt into an EU directive providing for and regulating asylum seekers' access to the workforce.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has since confirmed that the Government will opt into the reception conditions directive.  Will the Taoiseach confirm when that opt-in will come into force and how quickly the people affected by this issue will be able to access employment?  Will he further indicate when we will see the detail of the new system, including provisions relating to access to vocational training and health care and any restrictions to be imposed in terms of the types of jobs for which people can apply?

The Deputy is correct that the deadline is tomorrow.  My understanding is that the court will be satisfied with the course we are pursuing and will, I am sure, make a declaration to that effect in early course.  The date upon which the new regime is to be implemented is April next year, in accordance with our EU obligations.  I expect there will be an important role and function for the implementation group in overseeing this process.  Last week, I circulated to all Deputies a note of the decision of Government on this matter.

The House has repeatedly agreed motions seeking to make employment sustainable and ensure decent working conditions for employees.  There has been much debate in recent days about the consequences of an early election.  In the midst of all that discussion, I was struck by a report by Jack Power in <i>The Irish Times</i>which pointed to the significant numbers of people employed in the Oireachtas on if-and-when contracts.  That this is happening sends a poor message to employers.  Will the Taoiseach join with me in asking the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to ensure if-and-when contracts are no longer given to staff employed by it?</p></speech>

The Government has legislative plans to ban zero-hour contracts and ensure people have more security in respect of the hours they work.  Sometimes, however, if-and-when contracts may be necessary and can work for the employee, particularly where there is an on-call or agency arrangement.  As I said, the Government will introduce legislation to ban zero-hour contracts and ensure workers have greater certainty as to the hours they are working so that they can plan their lives and finances.  However, I will leave actual contractual matters for staff to the good offices of the commission.</p></speech>

Given those very strong statements, will he indicate the precise extent of this external review of matters related to the Department of Justice and Equality?  The issues are relevant not only to the whistleblower scandal but are also evident in the discovery that 2 million false breath tests were carried out by garda&iacute; and there were 15,000 wrongful convictions as a result.

The delegates saw the Minister for Health in the corridor but were not talking to him.  This is a life-changing drug for children with the rare condition, Morquio syndrome.  It is very sad to hear the stories of the families concerned.  The drug is manufactured in Cork, in the constituency of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and is available throughout Europe.  I do not know what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, finds so funny about it.  This is a very serious situation affecting a small number of families who are requesting a meeting with the Minister for Health.  One child from Monaghan has been prescribed the drug, which is paid for by the HSE but can only be purchased in the North.  It is not possible to get it in this State, even though it is manufactured here.  It is a bizarre situation.</p></speech>

The group includes two children who are being treated with Vimizim.  We all meet thousands of people in the course of our life, especially those of us here in the Oireachtas, but sometimes one meets a person who is unique and whose humanity shines through.  That is the case with the two children we met this morning.  The Minister for Health has agreed to meet the delegation for a few minutes, which I am delighted to hear, but I urge the Taoiseach, too, to meet the children before they leave.  It is always clear when we meet people who are special and different.  I ask that the Taoiseach listen for five minutes to what these two children have to say.  If he does so, I am absolutely confident he will ensure the drug is approved for all children with this illness.  It is totally wrong that they have been left in their current situation.</p></speech>

As Deputy McGrath noted, in one particular case a child has been prescribed the drug, paid for the HSE, but has to purchase it in the North.  Other children cannot avail of it.

Show them the respect of that and get the HSE officials to recognise the problem.</p></speech>

The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 very clearly means that the HSE is the decision-making body on this.  I know that this is a very important and sensitive matter.  It is very important for the families and I absolutely understand why they would be rightly worried, upset and concerned.  On 7 November last, the HSE made a decision not to add Vimizim to its reimbursement list.  In doing so, the HSE has made it very clear to the company that the company can come back to the table and produce new evidence and negotiate.  During my time as the Minister for Health, we have seen people come to the table to negotiate, even in extraordinarily difficult circumstances relating to trying to access new drugs, and we can often find a way forward.  I urge colleagues to not just call on the Government to act, but to also call on the drug company to sit down with the HSE and negotiate a way forward.</p>  <p>  I understand that a small number of children are on an access scheme for this drug.  It is extraordinarily important that the drug company acts in an ethical manner.  The Declaration of Helsinki is very clear that access schemes and reimbursement should not be linked.  There is absolutely no way this House should stand over the removal of children from an access scheme for that drug.  I would be delighted to have a word with the families today, and to keep in touch with Deputies on this.  I believe, however, that people need to get back to the negotiating table.</p></speech>

The EU Commission has stated that the difference with PESCO relates to the binding nature of the commitment undertaken by member states in the context of various forms of co-operation it covers.  The Secretary General of NATO has indicated that this measure would strengthen the EU pillar within NATO.  This will lead to a massive increase in defence spending and in the development of the defence industry.  It has huge implications for Ireland in the context of budgets and the nature of our Defence Forces.  When will we have a proper debate on this historic development, which needs to be decided upon by the House and not just the Cabinet?</p></speech>

There will be a full debate on it before a decision is made by this House.  The proposal for more structured co-operation on defence and security issues across the European Union has been in development for a number of years.  It does not, however, oblige Ireland to do anything.  The structure has, essentially, a voluntary opt-in that allows Ireland to choose the projects in respect of which we want partnerships with other countries.  Perhaps these could be in areas such as marine surveillance, peacekeeping, training or cyber security.  This is a practical response by the European Union to create more structure around co-operation when countries choose, on a voluntary basis, to work together in a more coherent way.  The Government will be recommending that Ireland supports the programme, but there will be an opportunity for all Members to have their say on the matter when we debate it in the House.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach also said that, with the economy improving, he hoped that more money would be available for national secondary and regional roads.  Last Monday, in the county in which I live, Roscommon, Transport Infrastructure Ireland informed the local authority of a 17% to 30% cut in the maintenance grant for national primary and national secondary roads.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to make an announcement now but I ask that he speak with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport today in order to get this cut reversed as quickly as possible.  The cut in question will have consequences for safety on and other issues relating to those roads.  I wonder if the same is happening in other counties.  It is a massive cut.  Earlier, we heard from my party leader about the cut in Garda overtime.  Obviously, the position in that regard will be rectified.  These cuts to the roads budget also need to be rectified or they will have consequences going forward.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to make an announcement today but it is important that he should deal with the matter.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware from the budget announcements that the overall transport budget has been increased for next year and for every year up to 2021.  I cannot understand why there would be a cut of that nature in roads maintenance.  I will have the matter checked out.</p></speech>

The report, which was published on 11 July 2014, included five serious issues, 18 recommendations and a timeframe of two years.  Had those recommendations been implemented, we would not be in the mess in which we find ourselves.  The review group actually offered "to meet twice yearly, if required by the Minister, over the next two years to review progress made in implementing these recommendations."  Will the Taoiseach let us know if any Minister took the review group up on that offer?  If so, how often did they meet and which, if any, of the 18 recommendations have been implemented?</p></speech>

The majority of the recommendations of the Toland report are now in an advanced state of implementation.  Many have been implemented.  Following the initiative on the part of the Taoiseach, which was announced yesterday, a further level of consideration will be given to bolster the recommendations of the Toland report with further proposals to ensure a smoother running of certain issues within the Department.</p>  <p>  I keep in very close contact with the members of my management team, with whom I have had the opportunity of engaging today.  I assure Deputy Connolly and the House that every effort will be made within the timeframe to ensure the full implementation of the Toland report recommendations.  However, having regard to the events of the past two weeks, we are looking at going beyond Toland.</p></speech>

I am concerned that farmers supply to the food chain through multinational supermarkets which, because we have lost so many grocers and small shops, are gaining a monopoly in the market.  The consumer will have to pay what these multinational supermarkets demand.  There is also a monopoly being imposed on farmers by the meat factories.  What is the Government going to do to protect farmers' incomes in the context of their dealings with the multinational supermarket companies and the meat factories?</p></speech>

We are almost a decade into the housing crisis.  The Taoiseach and the Government have been in government for the past seven years.  The landbanks have also been there for that length of time and longer.  There are more than 4,000 people and families on the housing waiting list in Louth, many of whom have been waiting for over nine years.  There are more people on the housing waiting list in Louth than the entire council owned housing stock in the county.  This shows the significance of the housing crisis in County Louth.</p><p>However, the Government is still refusing to build social housing on these landbanks.  Approximately 20 minutes ago the Taoiseach said money was no object in the roll-out of house building but that sites were a problem.  Not for the first time, I am telling the Government that there are 53 acres of local authority owned land in County Louth.  As we have the sites and money is no object, when will the Government roll out a social housing building programme in County Louth on council owned landbanks which sit idle and barren in the midst of a crisis?</p></speech>

This is a matter included in the programme for Government.  Executives in rural development authorities have been told by officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that shovels are not likely to be in the ground in the first three months of 2018.  In fact, they think it will be the summer or the autumn before work commences.  They are now saying 540,000 rural houses and businesses will not receive broadband next year.  That is what is being reported in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>and I thank the newspaper for setting it out.  It is important factual information which we did not have until now.  I ask the Taoiseach to make a statement, taking into consideration that the national broadband plan is included in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there are only two bidders left.  Inevitably, these things take time.  There has to be a tender process and a contract and a further short period during which the unsuccessful bidder can challenge the process.  At that point, the contractor has to mobilise and get the work done.  After many years of delay, I am extremely confident that we will have the contract signed and that the work will get under way in 2018.  The 500,000 homes and premises to which the Deputy referred will be connected in the next couple of years.  I share the frustration of the House at the delays in getting to this point but 2018 will be the year it will happen.</p></speech>

On page 81 of the programme for Government it is stated the Government is committed, with Tusla, to providing targeted intervention services for children.  The Waterford unit of the ISPCC is being closed on Friday, 1 December.  It is manned by 35 volunteers and two full-time staff who take 30,000 calls a year and support 20 families annually with a unique mentoring service.  Tusla provides &euro;9,000 but the cost of running the unit is &euro;100,000.  I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach for a four-week stay on the decision to allow a solution to be found by 31 December.</p></speech>

Most recently, we have worked with it on the cases of children who have been made homeless.  It is regrettable that it has decided that it has to close the office in Waterford and the two services it provides there.  I understand from our recent conversations with it that any child from Waterford and the south east will continue to have full access to Childline.  My understanding of how the service works is that when a child calls, he or she may be connected to a person who could be in any part of the country.  I understand the mentoring service that is run from the office is mostly provided by volunteers for the ISPCC.  They are finishing their work with some children and families.  In cases where they have not finished it, they are working with local services to hand them over.  That is my understanding of how, in the context of the decision to close, the ISPCC is ensuring the children in need will receive what they require.  I will continue to work closely with the ISPCC to see if it is possible to find further funding in the new year.</p></speech>

In essence, it has become harder for second-time buyers to move on.  We are all well aware of the chronic difficulties in the housing market.  Apparently, the change is based on a presumption that second-time buyers are more settled and secure than first-time buyers.  While that might be the position in a normally functioning market, many people coming out of negative equity and a recession are not in that position.  This issue has a knock-on effect on supply because first-time buyers who face a lack of new builds will not be able to buy a home in the second-hand market which has been throttled.  That, of course, in turn, has a knock-on effect on the rental market as there is no supply at that stage.  The whole pyramid is throttled.  I am aware that there is a limit to the extent to which the Government can instruct the Central Bank, but there are fora such as the Central Bank Commission in which policy matters can be discussed.  I am sure it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Government to tackle this issue in other ways also.  This is a real issue for many buyers and it affects the market as a whole.  I hope the Government can address it.</p></speech>

The only legislative relationship in this area requires that we be informed of what the Central Bank is doing, but it makes its decision and announces it.  As the Deputy said, there are other measures at which we are looking to increase the supply of homes.  There are also measures in the Finance Bill which I hope will be passed in the Seanad soon.  I hope those measures will address some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The division supports the work of Cabinet committee B and the associated senior officials group.  This covers social policy and public service reform and seeks to ensure a co-ordinated approach to policy areas such as education, children, equality and reform of public services.  It also supports the work of Cabinet committee E and the associated senior officials group.  They deal with issues relating to health, including improvements in health service delivery and the development of the Government's response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The division also provides the secretariat for the Civil Service Management Board which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and oversees implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan and incorporates the programme for Government office which publishes regular progress reports on implementation of the programme for Government.  The division is also responsible for liaison with the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which falls within the remit of my Department and supports the north-east inner city initiative, including the programme implementation board and the oversight group.</p><p>The division also provides me with briefings and speech material on social policy and public service reform issues and participates in relevant interdepartmental committees with other groups.  Given the nature of its role the division works closely with the line Departments which have day to day responsibility for specific policy areas.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach has already acknowledged that a homeless citizen died yesterday and there are reports that another homeless citizen died today.  The Taoiseach has extended his condolences to the family involved.  I also extend my condolences.</p>  <p>  The Peter McVerry Trust has said that seven homeless people have died in the past 12 weeks.  That is totally unacceptable.  This situation of course demands our condolences but it demands much more than that.  We are told that 184 citizens are lying in the cold and it is bitterly cold now.  It is reported that 50 adults were in the Merchant's Quay night caf&eacute; because they were unable to get an emergency bed.  I know the Taoiseach dealt with this earlier but I would like him to outline again the emergency measures the Government has planned to help citizens sleeping on the streets, in shop doorways or in tents and to deal with the trauma for 3,000 children and their parents who will celebrate Christmas living in totally inappropriate accommodation.  There are rumours, although I cannot support them, that some of those in hotels and boarding houses may lose their places because some of those establishments are looking for other customers.  Will the Government revisit the Focus Ireland amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 to limit landlords issuing vacant possession notices to quit?</p></speech>

There is the shocking fact that 3,000 children are in emergency accommodation.  Peter McVerry is asking for very specific things to respond to this.  Will the Taoiseach agree to what he is asking for?  He wants a formal assessment of the number of people sleeping rough carried out by local authorities; local authorities to provide a dedicated phone number for members of the public who can identify people sleeping rough in their areas so that help can be given to them; each local authority to have a dedicated rough sleeper response team with transport to cover out-of-hours periods; a commitment that rough sleeping would be ended completely by 2018 which he points out that requires between 250 and 300 people to be housed through the Housing First programme; and that each local authority draw up a Housing First plan to house rapidly and offer intensive case management to recently housed former rough sleepers.  Will the Taoiseach agree to that?</p>  <p>  I want the Taoiseach to reconsider the comments he made earlier about the problems of big social housing estates.  This is the excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need on the public housing land that we have.  Problems generated in social housing estates are not because of anything intrinsic to social housing estates.  They are to do with the lack of infrastructure put into estates built in the past.  We need large scale provision of council housing with the infrastructure and services but that cannot be an excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need to address this crisis.</p></speech>

I understand the position of assistant secretary, the most senior in the division, is now vacant.  When will it be filled?</p>  <p>  I join others who have spoken about the announcement that two citizens of our country, rough sleepers, have been found dead on the streets in recent days.  On my behalf and on behalf of the party, I send condolences to the friends and families involved.  There are 8,000 homeless people, 3,000 of whom are children.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has said that these statistics will worsen and that speaks volumes of itself.</p>  <p>  Rough sleepers should be an isolated policy focus for the Government.  This is a very complex issue and the solution is not simply housing.  That is why the wraparound supports of the Housing First model have been recommended.  This is the most urgent focus we need.  What will the Government do to ensure that the needs of the 180 plus people who are rough sleepers will be addressed? </p></speech>

I genuinely believe there is a danger in how this grows and evolves.  If a hospital is a self-contained entity in its work it is difficult to comprehend why its communications agenda is located within the Department of the Taoiseach.  All the good news relating to it therefore is for the Taoiseach.  The blurring of party politics with the Civil Service is a governance issue that the Taoiseach does not understand.  We need to be very careful about it.  I do not see why it is necessary to have a separate campaign on the children's hospital while there is a bespoke model and framework there already.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900019#R01200"><p>The range of questions was diverse but I will do my best to answer as many as I can.  Deputy Adams is of course correct in saying that approximately seven homeless people have died in recent weeks.  Roughly speaking, between 40 and 50 homeless people die every year.  Each one is a tragedy and very sad.  People who are homeless die for all sorts of different reasons, whether physical health, overdose, addiction, mental health issues, suicide or violence on some occasions.  That speaks to the fact that this is such a complex social issue and is not just a simple matter of providing shelter or housing.  A range of supports is required, particularly in the health area, relating to mental health and addiction, and overdose in particular.  That is a difficult problem that we face as a country.  It is one faced all over the world.</p>  <p>  Additional beds are being provided to ensure that we have a surplus number of beds available in the city and around the country.</p><p>Approximately 60 will come onstream today, with another 60 before the end of the week, on Little Britain Street and in Cabra.  The intention is to have another 200 beds in single or double rooms.  They are not Florence Nightingale institutional type accommodation.  We will have 200 in place by 18 December and the intention is to ensure there is a bed and shelter available for everyone who wants it and needs it.  This is something we want to ensure is in place not just for the winter period, but also through to spring and summer.</p> <p> We have also had the development of the family hubs, of which people are aware, providing much more appropriate family-type accommodation, where people can make their own food and have access to recreational areas.  As a result of the development of family hubs, the number of families with children who are being accommodated in bed and breakfasts and hotels has fallen since it peaked last spring.  We hope to see more progress on this front in the coming months.</p> <p> Housing First was specifically mentioned, and I mentioned it earlier myself.  It is a programme to take people who are rough sleeping and provide them with housing, but not just housing.  They need to be able to hang onto the housing so we need to put in place a range of social, health and other supports so they can stay in the house or apartment they are given and do not end up rough sleeping again.  A total of 180 people have already been moved out of homelessness and rough sleeping into a Housing First model.  At the request of the various charities and agencies that work in the sector, a national director for Housing First will be appointed.  That appointment will be made in the next two weeks.  I hope it will make a difference in the months and years ahead.</p> <p> On public housing, as I mentioned earlier, 2,000 houses, or homes, will have been directly built by local authorities this year.  This needs to be ramped up over time.  It was only a couple of hundred a few years ago and we are up to 2,000 this year.  It will be 3,800 next year, in addition to the voids being brought into use and long-term leases such as the Iveagh Trust one I was at a couple of days ago.  I know people do not count them, but I think they should be counted and certainly the people living in them are counted.  There are also direct purchases from developers through Part V and other mechanisms.  These will bring the number of new social homes available to be occupied to more than 7,000 next year for people and their families.  We will see a real ramping up in the provision of public housing in the coming years.</p> <p> In terms of general supply, commencement notices are up significantly, as are planning permissions.  We are seeing about a 50% increase in all of these, so we are starting to see the development of new homes and houses in Dublin and throughout the country, but it is coming from a very low base and we acknowledge as a Government that it will take time for us to get to the point where the number of new homes is meeting the demand for new homes and then to get ahead of it.  This is not something we will be able to do quickly, and no Government would be able to do it quickly.</p> <p> I was struck by the honesty of the Sinn F&eacute;in housing spokesperson at the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Fheis recently, where he enunciated the Sinn F&eacute;in policy on social housing, which is to build approximately 10,000 a year until the housing list is cleared.  That would still leave people waiting nine or ten years on the housing list before they would get their house.  It would require two terms of Sinn F&eacute;in in office for people joining the housing list today to get social housing.  I thought that was very honest.  It is the reality of what it will take to get on top of these issues, because we cannot just ramp up social housing or private housing overnight.  There are capacity constraints of all sorts, but we are going to ramp it up as quickly as we possibly can, and that is with regard to social housing as well as private housing.</p></speech>

This was organised jointly by Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan L&ouml;fven, and European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <p>  The social summit gathered EU leaders, social partners and other stakeholders for an open discussion on how to promote fair jobs and growth.  The focus was on learning from each other's national experiences, particularly in making the most of new opportunities, and tackling common challenges for the labour markets and welfare models of today and tomorrow. </p>  <p>  During the summit, the inter-institutional proclamation on the European pillar of social rights was signed by the Presidents of the Council, Parliament and Commission.  This represents important reinforcement of political commitment by the member states and the EU institutions to supporting key social policy objectives at both national and EU levels. </p>  <p>  The social summit was followed by a working lunch for leaders, chaired by the European Council President, Donald Tusk.  This was the first in a series of discussions under his leaders' agenda, as endorsed by the European Council in October, and it focused on education and culture.  While the EU has limited competence in these areas, we had constructive exchanges on how we could do more, including on initiatives such as a stronger Erasmus programme.  I expect that the outcome of both the social summit and our leaders' agenda discussion will be reflected in the conclusions we adopt at the forthcoming December European Council.</p>  <p>  I also had a meeting with the Prime Minister May in Gothenburg and reported to the House on 22 November all about this meeting.  I did not have any formal meetings with other Heads of State and Government while in Gothenburg.  However, I did take the opportunity, as is customary at these events, to speak with many of them on many issues in the margins of the summit and during the meals.</p>  <p>  I have not yet had the opportunity for a formal meeting with Polish Prime Minister Szydlo.  However, I did speak to her in Gothenburg, in June and October at the European Councils, and at September&rsquo;s digital summit in Tallinn.  We sat beside each other for one of the meals.</p>  <p>  Ongoing political engagement with our EU and international partners remains crucial, especially as negotiations on Brexit proceed, and I will continue to take advantage of every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests with my fellow members of the European Council.</p></reply>

I want to ask the Taoiseach about two issues.  When I was Minister for Social Protection, there was a lot of work done at an incredibly slow pace on a European social pillar, in other words, and this is what Gothenburg was partly about, a strong social security system in each country.  It would be a Europe of strong social security systems in each country that would help people and provide a cushion of safety.</p>  <p>  Most importantly, we will not get people out of poverty and into a reasonably comfortable standard of living unless we address wages.  Does the Taoiseach agree with some of the thinking about Gothenburg, that we need to maintain wage levels in the European Union as an absolute primary, and to maintain wage levels?  This is something I know Fine Gael does not like, but we must return to social partnership and have national agreements that actually help those people at the bottom of the wage scale, including people who are bogusly self-employed.</p></speech>

It has no justiciable basis, of course, but it is intended as a means of setting broad objectives for national and European Union activity.</p><p>It is a very worthy document but it is not clear what importance is attached to it.  It is a pity the Government did not publish a national position on that document beforehand, which we could have debated in the House.  There is a failure when we develop inflated rhetoric about social policy which is not followed up by action because of basic issues such as the European Union budget and widely differing social support systems.  I recall plenty of rhetoric around social guarantees and the Youth Guarantee but it was just rhetoric, with little funding to support it.  Can the Taoiseach detail what specific actions he is undertaking following the signing of the European Pillar of Social Rights?</p> <p> The document mentions individual access to housing and the Taoiseach will note that, despite the attempt to relativise homelessness figures at the Fine Gael conference, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has admitted the problem will get worse.  I have heard that phrase previously.  When the Taoiseach was appointed Minister for Health one of his first pronouncements was that the situation would get worse and, by God, it did get worse.  I got very worried, therefore, when the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government said at the Fine Gael conference that the situation would get worse.  How worse will it get before it will improve?  Has the Taoiseach any idea of what his Minister was commenting on?</p></speech>

The media today are reporting that the British have agreed to pay between &euro;45 billion and &euro;55 billion in its settlement of the divorce bill.  That will obviously increase demands by the British that the European Union meeting two weeks hence will accept this as substantial progress and move to negotiations on a new trade deal.  That means there will be a focus on what progress has been made on two outstanding issues of the current negotiations, the Border and the status of EU citizens in the North.  So far, there has been no detailed plan from the British for how they intend to resolve these matters.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, have been insisting, quite rightly, that no progress can be made to advance to the trade talks without real guarantees and commitments from the British on the Border.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that it is better to resolve all these issues diplomatically, but we are now coming to a critical point in the negotiations.  The Taoiseach has a veto.  Is he prepared to use it?  I appeal to him to be resolved to do so.  The right of citizens in the North to EU citizenship is a fundamental part of this.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure there is progress on both of these issues and that this be the Government's red line in the forthcoming negotiations.</p></speech>

He will probably agree that much of that is predicated on the loss of faith in the European project as a social project that impacts positively on the people of Europe and not simply an international trade agreement, as it is sometimes characterised particularly by some commentators in the United Kingdom.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that signing the European Pillar of Social Rights is a fundamental and important readjustment?  On a number of occasions I raised the fact that in the negotiations preceding this agreement Ireland sought to water it down.  That was not an auspicious or desirable stand for the country to take.  However, now that it has been signed it is important, and Deputy Martin made this point, to have an Irish implementation plan.  Is it the Taoiseach's view that we must reconnect with people to ensure that the vision of Europe is a social Europe that incorporates rights for working people and standards of decency?  Will we have an implementation plan on issues such as zero-hour and if-and-when contracts and other important matters such as housing and so forth?  Will the Taoiseach undertake to produce such a national implementation plan?</p></speech>

A little known fact, but one noted by Mercy Law Resource Centre among others, is that, incredibly, Ireland opted out of the right to housing provisions of the European Social Charter, even though it was used to sell the Lisbon treaty to us.  I presume it was Fianna F&aacute;il that made this decision, which shows its commitment to social housing even then.  Should we not opt into the provision on the right to housing in the European Social Charter?</p>  <p>  Second, to what extent does the Taoiseach think that EU state aid and competition rules are causing us a problem in delivering the social and public housing we need?  Certainly in my local authority area, and I presume this happens everywhere else, the tendering processes that require us most of the time to outsource work on public housing are one of the major areas of bureaucracy and delay preventing us from delivering the public housing that is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-29a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112900021#T00500"><p>There was a wide range of questions, a number of which are tangential to the questions that were tabled.  However, as always, I will try my best to answer as many questions as possible.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to represent the Government at Gothenburg for the social summit.  As I mentioned in my video piece at the end of the summit with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy McEntee, it was an opportunity for us to reignite the engine of social Europe.  There is a sense across Europe, not just among politicians but particularly among citizens, that in the last decade Europe has focused so much on banking, deficits, fiscal matters, finance and trade it has been to the detriment of everything else.  Europe has never just been an economic community or a free trade area.  It has always been about more than that.  Many of the labour and social rights we have in Ireland flow from European law, whether it is equal pay for equal work or the fact that child benefit was moved from being paid to the father to being paid to the mother.  It all happened as a consequence of progressive European legislation.</p>  <p>  The vision set out in the paper is very much one that was shared by the Christian democrats and social democrats who established the European project in the first place.  That vision was of a social market economy, the belief that market economies are the best ways to produce wealth and employment for people while also recognising the role of government in ensuring social progress by using the market economy and harnessing its wealth and job producing effects to bring about social good.  The original speeches of the famous men and women who founded the European Economic Community spoke a great deal about the social market economy.  It is a political philosophy that my party very much supports.</p>  <p>  We are very supportive of the declaration.  While we had some reservations along the way we were happy to sign it.  Of course, it is not legally binding but it will guide future European regulations and directives in areas such as labour rights, social protection and pension rights.  One of the points I made was that it had to work in terms of portability.  The world of work is changing all the time.  Most people entering the workforce now will probably have a number of different employers, will be self-employed for periods of their life and employees for other periods and they will probably travel a great deal.  They will work in more than one country.  However, our social welfare systems are not set up to reflect that properly.  This gives us an opportunity to develop more European law in these areas.</p>  <p>  It is interesting and fascinating, however, to see the different approaches that countries adopt to it.</p><p>A number of people in this House would see the Nordic countries and their flexicurity model as being one of the better and more developed labour markets and social market economies, but the Nordic countries are among the most sceptical when it comes to further EU harmonisation in this area because they feel harmonisation and making things the same across Europe could harmonise things downwards.  They are among the countries that are most sceptical about the European Pillar of Social Rights for that reason.  It is fascinating to see the different perspectives people have.  </p> <p> We discussed the possibility of a European minimum wage.  I spoke very much in favour of a European minimum wage but, of course, that would be on the basis that there would then be a national top up to take account of the different costs of living in different European countries.</p> <p> In terms of social partnership, I am very pleased that the Government was able to negotiate a very good public sector pay deal with the public sector unions.  Legislation for that is now going through the House and will bring about pay restoration and pay increases in some cases throughout next year and through to 2020.  When it comes to social partnership with the private sector, both IBEC and ICTU take the view that they do not want to go down that road and that the existing bargaining mechanisms are working for them and their members, but it is not something we would rule out in the future if we needed to achieve price stability among other things.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this summit and I have passed on my regrets.  The Government will be represented by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  While I had no discussions about the summit with those organising it, I have made clear my view that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the Paris agreement.</p></reply>

Emissions in every sector grew with no sign of anything stopping this incredible increase in pollution for which we are responsible and that is doing real damage to our country.  In the Taoiseach's discussion with President Macron on 24 October last, did President Macron mention the fact that he may be setting a different example?  President Macron has agreed to phase out coal power by 2022.  Would we not do something similar to try to restore our reputation?  President Macron is committed to doubling wind and solar power.  Would we not look to do something similar?</p>  <p>  President Macron's government has set a timeline for phasing out the fossil fuel-based car fleet and has committed to do no more exploration in the Atlantic waters, which are just the same or very similar to our waters.  It is reported that the Taoiseach is a keen admirer of President Macron.  Would the Taoiseach not think of replicating some of those measures that would start to restore our reputation because if we keep on the way we are going, this will increasingly be a black spot on this country and we will miss out on the economic opportunities that exist from those countries that are showing a lead?  When the Taoiseach talks with President Macron, does President Macron mention climate change?  Do the Taoiseach and President Macron ever talk about some of the initiatives President Macron is delivering which we could imitate and restore our reputation?</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach perhaps travels this evening or today, for example, if he travels along the Navan Road and through Castleknock, he will see lots of houses with solar panels on the roof and vast numbers of skips outside doors and gardens where people are re-insulating their houses.  When the Taoiseach goes to Paris, rather than going as the poor relation looking for a handout of some kind, could he go with a message that the Government will actually play catch up with people and businesses in Ireland?  He should look to Intel's recent announcement.  We have yet to have an electric train that travels from Dublin to Cork or indeed from Dublin to Belfast.  The Taoiseach has been in office for a significant period and we have heard nothing about his vision of where he hopes to make the country better.  He should not be looking for handouts and concessions when he goes to Paris.  Will he go with a plan that will make people in Ireland proud that while it is difficult and expensive to deal with climate change and we must find resources, we will start with electric trains and electrifying the bus fleet in Dublin instead of having filthy diesel buses driven by fabulous staff in Dublin Bus?</p></speech>

It may have escaped national focus because of political controversy in recent days but because of that, this nation is facing fines of at least &euro;455 million, which is an enormous sum, by 2020 and maybe up to &euro;600 million.  The year 2020 is not that far away and &euro;600 million would gobble up a fair chunk of any available fiscal space we might have and should be devoting to other more productive uses building the capacity of this State.  We are already well behind the curve.  What specifically are we going to do?  Are we just going to sail into a situation where we are going to buy carbon credits and face fines rather than take a really proactive line now to bring the actual greenhouse gas emissions we create in this country into line with the commitments we made openly and voluntarily to the international community?</p></speech>

Indeed I would trace this back to when the current Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I think Fine Gael took the position that dealing with climate change was electorally damaging, particularly in rural Ireland, and essentially jettisoned any real commitment to it.  This has been manifest since then.  One can see it with the recent Heritage Bill, which concerned ditches and hedges.  Where did that spring from?  Who were the influencers that said we needed legislation on that, which was quite significant in its destruction of biodiversity?  I spoke to many farmers who really did not have an agenda to do this.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows we amended that Bill in the Seanad.  I am just making the point that in terms of the introduction of that Bill, nobody knows where it came from unless there were hidden influences influencing it.  The point I am trying to make is that there is an absence of vision regarding the agenda across the board in terms of renewable energy support schemes, renewable heating incentives, not meeting targets and so forth.  The broader question is that hundreds of millions of euro will be lost in the coming years through fines and, as Deputy Howlin noted, the buying of carbon credits when that money could be used far more effectively in transport initiatives in particular.  We will have an issue with agriculture and food if we are not careful.  I believe in food security and I believe we need food production, but the transport sector is getting out of control again in terms of emissions and radical action is required in this sector to change the paradigm around our climate change policy.</p></speech>

As others have said, the EPA revealed that, last year, our greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.5%.  We are one of only four states in the EU that are still producing emissions above the 1990 levels and will also be one of the very few to miss the 20% reduction target.  It has been established by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that fines could be between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government is failing to take the necessary action to avoid this?  Will he respond to the 13 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change?  Will the Government incorporate them into Government policy?  Will the Taoiseach update the D&aacute;il on the national adoption framework which is to set out the strategy to be employed to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change?  Will these proposals be available by 10 December, as promised?</p></speech>

Is the Taoiseach willing to take the radical action necessary and end the special pleading for our pathetic performance?  Both Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and Deputy Eamon Ryan this week and last week submitted Bills proposing a decision to grant no more licences for the exploration of oil and gas.  If we were to do that, we would contribute significantly as a country.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith reports from the Bonn summit that delegates were very excited about the prospect that if it happened in Ireland, like the fracking ban, it could have a huge impact internationally.  If we were to make that decision, we could go from being the worst to being a leader.</p>  <p>  I have been banging on in the D&aacute;il for the past six years about forests and trees.  Our performance in afforestation is shockingly bad.  It is one of the worst in Europe.  We are missing all our targets.  Our level of forest cover is pathetically low.  The Larry Goodmans of this world and the big ranchers are to blame because they want the land for their businesses, but we need to increase the level of our forest cover.  There are ways to do this that farmers would get behind if we were to support them and explain how increasing the level of forest cover on their land would benefit them financially and the environment without infringing on other things.  We need to do something about Coillte's failure to plant trees.</p></speech>

I will have to prioritise the summit in Brussels on 14 and 15 December over going to Paris on 12 December.  It would not be possible for me to attend the House to speak to Members about that crucial summit if I was to be in Paris for the two days before the summit.  I will not be in Paris looking for handouts.  I am happy to assure the House that that will not be the case as I will not be there.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Eamon Ryan's questions about President Macron, to the best of my recollection, he did not specifically mention any of those things.  We touched on climate change and also discussed the Mercosur.  Ireland and France are very much aligned in their wish to protect their respective beef industries which are more carbon efficient than beef production in South America.  One thing we need to make sure we will do not do in trying to tackle climate change is displace production to other countries that are less carbon efficient than us.  </p>  <p>  We are examining the future role of the Moneypoint plant, our major coal-burning power plant, and also of the peat-fired stations as the PSO will run out in a number of years.  As it is unlikely to be renewed, we will have to consider whether these stations can continue or whether they should be replaced to burn alternative fuels such as biomass.   </p>  <p>  The ten-year capital programme, on which we are working, will have a very strong climate change focus.  It will not be enough to satisfy the Government's critics who include everyone present in the Chamber, apart from the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and I, but it will be a big step forward in terms of our response to climate change.</p></speech>

It is not as simple as going electric in one year or moving to natural gas or fuel cells or other fuels.  We actually have to build the fuelling plants in lots of places, which raises the question of whether depots should still be where they are.  It will include actions to modernise the bus fleet and move away from existing fuels.  On rail electrification, it would not be practical to electrify all of the railways; it would be practical to electrify some of them.</p>  <p>  There will be investment in cycle ways and greenways, in addition to what is happening.  The plan will also include the capital plans for EirGrid and the ESB and their plans to bring more renewables into the system to also make the grid smart.  </p>  <p>  There will be provision for further investment in forestry, above what is planned.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has announced the renewable heat initiative which will come into effect next year.

It is my view that we should increase them in the years ahead, both to discourage the production of CO2, one of the greenhouse gases that causes climate change, and also potentially as a means to raise funds to pay some of the fines.  We could pay some of them by taxing the bad behaviour and bad activities that will cause the fines to arise.  That is something that will have to be discussed in the context of the confidence and supply arrangement because we would not be able to do it without the facilitation of the main Opposition party.</p></speech>
