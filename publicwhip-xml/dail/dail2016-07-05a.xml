Some 63% of people in Northern Ireland voted and a majority of them opted to remain within the European Union.  The prospect of Northern Ireland being taken out of the European Union without the consent of the people there is now a very live one.</p>  <p>  In that context, the Taoiseach floated the idea of an all-Ireland forum on Brexit.  His Ministers, including the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, spoke fulsomely about it on "The Week in Politics" programme on Sunday.  I am surprised, however, because many people would have thought that if Ministers are speaking so liberally about it, work would have gone on behind the scenes to prepare the ground for such an eventuality.  It was therefore with great surprise that one heard Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, say that she had not been approached in advance.  She said: "It wasn't discussed with me over the weekend or indeed before, and it wasn't discussed at the NSMC [North South Ministerial Council] today."  In essence, that conveyed a perception of something of a shambles, of an incoherent all-island response to Brexit which constitutes such a severe threat to trade and to the economic well-being of the people of this island.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain why no attempt was made to speak to Arlene Foster and others prior to the North-South Ministerial Council and prior to the idea of a forum being floated by him and his Ministers without any advance warning, notice or engagement, if indeed that was the case, with the First Minister and others?</p><p>We know that in not doing that he would be ensuring the idea never gets off the ground.  The fate of Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland is central to the negotiations that have to take place over the coming months place between London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels.  The impact of this on the island of Ireland as a single market and as a economic area will be immense if it is not handled carefully, professionally and properly.  It calls for a specialised and more focused approach.  </p> <p>Will the Taoiseach indicate, first, if he had any engagement with the First Minister prior to the idea of an all-island forum on Brexit being floated and, second, what he proposes to do in relation to this particular idea of forum or to ensure a proper response to Brexit in the context of Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland?</p></speech>

I also spoke to the Deputy First Minister, the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament and to the British Prime Minister, who had engagements at the European Council with many Leaders.  This is unprecedented in the sense of a decision like this not having been made before.  People said that it was inconceivable that Britain would leave the European Union; now they know.  People said many other things about politics that might not happen.  In that sense, one can never dictate the outcome of referenda.  What we did agree at the North-South Ministerial Council yesterday was a ten-point plan to follow through on the engagements that are going on.  I had no intention of setting up a statutory authority that would run for a period of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500004#B00300"><p>Sorry?</p></speech>

Ministers currently meet on a regular basis through the North-South Ministerial Council.  We also have other North-South bodies and State agencies, including the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and so on.  From that point of view, I was struck by the impact of the economic discussion we had down here in preparation for budgets 2016 and 2017, whereby all of the main players were brought together in one location to offer their views on how, in that case, the budgets should be framed, the issues for prioritisation and so on.  That is what was in my mind but I said publicly it could not work if all the parties did not buy in to it.  There was no discussion with First Minister Foster or any other leader in Northern Ireland and there was no discussion about the setting up of, as titled, "a forum" or an institution.</p>  <p>  This question was raised during a debate in the House last week.  When one considers all of the entities that are in contact with each other my thought subsequently was that it would be beneficial for everybody if a conversation were enabled to take place about the priorities that everybody collectively saw arising from the Brexit decision, nothing more that.  Therefore, there was no discussion with the Alliance, the SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP or the DUP.  It is not going to work; it is not going to happen.  I still extend an open invitation to everybody who might be interested in having that kind of conversation.  As I said, it is not something that would be put on a statutory basis.  We need to be clear where the horizon is now.  Clearly, nothing is going to happen until the British Conservative Party elects a new Prime Minister and sets out its strategy and intent.  I hear different comments about European Union citizens living in Britain, when Article 50 might be triggered and so on.  Let me be clear that we will seek to protect the interests of our people and of all other people living on this island, dealing with the economy and trade, Northern Ireland and British-Irish relations, the common travel area, an open Border and the European Union.  These are all areas that are of intense interest now to people.  While they might not have had an issue about politics before, they know now that it can impact on them.</p><p>From our perspective, what we agreed yesterday at the North-South Ministerial Council with all of the parties will be followed through diligently and rigorously.  We must also understand our connections with the UK and the EU.  Nobody wants to see a hard border.  Nobody wants to see customs and checkpoints every mile of the road on the way into or out of Northern Ireland.  These are issues that concern all the parties in Northern Ireland.  The Deputy is well aware that all of the parties, with the exception of the DUP, favoured the "Remain" vote and the issue was clear from that perspective.  We want to look after the interests of our people and our relationships with Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the EU.  There is a great deal of work and there are challenges ahead, many of them as yet unknown.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500005#C00200"><p>To be frank, I find it incredible that there was no discussion with the First Minister in advance of the North-South Ministerial Council meeting about the idea of a forum.  It seems incredible that it would have been floated without due consultation and engagement and the sounding out of all the political leaders in Northern Ireland, particularly the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and the Executive.  That would have brought clarity, which was in short supply yesterday in terms of the idea that had been floated and spoken about by the Minister for Health.  For example, the Minister said that the forum would see groups North and South work on issues of mutual interest in light of the Brexit vote.  Listening to the Minister on Sunday, one would have thought it was a done deal, a <i>fait accompli</i>, and was going to happen.  Lo and behold, we learned that nobody was consulted about it.</p><p>It is a great pity because there was merit in the idea.  There is merit in the idea of a focused and specialised all-island response to Brexit because Brexit constitutes perhaps the most severe threat to the all-island economy we have witnessed for a long time - certainly since the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement established the idea of consent and the will of the people of Northern Ireland and, very clearly, the will of the people of Northern Ireland will be subverted by the English nationalistic approach in terms of its future within the EU.  To be frank, Brexiteers have very little time for Northern Ireland and, unfortunately, Northern Ireland will not be central to their engagement with Europe in terms of what will unfold, so we need an all-island response.  However, it needs a bit of work in advance before people start floating ideas just for the sake of spin over substance.  We have had too much of that over the past number of years and we had too much of it again over the weekend.  The issues are far too serious for somebody to just get a notion, send it up into the atmosphere and hope everybody will agree with it the following day.  It cannot work like that.  We need more thoroughness and professionalism in terms of approaching what is a very serious issue.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we need additional capacity in our Departments in respect of Northern Ireland, including its position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Brexit.  Likewise, we should be pressing the Northern Ireland Executive to recruit additional personnel and put a special team together to work on an all-island basis in respect of the implications of Brexit and the negotiations that will undoubtedly follow in the coming months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500005#C00300"><p>It was and remains a good idea.  I keep an invitation open to everybody if they want to follow through on this.  There is nothing in this other than the capacity for everybody who wants to have a say and who has a point of view or a proposal to be able to state it cogently and clearly.  All of the bodies are talking to each other.  From assessing all of that, my idea was that it would be worthwhile having an island conversation.  One cannot have it if people do not want to buy into it, and that is their right and opportunity.  The idea still stands and it is still a good idea.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy looks at the cross-Border agencies that deal with investment in infrastructure, one can see that this takes in initiatives such as the Narrow Water Bridge, the A5 and the Ulster Canal.  If the money is to be given up front by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but the Commission decides that, with the UK leaving, INTERREG and the infrastructural funds will no longer continue, we cannot plan in advance.  We cannot say that we are going to have project X or Y and expect the taxpayer here to contribute to something that will be backed up by funding-----</p></speech>

We cannot expect to plan properly if at the end of the process the European Commission will not have anything further to do with Northern Ireland.  We need clarity.  The first thing is that the British Prime Minister will have to state his view.  The process of triggering Article 50 then takes place.  I hear different views about that.  The European Council will monitor political control over this process.  While they say nothing can happen until the exit process is concluded by Britain, I hope that the European Union, having received notification from Britain, will have a parallel system; otherwise, two years of planning, strategy and coherence about what they should do will be lost.</p>  <p>  All Members of the House have to work together on this in respect of our interests - the common travel area, trade with Britain, access to the free market, the free movement of people and an open border with Northern Ireland with no customs or checkpoints similar to those we had 30 years ago.  This will require a great deal of work from everybody.  It is time now, instead of trying to score points on this, to have a particular jersey that we should wear in the interest of our country.</p></speech>

I extend, on my own behalf and on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, condolences and solidarity to the families of the 200 people killed in a bomb explosion in Baghdad.</p>  <p>  The Brexit vote, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, is probably the most serious political and economic crisis to face this island in many years.  The decision is bad for the island of Ireland, North and south.  Yesterday, two ministers for health - the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Northern health minister, Michelle O'Neill - jointly announced a &pound;42 million investment in an all-Ireland children's heart service at the opening of a new cardiac unit in Dublin.  It is good for Ireland, North and south.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r roimh an fhorbairt seo.</p>  <p>  There is a real risk in the time ahead that the Brexit result will have an impact on these areas of co-operation between the two parts of our island.  It also represents a significant threat to the underlying principles and infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement.  Last week, I wrote to the Taoiseach, the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and other political leaders, including the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The only one who answered me was the leader of the Labour Party.  I proposed that the Government work with the Executive and all parties on the island to establish a national forum.  I heard Ministers over the weekend expounding this as a good idea.  The objective, which I outlined in the letter, would be to discuss how the Remain vote of the clear majority of the citizens of the North will be respected and defended.  It could also help shape the collective challenges and our responses to these challenges as we face into the consequences that will arise.  The DUP's rejection of this idea should not be allowed to stand in the way of the establishment of such a body.  The Remain vote, like the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, uniquely brought together in the North unionists, nationalists, republicans and others in common cause.  There will be enormous goodwill for a forum that seeks to defend the North's vote and to protect the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement, its institutions and the two economies on this island.  The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, said yesterday, and I have no doubt, that representatives of civic Unionism and civil society in general will attend along with representatives from our agricultural sector, including agrifood, and the business, community and voluntary sector and many others who are very concerned about what faces us in the time ahead.  I spent the weekend in Belfast.  </p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a responsibility on all of us who are worried by Brexit to work together in the time ahead?   The Government is an equal co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge the particular onus on the Irish Government to defend that agreement and its institutions?  Will he establish this forum, similar in format to the New Ireland Forum and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, with the clear objective that I pointed out?  Will he tell us now when he will bring this forum together?</p><p>When the Taoiseach gets a chance, will he answer my letter?</p></speech>

I am not sure whether the Deputy was talking about a statutory forum that would be put in place like any of the other institutions.  Deputy Adams's idea certainly has merit and value and I share his view that it is necessary that everybody works together in the common interest of all the people of the island.  I also share Deputy Adams' view - it is our responsibility as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, as I have said to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister - that we have a duty to understand the common challenges that we face, in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, in the context of the UK vote and the subsequent relationships, in whatever form, that will apply in terms of the European Union.  Obviously, there is a great deal of confusion among many, but it is important to note that until the exist process is completed, Britain does not leave the European Union, it retains its full rights and membership, it must make its payments to the European Union and it must meet every other regulation of the Union.  Until that time, Britain remains a full member.  Deputy Adams will have noted the comments from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, originally in respect of being able to bring in a surplus by 2020 and then a proposition to reduce the corporate tax rate to below 15%, which would be directly in competition with both here and the intention of the Northern Ireland Executive to reduce its corporate tax rate under devolved authority given to it.  These are all issues that need to be considered.</p>  <p>  We agreed yesterday in the ten-point programme to work through all the existing institutions - the cross-Border bodies, the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council.  We encouraged Ministers, many of whom were new at the meeting yesterday, to engage with their counterparts to set out the programmes they intend to work on towards implementation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams is correct that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Ms Michelle O'Neill MLA, attended the children's hospital in Crumlin.  That will be a unique situation whereby children from the island of Ireland with particular specialist problems will be able to attend that multi-million euro facility where the care and attention they will get will be world class.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams should be clear on it.  From my point of view, as Head of Government, I will work closely with our European colleagues at the European Council many of whom have very different views about the kind of Europe that we can or might have over the next few years.  Our intention is to protect our interests, the interests of all the people of this island, North and South, such as the common travel area, the open Border, the peace process, and the opportunity to continue to grow trade and prosperity in a peaceful situation.  Clearly, there are many challenges ahead.  As I said to Deputy Martin, it requires everybody in the House, irrespective of their political background, to work in the greater interests of the country.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will recall I asked him in my letter to bring together the leaders in the Oireachtas to discuss this.  If we cannot get a date now for the forum, we should at least get a date for that meeting to discuss how we put it in place.</p>  <p>  I remind the Taoiseach that the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and no one stood back.  Neither the international community, the Governments nor the people of the island allowed that opposition to block progress, and the Good Friday Agreement referendum received the clear support of the people.  It must be remembered that the DUP lost this vote also and many of its supporters will not be of the same mind as their leadership.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has said, we need to maximise and co-ordinate our response to the crisis that has been created.  Last week, the Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader championed the cause of Scotland.  I was in south Armagh last night and many people mentioned this to me, and I welcome very much the statement from the Fianna F&aacute;il leader now upholding the Northern vote.  There is an opportunity in all these difficulties to redesign the future of the island of Ireland and of the European Union.  Let us redesign the future of the island of Ireland first.  As I have said, the way to do that is to put together the forum.</p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to indicate a date for that now.

If I proceed to set up a forum that has no participation from other parties, it will become divisive, which is not in the interest of the island of Ireland and its people, North and South.  The Deputy's proposition might be slightly different from mine but there is a welcome opportunity for people from all over the island of Ireland to give their views together on how they see the impact of Brexit and the consequences for them, businesses and people, etc.  I will not give a date for a forum that will not have buy-in from the political parties.  This idea has merit, as I stated to the Deputy, and I noted the national conversation regarding preparation for the budget for next year and this year was very well worthwhile.  People who might not normally be associated with political bodies have had the opportunity to say, as citizens, how it might impact on them and their business.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, we agreed a ten-point programme and we will follow that through diligently and rigorously, with every Minister and cross-Border bodies.  We must work with Europe to ensure that major infrastructure projects that are to be implemented will not be stranded because of a lack of funding.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is already very much aware of this.  We do not want a halt being called to very necessary infrastructure because of either confusion or an inability to work together, which is the central point of the Deputy's comments.  I would like to think we can process the bigger and smaller infrastructure pieces, including, as the Deputy has said, the &euro;3 billion on the table between here and 2020 for the peace process, INTERREG and so on.  It was negotiated during our own term as holder of the Presidency back at the start of 2013.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500008#F00300"><p>As we have heard, yesterday the Taoiseach joined the Northern Ireland First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, to answer media questions on the unprecedented challenges now being faced by the people North and South as a result of the UK Brexit vote.  In recent days the Taoiseach had floated the idea of an all-island forum so we could have a consensus on the island on how to deal with this.  As others have said, this idea was floated many times over the weekend by a number of the Taoiseach's Ministers.  However, at yesterday's press conference, it became clear the Taoiseach had failed to prepare the ground with the Northern Ireland First Minister; the result was the proposal was rejected by her publicly in a very humiliating way.  Yesterday's exchange was reminiscent of a previous Fine Gael Taoiseach who in 1984 faced the media to answer questions about the future of North-South relations.  In both instances, the authority of the office of the Taoiseach and, more importantly, the interests of Ireland, were damaged.</p><p>The Taoiseach's authority has also been damaged on the domestic front.  We see the spectacle this week of the Head of Government being faced down by members of his own Cabinet over a Private Members' Bill on fatal foetal abnormalities.  The Attorney General has consistently been of the view that this legislation is unconstitutional.  We now see a position where some Ministers, including some sitting at the Cabinet table, are taking an <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>approach to the advice of the Attorney General.  This advice is not, as one member of the Government stated, merely &quot;a legal opinion&quot;.  It is the considered view of the chief law officer of the State, whose constitutional functions are clearly laid out in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  The Independent Alliance Ministers do not seem to accept that, or if they do, they do not seem to be too bothered by it.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, has stated he does not care if the Bill is unconstitutional.</p><p>What is even more extraordinary is that this has not caused the Taoiseach to bat an eyelid.</p><p>There were noises last week to the effect that the Taoiseach would reassert the primacy of the Constitution and would require Ministers to accept the doctrine, dating from the foundation of the State, of collective Cabinet responsibility and to abide by decisions of the Cabinet.  What does the Taoiseach intend to do now to reassert the rule of law and the primacy of the Constitution in this Government?  Is he indifferent to Ministers ignoring long-established constitutional rules, or is it simply the case now, in this new political paradigm, that no rules apply as long as the Government continues?</p></speech>

I point out to him that within 12 months of that, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  I think the opportunity is still there for everybody to participate in an island conversation about the common challenges that we face here.  That invitation remains open.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Deputy's second question, the fact of the matter is that this is a partnership Government.  This party does not have a majority and therefore cannot act as a majority.  I have already reminded Ministers of their responsibilities.  While my own party would have a very clear view in respect of a Private Members' Bill being put forward by an independent Member, I am concerned, I have to say, at the clarity from the medical profession in terms of how inadequate the particular Bill is.  Those who operate at the highest level of integrity in the medical profession have made it perfectly clear that the Bill in question is a bad Bill for women.  It does nothing for them.  I have a conscience about that and would not vote for something that would not be in their interest.</p>  <p>  I have set out a position that we put into the programme for Government, namely, that we would set up a citizens' assembly which would reflect on the eighth amendment to the Constitution, which also deals with the question of the substance of the Bill.  I have set out the process by which that will be followed.  We have had two Government decisions on it already.  It will be up and running by October.  This will be the first issue that the citizens' assembly will reflect on.  When it comes back with its recommendations, whatever they might be, it will be a matter for the committee of the D&aacute;il, having access to legal, constitutional and medical advice, and so on, to make its recommendations to this House.  Then everybody can vote freely in accordance with their conscience.  It is a Private Member's Bill that is in question here.  I have reminded Cabinet members very clearly of the responsibility they carry in collective Cabinet responsibility.  While I am not in a position, as the leader of my own party, to dictate to others who are not members of the party and in that sense are not subject to an agreement we would have internally within our party, those who sit at the Cabinet table, as I have reminded Ministers, have a duty in terms of the defence of the Constitution and collective Cabinet responsibility.</p></speech>

He or she "shall be the adviser".  The members of the Government now believe it is simply an advice, to be taken, rejected or weighed against others.  What is the view of the Taoiseach?  Does he accept that under Article 30 there is one authoritative legal adviser to the Government and that members of his Government will be bound by that constitutional precept?</p></speech>

However, I thank Joe O'Toole for shining a light on the real objectives of the commission.  His honesty in telling it like it is has been very useful to those of us who marched against and opposed water charges, as it is for the people who voted for a majority of Deputies in this House to oppose water charges.  Joe O'Toole has already declared that central taxation is not enough to pay for water and that Revenue should be used to collect the levies, something of which people should take note.  He says it is a political exercise, a democratic exercise - he said that people have voted in a certain way and we now have to find enough sugar to make the medicine go down.  He has unpicked what this commission is all about.</p>  <p>  What method was used to appoint the other members of the commission?  Peter Peacock is the chair of the customer forum of Scottish Water and favours charges.  He boasts that customer forums can help to lower prices but water and wastewater charges in Scotland stand at a handsome &pound;417 per annum.  Bill Emery is a former director of Ofwat, the British energy regulator which presided over a privatised water system.  He is an associate of a company that helps public agencies deal with big business and lists 22 water companies among his clients.  Xavier Leflaive of the OECD steers water policy in selected countries - such as Brazil - in South America.  Thames Water, one of the biggest globalised water companies, states that Brazil has one of the largest concentrations in the world of water and wastewater privatisation opportunities.  Despite two decades of water charging and privatisation in South America, more than 130 million people still have no access to safe, clean drinking water and only one in six enjoys safe and adequate sanitation.  Based on this selection, the commission will be a complete sham.  There is not a single representative from the largest social movement in the history of the State or the trade union movement.  The commission's remit excludes any social implication of funding water services in the short, medium or long term and that includes water poverty, future privatisation and potential shut-offs.  All of these things have plagued Detroit and the people of that city have been landed with terrible debt and a scarcity of water.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the commission is predictable and I thank Joe O'Toole again for that.  There will be charges, with sweeteners for those in receipt of social welfare or living in poverty, and there will be a company that will allow privatisation by the back door.  People should note that we are holding a major protest in the city on 17 September to oppose this totally undemocratic measure and the bullying of the EU on the question of water.</p></speech>

This is one of the most important developments in the country in a long period because of years and years of neglect during which the Irish water system and the Irish wastewater system have been woefully inadequate.  The city in which the Deputy lives has been on a knife edge in terms of its capacity for clean water for many years.</p></speech>

Irish Water has invested over &euro;400 million since 2015, an increase of 37% on the estimated &euro;300 million spent in 2013.  Since January 2014, it has built 20 new and upgraded water treatment plants and 49 new and upgraded wastewater treatment plants.  If people live in those areas and can see the improvement in the quality of life that has come about as a consequence, they will understand why Irish Water has done such work.  The Cork lower harbour project, costing &euro;90 million, is also under way.</p><p> As a public servant, Joe O'Toole did a great deal of work over the many years he was involved in public life.  He has said he wants to be an impartial chairman and he knows, more than anybody else, there must be public and political confidence in the integrity of the process that has been set out.  The people the Deputy mentioned - trade unionists, ordinary citizens and so on - of course have their opportunity, but the issue was to have an expert advisory group to advise in respect of how Irish Water should do its business, the standards that should be set and the trends it should follow in order to provide businesspeople and ordinary citizens with clean water and proper wastewater treatment plants while at the same time provide an opportunity for continued investment for jobs for people so that they can have a life to live and contribute to our society.  The Deputy has a very different view from me in terms of Irish Water but in the while it has been in operation, despite the many difficulties in the beginning, it has made very significant improvements through town and country, and its programme of investment in the coming years will continue that kind of development.</p></speech>

I asked him about the structure and formation of the commission and I am objecting, on behalf of many people, to those I listed who were appointed to it because they are not impartial but are in fact partial towards a little bit of privatisation and a lot of charges.  My question is about the structure and the composition of the commission itself, including the non-partial Joe O'Toole, who is going in to chair it with his own set views on it.</p><p>I know of some citizens who applied to be considered for this commission, some of whom have considerable expertise in the environment, waste management and water management and they were not even given the respect or the decency of an explanation as to why their applications failed or that they would not be considered suitable.  The commission is loaded with academics and people from outside the jurisdiction who are unelected and not representative of the people in this country who voted, marched, protested and boycotted <i>en masse</i>to have a different system of water services that is publicly funded through progressive central taxation and over which they have some decision making power.  We are getting a commission that has already made up its mind that it will give us more of the same.</p></speech>

I would have thought, however, having come this far, that the House would allow motions to be put on the legislation and vote on them, rather than just statements.  Given that we have no democratic control over this important issue and its implications for tens of thousands of public sector workers&rsquo; pay, we should at least express our sentiments through a motion and have a vote showing where the political parties stand on their relationship with the public sector and the penalties that will be imposed on it through this legislation.</p></speech>

There are still 12 people missing and many more on the critical list.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is in a position to allocate additional funding from our aid programme to non-governmental organisations providing humanitarian assistance to the communities there, and whether a supplementary Estimate is required?  We have all been struck by the scale and randomness of attacks across the globe by ISIS and other extremist terrorist organisations, which are taking an enormous toll on human life.  We need to be mindful of that with our European Union colleagues.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is.</p>  <p>  The latest announcement by the United Kingdom that it plans to reduce its corporation tax rate to 15% has implications for Ireland and for the ongoing competition to attract foreign direct investment.  Up to 187,000 people work in companies assisted by IDA Ireland.  I understand that the knowledge box proposal is before the European Commission.  It is interesting that Britain forged ahead with a knowledge box some years ago without the Commission&rsquo;s approval and that was being considered.  In light of the competition that is about to develop, can the Taoiseach indicate where we are in respect of our proposals to develop a knowledge box and to create an incentivised tax framework for attracting research and development activities to the country?  The Minister for Finance would have known about this some time ago in previous budgets. </p></speech>

A presentation made by the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Social Protection is designed to deal with quite a number of issues surrounding mortgages and the provision of a new service, including dedicated courts with named judges and days to deal with cases that come before the courts.  The Government approved that today.</p>  <p>  In respect of the 6.25% knowledge development box, it is the first that will be fully compliant, arising from the OECD analysis of corporate tax.  That is following its way through to being approved and introduced.  The 2015 Act introduced a knowledge development box in respect of inventions not patent protected but certified by the controller of patents, designs and trademarks as novel, non-obvious and useful.  The Act provides a statutory basis for the certification scheme.  I will advise Deputy Martin of the progress being made by the application for approval in respect of the knowledge development box.</p>  <p>  In respect of the tragedy in Baghdad which, as the Ceann Comhairle said, was the slaughter of innocent people  I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has reflected on the situation in terms of humanitarian aid.  I will advise Deputy Martin of the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

He did not give me an answer.  Given that he supports the idea, as do three of the leaders who have spoken on it, he should meet us.</p>  <p>  The Government recently told us that waste companies had agreed to freeze the introduction of pay-by-weight charges for 12 months.  I understand since then that Greyhound has said it will automatically transfer customers to a pay-by-weight charge unless they opt out and choose to remain with their current price arrangements.  Greyhound services 250,000 customers in Dublin.  What action will the Government take to protect the rights of these customers?  Will it insist that Greyhound abides by the agreement reached with the Minister?</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach support Second Stage of the Banded Hours Contract Bill, which will be taken today during Private Members' time?  There must be a problem with the Taoiseach's mail, because Deputy David Cullinane wrote to him a week ago but did not get an answer.</p>  <p>  The Government established an expert commission on water charges, the chairperson of which made a series of comments that are unacceptable from the chair of a committee established to independently evaluate water services and water charges.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he should ask Joe O'Toole, the chairperson of the commission, to resign.</p></speech>

It is very redolent of the way we built the west link toll bridge when the Government ended up buying back the toll bridge after 26 years, amazingly enough, for &euro;600 million although it cost &euro;36 million to build.  When in Government we had an agreement that we would safeguard the delivery systems of vital infrastructure such as gas and electricity and protect those networks.  Will the Taoiseach agree the broadband network is as intrinsically important to the State as gas or electricity?  Is this decision of Cabinet irrevocable?  In the new minority Government situation can we have a debate about it in this House?  Will the decision be communicated to the House by way of a debate, motion, or legislation?</p></speech>

The Minister has said that this money is on its way and that they should be making arrangements to meet demand.  I take Deputy O'Dea's point and his is not the only location where the funds in place for those important packages have dried up.  The Minister is aware of it and has issued his instructions.

These group schemes are now in dire need of attention.  Heretofore, the Department provided funding to bring these group schemes up to scratch.  In order that fair play will be seen to be carried out, I ask the Taoiseach what funding is in place to do this.  In Clanmorris, north Kerry, there is a large group scheme with 1,300 customers, while there are more than 2,000 customers in the central group scheme around Tralee.  I also want to make the Taoiseach aware that in one of these group schemes people have been paying residential water charges.  There is a serious matter to be addressed here, so I am asking the Taoiseach to provide funding so that everyone will be on a level pitch.</p></speech>

That is the reason they have been in trouble for a long time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that the Government and the Department had a scheme to put local group schemes together, to measure up to standards where metering was installed, where water was saved and costs were reduced.  People were much happier as a consequence.  That scheme is continuing.  I assume that if the Deputy contacts his local authority together with Irish Water and the Department's housing and planning unit, they will indicate the strategy for schemes that are intended to be brought up to standard so that people can have a high quality system.</p></speech>

At the moment, the school transport section is undertaking a review of all bus routes.  This was carried out three years ago in 2013.  It has come to my attention that quite a number of people will be displaced because of this.  I am aware that some young children may have to move to another school probably 14 km or 15 km from where they currently attend school.</p>  <p>  As a former teacher, I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that it is wrong to move children in years three or four in secondary school, which are exam years, to new schools with different teachers and students.  This matter should be addressed.  If children have to attend a certain school, that should happen before they start going to school, not in the middle of their school years.</p></speech>

This programme, which was published on 11 May, was the outcome of many hours of discussion which took place between my party and Independent Deputies and groupings.  During these discussions agreement was reached with the now Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to undertake an independent clinical review of services at University Hospital Waterford.  This agreement was set out in the programme for a partnership Government and a letter on the matter from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was published on the <i>merrionstreet.ie</i>website.</p><p>Central to the approach for delivering on this ambitious programme is the concept of good faith and no surprises.  The programme for Government sets out a new and collaborative approach in doing business, not only in including the partners of Government but in being inclusive of the Oireachtas and wider society.</p><p>Implementation of the programme for a partnership Government will require a new relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas.  This is reflected in significant D&aacute;il reforms that have been agreed and are being implemented in the House and will provide a significantly greater role for Members of the D&aacute;il.  These arrangements will require greater collaboration and sharing of information by the Government with the Oireachtas, and a new process to support this is being put in place and will be co-ordinated by my Department.  It will pose a challenge to all Members of the Oireachtas to ensure this new relationship works effectively in the long-term interest of the people we represent.</p></reply>

Two months ago on 6 May as the Government was being announced, I asked the Taoiseach to put on record, as he stated on numerous occasions inside and outside this House he would do, all the deals done with political parties, political groupings and each Independent Deputy.  I presume the Taoiseach remembers that.</p>  <p>  It would appear from the Taoiseach's reply today that the only deal made with any Independent, individual or grouping is the deal with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan on University Hospital Waterford in the south east.  I am trying to ensure we do not end up in a situation in the future of my having to accuse the Taoiseach of having misled the D&aacute;il.  There is much talk about new politics.  Ironically, the Taoiseach's adviser was appointed without public analysis to a &euro;275,000 per annum job.</p>  <p>  I want the Taoiseach to guarantee to this House that neither I nor any other Member of this House will come into the possession of any documentation referring to other deals, understandings or agreements, despite that certain Members of this House are stating publicly that agreements or understandings have been reached.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee this House that outside of what he has just read into the record, there are no agreements between any political entity, individual or otherwise and the Government, which is led by the Taoiseach?  Should I or anyone in this House subsequently come into the possession of documentation that refers to such deals, obviously we will have to come into this House and ask the Taoiseach some serious questions.</p></speech>

It is available for everybody to see.  I have no knowledge of understandings, written agreements or commitments other than those published.  No Minister or Minister of State in government has indicated to me that he or she has an agreement with any Member or Members of the House.</p><p>As I said, the programme for Government has been published and was debated here for many hours.  In that regard a specific issue arose in respect of Waterford hospital.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, wrote a letter about that, which was published on the <i>merrionstreet.ie</i>website.  As Deputy Kelly is well aware from his experience in government, regardless of how much one tries to put into a programme for Government, other issues arise day to day or over time that are never contemplated by a programme for Government.  As happened during the years in office of the previous Government, of which Deputy Kelly, former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, and Deputy Howlin were members, there were many issues that were never referred to in the programme for Government that had to be dealt with.</p><p>In so far as the Deputy's question is concerned, the programme has been published; that is it.  There was one other the letter in respect of Waterford hospital and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  As new challenges and problems arise, the Government will have to make decisions about them.  In so far as written documentation on understandings are concerned, I do not know of any.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the programme for Government and what is in it.  Members of this House who support the Government are referring to understandings or deals they have done with the Taoiseach, the Government or individual Ministers.  I have read the programme for Government and other documentation in this regard on which I could lay my hands and saw no reference in it to any such deals with the Taoiseach or the Government.  There appears to be at play here some form of political manoeuvring in that certain Deputies are implying they have done deals with the Government or have agreements with Ministers, individually or collectively, on certain issues pertaining to their constituencies, be that in regard to hospitals, schools, roads, railway lines and so on.  Given that the Taoiseach stated on the record of the House that he would publish everything, what are we to believe when we hear these Deputies refer to such deals?   I take it from the Taoiseach's response today that all utterances from such Deputies are untrue.  They are not included in the programme for Government or in any published documents and have not been in any way objectively assessed to be appropriate in the context of Government spending.</p>  <p>  Am I to take it from what the Taoiseach said today, despite his get-out-jail clause to the effect that other issues arise and things change - they cannot have changed in the past two months - that no such deals exist in writing, that as such there is no such documentation and that what is being stated in the public domain is untrue?  If that is the case, if I or any Member of this House were to come into the possession of documentation that would demonstrate that any of said deals do exist, which some Ministers or Ministers of State are confirming, what am I to do and how will the Taoiseach respond?  In such a scenario, unfortunately, I or another Member would have to come into this House and say that the Taoiseach had misled the House.   We do not want to end up in that scenario.</p></speech>

It is a half page article.  Obviously, somebody is on some inside track.  Deputy Lowry states in that article that he is the only Deputy in the county in a position to work on this because he is supporting the Government.  He also refers to his having cited health as an election issue and in that regard that he has had extensive meetings with HSE officials and senior management and the Minister on how best to progress the case of South Tipperary General Hospital.  Not only is this pilot scheme of a modular unit of 40 beds en suite going to happen but Deputy Lowry has persuaded the Minister to revisit the capital plan.  It seems that in one fell swoop the other four Deputies representing Tipperary would as a result of this deal appear to be redundant.  That said, this could have been something in the offing already and perhaps Deputy Lowry is claiming credit for it.  I do not know.</p></speech>

I am pointing out to the Taoiseach that Deputy Lowry, in terms of how that article is couched and articulated, is saying he has access to the Minister because he is supporting the Government, that he is on the inside track while other Deputies are not.</p><p>In the context of the question tabled by Deputy Kelly, could the Taoiseach tell us whether he has done a deal with Deputy Lowry in return for his support for the Government and are the Ministers under some inside track?  There are all sorts of rumours that a Lowry will be the next Fine Gael Deputy in Tipperary.  It might not be the current Deputy.  It is very interesting reading in terms of the language, content and the clear indication emanating from the entire article and the treatment of the story.</p></speech>

Is this the case?  Did the Taoiseach inform Fianna F&aacute;il about this appointment or in any way give it notice of the appointment of the committee?  The Taoiseach alluded to the lengthy negotiations that took place before the Government reconvened as a minority Government.  I recall the remarks of the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il at that time.  He said "the election represented an overwhelming rejection of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, its policies and its hyper-political behaviour."  He was then moved to put Fine Gael back into Government.  The appointment of the Seanad is another issue.  Clearly, some deal was done between the Taoiseach and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It would be in the interests of everyone if there was transparency about what was going on.  We saw it with the Government decision to repeal the High Court judgment on the national monument at the iconic 1916 site.  Was Fianna F&aacute;il consulted about that?

Obviously, he did not form a Government with the Labour Party so was another deal done with Deputy Lowry in the context of the current Government of the new politics?  Has Deputy Lowry privileged access to the Taoiseach, as the Tipperary Star story would appear to indicate, or to people who command the Taoiseach's attention and decisions from the Taoiseach?</p></speech>

While constitutionally it is up to the Taoiseach of the day to make 11 nominations, I was happy to say to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who is supporting a partnership Government in a minority position, that he could nominate three sectoral positions and that I would appoint them.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.180.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500019#R02000"><p>The last Government responded in the D&aacute;il to all nine of the Convention on the Constitution's reports.  The reports contained 38 recommendations, 18 of which would involve change in the text of the Constitution.  I will summarise the convention's main recommendations and the response to them.</p>  <p>  In its first report, the convention voted against reducing the presidential term of office but recommended that the age threshold for candidacy in presidential elections be reduced from 35 years.  A referendum on this was defeated on 22 May 2015.  The convention's recommendation to reduce the voting age to 16 was accepted but a referendum was not held on this matter.  There are currently no proposals to proceed with such a referendum.</p>  <p>  In the convention's second report, the reference in Article 41.2 of the Constitution to "a woman's life within the home" was considered.  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to holding a referendum on this issue.</p>  <p>  In its third report, the convention recommended an amendment to the Constitution to provide for same-sex marriage.  A referendum on marriage equality was held on 22 May 2015 and was passed by a majority of 62.1%.</p>  <p>  The convention's fourth report made recommendations on the electoral system.  The recommendation that the proportional representation-single transferable vote electoral system be retained was accepted, while the recommendation to increase constituency sizes was not.  The recommendation to establish an electoral commission was accepted and work on this is continuing.  The recommendation that there should be a referendum to permit the appointment of non-Oireachtas members as Ministers was not accepted as the Constitution already allows the Taoiseach to nominate as Ministers two persons who have not been elected to the Oireachtas but who have been nominated to the Seanad.</p>  <p>  In respect of the fifth report on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, the last Government indicated that it was necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise before a decision could be made on holding of referendum.  That analysis is ongoing and will be considered by Government in due course.  I have asked the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora to make this a real priority.</p>  <p>  As regards the sixth report on the offence of blasphemy, the programme for a partnership Government says that a referendum will be held on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.</p>  <p>  The seventh report made recommendations relating to D&aacute;il reform.  The House will be aware that Standing Orders were amended in January of this year to provide for election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot.  Standing Orders were also amended to introduce a system whereby I, as Taoiseach, will appear before the working group of committees twice a year.  Provision has also been made for the proportionate allocation of committee chairs using the d'Hondt system.  In addition, a sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform chaired by the Ceann Comhairle was established.  Also, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to a referendum on enhancing the reference to the Ceann Comhairle in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  As regards the convention's eighth report, A Programme for a Partnership Government states that this report on economic, social and cultural rights will be referred to the new Oireachtas Committee on Housing for consideration of the substantial questions it raises on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources.</p>  <p>  Finally, the ninth report deals mainly with the convention's conclusions and recommendations on the convention process and says there was unanimous support for a second convention.  The House will be aware that the Government is committed to establishing a citizens' assembly with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues.  There are no plans otherwise to implement convention recommendations that were not accepted by the last Government other than as set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

I hope I do not misremember but Tom Arnold and Art O'Leary played a very good leadership role in all of that and it worked well, although the Fine Gael-Labour Government's choice of issues for subsequent referendums left a lot to be desired.  I suppose the biggest success was the marriage equality referendum.</p><p>We have since been told that a citizens' assembly is to be put in place.  We have not been given an explanation of why elements that worked well - the participation of Members of the Oireachtas and the Northern Assembly - have been stripped away.  It would be useful to get some sense of that.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have a very strong view that political representatives should be included in those deliberations.  We are told that the first meeting of the new assembly will take place in November.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when the polling company will be appointed to identify the citizens?  When does he expect to appoint a chairperson for the assembly?  We also want to know who will be responsible for referring issues for discussion to the assembly.  Can the assembly determine these, or will they come from the Government?</p> <p> As the Taoiseach has outlined, the nine reports from the assembly contained 38 recommendations.  The Government accepted six out of 18 that would have meant constitutional change.  We have been given no explanation.  These citizens spent an awful lot of time, briefed themselves, and felt really proud to be part of that democratic process, but the recommendations they made have been rejected without, as far as I can ascertain, any explanation.  </p> <p> The programme for Government proposes that referendums be held on a further two of the outstanding issues - to amend the Constitution to remove the offence of blasphemy, and to give the office of Ceann Comhairle constitutional standing - yet we have no date for either.  There is a proposal for a referendum on the article in the Constitution that refers to a woman's life within the home.  We have no date for that.  One can see as we go into a new, revised and different shape for a citizens' assembly that there is still outstanding work from the last grouping, which gave us an awful lot of their time and some very thoughtful recommendations.  The very least they and we deserve is a response to their recommendations and some sense of when they will be implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500020#S00200"><p>I thank Deputy Adams for his comments.  It is fair to say that Tom Arnold and all of those people who were chosen and participated in the Constitutional Convention were proud of the fact that they were responsible in many ways for changes to the Constitution.  They felt very pleased to be a part of the democratic process by contributing to questions that people were asked in a referendum and to the answers they gave, with particular reference to the marriage equality referendum.</p>  <p>  We have learned some lessons.  I had thought originally that it might be possible to run four or five referendums on the one day and people could tick the boxes.  That is not the way it works, because when there is a referendum people begin to ask what the issues are on the "Yes" and "No" side.  If one imagines knocking on the door of a constituent's house and saying "I am here about the referendums; there are four or five next Wednesday, and these are the issues," one does not have the opportunity to explain that in the 30 seconds or 90 seconds one might get on a doorway.  I have come back from that view.  One or two might be the most we could have because, if multiple referendums were held on the same day, citizens would lose interest and say "I cannot take all this in," because of the "Yes" and "No" side and the way things are conducted.</p>  <p>  The assembly will be 100 citizens.  That is not to decry in any way the contribution made by the political representatives on the last occasion.  I have authorisation from the Cabinet to set up the assembly.  We got authorisation to use the electoral register, which has to apply.  I will now proceed to go through the process of nominating an appropriate polling company, which will be able to use the information on the electoral register to select the 100 citizens.  I will take advice from anybody on potential candidates for chairperson.  The first issue they will look at is the eighth amendment.  The implications of that are very serious and sensitive for many people.  </p>  <p>  Tom Arnold was not appointed until later on in the day.  It might have been better if he had been appointed a little earlier.  That is not to decry his merits or value at all, but perhaps if the chairperson were to be appointed earlier he or she might be in a position to give out information about what the work of the assembly will be.  We will consider that.  I hope to have the polling company up and doing its work pretty soon.  I would like to think it would be ready to go as an assembly by the end of September so we can have the first meeting in October, not November.  I have committed to bring that forward because of the importance and interest in looking at the question of the eighth amendment.  </p>  <p>  Will the assembly be able to do things itself?  Yes, it will.  The Government has given it a few things to do - to look, first of all, at the question of the eighth amendment and aging in Ireland, on which there are a number of issues.  The assembly itself could decide to look at X or Y as well.  The remit of the assembly is for 12 months unless otherwise decided.  The first issue it will reflect on is the eighth amendment, and when it makes its recommendations or propositions it can send them back to the Oireachtas.  I do not know how long that will take.  I assume they will want some reasonable time to reflect on those issues and call in people who might advise them on the range of activities.  The items the assembly is to consider, including the eighth amendment, are set out in the programme for Government.  The chairperson will be completely independent.  I hope that those who are selected by the polling company will do their job well.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say here that we can have referendums on X or Y.  We need to get agreement from everybody on the referendums the previous Government agreed to hold but was not in a position to hold and whatever might arise from the reflections of the assembly with regard to the eighth amendment.  We need to get agreement from everybody as to the timing or the number of referendums to be held.  My original thought of having a super-referendum day is one I cannot see working in reality because people get overloaded with information from the for and against sides, depending on what the issue is.</p></speech>

We will now not have anyone from the Six Counties, either a citizen delegate or political representative.  He also did not give any clarity about the unfinished business of the Constitutional Convention and the series of recommendations it made.  Neither did he show any interest in explaining what happened if the Government, for whatever reason, decided not to go with a recommendation.  People deserve an explanation of why that was the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500020#S00400"><p>Many of the questions or recommendations from the Constitutional Convention were ones we would have difficulty with in terms of the issues or the lack of depth of what was proposed.  We would not necessarily say we would follow through on every recommendation the Constitutional Convention made on referendums or that they should automatically be referred to the people on the basis that they were recommended by the convention.  While the last Constitutional Convention held informative debate and produced thoughtful recommendations, it was hamstrung from the beginning.  It covered a significant range of issues rather than being focused on one major topic such as political reform.  It jumped from issue to issue.  It also suffered from the fact that its agenda was, in some instances, set to delay the then Government from having to take a stand on a number of issues.  The rejection by the people of the proposal on the minimum age for candidates for the presidency showed what happens when marginal issues are elevated over more urgent ones.  We need a more comprehensive approach to holding referendums and the Oireachtas should be centrally involved in that process.</p><p>I take the Taoiseach's point that one cannot have four or five referendums in one day.  I would never have subscribed to that idea because most referendums are about weighty subjects that demand much consideration in advance, as we have learnt from Brexit.  The point is that we should, as an Oireachtas, either agree on a number during the lifetime of a particular Oireachtas or whether, at least, there are issues that we can get consensus on.  There are some hanging around since a previous Oireachtas committee, for example, regarding reform of the Constitution, and some from the Constitutional Convention that might have merit.  It might be worth considering whether the Oireachtas can agree to hold one or two a year over the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500021#T00200"><p>The idea of the Constitutional Convention, which originally came from the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, proved to be a very good one.  It is a disappointment and a mistake to move away from the inclusive political involvement in that, because the interaction of professional politicians and general citizens was good for both sides.  People came with an open mind.</p>  <p>  I do not agree that we should have two or three referendums, as though we have just lined up a list of things to do, and I ask the Taoiseach's view on it.  What all of us who have been knocking on doors in referendums know, and if the experience of Brexit for the past few weeks indicates anything, is that we should be careful about what questions we put to people.  They should be issues of moment and substance, and if we are going to make changes, particularly to the Constitution, we should have a good and convincing reason.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is clear that when there is a major event such as a presidential election taking place in conjunction with a referendum, as was the case with the first referendum we held on parliamentary inquiries, it overshadows the referendum to the extent that there is no real engagement with the issue.  In addition, where an important referendum is in the public mind together with a less important one, there is no real debate about the less important one.  We must be very careful in how we proceed on referendums, and I would not be in favour of simply saying, "Let us have a plethora of them.  Let us list them every three months."  Unless there is a convincing and compelling reason to undertake a democratic process of this nature, we should not be embarking upon it.</p></speech>

I have no intention of setting out dates for referendums without consultation with everybody.  I agree with that.  There is no point in saying that we will have a referendum in October on some issue unless we have buy-in from all of the political parties here and agreement to set aside day X in month X for a referendum on a major issue.</p>  <p>  I suppose, when one reflects on the Constitutional Convention, one must conclude that while it did good work, perhaps we gave it too much work to do.  If one gets 18 recommendations for referendums, obviously, that is four or five years' work.  These are expensive issues to handle and a Minister of the day must contend with that.  I also agree that it is difficult to motivate people about many of the issues that might arise in terms of changes to the Constitution and we should, perhaps, consider more carefully the major issues, societal or otherwise, that need to be dealt with by way of referendum.</p>  <p>  We decided on this occasion to have as broad a citizen representation as possible and that is why the recommendations from the assembly will come back to the Oireachtas, where all the Members will be involved in any event.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.196.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500021#T01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  On the morning of 24 June, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, telephoned to inform me personally of the result and of his intention to resign.  He thanked the Irish Government for its support all through the process.  He committed to ensuring that there would be early bilateral engagement at senior official level on key issues then arising.  These include Northern Ireland, the Border and the common travel area.  I subsequently met Mr. Cameron at last week's European Council.  I took the opportunity at the meeting to speak of our long history with the UK and our strong and unique relationship, including the fact we share a number of specific interests and concerns, including Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the interconnectedness of our trade.  The wish of the Irish Government is for Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom to remain part of the Single Market in order to avoid any borders between people, goods and services on these islands.  In that context, I also passed on the concerns of the Scottish First Minister, whom I had spoken to on the phone and met at the British-Irish Council summit in Glasgow recently.  I met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland at the North-South Ministerial Council yesterday, having spoken to them the week before by telephone.  Yesterday we agreed a range of actions to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected and the benefits of North-South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements that emerge in terms of United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 24 June, the Government adopted a contingency framework identifying key policy issues to be managed by Departments arising from the referendum vote for the UK to leave the EU.  The framework maps out the key issues that will be of most importance to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  This will be a process, as important issues that emerge and recede in the course of negotiations will be reflected upon.</p>  <p>  The contingency framework is being co-ordinated by my Department.  It is based on preparations over many months, including inputs by Departments to identify the key strategic and sectoral issues arising from the UK's disengagement with the EU.  The framework will ensure that the Government and its constituent Departments are able to focus on key policy issues to be addressed in any exit negotiations with a view to minimising potential operational risks likely to arise.  Using the contingency framework, Ministers, Departments and agencies will track and adapt the detail of risk management strategies arising in each of the policy and operational areas identified.  Substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify those key strategic, policy and operational risks.  This work will be intensified and prioritised across all Departments and agencies.  Priority issues identified include UK-EU negotiations, British-Irish relations, Northern Ireland, trade, investment, North-South Border impact, competitiveness and macroeconomic issues, research and innovation funding, and energy.  More will be added as the terms and conditions of the new UK-EU relationship evolve.</p>  <p>  A number of existing structures will he strengthened as necessary.  These include the Cabinet committee on EU affairs, the North-South Ministerial Council, and the British-Irish Council; and at official level, the joint Ireland-UK Secretaries General-permanent secretaries process, the EU senior officials' group, the interdepartmental group on the UK EU referendum, and external stakeholders and interested bodies.</p></reply>

If the British economy goes into recession, would the Taoiseach agree that it will make matters difficult for us here - difficult for Irish businesses and farmers whose main market is the UK, and difficult for the tourism industry because of the weak pound?  We will have a mighty job, and they will have a mighty job in the UK as well, to avoid a recession both in Europe and in the UK.</p>  <p>  In that context, Deputy Kenny's status as Taoiseach has been badly damaged and diminished in recent days.  First, a number of his Ministers are in open revolt over a stated policy by the Taoiseach.  Second, the cack-handed way in which the Taoiseach approached the issue of the North-South Ministerial Council, where he had his proposals trailed in the media over the weekend before discussing them with the First Minister, was a mistake, because we will need all-island forums to discuss this.  Lastly, at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly this weekend there was fairly unanimous agreement that there should not be a hard land border between the North of Ireland and the Republic.  Would the Taoiseach agree with that?  Some weeks ago, when I said I had some doubts that the Remain side would prevail, I asked the Taoiseach whether he had a plan B.  I did not hear a plan B in the long list the Taoiseach read out.</p><p>I think I heard a tone of panic though.</p></speech>

It could clearly have an impact in politics across Europe.  Many people feared the right could be strengthened after the Leave vote, but the right is in disarray.  Mr. Cameron and Mr. Johnson are gone and Mr. Farage is following them.  On the left, Mr. Corbyn remains.  The key question now is the attempted coup by the Blairites against Mr. Jeremy Corbyn in order to remove him and put a Blairite back in charge of the Labour Party.  There is a battle of two parties in one Labour Party, that of the pro-war, neo-liberal Blairites and that of the socialists of Mr. Corbyn and, for example, many of the 60,000 people who have joined the Labour Party over the past week.  That battle inside the Labour Party is vital and I send the solidarity of the Anti-Austerity Alliance to Mr. Corbyn.  We hope he and those coming around the Labour Party prevail-----</p></speech>

There should be a call to a conference of the broad labour movement to defend his leadership and therefore have a socialist-led Labour Party engaging in a general election campaign, fighting for a government position that can be won in Britain.  That will create a completely different picture in terms of the nature of exit that will take place, as well as the debate right across Europe putting on the agenda the question of fighting for a Europe that serves the interests of people; it would be a socialist Europe, as opposed to the neo-liberal, militarised Europe that has been rejected.</p></speech>

This is one of the biggest ever diplomatic and administrative challenges we have faced as a country and it needs senior people working full-time on it.  I am particularly concerned about the need for us to have a whole-of-government approach.  I suggest there needs to be a series of a temporary secondments from other Departments to the unit in the Taoiseach's Department responsible for co-ordinating and managing the Government's response to Brexit.</p>  <p>  After yesterday, it is clear something must happen in terms of the decision by the Northern Ireland First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, who will not support the sort of inclusive and open North-South action we need.  That process was wrongly and badly handled, as I stated already, but the key point is we cannot let that be the end of the matter.  We need an all-island Brexit-specific session of each North-South body before the start of September.  Will the Taoiseach put that in place?</p>  <p>  The Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in together colluded in getting rid of the civil dialogue as part of the Good Friday Agreement.  They never wanted it to get off the ground.  Now people are screaming for it to get together-----</p></speech>

My focus, however, is not on the plans that those on the ultra-left see, with no amount of chaos being too much for them in order to see themselves thriving.  We must now put this country first.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach for specifics.  The front runner in the Tory leadership election seems to be Ms Theresa May and she has indicated she will not invoke Article 50 of the treaties of the European Union until, at the earliest, next year.  We should give the space for that.  There is a very divided view coming from Europe, with a very strong negative view coming from the Commission and, bluntly, my socialist colleague in the Parliament.  There is a more measured response from President Tusk.  What is the Taoiseach's view on the timing of the invocation of Article 50 and what we should be doing bilaterally with Britain and trilaterally with Britain and the European Union to shape our position?  We are the most affected nation, other than the UK itself, by all of this so we should have a very clear strategy for what we want to emerge at the end of negotiations, even before those negotiations begin.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500022#U03500"><p>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House on last week's meeting of the European Council and the subsequent informal meeting of 27 Heads of State or Government.  The outcome of the UK referendum, of course, was the dominant focus of the discussions.  The current migration situation was also discussed, as were a number of economic, foreign and security policy issues.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to address the external relations issues in his closing remarks.</p>  <p>  There was an extensive discussion of the outcome of the UK referendum and its implications.</p><p>There were two separate exchanges on the issue.  The first was on Tuesday evening at the European Council proper, where the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, gave an interesting and frank account of the referendum and more recent developments within the UK, and the second was on Wednesday morning, when the 27 other member states had their first discussion on the withdrawal process, as well as the future direction of the EU.  The atmosphere throughout the discussions at the meeting with David Cameron was subdued, but both calm and constructive.  Most leaders spoke, all in a spirit of regret.  Many emphasised the importance of their relationships with the UK and hoped for strong ties to continue, but also made clear the need for the European Union to plan for a future without Britain.  I should emphasise that David Cameron offered his analysis of why the Leave side won the referendum, including the immigration factor, but he did not seek to anticipate the approach to be taken by his successor.<br/><br/>I used the opportunity to outline our long and complex history with the UK, emphasising how relations had developed remarkably in recent years.  A symbol of this was the participation of President Higgins in the ceremonies at the end of last week to mark the centenary of the start of the Battle of the Somme, in which very many Irish soldiers, from both North and South, lost their lives.  I also stressed the importance of the Northern Ireland peace process and our joint responsibility for the Good Friday Agreement.  I noted that we had joined the EU together in 1973 and that the current strength of our bilateral relationship was in no small part due to our common membership.  I highlighted our specific interests and concerns, including in relation to Northern Ireland, North-South relations, the common travel area and the interconnectedness of our bilateral trade.<br/><br/>At the meeting of the 27 countries the following morning, all partners shared the view that, while they regretted the outcome of the referendum, the democratic decision of the UK electorate must be respected.  While, of course, there was concern about the effects of the British vote on the politics of some other countries, there was little evidence of any punitive approach.  We all have a strong collective interest in a strong, stable and prosperous UK.  Further, we all agreed that Article 50 provides the only legal framework for the UK to withdraw from the EU.  It is up to the British Government to notify the European Council explicitly of its intention to withdraw.  However, it was agreed that the notification should be made as quickly as possible.  Around the table, as in wider debate, there were different perspectives on what &ldquo;as quickly as possible&quot; should or could mean, but it was generally accepted that notification could not be expected until the political situation in the UK had settled down and a new Prime Minister has been appointed.<br/><br/>As Deputies will be aware, different candidates for the Conservative Party leadership have said different things about the timeframe they envisage for the triggering of Article 50.  On the one hand, I think it is reasonable for the British Government, under its new leader, to take the time necessary to formulate its approach and to engage in the consultations required with Parliament and with the three devolved Administrations, including Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, too lengthy a gap will simply prolong uncertainty in the rest of the EU but also, above all, in the UK itself, with the negative consequences for business and consumer confidence that we are already seeing.<br/><br/>Any sense that the British Government was engaging in game-playing or deliberate procrastination would be received negatively by partners and would damage the confidence and goodwill needed for a successful future negotiation.  It was mainly for this reason that it was emphasised that there can be no negotiations of any kind before this notification has taken place, contrary to what has been suggested by some in Britain.  As a point of clarification, however, this refers to negotiations as such on behalf of the 27 as a whole.  It can, of course, be assumed that informal contacts will take place between different member states and the UK.  Certainly, I think it important that the Government start exploratory work with the UK in regard to our very specific concerns to analyse what might be possible on a bilateral basis, without, of course, prejudicing EU negotiations.<br/><br/>Once formal negotiations begin, those under Article 50 relate to the exit of the UK only and not to its future relationship with the EU.  These negotiations are expected to cover such issues as the status of UK citizens currently in Europe and EU citizens in Britain, what happens to existing contracts under EU programmes, the position of British officials in the EU institutions, and so forth.  They cannot last more than two years, unless there is unanimous agreement to prolong them, and a withdrawal agreement needs the agreement of a qualified majority in the European Council, and not of all member states.  In the meantime, the UK remains a full member of the Union, with all the rights and obligations that membership confers.  These obligations include the full application of European law.  This means there will be no change in current arrangements regarding trade, free movement, or any other issue.<br/><br/>Separately, there is the possibility of a negotiation between the UK and the EU over its future relations with the Union.  I say &quot;possibility&quot; because it would be for the UK to seek such a negotiation.  It is the possible options here - such as UK membership of the European Economic Area, like Norway, or a more distant relationship with fewer obligations but also fewer rights - that are the main focus of current debate.  I would stress, however, that there are many issues beyond trade which would need to be discussed and agreed.  Legally, there can be no agreement on the relationship between the EU and the UK until it leaves the Union and becomes a third country.  It is also the case that negotiations on these issues may very well take longer than the two years envisaged for the withdrawal negotiations.  However, it would be very much the hope that the two sets of negotiations could proceed in parallel, that at least the broad outline of what the relationship would look like would have emerged before withdrawal, and that sensible transitional or bridging arrangements could be put in place.  If this is to be achieved, however, the UK would have to be seen to be negotiating constructively and in good faith.  The EU, for its part, would need to take a positive approach also.<br/><br/>Last Wednesday's statement by the 27 stated that the hope was that the UK would be a close partner of the EU in the future.  It stated that any agreement would have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations.  It was also underlined that access to the Single Market<font color="#FF0000"></font>requires acceptance of all four freedoms, which include the free movement of EU citizens within the Union, above all for the purpose of working.  Some commentators have seen this as some sort of hardening towards the UK.  It is simply a statement of what the treaties require.  The essential purpose was to disabuse people in the UK of the idea that they could have full access to the Single Market but major restrictions on free movement.  How exactly the balance of rights and obligations referred to in the statement would be achieved would, of course, be for negotiation.  The most important element will be what the UK sets as its objectives.<br/><br/>As negotiations are unlikely to start for some months, there is also time for the EU and its member states, including Ireland, to identify key issues and begin to prioritise and prepare.  What is absolutely clear is that the European Council will play the decisive role in the negotiations.  Heads of State or Government are adamant that it will be for them to make the key decisions, and that national officials will be closely involved.  Clearly the European Commission, with its technical expertise, will also have an important role to play, and the final package will require the approval of the European Parliament, but the overall political direction of the process will be provided by the European Council.  I stress this for two reasons.  First, there has been a great deal of comment by a wide range of European personalities, much of it rather premature and ill-considered.  I advise Deputies to focus instead on what the European Council says.  Second, in the setting of the negotiating mandate, all leaders, including myself, will be closely involved.<br/><br/>From Ireland's perspective, we have advanced, and will continue to progress, comprehensive contingency work across Government in order to define our national interests and work out how best they can be protected during the negotiation process.  This process will continue before and during the negotiations and I look forward to an intensification of work at both official and political level, including in this House.  The Government is also very conscious of the need to consult widely with all stakeholders and will build on the arrangements already in place.  At our North-South Ministerial Council meeting yesterday, 4 July, we had a detailed discussion about the potential impact of the UK referendum result.  We agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected and advanced, and that the benefits of North-South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge as regards the United Kingdom's future relationship with the EU.<br/><br/>Yes, Ireland will be part of the overall EU team of 27.  However, from my exchanges with other EU leaders I can say that our partners fully understand and acknowledge the unique nature of our relations with the UK, especially with regard to Northern Ireland, North-South relations and the common travel area.  I have no doubt that they will be sympathetic to our concerns in framing the negotiating mandate.</p><p>As I said earlier, we will do the maximum possible to reach agreements on a bilateral basis on all issues which can be handled that way.  It is evident that Ireland has a particular interest in a stable, prosperous and outward looking UK.  The closer the future relationship is between the EU and the UK, the better it will be from our perspective.  We will work for that in negotiations, but let me be clear &ndash; the approach the UK itself takes will be fundamentally important to our chances of achieving that goal.</p> <p> Much has been said already about the wider implications of the outcome of the UK referendum.  It has certainly highlighted the crisis of confidence not only in the European Union, but in politics and political institutions throughout much of the Western world.  Further reflection on the best way forward will be necessary and our discussion last Wednesday was rightly preliminary in nature.  At this stage, most leaders are strongly of the view that this is not the time to take a big leap forward towards integration or a backward step towards weakening the Union.  There was little talk of treaty change, or new powers for the EU.  The real need is to focus on implementing, more effectively and dynamically, concrete measures that improve the lives of all our citizens, such as measures on jobs, growth, investment and counterterrorism.  These are the essential building blocks of long-term prosperity and stability for us all.  We agreed to return to the matter in the autumn and, to this end, an informal meeting of EU leaders has been scheduled for 18 September, to be hosted by the Slovakian Presidency in Bratislava.</p> <p> The migration and refugee situation rightly remains an issue of the highest priority for the Union, although the time for discussion at last week's meeting was more limited than usual.  The EU has developed a comprehensive approach to the migration challenges as set out in a range of specific measures.  There has been good progress on many of these measures, including the establishment of a European coast and border guard, which Ireland will not opt into, and a package of measures agreed with Turkey and, for a variety of reasons, slower progress on others.  Overall, however, the measures are having a positive impact.  The Commission report of 15 June indicates - this is also confirmed in other reports - that the numbers crossing the Aegean Sea, for example, have reduced very substantially since the EU-Turkey deal was signed in March.  This is to be welcomed sincerely.  However, the challenge remains both in the Aegean and on the route from Libya to Italy, which remains perilous.</p> <p> At last week's meeting, the main focus was on the external dimension of the crisis where the proposed migration partnership framework, which aims at ensuring coherence between EU migration policy and its external policies, was examined.  In general terms, we welcome the framework's focus on working even more closely with countries of origin and transit.  We also welcome the intention to work closely with countries hosting large numbers of displaced people, and would support the approach that partnership frameworks build on existing policies in this area.</p> <p> The European Council dealt with a number of important economic issues under the broad heading of jobs, growth and investment.  The European Council generally endorsed the country-specific recommendations and thereby completed the 2016 European semester process.  The European Council also adopted conclusions on the Single Market and we support the affirmation that swift and determined progress must be made.  We also support the call for the various strategies and action plans proposed by the Commission to be implemented by 2018 and the fixing of an annual review of progress.  It is especially welcome that leaders placed such emphasis on the need to bring the full benefits of the digital single market to all stakeholders.  This is a priority for the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy.</p> <p> I intervened during a brief exchange on trade, where I stressed that the Commission should follow through and seek to agree a TTIP deal with the United States.  This is a major opportunity to set the standards for global trade for the next 50 years.  As the conclusions confirm, the European Council will return to the trade agenda in October.  Separately, the European Council noted the progress which has been made through the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, in mobilising private investment, and called for the Council and European Parliament to urgently examine new proposals on the future of the fund.  The Commission will bring these proposals forward soon.  Ireland has welcomed EFSI as an additional instrument in support of growth and investment and we look forward to the Commission's detailed evaluation of the first results of the fund.  It is essential that any obstacles to investment be removed.</p> <p> Note was also taken of recent steps on the development of economic and monetary union.  At European Council level, there appears to be a limited ambition for a major push towards deeper integration at the current time.  While the issue was not discussed, the Heads of State or Government affirmed the importance of the continuing fight against tax fraud, evasion and avoidance, noting, in particular, the anti-tax avoidance directive.  Finally, the European Council took note of the difficult situation in the agricultural sector, principally in dairy and pigmeat.  We welcome the call on the Commission to provide all necessary supports to assist farmers, including financial assistance, where appropriate.</p> <p> As is evident, last week's meeting of the European Council addressed a number of issues of great importance and we will return to them in future meetings, above all the UK question.  I look forward now to hearing statements by Deputies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500024#W00200"><p>Eleven days after the result of the UK referendum the future direction of the European Union is no clearer.  In fact, the incoherence in London has actually become worse.  Anything which increases uncertainty and drags out the process before hard decisions are reached is damaging for Europe and for Ireland.  Last week's summit involved no significant progress.  It is welcome that leaders expressed their solidarity, but this is something they express on every issue at every summit, even when they are fighting relentless battles on issues.  Warm words and anodyne clich&eacute;s about shared visions are irrelevant when set beside the urgency of the issue at hand.</p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il&rsquo;s debate on this topic last week demonstrated that Deputies representing the overwhelming majority of the Irish people agree on the core principles of Ireland's response.  We are absolutely committed to remaining a full, active and constructive member state of the European Union.  We recognise the scale of the economic and social threat posed to all parts of this island from the decision of the UK.  We believe that this issue must now be an absolute priority for us.</p>  <p>  This is a consensus which has a strong democratic legitimacy and an even stronger basis in the facts of progress directly linked to Ireland's place in the European Union.  We are not uncritical and we see the need for reform, but we also refuse to accept the anti-EU rhetoric which pushes aside as irrelevant the peace and prosperity enabled by the Union.  This view was not, of course, unanimous.  A minority of Deputies continued in the anti-EU tradition of accusing it of being some vast neo-liberal conspiracy beating down the people of Europe and inflicting aggression on others.  To them, there is a socialist utopia available outside of the Union.  Sinn F&eacute;in, of course, continued its new policy of attacking everything the EU does and its core principles and then claiming that it wants to stay in the EU.  Incredibly, and in the face of overwhelming evidence, our far-left anti-EU Deputies again claimed the result as vindicating their critique.  According to them the xenophobic, neo-liberal and anti-social campaign to leave had nothing to do with the decision to leave.  This ridiculous position, a political manoeuvre more cynical than anything of which they have accused other parties in the past, is even less tenable a week later.  As we have all seen, the first response in London has been to plan lower corporation tax and argue over how to have the maximum amount of free trade with the minimum amount of free movement, workers' rights and consumer protections.  The sinister attacks on EU nationals, particularly those from more recent member states, are a new development directly linked to the Leave rhetoric.</p>  <p>  The speeches we heard denouncing the sinister anti-foreigner rhetoric of some English politicians were, as usual, forceful and eloquent, but if one does not acknowledge the centrality of these views in driving anti-EU sentiment in the referendum and in other countries, then clearly one cannot help confront it in reality.  The far right in France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy and many other countries is to the fore in pushing an agenda of dismantling the EU.  Nothing should be done which can help to legitimise their arguments.  This was the core mistake which David Cameron and his allies made when they embraced the idea of painting the EU as an enemy to be fought.  The fact that the clear majority of the Irish people, of all parts of society, and their representatives reject this gives us a very positive foundation upon which to move forward.</p><p> Given that all of the potential holders of the office of British Prime Minister after the start of September have ruled out maintaining full freedom of movement and continued budget payments, the so-called Norway option of the United Kingdom joining the European Economic Area appears to be a non-starter.  As such, a very complex trade negotiation is required.</p> <p> The idea, floated by some in Brussels, that the United Kingdom could only start such a negotiation post-exit is foolish and one we should oppose.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests that the UK&rsquo;s exit causes as little disruption as possible and that the terms be as generous as possible within the major constraint of protecting the core principles of the Union, particularly fair trade based on agreed standards of workers' rights, consumer protection and freedom of movement.</p> <p> Regarding the timetable, a delay in triggering Article 50 until the new London Government is in place is reasonable.  Anything which delays it for a substantial period would be unacceptable.  We are not looking at the equivalent of the Canadian trade negotiation, which took six years, because there is already a vast body of shared regulation in place.  Two years is an entirely achievable goal.  Ongoing uncertainty helps no one.</p> <p> I welcome the meetings which the Taoiseach is to hold with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande.  It should be noted, however, that these meetings have a poor record of producing substantive results for Ireland.</p> <p> We have to be clear about exactly what we want.  At the top of the list should be Irish involvement in the negotiations as part of a specific team appointed by the Council.  President Junker has not been reassuring in his response so far and it would be unacceptable for him and the Commission to be in charge; I welcome the Taoiseach's comments earlier in terms of the Council being in charge.</p> <p> One very real issue within the Union has been the failure to find a mechanism for ensuring that more voices are involved in critical discussions.  The growing number of initiatives between a limited number of members must be opposed as it is causing real damage.  The original meeting of the six, for example, was foolish, counterproductive and sent the wrong message to the rest of the European Union.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500025#X00300"><p>I welcome that.  These negotiations are an opportunity to address this by ensuring that those involved represent distinct interests, including those of countries with a major stake in the final deal with the United Kingdom.</p><p>The Taoiseach should also use the period between now and the special summit in September to launch a specific diplomatic initiative to ensure that each member state is briefed at a high level on Ireland&rsquo;s position.</p><p>At the meeting last week of our European party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I outlined for the five Prime Ministers present and the other Governments represented the importance of this issue for Ireland.  I am convinced that there would be a substantial, positive outcome from a comprehensive initiative to tour and brief all our partners and not just the largest two.</p><p>The handling of the possibility of establishing an all-island forum on Brexit, unfortunately, has been close to shambolic.  It is genuinely extraordinary that Ministers would do interviews about a proposal before making contact with Northern parties.  It is the inevitable outcome of five years of stepping back from deep, ongoing involvement in all-island issues.  The rejection of the idea by First Minister Foster is regrettable, and her statement that there are more than enough all-island bodies is unacceptable given her duty to examine areas for such bodies as part of the required review under the Belfast Agreement.  What was missing from her comments was an acceptance of the deep threat to our economies.  She is fully entitled to believe in the Brexit cause.  Her dismissal of the potential threat of Brexit is a completely different thing and ignores the will of the people of Northern Ireland and the mounting economic evidence.</p><p>It is the right and obligation of our Government to speak up for the social and economic interests of the whole island in Brexit negotiations.  We cannot impose our will on the people of Northern Ireland, but we can and must make sure that their importance to us, and <i>vice versa</i>, is not ignored.</p><p>As I said in our debate last week, this is too urgent for us to leave it to business as usual.  The Government must now publish details of how it intends to use existing structures to ensure deep engagement with institutions in the North and to ensure that economic and social interests on both sides of the Border are heard.</p><p>The joint DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in exclusion of formal civil society dialogue from the Northern institutions in contravention of the Belfast Agreement must be challenged immediately.  The pattern for quite some years has been a refusal to establish that civil society dialogue.  It was part of the negotiated deal on the Good Friday Agreement but, regrettably, the main parties in the North did not want to know about it.  We should now offer all necessary assistance to employer bodies, trades unions, farmers&rsquo; organisations and others to convene dedicated North-South expert groups on their concerns and to present their views as soon as possible.</p><p>We had a Brexit seminar over 12 months ago in Cavan hosted by Deputy Brendan Smith.  We had the IFA economist present who gave a great presentation on the perils of Brexit for Ulster farmers.  It was a pity her views and research was not disseminated more widely in the North in a rational and cool way in the context of the debate, but we got a sense at that seminar of the level of expertise available that can be of assistance now in an all-island approach to our negotiations.</p><p>On the issue of a potential unification referendum, the demand for one was made by Sinn F&eacute;in without any attempt to reach out to other parties or groups.  It was made without the provision of any evidence that it might pass.  It was clearly intended to be nothing other than a bit of grandstanding from our most consistently anti-EU party.</p><p>I hope that Brexit will mean that a substantial number of people in Northern Ireland change their position and become supporters of unification.  If this happens then we should have a reunification referendum.  The partisan posturing of a party which only last year issued leaflets calling on Belfast voters to vote on sectarian lines simply puts off the day when a reunification referendum could be held and won.</p><p>Until we see the result of the Tory election the nature of negotiations with London will be uncertain.  Mr. Gove, as a journalist, was one of the most consistently wrong and ill-informed commentators on Northern Ireland.  The other candidates have no significant record to assess.  What we do know is that all appear to support the basic economic strategy outlined by Chancellor Osborne yesterday.  As predicted, this is moving in the opposite way to the social vision claimed by our anti-European Union Deputies as the basis for the &quot;Leave&quot; vote.</p><p>Until 2011, it was a tradition that the Taoiseach would have a meeting with the British Prime Minister within a week or two of either taking office.  We should seek to have that tradition restored.</p><p>Last week, I set out my party&rsquo;s policy concerning Scotland and the fact that it must not be treated like a normal candidate country should it vote for independence and seek to retain European Union membership.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s presentation of the views of First Minister Sturgeon at the summit.</p><p>The objective of reducing corporation tax below 15% is a serious issue for Ireland.  A detailed study included in the latest ESRI quarterly review directly addressed the issue of the possible impact on Ireland of reductions in the British rate.  By the figures they produced, a reduction of over 5% in the British rate would potentially reduce investment in Ireland by non-EU firms by over one quarter.  What this figure might be following Brexit is unknown, but it will not turn from a major negative to a positive.  That reinforces the need for us to resist domestic and European voices calling for greater taxation of employers.  In this context, a message in forthcoming meetings should be that Brexit cannot be used as an excuse for resurrecting old demands to end national discretion in tax policy.</p><p>The ESRI study also demonstrated that the decision taken in 1997 to invest in research and build the knowledge base of the economy is central to Ireland&rsquo;s long-term prospects.  It is one area where we have the ability to create high value, high security employment.  The delayed and then rushed science strategy published before the general election contained many things but a financial commitment to a broad research community was not one of them.  We should note that the British science community, one of the strongest in the world, is in near panic over the impact of Brexit and we have to revisit this area.  We have to use research and innovation to increase our opportunities and limit the threats from Brexit.  That particularly applies to Northern Ireland where many companies currently applying for grants under Horizon 2020, for example, are in a very difficult if not hopeless situation in terms of the prospects of getting grants under that programme given the decision to leave the European Union.</p><p>In other business, the summit agreed to give more flexibility to Spain and Portugal in regard to meeting fiscal targets.  That is welcome.  The semester process cannot be allowed to degenerate into a crude and inflexible control mechanism which ignores economic reality.</p><p>Some have begun to lobby for the lifting of sanctions concerning the invasion and partition of Ukraine.  In all cases this is justified by business interests.</p><p>I hope the Taoiseach remains strong in opposing this.  There is no surer way towards more aggression against European states than to reward aggression by removing the limited penalties that have been applied.</p> <p> We need to request a shared initiative against the rising tide of intolerance and scapegoating that we are seeing in many countries.  Ireland should take the lead in pushing for greater solidarity and resolution in the face of an immediate threat to fundamental values.  Last week's summit set no definitive course.  September's summit should bring some greater clarity.  In the meantime, Ireland has no time to waste.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in campaigned vigorously for a Remain vote, and the North did vote to remain.  However, as a result of the vote in England and Wales, the entire island of Ireland now faces huge challenges, as acknowledged by many Members, the most serious challenges we have faced for many years.  During the referendum vote in the North, for the first time since the Good Friday Agreement, Unionists, republicans, Nationalists and others expressed a collective and definitive voice and said they wished to remain within the European Union.  That collective expression is momentous and should be heeded in light of the unique challenges a post-Brexit environment poses for Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am of the firm view that such challenges can only be overcome in the national interest if we think and act nationally.  That means on an all-Ireland basis, here at home and abroad.  That is why I wrote to the Taoiseach on Thursday, as well as to the First and Deputy First Ministers and to all political party leaders on the island, proposing the establishment of a national forum to discuss how the vote of the clear majority of citizens in the North - who want to remain in the EU - can be respected and defended, and how the unique challenges facing Ireland can be adequately addressed.  Speculation arose, directly from media interviews given by two Ministers, that this issue would be raised at the North-South meeting yesterday.  It now appears there was no tic-tac between the Government and the Northern Ministers before the meeting.  If this is correct it is extremely worrying.  The Taoiseach's current lack of clarity over the status of the proposal is also worrying.  I listened intently to the Taoiseach's answers to various questions today, but it is uncertain whether the Taoiseach will establish a national forum that will have island-wide participation.  He went from Government support for the proposal to a totally unclear position.  Surely he should not have been surprised by the DUP's response.  They may decide not to attend, but the DUP's rejection should not be allowed to stand in the way of the establishment of such a body.</p>  <p>  There will be enormous goodwill for a forum that seeks to defend the North&rsquo;s vote to remain and to protect the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement, its institutions and the two economies on this island - the very objectives that the Taoiseach quite rightly set out as the Government's objectives.  I have no doubt that civic Unionism and civic society in general will attend, along with representatives from our agriculture, agrifood, business, voluntary, community and other sectors.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on the entire apparatus of Government to work closely with the Executive to achieve maximum co-operation on all of the outworkings of the Brexit vote across this island.  There is also an onus on all of those people who claim to be republicans to do likewise.</p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader took the opportunity today to attack Sinn F&eacute;in's calls for a referendum on Irish unity.  He then went on to say that he hopes that people in the North will move to a pro-united-Ireland position.  He will need more than hope.  He would actually need to be working with us, and everybody else, whatever disagreement he may have with us, to try to bring about that aim.  The challenge is to rise above his own little personal party-political focus to work for the common good and in the national interest.</p>  <p>  There is a particular opportunity and imperative now, in light of some of the negative and dismissive voices coming from England, with regard to the Good Friday Agreement and, in particular, the human rights provisions that underpin much of it.  Let us be in no doubt whatsoever that the Good Friday Agreement is under threat.  Consider, for example, one of the candidates for the Conservative Party leadership, Michael Gove, MP, and his warped fantasies of British military victory over Nationalist and republican Ireland.  He argued for war instead of peace.  He has derided the Good Friday Agreement, opposed demilitarisation and opposed the reform of policing and justice in the North.  This record is from a man who wants to be the next British Prime Minister.</p>  <p>  There is a huge responsibility on us all to set differences aside, act together and act nationally in the time ahead.  It is also important to look at the current situation.  The First Minister lost the vote, yet she wants the North to leave the EU.  The Deputy First Minister won the vote - along with others - and he wants the North to have its vote upheld and defended.  After a good start for the Fresh Start agreement and the work done there, there is a crack emerging in the time ahead.  Let us not underestimate the difficulties that will present.  I would argue very strongly for the right of Ministers in the North to deal directly with the EU institutions and for the Taoiseach and the Government to support that proposition.</p>  <p>  I request that the Commission be asked to establish a fund to assist small Irish export businesses that may be destroyed by the consequences of Brexit.  Many of these businesses, as the Taoiseach is aware, are tied into contracts and may have to shut down if they do not receive assistance.  It took years to establish these export businesses, through austerity and all of its difficulties, and they currently employ a great number of people.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will raise this important issue with the Commission also.</p>  <p>  At the pre-Council statements two weeks ago I raised the issue of refugees. This is the third year of the current crisis and there appears to be no let-up in the numbers of refugees trying to reach Europe.  Today the Taoiseach said that discussions at last week's meeting were more limited than usual.  He also said that there had been progress on many measures.  However, a recent United Nations report says that more than 7,000 children took the central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Italy from January to June this year - more than double the number who did so during the same period in 2015.  How is that considered progress? Tragically, in the first six months of the year, more than 2,800 deaths were recorded in the Mediterranean.  For the whole of 2015 the number was 3,770.  Many of these deaths were of children.  As we sit here in the relative comfort of this Chamber, those figures are staggering when we contemplate them.  Some 96,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in Europe in 2015.  UNICEF has urged the EU to introduce measures to create a stronger process through which minors can find safety, and it also advocates for the reunion of children with family members.  We have to look to our Government to champion these refugees.  We cannot look to anybody else.  We must look to the Taoiseach to represent us and the unfortunate people who are fleeing conflict, prejudice and the danger of being discriminated against or killed.  There is no report on whether any of this was discussed at the Council meeting.</p><p>I also commend and thank the crew of the <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>, the naval vessel which completed its humanitarian mission in recent days.  It saved in excess of 1,250 people in the past 12 weeks.  That is the size of a small town.  The crew does incredible work and I am sure all of us here are very proud of the crew's efforts.  I also wish the crew of the <i>LE James Joyce</i>the very best as it sets out on a similar mission from Cork on Friday.  We have to work towards making these missions a thing of the past.  That should be our focus at these Council meetings and in our other engagements because while we all focus on Brexit, these issues are not in the media but they are happening.<br/><br/>I wrote to the Taoiseach two weeks ago about the ongoing plight of Ibrahim Halawa, who is still detained in Egypt, and asked him to raise this case with other European leaders.  He did not say in the course of his report whether he did.  Since then, the trial date has been postponed for a 14th time.  The Taoiseach knows Ibrahim should be at home with his family and friends.  Will he confirm that he raised Ibrahim&rsquo;s case at the European Council meeting?</p></speech>

He has clearly failed to do so and has failed to listen to the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and aid workers on the front line of the refugee crisis who deal with the consequences of this terrible deal.  It is a disgrace that the EU thinks Turkey is a so-called safe country of origin and is deporting asylum seekers back there.  Turkey&rsquo;s increasingly authoritarian government does not respect basic human rights, and refugees have been shot by the Turkish military on the Syrian border.</p><p>At the Council meeting, the Taoiseach discussed the European Commission&rsquo;s communication on a new partnership framework with third countries.  Is he aware that 104 European NGOs have signed a joint statement criticising this plan?  They are rightly concerned about the direction the EU is taking by making deterrence and return the main objective of the EU's relationship with third countries.</p><p>They have stated this approach will not only fail to &ldquo;break the business model&rdquo; of smugglers, but will increase human suffering as people are forced into taking more dangerous routes.  Moreover, despite the stated commitment to respect the principle of non-<i>refoulement</i>, there are no safeguards envisaged to ensure human rights, legal standards and protection mechanisms are in place.  As a result, people risk being deported to countries where their rights are not safeguarded.  Did the Taoiseach speak out against this plan?  Instead of blindly supporting it, he should have been calling for clear commitments to open up safe and regular channels to Europe for those in need of international protection and for other migrants.</p><p>Before this meeting, Sinn F&eacute;in wrote to the Taoiseach and called on him to raise Ibrahim Halawa&rsquo;s case with other European leaders.  Did he raise Ibrahim's case with them?  On 29 June, Ibrahim's trial was postponed for the 14th time, pushing it back until October at the earliest.  It is a disgrace.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy is clearly failing.  It is time the Taoiseach applied for a presidential decree on Ibrahim&rsquo;s behalf.  This decree would allow Ibrahim to return home before a final ruling has been made in his case, and is used in cases where a deportation or extradition would serve the so-called higher interest of the Egyptian state.</p><p>The presidential decree has always been available, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has refused to apply for it until the trial has been completed.  For the sake of Ibrahim&rsquo;s mental and physical well-being, the Taoiseach must act now.  News of such decisive action would give him some comfort while he lingers in an Egyptian prison cell.  The Taoiseach should also be canvassing other European leaders and enlisting their support for Ibrahim&rsquo;s release to ensure he is allowed return home to his family and his many loved ones.</p></speech>

There is pig-headedness in evidence already on both sides of this debate.</p><p>In their recent public comments, some of the most senior members of the Commission, Council and Parliament seem to have displayed the capacity of the Bourbons to learn nothing from history.  Despite the passage of time since the referendum and the opportunity for considered reflection that has been afforded us all, the thinking of some has become even more shallow and more simplistic.</p><p>If the members of Europe&rsquo;s political elite are to deserve the respect of those of us who send them there, who believe in the vision of Europe, they must give up on the sort of jockeying and grandstanding that remind us of schoolyard faction fights.  I said last week that the Union should not be a sheep pen into which people are corralled by fear of the consequences of leaving.  That is not the idealism that drove visionaries in the aftermath of two world wars to create this unique political entity in our lifetime.  The last thing we need now is a bully-boy determination not just to expel the British but to make their expulsion as immediate and draconian as possible &ndash; <i>pour encourager les autres</i>.</p><p>We still await clarity on several aspects but one thing is clear: Britain&rsquo;s political leadership is in no position to commence withdrawal negotiations right now.  That will not happen until there is at least one new party leader, a new Prime Minister and probably a reshuffled government with its members in command of their portfolios.  Until all that has happened, we will not know the settled aim of the British negotiations.  We need to know that and we need to afford the British the time to make that determination in a democratic way.  It is basic common sense, as well as basic decency, to allow the UK&rsquo;s internal politics to produce a leader with a mandate to negotiate and a clear strategy to follow.  That means waiting, quite possibly until the end of the year, before Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty is formally triggered.</p><p>The British government has accepted that it is under a democratic duty to give effect to the people of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision in the referendum.  Under Article 50, a member state that decides to withdraw must notify the European Council of that intention.  It provides that, in the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement that sets out the arrangements for its withdrawal, &ldquo;taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union&rdquo;.</p><p>The process has several stages.  First, the European Council, without the UK member, has to agree guidelines for negotiations.</p><p>It also seems clear that a second treaty is needed on the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Whatever settlement is negotiated has to be formally endorsed by the Council, acting by qualified majority vote, and a vote of the European Parliament.  It makes sense for everybody, including Ireland, that the withdrawal agreement and the treaty on the future relationship are closely linked, with the shortest transition and the least disruption that can be achieved.  We need to have a clear strategy to achieve that objective.  This needs the most careful planning and consideration.  There is no merit in rushing towards finality.<br/><br/>This is not a case where we need to defer to the founding six or the powerhouse three.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments last week, which he repeated today, namely, that negative views were expressed about the assumption that there is some subset of authority within the Council of Ministers.  That is eroding the principle of equality and undermining people's confidence in the EU to act in consort.  If there are such negative comments, they need to made more overtly for us all to hear.<br/><br/>Our country is a EU member state with full entitlements.  I repeat what I said last week.  If European values mean anything, they mean that right now our voice must be heard clearly, loudly and succinctly by all our European colleagues.  I reject a Europe where every state is notionally equal, but some quite clearly consider themselves more authoritative or equal than others.  We know why they want an early resolution of this issue, and one that is as harsh as it is immediate.  They want to hammer home the price of leaving because they think this will contain the risk of eurosceptic contagion.  Their thinking was summarised by Guy Verhofstadt writing in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>last week, who said, &quot;But if we&rsquo;re soft now with Britain, giving it too much wiggle room to extract favours and deals, we will only feed anti-European parties elsewhere in Europe and strengthen the belief of nationalists and populists that the European Union is a walkover&rdquo;.  He is the president of the ALDE grouping to which Fianna F&aacute;il is affiliated.  He probably had long discussions with Deputy Martin last week.<br/><br/>I had those discussions in the past.  Mr. Verhofstadt is a passionate European federalist.  In a peculiar way, he sees this as an opportunity.  It is almost as if there is an inner core belief that has no regard for European democracy.  My former working colleague, Minister Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, has changed his view on these matters post Brexit.  He understands a democratic mandate is required to advance such eurocentric views.<br/><br/>A Europe that hurriedly and badly mishandles the British exit will not win itself any new supporters among the European electorate.  I agree with the Polish Foreign Minister that the referendum result showed disillusionment with European integration and declining trust in the EU.  We must have cognisance of and do something about that.  We need politely to restrain Guy Verhofstadt and his like, with talk of Brexit not being a crisis but an enormous opportunity to re-examine Europe from its foundations and to build a more integrated Union, with stronger defence forces and a united foreign policy.  I take it that Deputy Martin made it clear that those sorts of views are not shared by very many in this House, including his sister party.<br/><br/>There is a very real risk for all of us.  If British withdrawal becomes a British expulsion, then the risk, by way of collateral damage, is that we will be flung from the centre of Europe to its frontiers.  The unthinking expectation seems to be that, like good Europeans, on behalf of the Union we would police the new frontier between a fortress Europe and a fortress United Kingdom, with the Union Jack flying over the border line.  Such a proposition is as dangerous as it is downright daft.  It is dafter than anything Donald Trump has in mind for his country&rsquo;s frontier with Mexico.<br/><br/>In Europe they talk about variable geometry.  We will all have to take out our compasses and protractors and go back to maths class to work out the geometry of this new frontier.  We are aiming to keep a frontier between the UK and this State that is permeable for Irish and British citizens.  Our objective is that there will be no hard border.  Meanwhile, our frontiers must be permeable to all EU citizens, while the UK&rsquo;s frontiers are supposed to be open to us but closed to the rest of Europe.  That is the challenge.  It will require patience, co-operation and compromise, and not raised voices and petulance, to work our way around this.<br/><br/>Our priorities are to protect the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement.  We need to ensure the transition for both institutions is as smooth and free from turbulence as our shared commitment and goodwill can make it.  Given that we are a member state in good standing, these are not just Irish or British-Irish priorities, rather they are European priorities.  They need to be highlighted in the European Council&rsquo;s negotiation guidelines.  Nothing less is acceptable for us.  I share the view expressed by Deputy Martin that we must be part of the European negotiating team because no country is as adversely affected by Brexit as us.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, if there is a delay in triggering Article 50 and if the European Union will not talk to the UK, formally or informally, until the process is triggered, there is nothing at all to stop this State from talking to both sides to highlight our concerns and to ensure they are fully accommodated in the eventual negotiations.  We need to start work now, not just bilaterally but trilaterally, on the new relationships between Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  We need to ensure we end up with the best institutional relationships to meet the needs of this State and this island.<br/><br/>The European Union does not have the support of the majority in the UK and the same might well be true elsewhere.  I agree with Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble when he admitted before the referendum that the British are not alone in their scepticism.  I also agree with Derek Scally&rsquo;s comment in <i>The Irish Times</i>today that Germany has a great talent for tin ear European diplomacy, most recently evidenced, as I said, by the exclusive invitation to the EU&rsquo;s six founding states, to the exclusion of others, to discuss Brexit.<br/><br/>On the one hand, we must welcome the concession that, in the face of rejection at popular level, this is not the time to call for further European integration and yet more pooled sovereignty.  More EU is not necessarily better EU.  On the other hand, German proposals for a return to a two-speed Europe, something that was tried a decade ago and rejected, are no solution.<br/><br/>Winning the citizens of Europe over to the European project requires two things.  First, it means a recommitment to democracy, openness, transparency and accountability.  Second, it means EU institutions and leaders addressing the problems pressing heaviest on their citizens, in particular stagnant growth and youth unemployment.  A Europe that does not recognise the dangers inherent in policies that sustain economic underachievement throughout the Continent will not win the support of the people.<br/><br/>As I have said before, a balance is required.  Mario Draghi and the ECB are doing their best, but monetary stimulus is no longer enough.  A corresponding fiscal stimulus is also required.</p><p>We cannot maintain a policy that seems grounded on only one principle, that member states must in no circumstances be allowed stimulate demand through additional taxes and expenditure.  This is a dangerous ideology posing as prudent housekeeping.  We need to debate this and to act.  Prolonged EU austerity can only do further damage to the political fabric of our Union.  Europe does not need a new project.  Right now it does not need further retrenchment or further integration.  Europe needs to recover its spirit and its purpose to serve its people, not to dictate their future.  The Union will survive and prosper if it shows it can meet the needs of its people right now.  This means more growth, more jobs, and genuine partnership in a Union of equals.</p></speech>

I would also ask how long Deputy Martin and other Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies will deny that the EU is right wing and racist.  I would also like to put another a more positive scenario arising from the Brexit result.  As somebody said in a post on Facebook, David Cameron is gone, Boris Johnson is gone, Nigel Farage is gone - who said this was all bad?  This is actually positive.  What we have in the Labour Party is essentially a struggle between the right wing, Blairite wing of the Labour Party, and the left, the more membership led section of the Labour Party.  They are doing battle for control of the Labour Party.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance and the Socialist Party support the growing movement against austerity and racism and we support moves to defend Jeremy Corbyn from those who are trying to oust him because this is a battle of ideas.  It is not a battle of personalities.  We convey our solidarity to him.  He was democratically selected by the membership, not by MPs, and they should have the final say.</p><p>Arising from Brexit, there is a real prospect of a left movement to challenge austerity and of a left Labour Party emerging probably from a split in the party.  It would mean two parties, but let them go.  Similarly with the Tories, there could be two Tory parties.  These are not necessarily negative developments.  In fact, from the point of view of people who want real change, who want the economy run in the interests of the majority, it is good if there is a left movement emerging in Britain around Jeremy Corbyn.  There is a real prospect of a general election being called, and the Labour Party winning that election with a left leader of the party, and that is a positive thing.</p><p>Also arising from Brexit, there has been an attempt to sully working class people and those in Britain who voted to leave the European Union as if they represented just one right wing and racist bloc.  Clearly, if one examines the statistics all across Europe, there is a movement against what the EU has become.  <i>The Telegraph</i>, which is not a radical socialist journal, contains an article which mentions that a tsunami of referendums is on the cards, with possibly 33 being called in the coming year, and not all of them from a right-wing perspective.</p><p>A recent survey by the Pew Research Centre found that only 38% of French people had a favourable attitude to the European Union while 62% had a negative attitude towards the European Union.  That is not accidental; it arises from the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 when it was made to pay in Europe for that crisis.  This seems not to be understood by the Government side.  An Ipsos MORI poll found that nearly half of voters in eight large European Union states want to be able to vote on whether to remain members of the bloc, with a third saying they would opt to leave, if given the choice.  Are all of these people right wing and racist all of a sudden?  In the case of France and Italy, that is far from the case.  In the case of France there is talk of a &quot;Frexit&quot;.  The discourse there is not to do with a right-wing trend, but with the fact that the anti-EU sentiment in France comes from the working class French electorate who feel the EU project is being hijacked by ultra liberal technocrats and they want to see it go the other way.  The French working class has shown its dissatisfaction with the EU through nationwide strikes, blockages and scenes of urban unrest.  It has made the comment that Brexit teaches a lesson to the whole of Europe that either we change it or we leave it.  I do not think the European Union can be changed.  We saw that in Greece last year with the humiliation that was heaped on it and the referendum of the people of Greece ignored by the EU leadership.  Similarly, in Italy, the Five Star Movement has said it wants Europe to be a community and not a Union of banks and lobbies.  It is very important that the Taoiseach and the Government understand that the movement now is away from the EU and what it has become and towards a return to democracy for real workers' rights, which the EU cannot provide.</p><p>I note also that NATO representatives were in attendance at the meeting held at the European Council.  The fact that NATO representatives sat in and took part in a meeting like that says it all.  After the meeting the European Council and NATO issued joint statements that there will be accelerated and practical co-operation between the EU and NATO in selected areas.  They called for further enhancement of the relationship in light of our common values and the unprecedented challenges from the south and the east.  What are those unprecedented challenges from the south?  They mean poor people from Africa and other countries who are trying to escape lives of poverty, but also lives of war that the EU is also involved in, stoking up and supporting and perpetuating.  That is what they mean when they talk about the terrible challenge.  I note that the Taoiseach was also at the European Council meeting near the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme where 1 million young people were slaughtered.  The European Council mentions these unprecedented challenges; so much for helping these people.</p><p>Regarding migration, the EU has now become an entity for preventing the poorest people on the planet from entering its borders.  That is racist.  Not only is it doing that, but it is boasting now instead - this is in the European Council report from Donald Tusk - that the sense of security in Europe has been restored because the numbers entering Europe from the Middle East is down to 50 a day as opposed to 7,000.  Where are those people being held?  They are being held in Turkey in the most horrific conditions, thanks to an agreement the EU signed with the country's Prime Minister, Mr. Erdoğan.  That is the EU that we see.</p><p>There was an establishment line of argument that the vote by the British people to leave the EU was racist, isolationist and xenophobic but what we are seeing across Europe is an anti-EU sentiment arising from the bailout and austerity programme inflicted since 2008 and 2009, and also an EU that has become anti-immigrant and put up fortresses against the poorest people in the world.</p></speech>

Sometimes when we are in the thick of it we do not recognise the dramatic and profound impact it is having on the world in a particular space and time and on world history.</p>  <p>  The UNHCR tells us that we are facing the most serious humanitarian crisis in terms of refugees of our time.  That is mainly in regard to the Syrian refugees but it also refers to Afghans, Iraqis and Iranians in the main.  People are coming from Africa also.  The EU report on migration lauds, to a certain extent, the deal done with Turkey and boasts that crossings from Turkey to the Greek islands have sharply decreased and have almost come to a halt.</p><p>What really bothers me about this kind of report is the sort of language they use about people who are fleeing war, famine, persecution, imprisonment, disappearance, rape, you name it - all sorts of torture, and all sorts of humanitarian reasons for tens of thousands - millions - of people to leave their own country.  Nobody really wants to get out of Syria, except that they face bombs being dropped from the air loaded with oil and petrol; they face Russian soldiers destroying their towns and cities, and, increasingly, killing their children and women, and destroying families.  That is why people leave.  If others could, they would also leave, like the Palestinians, who have been starved and isolated in the Yarmouk camp in Damascus.  There are lots of pockets of Syria that aid is not being brought to because, as we heard from a whistleblower from the United Nations who recently gave a presentation here, much of it is being diverted by the Assad regime away from where it is absolutely and fundamentally needed.</p> <p> This report from the European Union lauds the progress that has been made in holding back, corralling and containing some of the most desperate people on the planet.  It also refers to an action plan called the Valletta action plan.  We should remind ourselves that this is all about the European Union handing over vast chunks of money.  In the case of the Valletta action plan, which was agreed in Malta in late 2015, &euro;1.8 billion as a minimum was agreed to be handed over and shared between countries such as Algeria, Burkina Faso and Sudan.  The President of Sudan could not even attend the talks in Malta because there is an international arrest warrant out for him because of his human rights violations.  These are the types of country that the European Union is pouring funding into.  Similarly, Human Rights Watch has expressed grave concerns about new laws in Tunisia that imperil human rights and lack adequate safeguards against abuses.</p> <p> Many of us have spoken at length about our concerns about the deals done with Turkey and the EU money that is being given to it to corral, contain and imprison more than 3 million refugees.  That continues to be a concern, but I am afraid the EU is not concerned at all.  In fact, it lauds Turkey and says that there is fast operational return of migrants, that leverages are being used in development on trade and that this is a progressive European Union model.  I endorse and echo what has just been said by Deputy Coppinger.  Those who think for even a minute that the EU is a progressive entity that does wonderful things on behalf of the human race - and many of them are in Britain, because Britain has not faced a bailout in the same way we did, and the imposition of directives from Europe in the same way as we, the Greeks, the Spanish and the Portuguese did - should, for God's sake, look at its attitude to migration, immigrants and, as declared by Amnesty International, the most serious humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time.  The European Union is dealing with it as if refugees were bunches of animals, wild bison or something, to be corralled behind fences.  It is not even delivering on the commitment made under the EU-Turkey deal.  Instead, refugees in Greece are being sent back to Turkey, despite opposition by the refugees themselves and despite the fact that - as I saw with my own eyes recently on a visit to many of the refugee camps in the airport, stadiums and industrial states around Athens - the people of Greece are lauded by the refugees for their decency and their willingness to open their homes and give kindness to some of the most desperate people in the world.  This is despite the fact that these are the people being most hammered by austerity, cutbacks and bailouts.</p> <p> What we are witnessing is the rest of Europe beyond the boundaries of Greece - the richest part of the planet - turning its back on the poorest and most desperate parts of the world.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, could comment on this if he gets to speak on it: why in the name of God have we not even begun to fulfil even our meagre, miserable commitment to take in the 4,000 refugees we talked about taking in from Syria?  We are miles behind in doing it, yet we still have at least 250,000 empty properties in this country that could adequately house the people on the waiting lists, the homeless, the people who are screaming for accommodation and those who need it coming in from elsewhere.  Indeed, people in direct provision are probably being treated a little bit better than those in the camps in Turkey.</p> <p> This report from the European Union only confirms my conviction, and that of most people with a heart instead of a swinging brick, that the European Union is indeed completely racist and aggressive towards migrants seeking refuge, food, shelter and safety, many of whom are children.  What does that say about our European rulers, about the great Commission that the people of Britain have supposed to have turned their backs on?  It says everything about the inhumanity, the cruelty, the selfishness, the greed and the very good reasons why this Union as it exists should be broken up and a different kind of Europe put together, a Europe that puts people before profit.</p></speech>

Nobody really knows what will happen over the coming period while we wait for the British to initiate the Article 50 procedure, or what the outcome of negotiations will be during that period.  The only thing we and our Government can do is to ensure we put ourselves in a strong enough position to argue very strongly on an all-island basis that no hard borders be put in place and that trade on an all-island basis be allowed to continue.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to see the way the media has tried to stoke up hysteria around this whole situation over the last number of weeks.  On the way down here today I listened to the chairpersons of the chambers of commerce in Newry and in Dundalk talk about the impact on the exchange rate, how it is affecting their towns and how business can be done.  They did not want to get into any hysteria-raising on the part of Sean O'Rourke, who interviewed them.  They said that they had lived through this - and it is a fact that people in Border areas have lived constantly with exchange rate fluctuations and the differences that result.  Sometimes it is to the benefit of us in the South, and we get people coming from the North and shopping here.  Other times, probably most times, it has been to the benefit of traders in the North, with people going in the opposite direction to avail of the benefits there due to the exchange rate with sterling.  We need to be clear and keep a clear head.  The Government needs to put Irish interests first.  That is key.  We can be sure that every other member state in the European Union will put its interests first when it comes to the negotiations with the UK.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the UK does not have a trade surplus with any European member state.  In fact, Germany has a trade surplus with the UK of more than &euro;50 billion a year, so the Germans stand to lose a hell of a lot.  The UK is the second-biggest trade surplus it has, so it will not negotiate a deal that hammers Germany.  We are in a strong enough position in that every other member state stands to lose out substantially.  The Netherlands has a trade surplus of more than &euro;20 billion with the UK and France has a trade surplus of about &euro;9 billion.  It will not be in their interests to make sure that a hard border comes to pass.  We have to use that as one of our strengths in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  It will take a long time to analyse why so many people in the UK voted to leave the European Union, but when we look at it, we see that so many people have been left behind by neoliberal policies and the growth of the financial sector in England.  So many people in the north and outside the south-east have been left behind and seen their jobs go.  They were told during the campaign that a Brexit would affect the economy, but they looked at it and said, "It won't make any difference to us, because we've been left behind anyway and we're being punished by what's going on."</p><p> I personally do not believe that the European Union is reformable.  If, however, it is serious about reform, it has to work towards becoming a community of partners and not what it has developed into over the last six or seven years, where might is right and if one's economy is big enough one can dictate to other countries and impose one's will on them.  It has been rehashed here on a number of occasions how we were treated through our bailout.  If we look at how Greece, Spain and Portugal have been treated, we can see that it is a European Union of might which dictates.  If the EU is to be reformed, that has to change.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach gave us a summary of his contributions and participation at the European Council.  By his own account, the only intervention he made at the Council meeting was when he stressed that the Commission should follow through and seek to agree a TTIP deal with the United States.  He said this was a huge opportunity to set the standards of global trade for the next 50 years.  It certainly is.  It is a huge opportunity for transnational capital to take control of trade for the next 50 years and ensure that countries such as Ireland are kept under their firm control.  If that is the only input the Taoiseach can make into the Council, it is a sad reflection of where we will be at the end of these negotiations about the UK's leaving the EU.  </p> <p> In his summary of what happened, the Taoiseach did not mention that NATO representatives attended the Council and received the EU's global strategy on foreign and security policy.  It is interesting that he omitted to mention that fact and its potential impact.  We know from the report of the strategy that it calls for ever-closer integration in terms of military spending and policy across the EU member states.  I wonder what the Government's attitude is to that.  I think I know what the Government's attitude will be because it will say one thing here.  We know, however, that the Minister for Defence is attending the EU-NATO congress in Poland in the coming days, where a pact between the EU and NATO will be signed.  What will Ireland's role be concerning this ever-growing military union?  Will the Government outline what our role will be?  It is highly important and will be of great interest to many people across the country.</p></speech>

I would say there was a hell of a lot more talking done about it than that, but it gives one a glimpse behind the scenes.  There is no doubt that the Brexit referendum - born originally from David Cameron's arrogance, and obviously stirred up a fair bit by the lies of Nigel Farage and racism - has at the same time delivered an almighty kick to the European establishment.</p>  <p>  It would be completely wrong to categorise all of the Leave votes as being from the sort of jumped-up Little Englanders who just want to keep immigrants out.  The truth and depth of the multi-layered vote in that referendum shows that many of the Leave votes had their roots in a desire to see a change from austerity policies, neoliberalism and the deepening militarisation of the EU, which is a major cause of the crisis to be faced.  While there are clearly complexities in the situation for everybody, it would be wrong not to acknowledge that in a certain way the vote gives an opportunity to people who have looked in dismay at the direction in which the EU has gone.  It has departed from what many people believed were its original ideals of co-operation and harmony.  In fact, it has revealed its true nature, which has always been that of an institution to promote big business rather than the interests of the citizen.  Out of that came a common, pan-European concern about how the hierarchy is going on.  There are nuggets concerning how we can unite with our fellow Europeans to try to develop a better Europe.</p>  <p>  Apart from the points about TTIP and militarism, to which Deputy Pringle referred, and the unspoken Brexit, the issue of migration and refugees was the key topic and the biggest challenge facing the EU.  Yet again the response of the Council meeting seems calculated to make the situation worse, rather than better.  That is because the focus again is entirely on border controls as the answer, yet we should know by now that that policy has been in place up to now and has not worked.  If we want to stop the tide of refugees, we should stop interfering in their countries and stop the drive towards militarisation.  In an Irish context, we must stop facilitating the US military through the use of Shannon Airport.  Border controls certainly do not work.</p>  <p>  I have referred previously to humanitarian visas and I want to hammer home that point.  I simply cannot understand why this approach is not being used to deal with the current situation.  A system of humanitarian visas would allow refugees to get to Europe safely, legally and cheaply using regular planes and boats.  They could apply for visas via consulates in their own countries or in third countries.  They would not then have to crowd into dinghies, risk drowning and give over their life savings to people smugglers.  I find it quite incredible, however, that we chose not to allow for a system of humanitarian visas.  It is true that Europe already has a humanitarian visa system of sorts, but the visas are issued at the discretion of individual states and there is no EU-wide scheme for issuing them.  I would like to know what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach have done to promote that idea.</p>  <p>  There is an incredibly sickening irony in the fact that, since the war in Syria broke out, the number of humanitarian visas issued by all the Schengen member states has fallen dramatically rather than rising, which is what one would think would happen in response to a humanitarian crisis.  We could have a role to play in this.  Given that we are not part of the Schengen area, we would have considerable scope to be more generous in our humanitarian visa system without having to obtain agreement from all the other EU member states.</p>  <p>  There is no point in whingeing about smugglers when our inaction is a key reason people traffickers are thriving.  People smuggling is big business.  In Turkey alone last year, a crude estimate put the smugglers' revenues at approximately &euro;800 million.  To put that in context, the entire EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for seven years is just over &euro;3 billion.  So the &euro;800 million that was sweated from the life savings of refugees and their families left behind is enriching an industry.  What is the EU's response?  We hear that it has declared war on the smugglers, which is just about as successful as the war on drugs.  What we are really doing is turning human beings into contraband.  First of all we help to bomb their homes and then when they flee we try to treat them like an illegal shipment of drugs or cigarettes seized at Dublin airport.  They are grabbed by customs, photographed and slung into a lock-up.  It simply is not good enough.</p>  <p>  The conclusions of the European Council meeting included a statement on the need to provide continued support to the western Balkan countries in their fight against smugglers and to remain vigilant about potential developments regarding other routes to facilitate rapid and concentrated action.  It seems to me that the EU has undoubtedly lost its way and its humanity in dealing with this situation. </p>  <p>  We should consider the experience of a surgeon, David Nott, who spent a lot of his time in Syria setting up a network of secret hospitals as a result of the bombing of hospitals there.  To conclude, I will read Nott's description of the aftermath of a barrel bomb attack in Syria.  As Deputies listen to this, they should remember that the money being given to Frontex, the EU's border security agency, has increased every year since the outbreak of war in Syria.</p><p>Research and development funds to the tune of &euro;230 million across 39 programmes have been dedicated to EU research to keep refugees out, with much of this money going to companies like Airbus, BAE and so on who all members of the European Security Research Working Group.  These are the manufacturers whose bombs have driven these people out of their homes.  It is a win-win on the double for them in terms of their being paid to bomb these countries and then later being paid for providing the security to keep them out.  In relation to one incident, Mr. Nott states:</p><blockquote>When barrel bombs fall on homes, they often send entire families to the ward. One day, five siblings arrived. Unable to treat any of them, Nott started filming the scene, so that he would have proof, he said, of &ldquo;how terrible it was.&rdquo; A baby with no feet let out a stifled cry, then died. An older brother lay silently nearby, his guts coming out. In the next room, a toddler with blood on his face shouted the name of his dying brother. Two medical workers carried in the fourth brother, who was about three years old. His pelvis was missing, and his face and chest were gray with concrete dust. He opened his eyes and looked around the room, blinking, without making a noise. There were wet, white blobs on his face, and Nott gently wiped them away. When the sister was brought into the room, he learned that a concrete block had fallen on her head, and the blobs were pieces of her brain.<br /><br />The boy was dying. There was no treatment; he had lost too much blood, and his lungs had filled with concrete particles. Nott held his hand for four agonizing minutes. &ldquo;All you can do is just comfort them,&rdquo; he told me. I asked him what that entailed, since M1 had exhausted its supply of morphine. He began to cry, and said, &ldquo;All you can hope is that they die quickly.&rdquo; </blockquote><p>This is what the people are running from in Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iraq and we put the borders up.  It is absolutely disgusting.</p></speech>

Ireland is a small nation that depends a great deal on Europe.  Any further break up of the European Union could seriously impact on Ireland's future.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a small nation surrounded by water, with no road access to mainland Europe.  I call on the Taoiseach, Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and our MEPs to tackle the European Commission and officials to ensure that Ireland gets vital concessions and to protect Ireland's interests.  We need our experts working to their maximum to ensure a seamless transition of Britain from the Europe Union such that our agriculture, manufacturing and tourist industries are protected.  The survival of our nation is at a crossroads.  Trade between Ireland and the UK could be reduced by 20%.  The proposal by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Osborne, to cut corporation tax there to 15% will affect Ireland in that it may result in industries choosing to set up in the UK rather than Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The issue of whether payments to farmers will be maintained under the CAP is one of the most commonly asked questions of me at my constituency clinic.  Another question is whether Britain not contributing to the finances of Europe will make a difference to CAP payments.  Farmers will be hit on the double because the value of sterling will fall and manufacturing and agricultural exports will be worth 10% less.  Freedom of movement of our people to and from the UK cannot be made difficult or cumbersome or in any way restrictive.  For more than 100 years people from Ireland have travelled to England for work to get money to help rear their families in this country.  Currently, many people travel to work in the UK on a weekly basis to get money to provide for their families in Ireland.  We cannot allow any travel restrictions or obstacles to be put in their way.</p>  <p>  We do not want Border checkpoints or friction with our good neighbours in Northern Ireland.  Relations between us have been running smoothly since the checkpoints were removed and we want this to continue.  At the same time, we need to ensure that we do not take in more immigrants or refugees than we can afford or house.  I have nothing against refugees but we can only house so many of them.  As Members will be aware, many of our own people cannot find homes and are sleeping in the streets, with little headway being made in that regard.  </p>  <p>  What will happen if Holland or any of the Baltic countries decide to leave the European Union?  Do we have a plan B?  I suggest that an all-party committee be established, comprising Deputies with expertise in marketing, taxation, business, agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing and trade.  As I said, free movement of our people in and out of the UK is important.  The people of Ireland do not want to leave the European Union at this stage but if more countries were to leave and if the European Union were to make things difficult for Ireland in terms of our being unfairly regulated or restricted in our trading or exports, Ireland would have to consider its position.  We need a plan B to deal with these eventualities.  Who would have thought when we were a few short months ago that the UK would leave the European Union.  Even though we knew the referendum was going to take place, we never believed the UK would leave the European Union but it has done so.  As that could trigger other countries to do likewise, we need to have a plan B in place.</p></speech>

The meeting of the Heads of State last week was one of the most important leaders' meeting in a long time in the context of the perilous situation in which Ireland finds itself following on from the UK referendum decision.  To say that we were surprised at the outcome would be an understatement.  While we respect people's right to vote in whatever way they wish, the decision has dangerous, knock-on consequences for Ireland in the context of its proximity to the UK and it being our nearest and largest trading partner.  Our daily lives are affected by the UK market, sterling and how the UK economy is fairing.  I cannot see the UK fairing any better following on from this decision and for that reason I am concerned about the knock-on effects for Ireland, particularly our farming and manufacturing sectors.</p>  <p>  Since the referendum result, I have met with the leaders of many of the farm representative organisations on a number of occasions.  They are extremely fearful for the beef sector.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will be aware of what is happening in our dairy sector and how dairy farmers are losing money every day of the week.  This decision is further destabilising that situation.  It is certainly doing nothing to help it.  I am concerned about whether our farms will be financially viable into the future because of the way the markets are going. </p><p>Anyone involved in manufacturing in this country, particularly small and medium-sized manufacturing, is terribly reliant on their exports to Great Britain every day and the way that trade determines how many people will be at work in Ireland.  Thousands of jobs will be on the line if we do not steer this ship very studiously and carefully.  It takes the Government working with the Opposition and all of us to ensure that we do everything to protect our nation's interests at this crucial time.  As my brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, rightly stated, we are where we are now but where will we be in another year's time or two or three years' time after the triggering of Article 50?  What if other countries start to look at themselves?  What would the situation in Europe be if France decided to pull out tomorrow morning?  The cumulative effect of this could be disastrous in the future so we must be terribly careful about how the situation is handled.  </p> <p> I firmly believe that the reason the vote went the way it did was because people were fearful of the migration issue.  That was the way it was sold in Great Britain.  This is way I would put it because to me, that was not what it was really about.  We must be careful to make sure that we only have people here for whom we can cater because we cannot cater for Irish citizens or people from abroad who are on waiting lists for accommodation.  We cannot take care of the people who are here.  Why would we want to open up for more when we cannot take care of those we already have?  If we have our own house in order, we can do whatever we like afterwards.  </p></speech>

The meeting of the Heads of State last week was very important.  Europe must take some of the blame.  The European project was a noble one and I salute its leaders and architects.  I remember the canvassing for entry back in the 1970s and the different referenda since then.  However, it has become too bureaucratic, powerful and rigid.  It has serious impacts, including impacts on democracy.  People are shocked by what has happened in Great Britain.  While we were all worried, I thought that it would swing back after the merciless slaying of that wonderful MP, Jo Cox, but that did not happen.  People who opposed it ran like scalded cats.  The main people opposing it have exited the stage.</p>  <p>  I attended a Derry-Monaghan wedding in Monaghan at the weekend.  People were dismayed and frightened and wonder whether the Border would come back.  Will there be a land border - a physical border - because people find it hard to see anything else if Article 50 is triggered by the next British Prime Minister?  There is a very dangerous vacuum at the moment.  The election is ongoing and different candidates are talking about the different things they are going to do.  We do not know what they will do when they are elected.  There is a very dangerous vacuum and we want certainty.  Like colleagues and previous speakers, I met the IFA, the ICMSA, other groups and individual farmers and they are hugely concerned about CAP payments.  Farms are not viable without those payments.  I know the Minister and the Taoiseach have built up good contacts over the years so, hopefully, they will stand Ireland, which is a small exporting country, in good stead in order that we will keep our markets and flagship food companies like Glanbia and the Kerry Group will be able to continue exporting and providing jobs here.  </p>  <p>  I do not know whether the First Minister in Northern Ireland is trying to imitate the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, with her "out, out, out" stance.  People in Northern Ireland are amazed at the DUP.  I know the people voted and some people in parts of Northern Ireland voted very strongly to stay in.  They are amazed at the First Minister's intransigence and tough talk.  I spent the last two days at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  The Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy O'Donovan, addressed it on Tuesday morning and his words went down very well.  There is huge anxiety across the board among all the Members of Parliament from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Jersey.  People are very concerned and we need to tread carefully and build up and draw upon the relationships we have built up over the years.  Whatever they do needs to be done pretty soon with a roadmap charted out because the uncertainty is dangerous.  </p>  <p>  While some people say we might make some capital out of that, we do not want to make capital out of somebody else's misfortune.  We may get some direct investment through companies moving here because of tax rates but we do not want that either.  We want stability and to continue as we are.  We want to have our place and have our Ministers and people listened to when they look for help, breathing space and derogations.  I am not saying we should get derogations willy-nilly but we should get derogations for some measures that are having a draconian effect here.  In respect of the nitrates directive, slurry spreading in Northern Ireland could be divided by a railing in the one field.  One could spread slurry on one side of it on a certain calendar date but not spread it on the other side.  These anomalies are silly.  They seem to be too rigid to understand the complexities of those issues.  The bureaucrats got too big for their boots in some ways.  We need to examine pay scales for bureaucrats and all the un-elected people over there.  It has become a bit of a gravy train and needs to be examined as well.  </p></speech>

We see that the UK economy is already showing signs of some damage.  We have also seen warnings from the UK Government that it will look to reduce spending on public services so it is already beginning to see some economic turbulence.  Obviously, if it disinvests in public services, it will see social damage as well.</p>  <p>  We have already started to see some economic damage in Ireland.  Billions were wiped off companies listed on the ISEQ.  The figure on the first day after Brexit was approximately &euro;10 billion.  A total of 40% of trade between indigenous Irish companies and the world is between Ireland and the UK so &euro;2 in &euro;5 that Irish companies trade globally is traded with the UK.  </p>  <p>  We also know that UK tourists account for about one quarter of all spend by foreign visitors to Ireland.  Last year, UK citizens made 3.5 million trips to Ireland so the fall in sterling and its volatility, both of which are likely to continue, and the general rise in uncertainty relating to the UK globally, within the UK and in Ireland are not just likely to start affecting Irish businesses very quickly, they are likely to hit tourism in Ireland almost straightaway this summer.  </p>  <p>  While there has been a lot of talk about the damage to the UK and the potential damage to Ireland, there has not been very much talk about the damage to the EU itself.  It is as if the EU and the European project are somehow divorced from the UK's decision to leave.  The European project is important.  I consider myself to be a proud European.  The European project has helped secure decades of peace in Europe.  We lead the way globally in areas like human rights, international development and climate change.  </p><p>The European project must succeed but it is losing its way.  During the banking crisis the institutions of Europe hung Ireland out to dry.  Threats were made to our economy by the ECB and Jean-Claude Trichet talked about a bomb going off in Dublin.  At every stage of the troika programme Ireland had either the worst or joint worst deal when it came to borrowing terms, interest rates and so forth.  When Ireland needed solidarity, we were treated very badly.  There is also a growing democratic deficit in the European Union.  In 2004 we saw the fiasco of the so-called European constitution.  The people of France and the Netherlands said no to it so they changed its name, said it was no longer a constitution but a treaty and the people's vote did not matter anymore.  We were asked to vote on it twice.</p> <p> During the economic crisis, we saw Germany move further into the centre in terms of calling the shots in the eurozone when it came to Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and so forth.  More recently, we have seen a small number of the large countries, including France and Germany, become more and more central to European policy.  The day after Brexit, we saw the six founding members come together, have a press release and photo call and essentially speak with the voice of the European Union about what was happening with the UK.</p> <p> The European Union is undoubtedly poorer without the people of the United Kingdom in it.  If lessons are not learned, the European Union is likely to find itself not just without the UK but potentially without other members as well.  We are now seeing calls in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Sweden and other EU countries to hold referendums similar to that in the UK.  Brexit was partly about immigration but really it was about a disconnect between the European project and the people of the UK, who are European citizens.  This disconnect and sense of disempowerment can be seen all over the place.  We see it in the rise of ultranationalism - in Golden Dawn in Greece, the Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland party in Germany, the National Front in France, the True Finns party in Finland and the Freedom Party of Austria.  These are all on the rise because the European project is not bringing all its citizens along.  It is becoming more and more a project for special interests - a project for the haves rather than the have-nots.  That disconnect and democratic deficit is what led people in the UK who feel disempowered to vote to leave the European Union.</p> <p> The Taoiseach referred to regret.  He said when he was at the Council meeting there was a sense of regret among the Heads of State of the European Union members.  Regret is irrelevant.  What is needed is reflection followed by action.  I have here the six-page statement from the European Council which covers immigration, border controls and a lot of different things.  The final item on it, No. 9, is "Outcome of the UK referendum".  In a six-page document, the only thing the European Council has to say about the outcome of the UK referendum is, "The UK Prime Minister informed the European Council about the outcome of the referendum in the UK."  There is nothing in there about lessons that have been learned or that need to be learned.  There is nothing about a period of reflection or the rise of ultranationalism in the European Union.  What is needed is a clear understanding of how the European Union needs to learn the lessons and follow a model that is inclusive both socially and economically.</p> <p> The Taoiseach stated that Brexit highlighted a crisis of confidence in the EU and in politics and institutions around the world, and I agree with him.  He is absolutely right.  I say to the Minister, Taoiseach, Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, let us act accordingly.  If we recognise that Brexit is the result of a crisis of confidence in the EU and political institutions globally, let us build confidence in the EU and political institutions globally.  Let us commit to no more regressive budgets, no more tax cuts and commit to investing instead in indigenous business and in giving every child the opportunity to achieve their potential.  Let us commit to calling out the lack of transparency and special interest that appear to be involved in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Ireland has limited influence when it comes to the European Union.  We are one of 28 members and we are a small member.  We can act in a manner that demonstrates how to rebuild confidence.  Why do we not change our economic policy?  Why do we not change our social policy to demonstrate that the choice is not between economic strength or a decent society, or economic strength and a decent society, but that economic strength and a decent society make each other stronger?  Why do we not change our approach and build a republic that demonstrates the advantages of economic strength and a decent society to show how a more globalised world can benefit all citizens and not just the few?</p></speech>

It is not like "A Midsummer Night's Dream" but a midsummer night's nightmare.  Some of the characters involved are like the characters of that Shakespeare play.  Thinking of Boris Johnson, who could play Bottom, never have the lines been so apt, "I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me" and "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"</p>  <p>  We all have a problem in the Union as a result of the decision because there is no easy way out of this mess that everyone is in now.  There is no easy negotiating position for the UK Government to take which will necessarily lead to an outcome that is good for either the Union, Ireland or the United Kingdom.  It seems to me that the negotiation difficulty arises from what has been much debated - the trade-off that some people are looking for between access to trade and free movement of people.  I do not believe, as the Taoiseach said earlier today, that the trade-off can be allowed within the treaties.  I was shocked and surprised to hear the shadow finance minister of the Labour Party in the UK when he seemed to indicate that it might be a good deal for labour.  How could it be a good deal for the left to have a world in which capital is able to move at great speed, has full flexibility and full power of manoeuvre, which gives it real negotiating strength, and at the same time restrict the ability of labour to move, which would weaken its bargaining position?  It makes no sense to me for the left to be arguing for such a position.  We need to recognise that part of the reason - perhaps the main reason - the vote went the way it did is because people were fearful that new people coming into the country would bring down wages and weaken the power of labour in the host country.  The way to tackle that is through better standards and better minimum wage rates, not just to capitulate to capital, which is what that section of the Labour Party seems to be doing at present in trying to advance the interest of capital, with no commensurate power for labour.</p>  <p>  I was concerned by the Taoiseach's speech that we would not put ourselves on the other side of the argument.  He said in his speech earlier today that one of the interventions he made in the European Council was that we should immediately advance the TTIP negotiations.  I do not know how that is possible.  Where would the United Kingdom be in such a renegotiation of TTIP or the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada?  The British Government seems to have three possible choices.  It may decide to place itself in that sphere with Canada, Mexico or Lord knows where and try to trade with the rest of Europe from such a third party position.  I do not think that would suit the UK or Europe.  That is one of the options it has.  The second option is to try to do a deal similar to the Swiss one and arrange a whole range of bilateral arrangements with the European Union.  It seems bound to fail because of the lack of freedom of movement which was central to the recent Swiss referendum.  It would run into similar problems in the UK.</p><p>The third option, if they wanted to go with a Norway-type model which the Taoiseach seemed to indicate might be one of the options that is looked at, brings real difficulties because it requires the UK to accept all the standards of the Union without the power to frame them.  There are no easy options and there is no easy way out.</p> <p> At a later stage, we will be able to ask questions.  One question I have is on what is the role of the European Parliament when it comes to the negotiation of a new relationship.  I understand the Parliament obviously has a position in terms of having to agree on the exit, but is it only the European Council which agrees the new negotiation arrangements?  I presume it must be because, if it is done on the basis of unanimity, I presume the Parliament would not be able to be involved because it would obviously not be able to work in such a way.  I would be interested if the Minister's officials could forward the details of that technical aspect of it.  What is the role of the European Parliament in the new relationship?</p> <p> One confusing aspect of this I have heard over the past few days from the Government, which is also contained in the Taoiseach's speech today, is the two slightly different contradictory messages.  The Government, on the one hand, rightly states that the ongoing uncertainty will kill investment decision-making which will lead to recession in the UK which, as sure as eggs are eggs, will affect our economy.  This will make the political system worse because a divided people will be more angry so there is a case for trying to do whatever they want to do quickly but at the same time, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach and others rightly state that we should not rush this and we should give them time.  What exactly is the timeline we are thinking of?  If the UK will see a new Prime Minister coming from the Conservative Party in the coming month or two, do we believe that the pulling of the trigger on negotiations should wait until 2017 or do we believe that should take place in the autumn?  I am sorry to get down to minutiae of technical details but I believe the effect of the lack of certainty on the economy and, indeed, on public confidence, will only get worse because of this disastrous decision, as I see it.</p> <p> As Deputy Donnelly stated, we should stand up for a Union which has economic values that both respect labour and are enterprising.  We should position our country in that way in all the talks.  I look forward to working with the Government in whatever way we in the Opposition can to try to rescue us from what is a bad place for all concerned.</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il and Seanad have been in place for some weeks now and it was important to get that committee in place.  We need to begin our deliberations on that committee as soon as possible, with Brexit being on the top of the agenda.</p>  <p>  That committee was beefed up following the rejection of the Lisbon treaty referendum on the first occasion.  It was given more powers because of the substantial amount of legislation coming from Europe and the lack of scrutiny taking place there.  This question and answer session was also in response to the Lisbon treaty rejection, and also the Taoiseach coming in before a European Council meeting to report to the House.  All those developments are particularly welcome.</p>  <p>  I have a couple of questions.  At this stage, what is the position on an all-island forum?  There has been much discussion this afternoon during questions to the Taoiseach and, subsequently, in this debate.  It is quite incredible that the Taoiseach did not run this idea past the First Minister over the weekend.  Then it came as a surprise to everybody when she rejected it.  Obviously, it should not have been a surprise.  I really would like to know what will happen now.  What mechanism will be put in place to ensure that the interests of all parties on this island are protected and what mechanism will be put in place to engage with stakeholders, social partners, civic society, etc.?  Can the forum proceed without the DUP, and, if not, what framework will be put in place?</p>  <p>  With the UK leaving the European Union, we have lost a vital ally in respect of a range of issues.  I assume the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, was at the European Council meeting together with the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have concerns about the future of the common travel areas, the possible erection of trade barriers, the possible introduction of cross-Border controls and the peace process.  Did any bilateral meetings take place at the European Council meeting between the Taoiseach and other European leaders and did the Taoiseach manage to gain support for the Irish position and to convey the view that this is a particular item of concern to Ireland?</p>  <p>  What was the prevailing view regarding the need to reform the EU institutions?  Several speakers here this afternoon have spoken about the democratic deficit, the disconnect between the citizens of Europe and the European Union institutions, and the fact that the European Union procedures are bureaucratic.  There is certainly a need for better delivery on key issues, particularly on youth employment, the refugee crisis and sluggish growth.</p></speech>

Should it be punished - should there be a punitive response - or should it be treated fairly, which would be in Ireland's interest as well?  Several bureaucrats have put forward the view that it should be treated harshly, and reference was made to that here today.  We would not support that.  I am merely wondering what the view of the European Council was in general in that regard.</p></speech>

There was a preliminary discussion on its implications for the European Union, in the short and in the longer term.  Indeed, it is true that the outcome has highlighted something of a crisis of confidence, not only in the European Union but in politics throughout the western world.</p>  <p>  The Council agreed that the Union needs to reflect on current matters in a way to ensure that new ways are found to connect better with its people, acknowledging some failings, addressing these failings and, ultimately, delivering concrete results.  Rather than setting new ambitious goals, it is important that the Union reflects on issues that have already been promised in areas such as the Single Market, investment, security and counter-terrorism.  These continue to be the building blocks of long-term prosperity and stability for everybody.</p>  <p>  On the matter of the approach of the Government towards the negotiations, it is early days yet.  The situation in the UK is such that it is most unlikely that the Article 50 mechanism will come into force soon.  It is important that we reflect now on the current position within the United Kingdom and the need to ensure that there is a Government and a Prime Minister, and that will become clear over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we have prepared as best we can.  We have our contingency framework.  It maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  Already, the Government has published a summary of its key actions.</p>  <p>  I accept the area is challenging.  There will be full discussion among the various parties here in the House.  I welcome the comments of Deputy Haughey on the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I assume that committee will have an important role to play in this issue.</p>  <p>  The Government will be responding by way of ensuring that our contingency plan will be ready in time for the negotiations.</p><p>It is fair to say there will be no negotiations until after the service of the Article 50 notice.  We cannot be certain in speculating on when the notice will be served; some people say it will be the autumn and more say it will be early next year.  In the meantime, both the Taoiseach and I are engaged bilaterally with our European partners.  I have already been speaking to my colleagues, the foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Germany, France and Britain, in the first instance.  I intend to travel to Germany on Friday to meet the German foreign Minister, Mr. Steinmeier, and the Taoiseach has similarly undertaken a number of visits.</p> <p> With respect to the all-island forum, I had a very constructive meeting last week on behalf of the Government with the Northern Ireland party leaders, including the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  It is important that every effort be made in conjunction with the party leaders in Northern Ireland to ensure our priorities are at the heart of the process.  Our priorities include the common travel area and the current invisible Border.  It is important that every effort be made on behalf of everybody in the House - I acknowledge the leadership role on the part of the Government - to reach out to all parties and stakeholders, beyond the specific arena of politics, to ensure our priorities are well ordered and well negotiated in the months and years that lie ahead.</p></speech>

It commits the European Union to the promotion of peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  I welcome that the strategy encompasses both foreign and security policy, taking in a global perspective.  I assure the House that Irish concerns have been taken on board to a large extent in the document.  The strategy has no implications for Ireland's military neutrality, which is confirmed in the legally binding protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  It sets out interesting ideas and important proposals, which we must take time to consider carefully before moving forward.  This is really important in the context of the decision of the United Kingdom to depart from the European Union.  The conclusions make clear that any implementation of this new strategy will be negotiated and agreed with member states.</p></speech>

The statement by the European Council states: "The European Council today adopted an agenda calling for swift and determined progress: ... to create the right conditions for stimulating new business opportunities by: ... ensuring very high-capacity fixed and wireless broadband connectivity across Europe, which is a precondition for future competitiveness."  The Cabinet made a very bad decision today to privatise the future national broadband network.  At the Council meeting or in conversations, has any pressure been placed on Ireland to make a decision to privatise the network rather than keeping it in public ownership, as a strategic asset should be?</p>  <p>  In the Minister's conversations with other foreign Ministers regarding Brexit, is there an acceptance that Ireland may very well need its own bilateral agreements with the UK, which may supersede general UK-EU negotiations after the serving of the Article 50 notice?</p></speech>

The Cabinet took a decision today, following consideration of a number of options, to proceed by way of a national plan.  I am sure the D&aacute;il will have the opportunity to discuss this at an early date.  I have no knowledge of any European influence on or engagement in this decision.  The Acting Chairman will forgive me if I defer to my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, on the issue.  I understand provision is being made for an early debate on the issue and I am sure there will be an opportunity for Deputies to raise this on Question Time as well.</p>  <p>  We have not, at the level of the Foreign Affairs Council, had the opportunity to discuss the issue of the referendum vote in the United Kingdom.  Our next meeting is scheduled for Monday week in Brussels.  My assumption, not having seen the agenda, is that the issue will feature.  In the meantime, in the context of my bilateral engagement with foreign Ministers, as well as the Taoiseach's engagement with European Heads of State and Government, which he relayed to me, Ireland's priorities are being clearly set out.  One of these is the matter of our long-standing relationship and engagement with the United Kingdom through the common travel area.  It is important that this form a priority in terms of the ultimate settlement negotiations with the United Kingdom.  There is also the issue of the Border, as was mentioned earlier by Deputy Haughey.  These are really important strategic national issues for us and we will continue to highlight them at every opportunity prior to the negotiations and, ultimately, in the course of those negotiations.  In the meantime, we wish to impress on our colleagues the core nature of the issues and the unique status of the island of Ireland in the context of the European Union, with particular reference to the peace process.</p></speech>

It does not by any means alter our membership position within the European Union.  I do not envisage any circumstances under which we would give consideration to leaving the Union.  The corporation tax rate referred to by Brian Hayes, MEP, is of course a national competency in any event.  It is not in any way influenced by our membership of the European Union.  The answer to the question is "No."</p></speech>

That acknowledgement has been forthcoming, particularly in my own bilateral engagement.  I have not, at this stage, spoken to all my EU colleagues.  I understand from the Taoiseach that he has impressed upon Heads of State and Government the priority of Ireland's engagement and preparedness for the forthcoming negotiations, the peace process, and the common travel area.  There is a broad level of understanding among our EU partners.  Obviously that will intensify as the negotiations proper get under way.</p><p>In respect of the North-South ministerial bodies, I acknowledge a very important and constructive meeting yesterday of the North-South Ministerial Council, the first since our election here and since the elections north of the Border.  There was an agreed approach in the form of a ten-point plan, where we agreed to intensify our relationship further and work more closely together over a range of Departments<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and issues of mutual benefit such as health, education, trade and agriculture.

As the Taoiseach has mentioned, I will focus my remarks on the items covered at the summit under the heading of external relations.</p>  <p>  The European Council adopted conclusions on Libya, where the situation remains most fragile.  There has been some welcome progress since the signing of a political agreement in December, but the Government of national accord still has to be fully endorsed.  The conclusions are quite clear.  All groups must work with the Government of national accord as the sole legitimate government in Libya.  This is necessary to restore stability and face the many challenges that are present there.  The European Union continues to stand ready to support Libya.</p>  <p>  The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, made a presentation to the European Council on the new EU global strategy on foreign and security policy.  The presentation was welcomed by the European Council.  The previous strategy was published in 2003.  There have, of course, been profound changes in the international context in which we now operate.  Ireland was actively engaged within the European Union in the process of consultation on the new strategy.  Irish perspectives and concerns have been taken on board to a large extent in the document.  I refer to my comments earlier on this matter in response to Deputy Pringle.  The High Representative, the Commission and the Council have been invited to take the work forward and we would be happy to keep the House informed of developments in this regard.</p>  <p>  In respect of EU-NATO affairs, the European Council agreed that in light of new security challenges, there should be further practical co-operation between the European Union and NATO in certain areas, including in respect of hybrid threats, which cross the boundary between military, policing, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and other dimensions.  Twenty-two EU member states are members of NATO and strongly wish to see such co-operation develop.  However, the conclusions contain clear confirmation that future EU-NATO co-operation will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of member states.  We were to the fore, therefore, in insisting that these long-standing guarantees, already enshrined in the treaty, be clearly reiterated.  There is a strong acknowledgement that Ireland's policy of neutrality and non-NATO membership will in no way be adversely affected by the enhanced co-operation.</p>  <p>  The European Council also heard from the Dutch Prime Minister on the outcome of the ballot in his country in April on the EU association agreement with Ukraine.  Dutch voters voted against the agreement in an advisory referendum.  The Council has now been invited to seek a solution addressing the concerns raised by voters.  This is expected to be done as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  On the relationship between the UK and the EU, as the Taoiseach has already said, the majority of the European Council's time was given over to the outcome of the UK's referendum on membership of the European Union.  As is well understood in this House, although the outcome was not what we had hoped for, contingency planning has been in progress for some time and a contingency framework is firmly in place.  We are now working to define our interests further and to ensure these are well understood by our EU partners in the time ahead.  As the Taoiseach set out at the European Council, we have key concerns, including Northern Ireland, the common travel area and our interconnected trade.  In this regard, I have maintained intensive contact with my EU counterparts.  I will continue to ensure our concerns are well understood at European Union level.  I travel on Friday to see my German colleague and I will host the Italian Minister for foreign affairs here in Dublin next week.  I have already been speaking to my colleagues from Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, in the context of the aftermath of the referendum.  It is my view that bilateral visits of this sort continue to offer a vital opportunity to build relationships with our EU partners and will be of ever more importance into the future.</p>  <p>  I might just take a moment to respond briefly to Deputy Smith's question regarding Ireland's response to the migration crisis.  I acknowledge that there are difficulties, but at EU level, we have consistently called for an approach that addresses the root causes as well as the humanitarian challenges involved.  I acknowledge that progress on resettlement has been good.  We have already taken in more than half the 273 persons we pledged to take.  We are on course to meet our target of 520 refugees by the end of this year.  I accept that progress on relocation, which I think was the point raised by Deputy Smith, has been slow, but it has been slow not only for Ireland but for of our partners.  There are 38 persons in Ireland.  This low number is due to a variety of reasons outside our control, including administrative and operational difficulties.  However, we are anxious to see progress on that and Ireland will continue to work towards reaching decisions on this issue.  In the meantime, I wish to confirm to the House again that Ireland has provided in excess of &euro;46 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region over recent years.</p></speech>

The ESRI and others have published reports warning that there is a potential reduction in trade between the two countries of up to 20%.  The UK is a very important trading partner for us but the beginning of our approach has bordered on shambolic.  I am very disappointed about the collapse of an all-Ireland forum before it even began and I hope that can be addressed.  We are at an early stage but what plans is the Minister putting in place to safeguard Irish trade interests between the two states?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.297.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500038#LL00600"><p>As I said in the House last week during the important discussion on the implications of the outcome of the UK referendum, I believe there is a collective determination across the Government and Opposition benches to meet the challenges and uncertainties of the period ahead.  Our work together over the next months and years must serve Irish national interests as we construct a new environment in which to maintain the strongest possible relations with our EU partners and with the United Kingdom, not least in so far as our trading relationships are concerned.  There will be no greater priority for Government than the effective handling of the process following the UK electorate's vote to exit from the European Union.</p>  <p>  As to the shape of the negotiations at EU level, both in terms of withdrawal and the UK's future relationship with the EU, this was a matter of some discussion at last week's European Council in Brussels which the Taoiseach attended.  In his post-European Council statement to the House today, the Taoiseach made two important points very clear: Article 50 provides a legal framework for the withdrawal negotiations, and the European Council, that is, the EU Heads of State and Government, will direct the process.  We await further clarification on this from the British side when the new Prime Minister is in place.  The new UK Prime Minister will also have to clarify what kind of future relationship it intends to seek with the EU.  The Irish people expect nothing less than a comprehensive, proactive, constructive and calm response to the challenges presented by these circumstances.  As a Government, we will use every resource available to us.</p>  <p>  The North-South dimension is also critical.  At the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council yesterday, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive had a detailed discussion on the potential impact of the UK referendum result to leave the EU.  To optimise joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the referendum result, we agreed to take actions in a number of priority areas.</p>  <p>  While we continue to rely heavily on a number of traditional markets, Ireland has been working to deepen its market penetration and its market diversification.  For example, while growing in volume terms, the percentage of UK exports as a percentage of total global exports has declined over the period 2005 to 2015.  This reflects Enterprise Ireland's strategy of supporting clients to win more business in the UK while at the same time diversifying the overall export base through targeting other existing markets and the emerging high growth markets.</p></reply>

Already, though, there is a threat to our export market as a result of the severe weakening in sterling and I would expect that, through the trade element of the Minister's portfolio, we would assist our exporters.  While our dependency on the British market is less than it was 20 years ago, it is still significant, with more than &euro;1.2 billion per week in trade between Ireland and Britain.  Has Government or the Minister deployed further resources within the Department and with other Departments to support the many businesses that export into the UK in the short term while this uncertainty is in place?  From the perspective of Tourism Ireland, how will the result affect visitor numbers and everything that flows from that?</p></speech>

We have been engaged in a review of our personnel and have put into effect something of a redeployment, but this involves much more than the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has a particular role to play.  However, my Department will support Enterprise Ireland's international trade mission, scheduled for the rest of this year, which will include missions to northern Europe, the USA, China, India and other high growth markets.  IDA Ireland is liaising directly with its more than 1,200 client companies and potential investors to work with them on the implications of the vote.  New opportunities may arise for Ireland in some sectors, many of which already form part of the IDA&rsquo;s marketing strategy.  Our embassies will, of course, continue to support and co-ordinate work on the ground with local market teams.  In the period leading up to the referendum, I consulted the export trade council on a number of occasions and, following the result, I have now convened a further meeting of the council, which will shortly bring together Ministries, State agencies and interested parties, including private sector representatives, to co-ordinate our efforts and intensify our work on this important issue.</p></speech>

It is not in our interest that the process be allowed to run into the next year or two.  I agree that we should not force Britain to submit the Article 50 letter, but there is uncertainty in the markets which means uncertainty for jobs and people's standard of living.  I am sure many companies have been in contact with the Minister in the area of agriculture and horticulture, with particular reference to export companies, and it is of grave concern that companies are already looking at cutting back, a mere two weeks after the referendum result.  I am glad to hear there is redeployment and that a cross-departmental approach is being taken.  Will the Minister keep us updated in this regard?</p></speech>

In this regard, my Department has launched a pilot programme of commercial attach&eacute;s and these will be locally hired commercial experts with short-term contracts of between one and three years, depending on the circumstances.  We are focusing on placing them in emerging markets where we have opened new embassies and missions and where there is an agency presence, for example, in Brasilia, Bucharest, which also covers Bulgaria, Buenos Aires, which also covers Chile, Jakarta in Indonesia, and Mexico.  These will work closely with our State agencies and the work will proceed while we prepare for the vital strategic negotiations on the matter of the UK withdrawal from the European Union.</p></speech>

The First and Deputy First Minister represented the Executive, as did the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice.  As well as the review meeting, I held separate bilateral meetings with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, the SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, the leader of the Alliance Party, David Ford, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  Naturally, the outcome of the UK referendum on the EU was a key element of each of these meetings.  I took the opportunity to assure all those I met of the priority the Government attaches to the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the aftermath of the referendum.  I emphasised the necessity and importance of working together in the best interests of the people on this island.  I reiterated the Government's commitment to work in support of stability, reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  In this regard, the Government will use its influence with our EU partners to seek to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island, a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.</p><p>In addition, I outlined that the common travel area and cross-Border EU funding are key priorities for the Government in the period ahead.</p> <p> I am very conscious of the deep concerns and anxiety that have arisen for many people across the community in Northern Ireland about the outcome of the referendum.  The fact that the majority within Northern Ireland who voted to remain now face their preference being set aside as a result of the overall result across the United Kingdom raises profound and important issues.</p> <p> In this regard, in my meeting with the Secretary of State, we agreed that the Good Friday Agreement would remain the foundation for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  The EU referendum result does not by any manner or means alter or diminish the centrality of the Good Friday Agreement or the requirement on both the British and Irish Governments to uphold it.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and succeeding agreements, the Irish Government remains determined that its institutions, values and principles, including the right to be British or Irish or both, will be fully protected.</p></reply>

Seasfaidh Sinn F&eacute;in an f&oacute;d do chearta mhuintir an Tuaiscirt sa cheist seo.</p>  <p>  I welcome that the Government, following a call from Sinn F&eacute;in, stated its intention to establish a national forum to discuss the impact of the EU referendum.  It is unfortunate that the DUP leader, First Minister, Arlene Foster, has stated that she does not believe such an important forum is necessary.  I believe that, if needs be, the forum should still go ahead without that Unionist representation from the DUP if needs be.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh cead ag an DUP veto a bheith acu.  The DUP should not have a veto on that.  The Irish Government has a responsibility to think nationally, not only in terms of the Twenty-six Counties but for the island of Ireland.  As a co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish Government has a responsibility, to which the Minister referred, and it must be robust in asserting that.  It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in or other parties here saying that.  A robust, well articulated argument was made by Fintan O'Toole on the serious responsibilities the Irish Government has in upholding the manner in which the people in the North voted.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister indicate whether the Government is still committed to a national forum?  Will he act on behalf of all citizens to ensure that one part of Ireland does not end up outside the EU while the rest remains inside?</p></speech>

These will remain our priorities in the context of our relationship with the United Kingdom as it prepares to withdraw from the European Union but, more particularly, our relationship with the European Union in the context of the forthcoming negotiations.</p>  <p>  I did acknowledge this result and the majority vote in the context of my engagements with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, and other political leaders.  It is important that all stakeholders and all political leaders are involved in what will be a very exciting challenge, and the Government has a clear plan in place to deal with that.  </p>  <p>  The contingency framework maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in weeks, months and years ahead.  We have already published a summary of key actions that will be taken to address the contingencies arising from the decision of the UK.  I note the formation today of the European affairs committee and I was pleased to address a meeting of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence in the past two weeks.  I note also the establishment of the committee on the Good Friday Agreement, which to my mind will have a specific task of ensuring that the issues on the island of Ireland are fully factored into the negotiated framework and process.</p></speech>

The result of the referendum does not in any way diminish the importance, centrality or legal basis of the Good Friday Agreement or the requirement on the part of both the British Government and the Irish Government to at all times uphold the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  I was there in my capacity as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and succeeding agreements and I wish to impress upon the House that the Irish Government is determined that the institutions, the principles, the letter, the spirit and the values of the Good Friday Agreement remain central to our approach to any negotiations with our EU partners on the future of the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-05a.317.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500039#MM01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</p>  <p>  MSF Ireland informed my Department on 15 June that the organisation globally had taken the decision that it would no longer accept European Union or member state funding for its humanitarian programmes.  It explained that MSF opposed the EU-Turkey refugee facility agreed by the European Council and believes that EU asylum and migration policies have become increasingly more restrictive and inconsistent with the organisation&rsquo;s humanitarian principles.  While not sharing this analysis, I respect the right of the group to take that decision and I recognise its important, continuing humanitarian role.</p>  <p>  MSF is funded mainly by private donations.  Its global income amounts to some &euro;1 billion.  In recent years, about &euro;50 million of that has been from the European Union and its member states.  Through Irish Aid, we have provided a total of &euro;5.6 million in humanitarian funding to MSF since 2013.  It had applied for further funding this year and was due to receive some &euro;1.6 million in humanitarian funding for programmes in Africa.  In view of its decision not to accept it, this funding will be reprogrammed by Irish Aid.</p>  <p>  In regard to Turkey, I believe it appropriate at this point to place on record the deepest sympathy of the Government and the people of Ireland with the victims and families of the appalling terrorist attack on Atat&uuml;rk Airport in Istanbul on 28 June.  We believe that Turkey has a key role to play in tackling the migration crisis and the unprecedented level of humanitarian need caused by the Syrian crisis.  The EU and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches to the crisis, which have been discussed at meetings of the European Council, most recently in March and June.  The discussions in March were framed by the set of principles agreed at the previous EU meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister on 7 March.</p><p> In the interim, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, had advanced work on a potential agreement, to ensure that partners&rsquo; concerns were addressed and that the proposed deal was compatible with EU and international law.  The June European Council noted that the legislation recently adopted by Turkey on the treatment of Syrians and other nationalities allows for the return of migrants to Turkey in full respect of the provisions of the asylum procedures directive.  The EU has initially agreed to provide a financial package of an additional &euro;3 billion, with the establishment of a refugee facility for Turkey to co-ordinate and streamline actions financed by this package.  The facility provides a co-ordination mechanism for actions financed by the EU and member states.  It is designed to ensure that the needs of refugees and host communities are addressed effectively and comprehensively.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution over four years will be just under &euro;23 million, starting with &euro;5 million this year.  Ireland is participating in the facility&rsquo;s steering committee, which meets in Brussels.</p> <p> The EU is also committed to deciding on further financial assistance for refugees in Turkey.  It has also put in place humanitarian aid to assist with the provision for asylum seekers and refugees in neighbouring Greece.</p></reply>

From the very outset, Fianna F&aacute;il expressed its reservations about the arrangement.  I am particularly concerned about the treatment of those who are fleeing war and persecution and the fact that Turkey has been designated a safe country for refugees, even in light of its record on human rights - consider the recent shut down of media and the arrests of journalists.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has argued that the European response - I would agree with it to some degree - has focused on deterrents rather than providing people with assistance and protection they need.</p>  <p>  By way of a supplementary question, I ask the Minister to consider the issue of unaccompanied minors as part of this deal, or the issue of Ireland's funding.  How sure are we that the funding, pledged by the Minister at the London pledging conference, is actually going to where we want it to go?  Is that funding going to strengthen hard borders within Europe to stop migrants, who are being persecuted in Syria and Iraq, from fleeing in to Europe?</p></speech>

During statements on migration and the refugee crisis on 28 April, I reacted to remarks made in the House by Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly by making a rather flippant remark about Deputy Wallace's visit to Dunkirk and Calais.  I subsequently apologised to Deputy Wallace outside the House but I now wish to apologise formally to Deputy Wallace on the record of the House.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy O'Brien's points, Turkey remains an essential partner in attempts to manage the current migration crisis.  The European Union and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches to the migration crisis.  I take seriously the Deputy's point and I have conveyed the concerns at the highest level.  EU Heads of State and the Government in Turkey reached an agreement at the March European Council.  The EU refugee facility for Turkey is a direct follow-on from that agreement and provides the financial support of &euro;3 billion to underpin the deal.  Some &euro;2 billion of this funding will be from member state contributions assessed on a GNP basis by the Commission.  Ireland's assessed contributions to the facility over a four year period will be almost &euro;23 million, including &euro;5 million this year.  I am conscious that these moneys will go solely towards the relief in the form of humanitarian response.</p></speech>

It is appalling to see the EU pride itself on human rights while systematically pushing people away from its shores and leaving them to suffer in overcrowded camps on Mediterranean islands.  The EU-Turkey deal has placed in danger the very concept of refugees and the protection it offers.  T&aacute; ceisteanna ann, fi&uacute;, faoi bhun&uacute;s dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il an pholasa&iacute; seo, ach anois t&aacute; an Coimisi&uacute;n ag iarraidh &eacute; seo a leathn&uacute; amach go 16 t&iacute;r eile.</p>  <p>  For months M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has detailed how the EU and third countries deals to expel asylum seekers are having dire humanitarian consequences.  As a State we have prided ourselves on our aid role in the world.  In that context, will the Minister explain why he and his Department are not listening to the concerns expressed?  Why is he not standing up for the human rights for some of the most vulnerable people in the world?  These new deals would impose trade and development aid cuts on countries that do not stem migration or facilitate forcible returns while rewarding those countries that do.  It disincentivises fair treatment of refugees.</p></speech>

If it takes a view that it will no longer accept donations, that decision remains one for the charity.  With regard to Turkey, it remains an essential partner in the very difficult and challenging attempts to manage the current migration crisis.  The European Union and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches to the crisis, including the deal agreed in March.</p>  <p>  It is fair to point out that there has been a very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek islands since the agreement entered into force in March.  While the EU-Turkey deal faces a number of challenges, it is clear that both sides understand the importance of working well together and we will continue to do so in our engagement with our EU partners on this issue.</p></speech>

However, if one leaves M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res out of the argument, then perhaps the Minister would consider Tr&oacute;caire's concerns about this deal and the concerns of other charitable organisations.  Tr&oacute;caire has said that the EU-Turkey plan is not designed in the best interests of refugees and asylum seekers.  As already referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, member states are effectively being rewarded for repatriation of people who need our assistance.</p>  <p>  What are Ireland's plans to expedite our refugee programme in Ireland?  The Minister outlined figures earlier today, figures I had previously sought from the foreign affairs committee.  While Ireland is not behind the European average, I believe that the European Union itself should hang its head in shame for the slow response to the human catastrophe happening right on our borders.  As the crisis unfolded, there was a feeling within Ireland that we may take up to 5,000 refugees.  As outlined by the Minister, we have had tens of Syrian refugees coming here.  We should do a lot better and I would like to know what plans there are to expedite the refugee resettlement programme here in Ireland. </p></speech>

This issue is not being raised in the context of the budgetary implications for M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res.  The point is how seriously it demonstrates its concern about this policy and the implications for very vulnerable people who are fleeing war-torn countries.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has said: "Deterrence policies sold to the public as humanitarian solutions have only exacerbated the suffering of people in need.  There is nothing remotely humanitarian about these policies."  It is disgraceful that rather than maximising the number of people we can welcome and protect, Ireland is supporting the EU in its efforts to maximise the amount of people it can push back into dangerous and volatile situations or back to Turkey which has a very poor record on human rights violations.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware that it is not only M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res raising this matter and that 104 NGOs have also signed this statement which condemns these agreements?  Some of the NGOs are based in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if he has met or if he will meet M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res or any of these organisations to discuss their concerns.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that a key element of the intensified engagement with Turkey is to assist in alleviating the suffering of those most affected by the migration crisis who are those who have had to flee their homes.  The moneys allocated to Turkey will be ring-fenced so that these finances are channelled exclusively to measures to support the refugee crisis.</p><p>This includes measures to enhance health services, access to clean water, housing, education resources and other measures.  Our response to the migration crisis has to include the long-term solutions that address the root causes of such large scale movements and the EU member state development co-operation programmes continue to have a key role to play in that regard.  At the same time, Ireland will continue to reaffirm the principle that decisions on aid allocation and in particular humanitarian assistance should be made on the basis of need and this principle must be retained as Europe responds to the migration and refugee pressures that it continues to face.</p></speech>

Our ongoing efforts will continue to involve engagement with a range of stakeholders, including the Oireachtas and its various committees.  Most of the committees of the Houses as constituted will have a firm and direct engagement in this regard.  The Government circulated an information note to Oireachtas Members in advance of the UK referendum and, on the day of the result, the Taoiseach met with Opposition leaders for a preliminary discussion of its implications.  The Taoiseach intends to continue these sessions as the situation evolves.  There have been valuable discussions in both Houses of the Oireachtas since the referendum result became known.  I look forward to continuing to work with Opposition spokespersons in the time ahead and I greatly value the cross-party exchanges on this critical issue that have taken place to date.  </p>  <p>  Political engagement at European level is also critically important.  When attending meetings in Brussels and elsewhere, Ministers have highlighted our unique political, economic and social ties with the UK, and our specific issues of concern.  Of course, the European Council, Heads of State and Government will direct the EU-UK negotiations.  However, the European Parliament and the Commission will also play important roles.  In relation to engagement with the broader political groupings at European level, the Taoiseach, I and Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, in his role as Vice President of the European People's Party, EPP, have taken every opportunity to highlight Irish priority issues to our colleagues within the EPP.  I know that Deputies with affiliations to other European groupings have undertaken similar engagements and I thank them for their efforts and urge them to continue with this work. </p>  <p>  Through our permanent representation in Brussels, we keep a regular channel open with all Irish Members of the European Parliament, MEPs, to ensure that they are fully briefed on the latest developments.  I directed my officials to offer a briefing to Irish MEPs shortly after the referendum result became known and there is an open invitation to Irish MEPs to engage with our permanent representation in Brussels.</p></reply>

It is almost as if Brexit is a normal European event.  He speaks as if we are doing business as usual, saying he will send out an information note and that he will brief us.  That is to miss the point.  The idea is how, where there are such significant challenges on so many fronts as set out in the contingency framework document that the Taoiseach presented, we can co-ordinate our response.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin met the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, including five prime ministers last week.  I am meeting the socialist group this week but we are not acting in consort in terms of a clear strategy working together.  Bluntly, the Minister or the Minister of State briefing their own family group is not what I am talking about.  I am talking about a coherent strategy, not going to brief committees as if it was a normal European issue.  This is a momentous event that needs a co-ordinated response using all our levers across Europe and I am not hearing that the Minister grasps that point.</p></speech>

Of course there is an information note.  It was an information note on the current crisis and the critical issues involved.  I assure the House that there will be full and detailed engagement.  I am very pleased that Deputy Howlin was in contact with the socialist group, as I am sure all Members are in contact with their own affiliate groups.  I remain fully committed to my engagement with members of the EPP, and have made available our resource in Brussels, who are highly experienced and expert, to brief all the MEPs on any issue at any time and I do so in a spirit of openness and look on this issue in a way that is transparent and constructive.  The Taoiseach indicated in the presence of Deputy Howlin at the briefing that he and the entire Government will not only keep the Deputies fully informed but will invite the Deputy's submissions and observations and elicit his help and support for what is a hugely challenging engagement.  We look forward to the co-operation of Deputy Howlin and all colleagues over the critical period that lies ahead.</p></speech>

I did not know he was going to take an initiative on an all-Ireland forum.  I had communication from Sinn F&eacute;in about that.  There is not a coherent, joined-up, national endeavour that seeks to involve us all but we can do that.  Will the Minister consider having a much more structured formalised engagement with us all so that we will know day to day what the strategy is, who we should contact and what the objectives are so that it is not the Government briefing the Opposition but putting team Ireland in the field where we can make an impact and convince people of the vital interests of Ireland as the discussions for Brexit unfold?</p></speech>

The level of demand is very high this year with an 11% rise in the number of applications year-to-date compared to the same period last year.  However, the situation has improved somewhat in recent weeks.  On 31 May, there were a total of 68,009 applications in the system and this figure has fallen throughout June. </p><p> To respond to the seasonal spike in demand and the more general increase in applications, a total of 233 temporary clerical officers have been recruited so far this year, an increase of 62 on last year.  Furthermore, processing work has been redistributed across passport offices and staff have been redeployed from other areas of the Department as needed.  As a matter of best practice, I recommend that applicants apply well in advance of travel and allow six weeks in case any difficulty arises with an application, for example, an incomplete application form.</p> <p> The most convenient way to apply for a passport is via passport express.  The passport office advise applicants to allow 15 working days for renewals submitted via passport express.  At the moment, these applications are being processed within 13 working days.  First-time applications take longer due to additional anti-fraud measures and the passport office advisers to first-time applicants using password express to allow 20 working days.  At the current time, first-time applications are taking 19 working days.</p> <p> While there is likely to be an increase in the number of first-time applications submitted from the UK and British people living overseas, it is too early to assess how significant this will be.  We are seeing an increased number of queries relating to passport and citizenship from Northern Ireland, Great Britain and elsewhere.  The passport office will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources and to minimise the impact of the high volume of applications on turnaround times and customer service.  The need for additional resources will be kept under review.</p></reply>

I have to compliment the Trojan work of those in the passport office who are dealing with a major backlog and applications.  I would like the Minister to go back with a very clear message to those working in his office and offer my sincerest thanks to them for their efforts and the Trojan work they do in emergency and urgent cases.  When people's lives are upset and they are experiencing trauma, we have received nothing but the utmost courtesy, dedication and determination from those working in the Minister's Department.  I want to acknowledge that, as well as those working in ordinary passport offices.  I want my message to go back to those dealing with the mountains of applications that we sincerely thank them for their work.  They are dealing with people who are highly distressed.  People may have to travel for a funeral or may have made arrangements and find themselves without passports, and as a result they are extremely upset.  They are treated very well to the best of people's abilities.</p></speech>

I will be more than happy to convey his very kind and well-received remarks directly to Mr. Austin Gormley in the passport office and his team.  I acknowledge that they work very hard in challenging circumstances.  It is not often that the House is witness to kind remarks of the type we heard from Deputy Healy-Rae.  I take them as they were given, namely, in very good faith.</p>  <p>  I wish to underline that there is no need for concern about current freedom of movement or entitlement to an Irish passport.  The process of negotiation to enable the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is likely to take at least two years, as envisaged under Article 50 of the treaty of the European Union once the article has commenced.  During this period, the UK remains a member of the European Union and its citizens continue to enjoy full rights, including freedom of movement, within the European Union.  The referendum in Britain has in no way changed the entitlement to an Irish passport, including as it extends to people born on the island of Ireland and those who may be entitled to Irish citizenship through parents or grandparents who were born in Ireland.</p></speech>

Does he believe the decision of the UK to leave the European Union will lead to a further spike in the number of applications being submitted for Irish passports?  Can he continue to provide additional staffing and resources when this happens?</p>  <p>  Can the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade arrange that notification of the current passport waiting times is sent to all post offices in the country?  Some post offices are informing applicants that the normal passport express time of ten days still applies.  As the Minister knows, that is inaccurate.  I ask that we keep post offices informed and wonder whether there is a cost effective way of doing so.  It might be a major task, but with modern communications surely there is some way that post offices could be advised of accurate waiting times.  They could put up notices to advise people of the current waiting times.  If that could be arranged it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The passport service offers a passport reminder service to customers, which can be accessed via the passport service web page, <i>www.passport.ie</i>.  It automatically sends an e-mail three and six months before a passport is due to expire to those who register.  Registration simply requires passport holders to record their names, e-mail addresses and expiry dates of their passports.  It is envisaged that as part of the future online application process for passport renewals for adults, which is scheduled to launch in early 2017, reminder notifications will automatically be sent to passport holders well in advance of renewal dates.</p><p>In respect of the Deputy's concern regarding the Irish community in Britain following the referendum, according to the 2011 census for England and Wales and Scotland, there are a total of 430,000 Irish born people resident in Britain, 407,000 in England and Wales and 23,000 in Scotland.  Estimates vary as to how many second and later generation Irish people live in Britain.  It is not possible to say what proportion of these people may apply for an Irish passport.  We will continue to monitor the situation.  In the meantime, there is no need for concern because the current legal regulations still apply and will continue to apply until after the conclusion of negotiations.</p></speech>

The second is the reports of the number of casualties as a result of drone strikes authorised by President Obama.  In effect, there is a drone assassination programme.</p></reply>

Bilaterally, there are regular contacts between political leaders from our two countries, such as through those that took place during the recent visit by Vice President Biden to Ireland and the annual St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington DC.  These discussions typically cover a wide range of topics of particular interest to Ireland, such as immigration reform, as well as relevant foreign policy issues, development aid, economic and investment ties and support for human rights.  My visit to the US in September for the UN General Assembly usually provides me with an opportunity for bilateral exchanges with senior US foreign policy officials.</p>  <p>  In addition, our embassy in Washington regularly engages with members of the US Houses of Congress and officials in various US Government Departments on a wide range of issues, as do our consulates in the US at a regional level.  Ireland is also party to contacts with the US by the European Union through the transatlantic dialogue, which includes a range of policy areas such as development co-operation, non-proliferation, energy security and the environment, as well as foreign policy.</p>  <p>  With regard to military policy, Ireland maintains a long-standing policy of military neutrality which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  This policy has been pursued by successive Governments and was reaffirmed in my Department's foreign policy strategy, The Global Island.</p></speech>

I do not see how that is compatible with a supposedly neutral foreign policy.  Does the Government have any intention of changing the use of Shannon Airport?</p><p> In particular, I wish to raise a question about a particular aircraft in Shannon Airport on 1 July.  Two issues arise here.  One is the use of Shannon to transport troops but the other was previously in terms of rendition.  An aircraft was at Shannon Airport that was previously identified as one of the CIA planes used in the extraordinary rendition programme by the European Union TDIP committee that investigated it, that is, Learjet 35, No. N71PG.  Would the Minister be aware of anything in regard to that?  Would he be willing to investigate that?</p></speech>

This commitment was reconfirmed last year in the context of my Department's foreign policy review and in the White Paper on Defence which was also published last year.  Successive Governments have made overfly and landing facilities at Shannon available to the US for well over 50 years.  This facility is also made available for military aircraft from other countries.  From 2013 to 2015, permission was granted in respect of requests from 23 countries.  The same conditions apply to all landings by military aircraft.  These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US and are consistent with our policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific instance raised by the Deputy on 1 July, I do not have information on that particular aircraft but I will endeavour at the earliest opportunity to appropriate this information and to contact the Deputy's office on it.</p></speech>

For the information of the Minister, it is Learjet 35, No. N71PG, which is reportedly a CIA aircraft.  Obviously, if CIA planes were to land at Shannon Airport and potentially were to have prisoners inside, it would be a very serious matter that the Government would want to investigate.  I do not think neutrality is compatible with a policy of allowing soldiers to land and allowing aircraft to be used that then go on to kill innocent Iraqis, Afghans and so on.  I do not think that is neutrality.</p>  <p>  What is the approach of the Government to the question of drone strikes?  The first official release of figures claims close to 3,000 people were killed as a result of drone strikes between 2009 and 2015.  There is the horrific situation where Obama signs a kill list; effectively, it is a judicial action but it is non-judicial assassination.  There is no oversight whatsoever.  They decide to kill people outside of combat.  Does the Irish Government have a view on it?</p></speech>

Bilateral relations between friendly nations are founded on mutual trust.  Both parties have an interest in maintaining that trust.  Details provided by diplomatic missions, including confirmation that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, no ammunition and no explosives, are therefore accepted in good faith as being accurate.  In accordance with international practice, foreign military aircraft which are granted permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection.  I will provide the Deputy with details in respect of the aircraft as evidenced by him earlier.</p></speech>

Its intent is to deny the democratic wish of people as expressed in the last election and to impose an extremely right-wing regressive reactionary government.  The Minister should express a statement of opposition to the Government that has come to power via a coup impeachment process.  Some of the numerous counter reforms include a tax being implemented by the government, the ending of compulsory state funding of health and education, cutting of universal access to health care, fire fighters and other public sector workers not being paid, the cancellation of a home building programme of 10,000 social houses, the abolition of the ministry for culture, attacks on abortion rights for women who have been raped, and a rowing back on other women's rights such as proposed changes to protect people against domestic violence.  There has been a huge protest movement of women workers and ordinary people in response and the Government should simply deal with this government.</p></speech>

President Temer has been appointed for a period of 180 days while the impeachment of President Rousseff is considered by the Brazilian Senate under the chairmanship of the current chief justice.  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation via our embassy in Brasilia.  We remain firmly of the opinion that the current beleaguered situation in Brazil including a number of investigations that are under way are a matter for the Brazilian authorities.</p></speech>

We would be supporters of PSOL and the LSR tendency within PSOL but this is a basic question of people's democratic rights and what is a major assault by the right via undemocratic means to try to impose a very right-wing government.

A number of cases are being investigated by Brazilian authorities and, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters that are in effect ongoing investigations.  However, I wish to point to the Marie da Penha law which was enacted in Brazil in 2006 which is the principal legal instrument in respect of violence against women.  The law incorporates a multifaceted approach in efforts to combat gender-based violence.  This includes a dedicated court, police support solely focused on dealing with violence against women, urgent protective legal measures for victims of domestic violence and a reinforcement of public social services in the areas.  The law also provides for educational measures such as the inclusion of gender equality in school curricula.  I wish to acknowledge government campaigns to raise awareness of the problems of gender-based violence.  A telephone service has been made available throughout Brazil giving women an opportunity to report crimes, provide information on victim's rights and legal procedures.</p><p>As I did at the outset of my earlier reply, I assure the Deputy and the House that our embassy in Brasilia will continue to monitor developments relating to this case on the wider issue of gender-based violence. </p></speech>

This young man has been detained now for well over 1,000 days.  Many people, including former prisoners from other countries, are openly asking whether the Irish Government is doing enough to get Ibrahim, who is an Irish citizen, home.  It looks to us it is not nearly enough, compared with what is possible.</p></reply>

This latest delay is a particular source of concern and frustration for the citizen and his family and we fully share their sense of frustration.  It is our understanding that at the latest hearing in this case on 29 June, the court ordered a review of video evidence by a technical committee, with the court due to reconvene in early October. </p><p>My own concerns and that of the Government about this delay have been conveyed directly to the Egyptian Government.  I met with the ambassador of Egypt last Thursday<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and asked that she convey to her authorities in Cairo my disappointment and frustration at this further postponement of the trial.  My officials are seeking more detail about these latest developments and their potential impact on this trial.</p><p>I met with this citizen&rsquo;s father and sister last week, in advance of the hearing, to reaffirm our continued commitment to securing his release.  A further meeting between the family and my officials took place on Friday<font color="#FF0000"> </font>where the latest developments were reviewed and options for future action, including a new application under Presidential Decree 140, were considered.  The Government will continue to bring all of its influence to bear on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf through all appropriate channels.  The Taoiseach and I stand ready to have further contacts with our Egyptian counterparts.</p><p>Regardless of our difficulties with the trial now under way, the reality is the Irish government cannot interfere with a trial in a foreign country.  What we can do, and what we are working very hard to do, is to provide all consular care possible to this citizen while he is in prison and to work towards his release at the earliest possible time.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>All actions taken in this case are considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s clear strategy, which is focused on two core objectives, first, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland as soon as possible, and, second, to provide every possible consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. </p><p>Our ambassador to Egypt, Mr. Damien Cole, was once again present in the court for the latest hearing.  This citizen&rsquo;s welfare is an important priority for our embassy in Cairo, as it is at home in Ireland.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is continuing to provide consular assistance to this citizen through regular visits to him in the prison where he is being held.  The ambassador visited him again on Sunday last, 3 July. </p><p>I am aware of media references to a letter concerning allegations about the Egyptian prison system.  On my instruction, the contents of this letter were discussed with the family and legal representative of this citizen as soon as the matter became known to me.  I also instructed that the matter be brought to the attention of our ambassador in Cairo as he is best placed to assess the level of concern to attach to its contents.  The ambassador visits this citizen regularly, and did so on 29 May and again on 3 July.  As would be the case for any Irish citizen imprisoned abroad, any concern related to ill-treatment is treated with the utmost seriousness and would be raised urgently with the appropriate authorities.  This point has been consistently reconfirmed to this citizen and his family.</p><p>In the coming days, I expect the Government will have further high level contacts with the Egyptian Government aimed at achieving a resolution of this case.</p></reply>

I quote to the Minister Peter Greste, who spent 400 days in prison and was at one stage Ibrahim's cell mate, who told Australian Al-Jazeera said that Ibrahim is simply not getting the same level of support as he did.  He said he wondered whether it was because his name was Peter, not Ibrahim, in other words, that he was considered white, normal and English-speaking, as opposed to Muslim with a different name.  Internationally and globally, he received more respect and had more people batting for him.</p>  <p>  Ibrahim has been detained for far longer than is absolutely necessary and was denied any opportunity to defend himself in court.  I also mention that the Minister tweeted and welcomed the release of Joshua Molloy, a constituent of his, after he was captured and put in jail in Iraq for a very short period of time.  The Minister welcomed Joshua Molloy's release.  Certainly it was welcome that that young man got out, despite the fact that he had fought and was in combat, rather than somebody as innocent as Ibrahim, who is now 1,000 days in and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by him.</p></speech>

It is important to note that each and every case is different.  We have considered the cases, as mentioned, in some detail.  We have consulted extensively on them, but my focus remains on the citizen, and his case, which is before the courts.  We have consulted extensively, including with states and governments that have had citizens in similar circumstances, but any decision as to the release of this citizen will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities.  I travelled to Cairo within the past few weeks.  I met face-to-face with my colleague, Foreign Minister Shoukry.  This was the fourth occasion on which I had a face-to-face meeting with him.  I assure the House that I and the Taoiseach are doing everything possible to ensure a satisfactory outcome.  If Deputy Smith or any other Deputy has advice or guidance, I would be very happy to hear from them.</p></speech>

It is just not good enough.  There needs to be a statement and a call from the Taoiseach directly to the Egyptian authorities.  There needs to be a presidential decree that there should be a demand for his release.  I also think we should recall the Egyptian ambassador, just as the Italian authorities have done after a young student disappeared and was later found murdered on the streets of Cairo.  It was an immediate recall.  They are now looking at banning some importations and trade dealings with Cairo.  Our representatives in the European Union should object strongly when arms deals, such as were recently concluded between France and Egypt, go ahead without any objection.  This is an appallingly brutal regime with a significant record of breaching human rights, where prisoners have no rights.  Should anything happen to Ibrahim, should he not be released, should he be tortured or found damaged in prison, be it on the Minister's head and that of the Government because not enough is being done to secure his release.</p></speech>

This was done by way of formal diplomatic notes and by our embassy in Cairo at the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 15 February 2015, in consultation with the family and its legal representatives.  The Government intends to lend its full support to a further request for release under Presidential Decree 140.  We will continue to work in support of these efforts.</p></speech>

He is on his way back from a funeral in England.  This again relates to the EU-Turkey deal.  I do not believe that it was ever a safe place for refugees or a good deal, but given the number of civilians who have been shot by the Turkish authorities attempting to flee Syria, does the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, not think that it is now time to rip up the deal and argue for a more humanitarian approach?</p></reply>

I learned with deep concern of the death of 11 refugees on the Turkish-Syrian border on 19 June.  I am also aware that the Turkish Foreign Ministry has refuted allegations that the refugees were shot by border guards, saying that Turkish security forces "act fully within the legal framework".  These reports are very worrying.  While Turkey has a right to secure its border with Syria, all actions on the part of Turkey must be in line with international law, including international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at meetings of the European Council and continues to form an integral part of the country&rsquo;s enlargement process, which we, along with our European partners, keep under close review.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in respect of the rule of law, human rights and freedom of the media in Turkey and the need to hold Turkey to account to the core European values inherent in the accession process. </p>  <p>  The core intention of the agreement which emerged from the March European Council was to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable.  In particular, it aims to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives.  The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since the agreement entered into force suggests that it is achieving its aims.</p>  <p>  The need for the agreement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU member states, including Ireland.  The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the agreement were not in breach of EU or International law. </p>  <p>  The EU and Turkey continue to work together to address this crisis, and I take this opportunity to express my sympathy to the people of Turkey, and in particular to the families of those who were killed in the bombing at Istanbul airport on Tuesday 28 June.  I signed a book of condolence at the embassy last week and conveyed our deep shock at this dreadful act to the ambassador.</p></reply>

The fact that the Turkish regime has denied them or said it was doing everything in accordance with a plan is a bad sign rather than something to take comfort from.  The EU is saying: "Tut tut, lads.  We're really not too happy with what you are doing here."  The problem, however, is that it sends a contradictory message when we continue to do business with them.  It is a fact that refugees have been shot, along with arbitrary detention and deportation without due process.  By continuing to deal with that, we are complicit in it, and not only in terms of the refugees themselves.  It also gives a green light to the Turkish authorities to continue their poor treatment of the Kurdish population.  The Minister will know that, according to the UN, Turkish security forces have shot civilians, destroyed infrastructure, carried out arbitrary arrests, and triggered a wave of displacement in their ongoing campaign against the Kurds.  By continuing to do business with them, we are giving a green light for that to continue.</p></speech>

Turkey is hosting an estimated 2.7 million refugees, which is an enormous number for any country.  The EU is committed to assisting Turkey and has established a &euro;3 billion facility for refugees there.  This facility aims to support Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education and health care.  As part of the deal, the EU has also agreed to take from Turkey, on a one-for-one basis, a Syrian refugee for each irregular migrant returned there from the EU.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the fact that there are issues and problems.  Instances have taken place recently that are a matter of huge concern and I share that concern.  I ask the Deputy to consider that the agreement entered into and the manner in which this process is under way are not the actions of an institution intent on outsourcing its problems.</p></speech>

They have reported stories about Syrians being brought to Turkey from Greece and taken directly to detention centres.  We know that these centres are largely off limits to journalists, aid organisations and lawyers.  One MEP who managed to visit one reported that detainees are only permitted to leave their cells for a few minutes every day.</p><p>The Turkish regime is brutally undemocratic and vicious.  Its treatment of the Kurdish population is reprehensible, not to mind its treatment of refugees.  That is an established fact and many of the international organisations which deal with refugees are saying so.  The Minister has not done enough to highlight this matter in dealings with his European counterparts. </p></speech>

Part of the assessment of persons process includes ascertaining whether Turkey can be considered a safe country, given an irregular migrant or asylum seeker's individual circumstances.  Turkey has provided a series of formal guarantees as part of the EU-Turkey agreement, including that Syrian refugees returned to Turkey will be granted temporary protection upon return.  Non-Syrians in need of international protection who are returned to Turkey will also be able to apply for and receive protection there.  On 4 May, the European Commission reported that Turkey has received all those returned from Greece in accordance with the agreement.</p>  <p>  I share the concern as evidenced by the Deputy and I wish to assure her that we will continue to monitor the situation.  Ireland is one of a number of countries that continues to provide humanitarian aid to the region, which is obviously a priority in terms of the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and other displaced persons.</p></speech>

Permission must be sought in advance for landings by all foreign military aircraft, including US aircraft, and, if granted, is subject to strict conditions.  These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, must not engage in intelligence gathering, the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations and the aircraft must carry no arms, ammunition or explosives.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has primary responsibility for the regulation of foreign civil aircraft in Ireland.  Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order of 1973, the carriage of munitions of war through Irish airspace or Irish airports is prohibited on civil aircraft unless an exemption has been obtained from the Minister.  In considering applications for exemptions, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport consults with a number of Departments, including my Department.  However, the final decision on all applications lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to whom any questions regarding the quantity of munitions transported by civil aircraft landing at Shannon Airport should be addressed.</p>  <p>  In considering requests for landings by foreign military aircraft, my Department&rsquo;s primary focus is on whether the flights in question comply with conditions which I have already outlined.  These conditions do not include a requirement in relation to the numbers and designation of passengers.  Accordingly, my Department does not compile records of the numbers of passengers, including military personnel, travelling on foreign military aircraft.</p>  <p>  Any queries regarding the numbers of US military personnel who pass through Shannon Airport on chartered civil aircraft should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

The Minister says that permission must be sought in advance and the final decision, extraordinarily, rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, not with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Department of Defence.  It is an extraordinary system that allows Ministers to pass responsibility from one to the other without really taking responsibility for 1 million troops passing through Shannon.  Even if those 1 million troops do not have arms, ammunition or explosives,  although we cannot prove that, they are still going through for a reason.  These human beings are being used to engage in war on other people through invasion.  The Minister cannot deny that affects decent foreign policy.</p></speech>

Permission is subject to a strict set of conditions and criteria.  Bilateral relations between friendly nations are founded on mutual trust and both parties have an interest in maintaining that trust.  Details provided by diplomatic missions, including confirmation that aircraft are unarmed and carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, are therefore accepted in good faith as being accurate.  In accordance with international practice, foreign military aircraft which are granted permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection.</p></speech>
