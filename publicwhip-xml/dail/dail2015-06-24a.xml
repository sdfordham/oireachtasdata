Has the Department carried out a social impact assessment, or an assessment of the possible effects on those who will lose out thereby?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400003#A00500"><p>The purpose of the reform of the one-parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into employment and thus to increase their income.  I welcome the considerable debate generated by this reform, which commenced in 2012.  My priority is to ensure that as a society we arrive at a situation in which lone parents have the same opportunities as everyone else to access employment, training and education.  For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast and confined to social welfare dependency.  Despite the commitment of extensive funding to lone-parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain most at risk of poverty, and their children are at high risk of poverty.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three quarters compared to those who do not work.</p>  <p>  The Department has published a social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures of budget 2015 and of the water charges.  It found that the household incomes of employed lone parents will increase by almost 0.8%, while those of unemployed lone parents will increase by 0.6%.  This positive outcome for lone parents reflects the increases in child benefit, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, the reduction of the USC for many lone parents in work, the back-to-work family dividend and the maintenance of the disregard at &euro;90.  It has not been possible to capture the full impact of the one-parent family reforms using the Switch model.  It is hoped this will be possible as part of the ongoing development of the model.  For instance, the model cannot capture the value to a person on full social welfare of having a medical card, for example, compared to a person in work on a low wage who might not qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  In the next budget I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single-parent families.  In particular, I want to look at the scope for further improvements in child benefit as well as other supports for families in full-time or part-time employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400003#A00600"><p>Obviously the Department has not done an assessment of the specific impact of this measure on lone parents, many thousands of whom will lose out.  Apparently an impact assessment was done on the budget measures and, according to the Minister, this showed that all lone parents, working or not working, would be better off as a result of the changes being introduced by the Government.  It is a wonder that lone parents from one end of the country to the other are not doing cartwheels with delight now that they are all going to be better off.  I wonder what they are all worried about.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the fact that there are problems in this system at present.  I remind her that a problem is not solved by adding to it.  The Minister gave a specific and solemn commitment to this House that she would not introduce this change until we had a Scandinavian-type child care system in this country.  When I asked her about it she said that child care was a matter for another Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  However, this change in the criteria for lone parent allowance is a matter exclusively for herself.  Does she intend to renege on the solemn promise she gave to this House and, through the House, to the lone parents from one end of this country to the other?  Does she intend to renege on this promise or to keep the commitment she made to lone parents?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, because he discussed it with me, I introduced a seven-year transition from the age of seven to 14.  The Deputy well knows that in this transition period we gave lone parents opportunities and encouragement to become involved in education and training - to become involved in the Department's activation services - but there is no obligation on lone parents to be actively seeking work, which is the basic requirement for jobseeker's allowance.  During the seven-year transition period I hope and expect that the country will change child care very significantly for the better.  We have already introduced the back-to-work family dividend scheme, in which hundreds of people have participated.</p></speech>

We have provided more than &euro;20 million for that in the budget.  Through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but with funding from the Department of Social Protection, we introduced after-school supports for parents who need after-school support.  In co-operation with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is currently examining the use of school buildings after school hours to provide after-school services for parents who may need an extra hour or two while they travel from the workplace to collect a child from school.</p></speech>

She promised she would not introduce this change until we had a Scandinavian child care system in this country.  She has not done that.  The answer to my question is that she intends to renege on her promise.  The Taoiseach said something yesterday which the T&aacute;naiste has said on many occasions, namely, that many working lone parents, who ironically are the only lone parents affected by these changes, can make themselves better off by working more hours because they will then be eligible for family income supplement, FIS.  Does the T&aacute;naiste realise that lone parents are not entitled to knock on their employers' doors to demand additional hours?  Even if there was such an entitlement, in many cases they could not avail of the additional hours due to the lack of affordable child care.  Does she also realise that people who are in receipt of FIS because they work more than 19 hours per week will be penalised by this change?  I received correspondence yesterday from somebody in the Taoiseach's constituency who is working 20 hours per week for &euro;10 per hour and is in receipt of FIS.  This person would gain exactly &euro;15 per week for five extra hours of work, which is less than half the minimum wage.  Does the T&aacute;naiste regard that as acceptable?</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to removing barriers which prevent people with disabilities from availing of employment opportunities.  My Department provides a wide range of work related supports which will cost an estimated &euro;37 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  While any person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the Intreo service on a voluntary basis, a complete range of activation supports is being provided initially in ten locations and it is planned to expand the number of locations over time, based on operational experience.  I commenced this initiative some time ago in ten locations around the country.  The Department&rsquo;s employment supports for people with disabilities focus on those who wish to take up work in the open labour market and have the capacity to do so.  This is done in accordance with the individual who has the disability.  The principal supports include the wage subsidy scheme and the employ ability service.  An independent review of the latter is currently under way, with a view to ensuring that the service is operating effectively.  Procedures are already in place to reinstate social welfare payments for those who are no longer able to work.  Participants on the partial capacity benefit scheme, which I introduced a number of years ago, can return to illness benefit or invalidity pension if they find that they cannot continue to work.  For example, a person who has multiple sclerosis and is in receipt the partial capacity benefit will still qualify for his or her original payment if he or she is unable to work.  If he or she subsequently goes into remission, he or she can return to the partial capacity benefit.  We are anxious to facilitate increasing participation in employment for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

However, it is recognised that some of our employment supports lack ambition and could be more comprehensive, and this is one of the reasons I prepared the aforementioned proposals, which are not exhaustive.  A substantially lower number of people with physical or mental disabilities end up in employment in Ireland compared to other countries.  In Switzerland, 80% of people with spinal injuries return to work, whereas in Ireland 78% of people with spinal injuries are unemployed.  We need greater ambition in this regard.  What are the Minister's intentions for the Intreo offices and for shifting attitudes away from concentrating on disabilities to a focus on abilities?  That is a key issue not only for the Civil Service, but also society in general.</p></speech>

An individual who suffers from an ongoing condition or is recovering from a serious illness can return to work on the partial capacity benefit and qualify for the social welfare disability payment if his or her condition deteriorates.  It is important for people that they are not required to reapply for payments.  I meet the disability groups on a regular basis and had a meeting with them recently.  Perhaps the scheme could be used by more people but I think it is working well.</p>  <p>  I have also rolled out the disability activation, DACT, pilot project, which Sinn F&eacute;in has praised.  The scheme has been under way for a number of years, including the Walk PEER programme, which is available in several north-eastern counties.</p><p>The programme is currently being evaluated by Indecon International Economic Consultants with a view to seeing what learning there is, particularly regarding young adults with a disability, many of whom are focused on the Walk PEER programme, to which the Deputy referred.  We are making good progress on employment supports and the policy.  I anticipate being in a position to launch it shortly.  The staff and voluntary groups involved in disability have been of enormous assistance in developing the programme.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the Walk programme.  There is an urgency regarding pilot programmes such as the Walk programme and, hopefully, the Minister will find in their favour and allow the approach they have taken away from disability towards ability as a model that needs to be followed.  I urge the Minister to find in their favour quickly so there is no gap in services for some people.  Young people with disabilities are excluded from the Youth Guarantee.  Could the Minister give a commitment to examine this aspect, which may need only a minor change?</p></speech>

The key factor is that people should be able to engage voluntarily in all the services the Department offers.  We have rolled all of it out on a consistent basis.  I am very ambitious to see much more take-up of the opportunities.  In practice, if people are interested in the Youth Guarantee, the staff will go out of their way to include them.  As the Deputy knows, the Youth Guarantee involves calling in young people, talking to them and getting them to make a life plan.  With people who have a disability, we have taken a voluntary approach, given that we do not want people to feel they are being asked to do something for which they do not feel they are ready.  I have no difficulty with the Youth Guarantee.</p></speech>

A person with one child who works 19 hours per week at the minimum wage will receive approximately &euro;165 in wages and another &euro;230 per week from my Department between family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  This will bring the person&rsquo;s income up to &euro;400 compared to a lone parent with one child who will receive approximately &euro;219 per week, comprising &euro;188.95 in personal rate and &euro;29.80 in the weekly qualified child increase.

Where these individuals are in employment and they are transitioning from the one-parent family payment to another social welfare payment, most will opt for the seven-year transition about which I spoke to Deputy O'Dea, in order to take into account the difficulties and responsibilities that lone parents have.  The seven-year transition would bring a child from the age of seven up to the age of 14.  A lone parent who is working 19 hours per week at the national minimum wage and in receipt of the one-parent family payment, the family income supplement, FIS, and rent supplement, will see very little difference in his or her weekly income.  The FIS will be automatically increased and the rent supplement contribution will, due to the loss of the one-parent family payment, decrease by &euro;56 per week.  Despite this decrease, the person would be better off.  The Deputy can see the figures in the reply.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>This means that their weekly income following the July reforms rises from &euro;309 to &euro;310.  Lone parents who experience a financial loss as a result of the age reforms will be able to have their rent supplement reviewed which may result in a reduction in their rent supplement contribution.  This will reduce or even eliminate their financial losses in some cases.  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as earnings increase.  This means that a lone parent affected by the July reforms who is in receipt of the rent supplement and who increases their hours of employment, may see their rent supplement contribution increase as a result of their higher earnings from employment.  However, despite this increase, these individuals will still maintain an incentive to increase their hours of employment.</p></speech>

The comparisons she makes are entirely dishonest.  The real comparison is where were lone parents who were working 20 hours per week on minimum wage in 2012 before the Minister started her cuts and where will they be after July and, worse, after July 2017.  In 2012, before the Minister cut the income disregard, a lone parent with one child working 20 hours per week received &euro;481, including FIS.  Prior to the July cuts the Minister is planning, it had decreased to &euro;453.  After July, it will decrease to &euro;402.60 and after July 2017, it will decrease to &euro;372.  It is a cumulative loss for a working person of &euro;109.  This does not take into account the loss of the rent allowance the person will suffer or the fact that FIS is calculated against rent allowance, another sneaky cut the Minister has brought in.</p></speech>

We must be careful not to discriminate against families in a relationship, either a marriage or a partnership.  We want all children and families treated in the same way with the same possibility for prosperity and financial independence.  As I said to Deputy O'Dea, in the era to which Deputy Boyd Barrett refers, lone parents were four and a half times more at risk of being in poverty.  Since the changes and the encouragement of lone parents into work, on a seven-year transitional basis, which people such as the Deputy conveniently ignore, the risk of those lone parents being in consistent poverty has almost halved to two and a half times.  This is reality and the Deputy forgets that the first action I took, in the first Social Welfare Bill I brought before the House, was to restore the minimum wage, which Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party had reduced by &euro;1 per hour, to &euro;8.65 per hour.  I do not understand the Deputy's calculations.  He should be fair.</p></speech>

Our figures are spot on.  They are an accurate reflection of what has been lost.  They are borne out by the CSO figures which show, contrary to what the Minister just said, that the number of one-parent families suffering deprivation has risen from 49% to 63% since she started her cuts.</p><p>The number living in consistent poverty has risen from 17.4% to 23%, while the number of children living in poverty has increased by 137,000 since the Minister started her cuts, the overwhelming majority of whom are children of lone parents.  The Minister is talking absolute nonsense.  The cuts have reduced the benefit that lone parents received from working.  In 2012, 60% of lone parents were working but now only 36% of them are doing so.  The change has had the opposite effect of that claimed by the Minister.</p></speech>

The impact of social transfers in Ireland is significant.  Furthermore, in the last budget I increased child benefit, introduced the back to work family dividend and reintroduced the family Christmas bonus, which was very strongly welcomed by lone parents.  The figures show that for a lone parent who is in work, the risk of poverty is much lower than for a lone parent who is out of work.</p>  <p>  In most countries, the transition from being solely defined as a lone parent happens when the child reaches the age of five or earlier, whereas in Ireland the transition begins at seven years of age and there is a seven year transition period while, as a country, we address the child care issues that we must address.</p></speech>

In such cases, the person concerned has a liability to repay the money.  When deductions are being implemented from ongoing social welfare entitlements, the person is notified in writing of the proposed amount to be deducted and provided with the opportunity to detail any circumstances he or she feels may be relevant to the rate of recovery proposed.  Any information received from the person is considered in deciding on the amount of the deduction.</p>  <p>  The total amount of overpayments in 2011 was approximately &euro;92 million.  Of this, almost &euro;35 million was due to fraud, around &euro;40 million due to customer error, approximately &euro;6 million related to departmental error and &euro;11 million was in respect of estate cases.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed assets of customers, usually pensioners, come to light after their deaths. The total value of overpayments in 2012 was &euro;97 million, broken down as follows: almost &euro;41 million was due to fraud, &euro;36 million due to customer error, &euro;8 million due to departmental error and &euro;12 million was in respect of overpayments from estate cases.  In 2013, total overpayments amounted to approximately &euro;127 million.  Of this, almost &euro;62 million was due to fraud, over &euro;43 million was due to customer error, approximately &euro;7 million related to departmental error and &euro;15 million was from estate cases.</p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that 95% of the value of social welfare overpayments are as a result of failure on the part of claimants to inform the Department of a change in circumstances or of their full circumstances .  More than half of these are suspected to be fraudulent.  Approximately 5% of the value of overpayments are due to departmental error.  I am not in a position to provide details on overpayments in 2014 or 2015 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are currently being audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

How many prosecutions have taken place in the past few years?  Has there been an increase in prosecutions?  The special investigations unit was set up in 2012.

However, in terms of the social contract, any level of overpayment, particularly one which arises from a conscious mis-statement of circumstances or fraud undermines the basic social welfare contract in that people at work who are paying PRSI do not want to see money which could be given to old age pensioners, people out of work or lone parents being misused by people who have no entitlement to it.  </p>  <p>  In recent times there have been quite a number of prosecutions.  We have also introduced facial recognition technology in association with the new personal services cards, more than one million of which have been issued.  We have identified a number of cases which have been prosecuted in the courts where people had multiple identities and were claiming multiple social welfare payments at different offices.

That means that if a person's basic rate is &euro;188, up to 15% of that can be deducted.  This does not affect payments issuing to the rest of the household or payments like child benefit.  We can recover up to 15%, giving a deduction of around &euro;25 per week, depending on individual circumstances.  Prior to the introduction of that legislation the Department could only recover &euro;2 per week from claimants.  To be perfectly honest, some people who had been involved in fraud were basically giving two fingers to their neighbours who were going out to work and paying their PRSI, to the Department and to Irish society as a whole.</p>  <p>  I will forward the detailed figures the Deputy has requested but the situation has improved significantly.

If the Department continues in this way, it will further undermine local post offices, especially in rural areas.</p></reply>

In this context, the Department considers that the forms should reflect the choices being made by new customers - the forms in question relate to new customers - on what payment channel they opt for.  The fact is that more and more of the Department's customers are opting for payment of their social welfare entitlements directly into their bank accounts, particularly people who are retiring on a contributory pension who already have bank accounts and typically received their wages or salary through their bank accounts.  Almost always, they want to continue the bank account arrangement.</p><p>To ensure that the Department's forms present payment options equally I have asked the Department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in respect of payment options is provided and to ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p><p>The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network.  It is clear in the programme for Government.  It is a key piece of social infrastructure in urban and rural areas.  It is Government policy that An Post will remain a strong and feasible company in a position to provide a high-quality postal service that will maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.</p><p>My Department relies on An Post to provide a payment service for people who do not have a bank account.  I cannot emphasise that enough.  The Department is heavily reliant on An Post.  This, in turn, provides An Post and post offices throughout the country with some valuable business.  For example, we are paying An Post approximately &euro;54 million this year for services, a significant sum of money and a vital source of income for post offices throughout the country.  That is our commitment to the network.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The post office network business development group, chaired by Bobby Kerr, has decided that the future of the post office will be best secured through the development of a more sustainable business model, including the development of financial services, which is identified by the group as fundamental to the future of the post office network.  The development by An Post of a payment account will be critical to a more sustainable business model as society inexorably moves to electronic rather than cash payments.  The post office network cannot remain reliant on an income stream from my Department for cash payments to its clients where an increasing number of social welfare recipients wish to receive payments to their bank accounts.</p></speech>

That is paid to An Post rather than the post offices.  It is a pity that An Post does not pay it to the post offices directly, but that is a different matter.</p>  <p>  I have a social welfare form here - the Minister has seen some of these forms - and it states that the Department recommends direct payment to the customer's current, deposit or savings accounts in a financial institution.  That is the first port of call.  It is only if a customer does not have an account in a financial institution that the Department asks the customer to indicate the post office where the customer wishes for the payment to be made.  That is a direction from the Department rather than an option.  That is a change in the way the Department works.</p>  <p>  I have given out before about how T&uacute;s workers must have a bank account to receive their payment from the Department of Social Protection.  The payment is not facilitated through the post office service.  If the Department continues this migration then the contract will obviously drop substantially.  The Minister should bear in mind that most people receiving social welfare payments in the State are usually dependent on it.  If the Department starts making them go to financial institutions it will impose an extra cost on them which is not on them at the moment with An Post.  There are transaction costs in most financial institutions.</p></speech>

I imagine Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh goes to the post office to collect his child benefit but, increasingly, many families, individuals and pensioners already have a bank account and they opt to use their bank account.  Is Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh suggesting that we should force people not to use their bank account and to use the post office option?  I do not believe that, as a Government, we can do that.  What we can do and what the Kerr group has recently recommended - I strongly support the proposal - is that there should be a standard bank account.</p>  <p>  As a result of the collapse of the banks the development of the standard bank account fell behind.  As I have said on many occasions, if the post office system had a standard bank account then the post office would be able to provide a composite range of financial services.  This applies in rural Ireland particularly and in urban areas, including in my constituency and the constituencies of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Deputy O'Dea, where there are no banks on the local main street.  I have conveyed this view to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p></speech>

This is what is available in Ireland at the moment.  If the Department changed the form to indicate that if the customer does not wish to indicate a post office, he or she could indicate a financial institution, then it would be a difference and would recognise the prominence that has been given to the post office and the postal service in this country in terms of social welfare payments over the years.  It does not prevent either pensioners or those in receipt of child benefit from getting payment in a financial institution, but it is a difference of emphasis.  The Department needs to look at that.</p>  <p>  There is an extra cost on senior citizens or anyone using banks in this country.  In the past I was with EBS and I had free banking.  I do not have that anymore because the State took over AIB and EBS and every transaction now has a cost.  I can sustain that, but those on social welfare do not necessarily have the ability to sustain an extra cost.</p>  <p>  The last question was to do with fraud.  One of the quickest ways to deal with fraud is for a social welfare customer to present in person to the post office with a card.  In that way the customer has a one-to-one transaction with an official, whereas banking can be done anonymously and there is no need to have that interaction.</p></speech>

The main business that the post office gets from us at the moment comprises two elements.  One is the fact that we require anyone who is receiving jobseeker's payments to collect their money in person at the post office.  That is a major element of the business of the post office and accounts for over 20 million transactions.  The second element relates to people who do not have a bank account and who opt to use their local post office, and long may they continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I have asked to have the form reassessed with a view to making the language more neutral.  That is under way at the moment.  I believe people should have an option in respect of what is best for their circumstances.</p></speech>

These forms are reviewed, designed and updated all the time, and I have asked for that to be done.</p>  <p>  There is a wider point.  We should move to a standard bank account for people who currently do not have a bank account.  There are so many transactions nowadays in society - not necessarily to do with social welfare, it applies in other areas as well - that the availability of a standard bank account from a local post office would be a great boon to the post office and a great boon to doing business in rural and urban areas where there are post offices.</p></speech>

As I said to colleagues earlier, I am looking at all the social welfare payments in the context of the budget.  Last year for lone parents and all parents I was happy to be able to increase child benefit and bring in the back to work family dividend for lone parents.  I am aware of the concerns which have been raised around the reforms of the one-parent family payment.</p><p>While I welcome the debate that has been generated by the reforms, my priority is to ensure that we as a society arrive at a situation in which lone parents have the same opportunities to access employment, training and education as all others.  For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been confined to social welfare dependency, and despite the provision of extensive funding to lone parent payments, the one-parent family payment scheme has not succeeded in preventing lone parents from being more at risk of poverty than the population as a whole.  I am concerned that the outcome for their children is not as good as it should be.  Therefore, the Department will now work with lone parents on a one-to-one basis to provide them with enhanced access to the Department's supports and services.<br/><br/>In regard to people at risk of homelessness, two weeks ago the organisations informed me of their concerns about the number of families becoming homeless, particularly families that are not aware of the supports that are available.  I wish to stress again that if the Deputy is aware of anybody who is at risk of becoming homeless, she should advise him or her to call to the Department's community welfare service, because we have a protocol in place which allows us to review the rent allowance.  We have done that already in a significant number of cases in Dublin city and around the country.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>While responsibility for provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities, the Department has put in place a number of preventative measures to ensure that people at risk of homelessness are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  The Department is actively communicating information on these supports, including by text message to all rent supplement beneficiaries.  These measures allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs on a case-by-case basis.  The community welfare service of the Department has a statutory discretionary power to increase a supplement for rental purposes, including when dealing with applicants who are in danger of homelessness.  These measures are kept under review to ensure that the appropriate supports are provided.</p></speech>

Also, I have been encouraging people who are experiencing problems in the area of rent supplement to go to the community welfare and social protection offices.  However, as we know, one-parent families have suffered higher deprivation and poverty rates than the general population and now they are having to withstand a further cut.  My concern relates to the detrimental effect of this on children.  We know from the Ombudsman's report that back in 2008, some 6.8% of children were in consistent poverty.  This year, that figure has risen to 11.7%, indicating an increase in childhood poverty.  We have met the housing organisations and have heard the same statistics from them.  Their great fear is that children may now join the numbers of rough sleepers.</p>  <p>  The Minister is proceeding with the change to the structure of the payments.  How well will that be monitored, and if the organisations' fears are realised, how quickly can the Department address that situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400008#F00300"><p>In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, the risk of consistent poverty for lone parents was more than four and a half times that of the population as a whole.  In 2015, the risk of consistent poverty for lone parents is two and a half times that of the rest of the population.  Therefore, the risk of poverty has halved in relative terms.  It should also be noted that the latest CSO figures indicating that 23% of one-parent families are living in consistent poverty include both people who are in work and those who are not in work.  The CSO study tells me that for lone parents who are at work, the consistent poverty rates are much lower, at approximately 10%.  I do not think 10%, or two and a half times the poverty risk of the rest of the population, is acceptable.</p>  <p>  If a lone parent with one child can get 19 hours' work at the minimum wage of &euro;165, for example, and also gets approximately &euro;230 per week in family income supplement and back-to-work family dividend from the Department, it gives that parent an income of &euro;400 which is not taxable.  This is a tremendous improvement on the figure of &euro;188 plus &euro;30 for one child which he or she would get if on lone parent allowance alone.</p></speech>

I do not know which lone parents she has been meeting, but I have been hearing a different story from those I have met regarding what faces them.  It is ironic that the One Family organisation issued a press release last March welcoming the fact that the Minister reversed the cuts to the carer's allowance for lone parents.  The organisation said that was a lifeline for most vulnerable families with children who also care for a family member who is ill, elderly or has special needs.  This was a welcome reversal, but now we are seeing genuine fear.</p>  <p>  I could read out letters I have received from lone parents in my constituency about the difference this cut will make to them.  They want the best possible outcomes for their children and they want the same opportunities for them as other families.  However, they are not able to get that.</p></speech>

This service has already assisted approximately 2,000 families on a one-to-one basis.</p>  <p>  In regard to the changes in social welfare, as we are getting people back to work - we have got the unemployment rate down from 15.2% to 9.85% - the key to achieving this has been the Intreo office, which is a friendly place where people get income support and advice and can avail of support services.  As a consequence, many people, including young people who might have felt they would never find work, have been assisted.  I attended a graduation ceremony recently of young people involved in work.  The key to success in this is one-to-one engagement.  Therefore, I encourage the Deputy to ask some of the people affected to consider calling into the Intreo office and talking to an employment officer so we can see whether we can improve their situation, particularly their housing situation.</p></speech>

The Department provides a wide range of work-related supports, which in 2015 will cost approximately &euro;37 million, solely for persons with a disability.  A person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the Intreo service on a voluntary basis.  A complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is provided in ten locations.  This number will be extended over time based on operational experience.</p>  <p>  The youth guarantee implementation plan provides for the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by Intreo with young unemployed people on the live register.  Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to develop and evaluate options to extend employment services to people not on the live register and improve the promotion and communication of existing activation options for this group.  Young people with disabilities will be considered in this context.  It is important to ensure that young people with disabilities get these opportunities.  The MOMENTUM programme operated by SOLAS for the Department of Education and Skills was designed to provide free education and training to long-term jobseekers.  The Department is positively disposed to opening access to the MOMENTUM programme to people with disabilities and is currently investigating and considering how this group can be accommodated in the programme.</p></reply>

There are activation measures to encourage the unemployed off the dole queues and into employment and it is only fair and just that those with a disability should have equal access to those activation measures.  I received communication from the Disability Federation of Ireland which states that those on disability payments, for example, are not included on the live register and, therefore, are discriminated against when they seek activation and employment opportunities on a par with their non-disabled peers.  Did I understand the Minister of State to say that all activation measures, apart from the MOMENTUM and the Youth Guarantee, are available on a voluntary basis to those with a disability?  Could I get clarification on that?  When can we expect those programmes to be extended to those with a disability, even on a voluntary basis?</p></speech>

He is quite correct.  The unemployment rate was at 15%, and heading for 500,000, but more than 100,000 net new jobs have been created in the economy since February 2012 and we have seen the unemployment rate drop into single figures.  In the disability sector, the unemployment rate is far too high.  It is key that the Intreo services are provided on a voluntary basis.  Those are available in ten locations, including the one in Limerick.  We want to roll the service out to all the other Intreo centres but we need to see what is the operational experience of that.  The Minister and I want to provide the best service we possible can for those with disabilities.  As I stated earlier, the State is spending &euro;37 million solely on activation measures for persons with a disability.</p></speech>

The Disability Federation of Ireland has also brought to my attention that the probability of exit, PEX, score, used by the Department of Social Protection, measures the probability of exit from the live register.  The Disability Federation of Ireland and other organisations representing those with a disability are unhappy that the PEX is a one-size-fits-all structure.  They are unhappy that it is not designed to accommodation variables associated with disabling conditions.  Has that been brought to the Minister of State's attention and is the Department looking at that?</p></speech>

I have not looked at that recently but I certainly will do so.</p>  <p>  I am quite happy to debate the 100,000 net new jobs that have been created since February 2012.  When that target was announced, I remember Members on the Opposition benches stating it was overly ambitious, it would not be delivered and we would be looking at 2017.  The plan was that over 100,000 jobs would be created in the economy by 2016.  We have done that this year, a year ahead of schedule.  In fact, there have been 104,464 net jobs created in the economy.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for acknowledging that.  Certainly, the best way out of poverty is getting into work and for those who have taken up employment, it has transformed their lives.  Sadly, there are not more jobs.  There are far too many still unemployed but we are rebuilding the country from the mess that we were left with.</p></speech>

The tenancy sustainable protocol in January was welcome and has helped.  The previous reply we got in the House from the Minister stated that 500 families had been uplifted at that time.  That was a few weeks ago.  However, I would like to know the numbers of those who were refused.  The Minister did not recognise that the Department did not have a legal leg to stand on in relation to uplifts and market rents, which is why the sustainability protocol emerged.  Making a family homeless through lack of support of rent supplement was not an option to the Minister, even though she slashed it by hundreds of millions of euro in the past four years.</p></reply>

Over 5,600 claims have been awarded in 2015, of which almost 1,600 are in Dublin.</p><p>In response to the current market difficulties, the Department has implemented preventative measures under rent supplement to provide for flexibility in assessing customers' individual accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  The framework applies both to existing rent supplement customers and also to new applicants who qualify for the scheme.  Under this approach, tenants' circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits throughout the country as appropriate.  Notices have issued to community welfare service staff, twice within the past 12 month period, reminding them of their discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes.  The Department is also working with Threshold's tenancy sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute.</p><p>This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,100 rent supplement households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through the payment of increased rent payments.  A divisional breakdown of this figure is provided in the following tabular statement.  Statistics are not maintained regarding the total number of applications made for increased payments or their outcome.  However, where community welfare service staff are notified of a potential threat of tenancy loss due to rising rents, flexibility is provided where the uplift request is reasonable and in line with local rents for similar properties.</p><p>The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign which seeks to encourage tenants at risk to contact the Department or the Threshold tenancy protection service as early as possible.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping the Department's response under review to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided.</p><p>Increased Rental Payments by Division &ndash; 15 June 2015<table><tr><th><div><b>Division</b></div></th><th><div><b>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</b></div></th><th><div><b>Awards under protocol with Threshold</b></div></th><th><div><b>Awards under Rent Supp. Initiative</b></div></th><th><div><b>Total no. of increased payments by Division</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>North East</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>South East</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Midlands South</div></td><td><div>315</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>315</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mid-West</div></td><td><div>52</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork Central</div></td><td><div>45</div></td><td><div>21</div></td><td></td><td><div>66</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>North West</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>West</div></td><td><div>28</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mid Leinster</div></td><td><div>58</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>58</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>South West</div></td><td><div>25</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Midlands North</div></td><td><div>128</div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div>128</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin North/Dublin South/Dublin Central</div></td><td><div>658</div></td><td><div>698</div></td><td><div>84</div></td><td><div>1,436</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>Overall Total</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,344</b></div></td><td><div><b>719</b></div></td><td><div><b>84</b></div></td><td><div><b>2,147</b></div></td></tr></table></p></speech>

He states there are no statistics.  The biggest failure of this Government by far has been housing.  As I said to the Taoiseach here a couple of weeks ago, and as both of the Ministers at the Department will be aware, every Thursday and Friday evening the homeless unit in Parkgate Street is completely under siege.  Each weekend perhaps 70 families are not able to receive any emergency accommodation.  There is no room at the inn for those families day after day, week after week.  It is an intolerable situation.  Some Members in this House have criticised Greece but this is a situation that mirrors or is worse than some of what is happening in Greece.  We have five or six hotels completely full.  We have dozens of other hotels and guest houses where many rooms are taken up with such families.  The previous figures, which the Government only gave us in April last, showed that over 1,100 children and 500 families were homeless.</p>  <p>  There has been no action on this matter.  Next week a Minister will visit my constituency, Dublin Bay North, where hundreds of families are homeless, to launch a couple of dozen apartments.  The Minister of State's colleague, Senator Hayden, is holding a meeting today about the deficiencies of rent supplement.  Will he bring in legislation on rent regulation and at long last, before this Government ends, declare a housing emergency and introduce the equivalent of FEMPI for housing?</p></speech>

Traditionally, departmental officials did not meet people on a one-to-one basis to support them.  In the two years of the changes to date, approximately 19,000 lone parents have entered the transitional arrangement, so we now have a great deal of experience of how it works.  People are called into group interviews to make them aware of the Department's services, followed by meetings on a one-to-one basis.  It is like the Youth Guarantee, in that we are asking people to make life plans for their futures in terms of education, training and employment.</p>  <p>  At the height of the boom in 2004, the number of lone parents who were at risk of poverty was four and a half times that of people who were not lone parents.  In 2015, the changes have led to that figure decreasing to two and a half times.  In any case of which Deputy Durkan is aware, I would ask the person to visit an employment officer and discuss the individual circumstances, and we will see what is possible.

I suggest that the mindset associated with the way that legislation was designed made this information a commodity.  I do not think data protection and privacy were at the core of what was being talked about.  The subsequent review conducted by Gemserv - the privacy audit - showed that there were concerns about privacy.  A summary, more or less, was produced, but not the actual audit itself.  It seems to me that data protection was not at the heart of the mindset of the Government and the Civil Service when they were approaching this issue.</p><p>Essentially, my aim in this amendment is to create some sanctions for breaches.  It seems to me that one will have to prove there is a breach.  One will have to prove damage if it is an individual.  I do not think individuals are going to breach this.  I suggest that big organisations will be far more likely to use information as a commodity.  I do not see where there will be a sanction for companies outside Ireland, and indeed companies outside the European Union.  Once they have bought information, they will be able to sell it on.  Given that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has the statutory authority to deal with breaches of data protection, I do not understand why it was not central to the thinking when this legislation was being put together.</p><p>I do not see where this Bill provides the means for an individual to prove damage.  A system that means that one has to rely on going to the courts to spend a long time dealing with a matter of this nature is really not accessible to the average person on the street.  All of what I am trying to do is aimed at the bigger entities.  I think there is a real risk that a company outside the EU will buy the whole data set in order to replicate it and sell it on.  If our data audit says something different, it is important for the Minister to tell us about it.  I think there is a mindset that the Government will have to change.  On one hand, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is talking to us about a more open approach to government -  I am quite energised by what he is saying - yet on the other, this initiative is putting the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the periphery and using data as a commodity.</p><p>If we examine what is happening across Europe, particularly in the UK, we will see that an intuitive approach is being taken.  If we were taking a more open approach, we might use the prefix &quot;KE&quot; for Kildare, followed by a code like &quot;300&quot; for Leixlip and another code like &quot;200&quot;, &quot;155&quot; or &quot;A&quot; for the relevant housing estate.  We could choose any combination of letters and numbers.  It is only at that point that we would need to include the individual householder's name.  It is not as if addresses are particularly secret at the moment.  I know people complain about the misuse of the electoral register for the purposes of marketing and things like that.  Obviously, that is a data set that is sold.  It is not entirely correct.  The 31 individual registers comprise a fairly comprehensive data set.  We seem to be going the opposite way here in terms of the approach to this.  It is in place now.  I presume there is a contract.  The very least we need to do is put in place some real safeguards.</p><p>I do not think we are particularly great at designing institutions or things like this.  I had a recent experience with regard to the Stock Exchange where there was at least a possibility of insider trading.  I am using this as an example.  When I wrote to the Stock Exchange, I was told to write to the Central Bank.  When I wrote to the Central Bank, I was told to write to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which essentially told me that it does not have a role in this regard, or at least that there was nothing to complain about.  Given that there is no route for making a complaint, is it a big surprise to us that, years after the legislation making insider trading an offence was put in place, there has not been a single solitary prosecution?  In the absence of a practical means for individuals to make a complaint when they believe damage has been done to them, there is no sanction.  The lack of a reasonable sanction in support of those whose data is potentially compromised is a real flaw in this legislation.  I really do not see where the sanctions are.  This is all aimed at large corporations that engage in wholesale marketing.  I do not see where there is an adequate sanction in this legislation.  I am seeking to remedy that in some of the amendments I have proposed.</p></speech>

I have asked why the State has spent so much money on designing a system that is unique to this country.  What business problem will be resolved by the use of this system?  It is a simple question.  The Minister has listed five or six business objectives, but nobody has explained what business processes will change to deliver those objectives.  They are more like aspirations that could be listed than business problems to be solved.</p><p>I cannot understand why we have spent so much, and relied so much, on one firm of management consultants to advise - I use the word "advise" in quotes - on this project from the very beginning right through to the preparation of the functional and technical design and requests for and submission of tenders.  This is a licence to print money.  I described it as the gift that keeps on giving for management consultants.  I am sorry that I and the D&aacute;il have to spend so much time on something that should be very simple, the setting up of a postcode system.  It is ill-conceived.  A postcode in this country is an excellent idea.  It should have been simple, straightforward and inexpensive.  Principally, it should have been inexpensive.  We have allowed those who have commercial considerations to convince us that we need something more complex that will continue to give money to the company.  I believe it is wrong.</p> <p> Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have tabled more or less the same amendments on the data protection aspects of this legislation .  It is establishing a very dangerous precedent.  That the normal data protection legislation does not cover this and we have to incorporate it into primary legislation is precedent.  Government-generated data will be sold off to companies in Ireland, Europe or throughout the world, which may then resell that data to other companies, yet this legislation is intended to protect data in this country.  That will not and cannot happen.  It all stems from the fact that we decided, on the advice of management consultants, to introduce a complex system where complexity was neither necessary nor desirable, and it will not do what the Minister says it says on the tin.  It has not been demonstrated to me that it will do what it says on the tin.  It is the gift that will keep on giving to management consultants.  People will pay big bucks for that data and this legislation will not stop them from reselling or misusing the data they have purchased.</p> <p> I will oppose this legislation at every stage in the process because the substantive amendments that I and others have tabled have not been accepted.  Even had those amendments on the data protection element been made, the very creation of the system is opening up a precedent whereby Government-sponsored data can be bought by private companies anywhere in the world and resold to whomever they wish with no controls over the dissemination or use of that data.</p> <p> I could go on for an hour about this, but I do not see the point.  I have raised these issues before and pointed out my serious concerns.  Time will prove that my concerns and the concerns of Deputy Catherine Murphy are well-founded, and it will cost the State a lot of money to clean up the mess this will create.</p></speech>

There is genuine concern that we have to bring in a Bill to amend the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  The public do not seem to be convinced that this Bill will protect data in the way in which it is intended.  The Minister should take account of that.  We need to have total confidence that any legislation that goes through the House protects the data it covers.</p></speech>

I do so, and have done so, and I regard it as being of considerable importance.</p>  <p>  Section 66C(2) of the Bill clarifies that section 6A of the Data Protection Act 1988, which relates to the processing of personal data which is likely to cause damage or distress, does not apply where processing is necessary to undertake a legitimate activity in relation to the postcode.  This would cover a situation in which an owner or occupier of a property disagrees with the matching of his or her address to an Eircode and in particular to the routing key element of that code - the number - despite the accuracy of such matching.  That is why section 66C(2) is an essential provision in the Bill.</p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Data Protection Act 2003 provides that data controllers and processors owe a duty of care to data subjects which relates to the collection and use of personal data.  That is the law and that is not being disturbed.  The provisions of the Data Protection Acts apply in respect of breaches of the rights contained in those Acts.  Section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2003 provides that the Data Protection Commissioner may bring summary proceedings for an offence under that Act.  Section 31 of the Act provides for penalties for offences under the Act. </p>  <p>  It is neither appropriate nor necessary to provide for offences of breaches of data protection rights when such provisions already exist in the Data Protection Acts.  In addition, the Bill provides that the Minister can make regulations providing for a power to suspend or terminate a value-added re-seller licence, as well as the power to carry out audits.  The activities covered by this Bill are only those which are essential to the delivery and maintenance of the postcode system.  End users will still be subject to the full rigours of the data protection legislation.  If any Deputy can persuade me otherwise I will listen for as long as it takes to understand the point.  I say that with every respect to all the Deputies in the House.</p>  <p>  Deputies Colreavy and Catherine Murphy already raised the extra-territorial effect on the last day we debated this.  The Data Protection Acts apply to all data controllers established in the State. </p><p>Section 11 of the Data Protection Act provides for restrictions on transfers of personal data outside the State.  The transfer of personal data by a data controller to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area may not take place unless that country or territory provides an adequate level of data protection.  This provision is already in the Data Protection Act.  While the issue may arise in this discussion, it does not turn on any of the provisions in the Bill, given that it is addressed in existing legislation. <br/><br/>Furthermore, under section 11 of the Data Protection Act, the Data Protection Commissioner may prohibit the transfer of personal data from the State to a place outside the State.  The commissioner can serve a prohibition notice on the data controller or data processor.  These provisions will continue to apply.  Moreover, the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations requiring a value-added reseller to provide evidence of having registered with the relevant data protection authority, where applicable, before a value-added reseller licence will be granted.  This requirement is not limited to registration with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.<br/><br/>I propose to respond to some of the issues raised by Deputies.  In the first instance, I respectfully do not accept the suggestion that there is a mindset at work here which seeks to exclude or have no regard to data protection issues.  Deputy Moynihan made a fair point in stating that Deputies raised issues at a certain time.  The former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, examined this issue, as did I, and we both decided to introduce what may be colloquially described as belt-and-braces legislation in so far as there could be any concern about the application of data protection principles.  This Bill deals with postcodes <i>simpliciter</i>- in other words, the Eircode number on its own.  When a person is allocated a postcode, the number will be meaningless on its own.  However, if it is linked to a person's name or by means of another identifier, it becomes something that can be treated in a certain way - Deputy Catherine Murphy used the word &quot;commodity&quot; to describe it - and people will have legitimate concerns about how it may be treated.  This is only the case where the postcode is linked to some other identifier because, on its own, it is nothing more than a number. <br/><br/>All the existing protections for personal data in the Data Protection Act apply in this scenario.  The only reference to a separate treatment, as it were, is to the postcode where it is used on its own.  However, once it is linked to anything else, all existing data protection legislation applies.  This Bill introduces rigorous protections in respect of what can be done with postcodes <i>simpliciter</i>.<br/><br/>A privacy audit was conducted on my instruction, and while the executive summary has been published, I will furnish Deputy Catherine Murphy or any Deputy with the full report if he or she wishes to have a copy.  It can also be published.  <br/><br/>It is not true that the Data Protection Commissioner was in some way peripheral to this Bill.  The current Data Protection Commissioner has acknowledged its publication and views the legislation as positive, describing it as &quot;underpinning the implementation and operation of the Eircode system and ensuring that essential data protection safeguards are in place&quot;.<br/><br/>On offences and ensuring compliance, the existing Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003 provide stringent penalties for summary offences in sections 30 and 31.  All the penalties are set out and substantial fines may be imposed where a person is found guilty of an offence under the Act.  <br/><br/>On the commodification of data, it is worth remembering that the information we are discussing is already sold by GeoDirectory and addresses are sold commercially.  The postcode is effectively an address that is referable to a premises rather than an individual.  Once it becomes referable to an individual, all of the data protection provisions with which we are familiar and which we regard as being of such great importance apply.  The addresses <i>simpliciter </i>are already sold commercially by GeoDirectory.  We hear a great deal about consultants and so forth.  A financial benefit will flow to the State from the contract that has been agreed, which includes a gain-share mechanism.<br/><br/>Having listened carefully to the arguments made by the Deputies opposite, I am not persuaded, nor could the House be persuaded, that this Bill in any way sets aside the important and precious principles outlined in the Data Protection Act 1988, extremely important legislation that was subsequently amended in 2003.  These principles continue to apply, as do the mechanisms for making complaints under the Data Protection Acts.  In addition, a separate complaints procedure has been established solely in respect of postcodes.  I draw the attention of Deputies to section 66C on personal data protection, as it emphasises the point I have been making.  It reads:<blockquote>(1) Nothing in this Part shall be construed as authorising the processing of personal data contrary to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003.<br /><br />(2) Section 6A of the Act of 1988 shall not apply in respect of such processing of personal data as is required for purposes related to the carrying out of a legitimate postcode activity.</blockquote>My point is that once the postcode or Eircode has been linked to another identifier, all the protections of the principal Act apply.  If a concern arises about legitimate postcode activity, namely, this narrow area of dealing only with Eircodes, section 66D sets out the complaints procedure that would apply.<br/><br/>Deputy Catherine Murphy argued that there is no facility available to individual citizens who feel aggrieved.  Citizens may avail of the existing protections under the Data Protection Act in respect of personal data, and where a complaint is related solely to the simple Eircode, they have available to them a new complaints procedure, which is set out in section 66D. <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I regret that I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

This is a much more appropriate description of the intuitive and open approach that Britain is taking to changes in its postcode system.  Its objective is to facilitate members of the emergency services in locate houses and commercial entities in delivering goods.  This Bill, however, is different as it groups information in a way that makes it a commodity, which I would not describe as a belt-and-braces approach.</p>  <p>  On the issue of how an individual can practically ensure that he or she is protected and his or her information is not misused, it will be difficult for an individual to prove that damage has been done.</p><p>The primary function with regard to data protection is with the company itself in this instance.  The Data Protection Commissioner is the second line of defence as I see it.  The consultation is where the big flaw occurred.  The consultation process should have been much more open to citizen engagement.  There is a fetish in both the Government and Civil Service for secrecy for its own sake yet there is a cavalier approach to data protection as we saw with PPS numbers and Irish Water.  This was a secondary consideration.  If it was not, why is the Bill before the House at this point?  Why was this not a central part of the initial legislation?</p></speech>

The same could be said about the PPS number.  That is also a numeric sequence which becomes useful when it is linked to a person.  I guarantee the Minister that if we were having the debate we are having on postcodes about the PPS number, the Chamber would be full.  It would not just be the four of us.  The same risks are inherent and the same precedent has been established with this legislation as if we were talking about the PPS number.  There is the same risk that data will be resold and that information will be resold once it is linked to people and an address.  The very fact that we need this legislation to protect against what might happen is an acknowledgement on the part of the Government that there are risks.  The legislation is not strong enough, however, to ensure those risks do not materialise.  It is ill-conceived.</p></speech>

That has been made very clear to me by them.  I understand the Deputy's point about the difficulty in proving damage in any complaints system.  When one brings forward a complaint, one must know or at least have a strong suspicion that there has been a breach.  In the complex world we live in, many things happen that we are concerned we do not know about; the so-called &quot;unknown knowns&quot;.  It is very difficult to devise any complaints system that is not based on an individual pointing to a particular breach that has occurred and bringing that matter forward.  That is the basis on which the Data Protection Acts were enacted.  I do not want to offend, but if anyone can think of a better way for the Data Protection Acts to function other than by way of complaints, I would certainly be interested in discussing it.  That is in relation to the Data Protection Acts, however, which are already there and which we deal with and use all the time.  I am sure Deputies use the legislation all the time to considerable effect.  That is in relation to Deputy Catherine Murphy's points.</p><p>To Deputy Colreavy I note that there is considerable protection in the Bill.  We are drawing on and can avail of the protections that are already in the Data Protection Acts and which cover all personal data.  The Deputies raised a parallel with the PPS number issue and we can all have our views on that in the context of the controversies last year.  With respect to Deputy Colreavy, I point out that PPS numbers were linked to individuals.  To the extent that there was a concern about one's PPS number, it was possible to see whose PPS number it was.  An Eircode <i>simpliciter</i>and on its own is not linked to any other identifier whereas the PPS number was.</p></speech>

To reiterate but not labour the points I made, the company involved has the first or primary role in regard to data protection and the Data Protection Commissioner has a secondary role.  I would argue that the Data Protection Commissioner should have been central to this in the first instance.  The amendments are designed to remove the private firm's role in handling the Eircode system and to give that role to the Data Protection Commissioner.  The firm will be given wide-ranging data protection powers, but such powers should be independent of it.  It is vital that the new system is as robust as possible when it comes to data protection, and that should include the direct involvement of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Many of the comments I made in my opening contribution relate to this issue, so I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

That is not delegation but abdication of responsibility for a solemn State duty.  It is setting a very dangerous precedent and it should not be included in this legislation.</p></speech>

The complaints procedure set out in the Bill refers to the process which owners or occupiers of property can follow in the case of a postcode-related complaint.  The complaints procedure is set out in the postcodes contractor's code of practice.  The postcode contractor has consulted with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner in the drafting of the code of practice, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has made a number of observations and recommendations which the postcode contractor is happy to accept.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has stated that it will approve the code of practice once these changes have been incorporated.</p>  <p>  The Data Protection Act provides powers for the Data Protection Commissioner to investigate complaints and enforce compliance with the Act.  Those provisions apply to any postcode-related complaints which the commissioner may receive.  There is nothing to prevent persons complaining to the Data Protection Commissioner where there is a perceived breach of the Data Protection Act in the context of the postcodes project.  It is, therefore, neither necessary nor appropriate to set out investigative functions for the Data Protection Commissioner in this Bill, given that there is a statutory regime already in place.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted extensively during the drafting stages of the Bill and at no stage indicated that the provisions set out in the 1988 Act are inadequate.  I repeat the core point I have made to the Deputies on this issue that the very considerable protections contained in the Data Protection Acts remain and will endure.  Nothing is being done to disturb, remove, delegate or abdicate the powers of the Data Protection Commissioner under the Acts, powers it is proper that she should have, and which are in no way being removed or lessened in this legislation.</p>  <p>  For those reasons, regrettably I am unable to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

From the foundation of the State, we have tended to outsource things.  We have outsourced education, health care in some cases, and the so-called "care" of children in some instances.  We have difficulty taking direct responsibility for things.  I see the current issue falling within that same category.</p>  <p>  Information is now a commodity, and the ease of access to information by large corporations is significant.  I do not believe it is easy for the citizen to make a complaint if he or she is targeted on the basis of there being grouped information.  What can the citizen do about it?  The very fact that this legislation is happening tells us everything about the mindset that was in place when the system was designed.  The design is about remedying something that was not adequately thought out in the first instance.  That tells us that citizens and data protection were not front and centre in this process, yet that is where we should have started from.  I do not believe there is adequate protection.  There is a two-pronged approach, and every time I have come across such an approach, for example, to parking fines, it has worked to the disadvantage of the citizen.</p></speech>

If the Minister is going to talk about the projected income to the State from this, he might also advise us on the estimated cost to the State for the various Departments to get their databases in order.  In response to parliamentary questions, I have been told there are a number of Departments that are not in a position to estimate the cost of getting their own databases in order to use the new system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400016#O00400"><p>I thank the Deputies.  There is always a very important debate to be had about which elements of public services, if any, should be outsourced to the private sector, and which should continue to be carried out directly by the public sector.  This issue arises in all kinds of areas, as the Deputy rightly says.  Education is still principally carried out and funded directly by the State.  I accept that there is controversy in some areas of health care.  Assessment sometimes has to be made as to whether it is more efficient for services to be provided by the private sector on contract to the State, or for the State services to provide them directly.  We have seen it the areas of public transport and, in my own area of responsibility, telecommunications and broadband.  These issues come up all the time.</p>  <p>  My own view, for what it is worth, is that we should address these issues on a case-by-case basis.  A strong case should have to be made when a public service previously provided directly by the State would in future be provided by the private sector on some form of contract.  That case should have to be made; it should not be the default position or anything like it.  However, I believe there are services which it is appropriate to outsource, and this is likely to be one of them.</p><p>This type of contract is essentially a self-contained process of design and implementation of a postcodes project.  It is appropriate that it should be contracted to an expert company in order to deliver it in circumstances where there is a strong hold on how the matter is done.</p> <p> Obviously, this has a statutory basis and the State is ultimately responsible for ensuring it is carried out correctly.  One of the things the State is certainly responsible for is to ensure there are adequate protections in regard to data.  As to the value to the State, as I mentioned earlier, once sales reach a certain level, there is to be a gainshare mechanism in terms of the value to the State.  However, the most important value to the State and the wider community is the multiplier effect for individual citizens, for the implementation and efficient provision of public services, in particular the emergency services, which I mentioned earlier, and for business and economic activity generally.  I expect there will be a very significant multiplier effect and this will bring huge value to us all.</p></speech>

The Government's approach has been to introduce a mortgage arrears code of conduct in which it gave a veto to the banks.  The alternative Fianna F&aacute;il Party policy was to establish an independent mortgage resolution office, but the Government did not buy into that policy.  Some considerable time later, we now see that the code of conduct for mortgage arrears is not working and is not serving the interests of borrowers.</p>  <p>  A very interesting report was published today by the Central Bank.  It examined the activities of seven lenders and found they are in breach of the code of conduct.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what he is going to do about that?  What actions will the Government take to ensure that the banks comply with the code of conduct?  In the past the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said there are no sanctions that can be applied to banks if they do not co-operate with the code of conduct.  Yet, those same banks are currently trying to recruit new mortgage holders.  It is, therefore, in the interests of current mortgage holders that some penalties are applied to the banks which breach the code of conduct.  It is also in the interests of those who draw down mortgages from these lenders to know the culture of the lender with which they will deal.  Will the Government ensure that banks which have breached the code of conduct are named and shamed and that some penalty is imposed on them?</p></speech>

The Government set out its view on mortgages and the code of conduct some time ago.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently made the decision to bring about further changes to the insolvency regime to deal with further facilities for mortgage holders.</p><p>It is utterly unacceptable that any lender would breach this code of conduct for mortgages.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is now engaged in part of the process in which it delivers on independently of the Government.  The code of conduct for mortgages is very clear and very fair in respect of those who are borrowers from any of the institutions.  The Deputy asked what will happen next.  The process is under way and this report comes from the Central Bank, which is the regulator.  The Central Bank obviously has gone through examples of where the code has been breached by lenders.  It is now the function and the responsibility of the Central Bank to set out whatever sanctions it desires to impose on these lenders.</p>  <p>  Those sanctions will be publicly announced because it will be a public decision.  It is not a case of the Minister for Finance setting out the sanctions.  The regulator is the Central Bank.  It conducted a report and identified breaches of the code of conduct by the lenders.  It is very serious for borrowers affected to have this undue pressure put upon them.  The next stage of the process is for the regulator, namely, the Central Bank, to set up the sanctions it intends to impose on those lenders in the first place.  Those decisions will be publicly announced because it is public information.</p></speech>

People need solutions now.  Will the Taoiseach give an indication of the timescale that is involved in the solution that he has put before us?</p>  <p>  I am interested in the fact that the Central Bank stated there is a problem with seven lenders but it does not name them.  I contend the public is entitled to know and that the public could then take action itself and make its own decisions had it that information.  The Taoiseach and his Government gave the banks a veto in the insolvency legislation.  Today, it would appear the Central Bank is giving further cover to the banking system by withholding this information.  I understand the Central Bank Act provides for information to be disclosed where it is in the interest of the consumer.  Is it not in the interest of the consumer that this information be put into the public realm?  What timescale is the Taoiseach talking about before this happens?</p></speech>

Who is overseeing the activities of local authorities as lenders which are forcing people out of their family homes?</p></speech>

I hope the Central Bank, as the regulator, will deal with this matter publicly, swiftly and effectively.  It has carried out examinations through its rigid inspection regime.  There will be sanctions for any breaches in the code of conduct that have been identified.  The sanctions and the institutions involved will be known.  The inspection examined compliance under the resolution of arrears, transparency, fair process and the process of improvement and controls.  I do not speak for the Central Bank but, following on from its own statement, it has the powers and the legitimacy to manage this effectively.  I hope it will now do so swiftly, effectively and publicly because these are public decisions.</p>  <p>  When personal insolvency practitioners made arrangements that were not acceptable to the banks, that is when a bank veto applied.  The Government intends to change that and legislation is being prepared to that effect.</p>  <p>  In respect of local authorities, was the Deputy referring to borrowing or cases involving repossession?  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be interested in examples of what the Deputy said about local authorities and the repayment of loans borrowed some time ago or where they are pursuing people for the non-payment mortgage arrears.  Clearly, the situation is being dealt with under the insolvency regime.  This has to be amended now because of the actions of some of the banks and that legislation is being prepared to that effect.</p></speech>

Why would NAMA want to prevent citizens knowing about its activities?  Is it not unfair and unjust that the taxpayer might have to pay for NAMA&rsquo;s effort to prevent the very same taxpayer knowing what the agency is doing, supposedly, in the name of the taxpayer?</p>  <p>  NAMA has been shrouded in secrecy since its conception.  It only became subject to the Freedom of Information Act last year, a development for which Sinn F&eacute;in campaigned and produced legislation.  Billions of euro of public assets continue to be sold off by NAMA to vulture capitalists without any proper democratic oversight.  Given the scandal at Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the Government&rsquo;s failure to protect the public interest, given the sell-off of Clerys and the Government&rsquo;s refusal to legislate to protect workers and concession holders in that shop, surely there is an urgent need to look at how NAMA does its business?  There are networks within networks of insiders and powerful vested interests behind many of these deals.  Some of them are in NAMA but buying assets for themselves or for third parties.  How is this allowed to happen?  There is also concern NAMA is engaged in a fire sale of assets to meet an arbitrary deadline set by the troika and now being driven by the Minister of Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p>  <p>  Considering the public concern that now exists, will the Taoiseach agree to a suspension of non-contracted disposals activity at NAMA for a time-limited examination of the books with a view to ensuring the best interests of citizens are being served?</p></speech>

If there is a concern about any aspect of NAMA&rsquo;s work - the Deputy mentioned one earlier- it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to have it scrutinised and investigated.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has produced three special reports already on NAMA&rsquo;s activities which have been broadly positive in their assessment of how the agency is managing the complex business of the extensive portfolio it acquired.  Those reports were generally positive about the management of its business and its conduct.</p>  <p>  All Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports on NAMA have been subject to the full scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  These reports are available on the NAMA website for everyone to see.  I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General will commence work shortly on his fourth special report on NAMA.  In the sense of accountability and public transparency, the independent watchdog of the D&aacute;il, namely, the Committee of Public Accounts, has considered these reports.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a permanent staff in NAMA with access to all files without restriction.</p><p>Three reports, broadly supportive of the work being done, have been published to date on the website and the fourth report has been commenced.</p></speech>

Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is an organisation of which we are all proud.  Is this not the type of project that NAMA, a State agency, should facilitate?

I am sure Deputy does as well.  They are in there with NAMA as these transactions go through.  The Comptroller and Auditor General as part of a special report on NAMA's progress from 2010 to 2012, following a review of NAMA disposals with a gross proceeds value of &euro;1 billion, stated the evidence was that almost all property disposals had been sold through an open competitive process or with testing of disposal prices against market valuation and provided assurance that prices obtained were the best on offer in the market at the time a property was sold.  For instance, No. 1 Warrington Place was sold following an open market competitive sale process.  It attracted substantial investor interest.  The property was advertised over an eight week period and there were 40 site inspections, 19 credible first round bids, eight parties invited to submit final bids on the basis of the strength of their first round bids and the asset was ultimately sold to the highest bidder after another bidder at the same price withdrew.  This purchase was by a global investment fund, marking only a second ever acquisition in Europe.  At the time it was the first sale of a major commercial building in Dublin for more than five years time.  International investor interest generated by the sale stayed in the Irish market and has contributed to the recovery which has been evident since.</p><p>I suggest to the Deputy that because of all of the interest being raised by Deputies from all sides of the House on matters relevant to NAMA, a particular facility was established for Members of the Oireachtas at <i>oir@nama.ie</i>-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge our aid programme and the work of Irish Aid and the NGOs and missionaries who work in very difficult circumstances and sometimes very dangerous situations.  A recent report commissioned by Tr&oacute;caire affirms Ireland's place as one of the best when it comes to aid because our age is untied.  Increasingly this untied aid is coming under threat because donor countries now want to benefit.  We are seeing aid flowing through the private sector in the form of procurement contracts for goods and services, the vast majority for firms from rich countries.  We are seeing self-interested development.  This indicates a need for greater policy coherence to prevent human rights abuses and corruption.</p>  <p>  The three conferences will be held in Addis Ababa on financing for development, in New York on sustainable development goals and in Geneva on climate change.  Ireland will participate in all three and play a particular role in preparing and co-facilitating one of them.  The conference in Addis Ababa on financing for development must produce a clear and comprehensive agreement.  My question is on Ireland's role at that conference.  There is a need for a senior Government figure to attend.  While it is not a pledging conference, will we recommit to honouring the 0.7% of GDP and how we will do this by 2020?  We could then be a voice for this commitment from other countries.  Will Ireland support the calls for an intergovernmental tax body under the auspices of the UN which could really tackle tax evasion, tax avoidance and illicit tax flows all of which contribute to poverty and inequality?  What is being proposed by the OECD will not address these needs.  It is vital that the conference in Addis Ababa gets it right and Ireland can play a strong role there.  If it does not get it right the other two conferences on sustainable development goals and climate change will be meaningless.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400021#T00100"><p>This is a very important issue that has been raised by the Deputy.  As I understand it, the conference in Addis Ababa is really about pledging for funding, which will be an important element.  It was raised with me by the chairman of the World Bank when he was here.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, normally attends these occasions and, to be honest, I am unsure who is attending on behalf of the Government, although there will be a representative there in any event.  The Uachtar&aacute;n will attend the September meeting in New York and I expect to be there for a short period at that development goal conference.  The third meeting, in Paris, is on climate change, and takes place in December.</p>  <p>  Following the Pope's encyclical, there is a new impetus about this and what it means for countries.  I hope the political process will respond, and I know that in our own case, as a small country, we would like to be able to have targets that we can actually achieve.  We face a real challenge in this respect because the targets set for Ireland for 2020 were based, in my view, on inadequate evidence and scientific information in the first place.  If the process continues from 2020 to 2030 on that basis, whatever Government represents our country in that period will be subject to enormous fines of &euro;5.5 billion or &euro;6 billion.  We have consent from the European Council in respect of the agri-profile that we have here, which will allow us in some small way to be better able to compete towards achievable targets.  Given the change in the economic position here over the past number of years, while Ireland was very much on track to achieve the required levels to contribute to those goals, the process has become somewhat stunted.  It is obviously a matter that the Government can consider as we prepare for the October budget and decide how that can be best reflected.</p>  <p>  I will see to it that we have a representative at the conference.  If it is not Deputy Sherlock, it will be a senior representative - a Minister or Minister of State, if possible - who will go to Addis Ababa.  The Uachtar&aacute;n will attend in New York and I hope to be there as well.  There is also the meeting in Paris dealing with issues to do with climate change.

This is because of financial flows, tax injustice and the cost of climate change.  Financial transparency and accountability, which equates to country-by-country reporting, is vital.  Globalisation has allowed the multinationals to dodge their tax obligations.  Ireland can be a voice at Addis Ababa.  It is welcome that the sustainable development goals will cover all countries, as there is certainly much unfinished business from the millennium development goals, which did not help those who are poorest, or women and children.</p><p>Climate change is the topic in Geneva, and the Taoiseach mentioned the Pope's <i>Laudato si'</i>.  On Monday and Tuesday, there was a climate change conference in Maynooth.  We know the relevant issues are pollution, waste and reduced biodiversity, which all contribute to climate change, which means that inequality and poverty will continue.  My question referred to our climate change Bill, although it does not mention climate justice, which is so important.  Nevertheless, in 2013, at the climate change conference hosted by the Government, the Government supported the principle of climate justice.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that our climate change Bill will include the principle of climate justice, as otherwise we could be accused of hypocrisy; we would be saying one thing on the international stage but something very different nationally.</p></speech>

The matter has moved on and the vast majority of governments are now acutely aware of their responsibilities.  Certainly, at the European Council this issue comes up on a very regular basis, with clear priorities to be followed.  That is why we have our own challenges to be faced here.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned pollution, waste and biodiversity.  There are some extraordinary innovations in new technology to deal with elements of this, and the more that can happen the better.  Some of those innovations have been pioneered in Ireland.  The climate Bill did not set out specific targets because it goes as far as 2030 or 2050 and objectives were set out clearly.  I do not object to having climate justice referred to in this matter.  A former President, Dr. Mary Robinson, has been very vocal on this and I have spoken to her about her particular interest in the area.</p>  <p>  Ireland will play its part as much as it can.  We will contribute where we can and we must challenge ourselves in measuring up and being recognised as a country that really is fulfilling obligations in respect of climate change and the other elements of these three discussions.  I will ask the Whip to make arrangements so that Members can have an opportunity to have their say on this in the House, and I hope that can happen before we leave for the summer recess.</p></speech>

I am struck on a regular basis in my constituency by the number of people having difficulties accessing the family courts, the inordinate delays and so on.  The Taoiseach has accepted the need for us to take action and produce a family courts system.  There was some concern initially that Article 34 of the Constitution might have to be amended in order to facilitate that initiative, but a way has been found around that.  Will the Taoiseach give the House some sort of an assurance as to what action the Government will take?  In light of the adoption of the children's referendum, there is a need for a real impetus to be injected into this process, and I would include in that the family law Bill promised by the Government.</p>  <p>  I also wish to ask about universal health insurance.  In April 2014, the Government published a White Paper that was a costings-free zone in terms of its finite proposals.  Where are we now on the issue of universal health insurance, which was such a key element of the Government's programme?  I ask this against the background of comments by the T&aacute;naiste in the past couple of days, who indicated that any reform of health financing must meet three criteria.  She indicated that it must give better outcomes for patients, make access fairer and easier and be affordable.  We would all agree with that, but she went on to say, "To be clear, any reform must meet all three criteria."  She stated, "I do not know yet whether universal health insurance or any other insurance-based system can meet these three criteria".  If this is a key element of the Government's platform-----</p></speech>

It is a very belated response to the recommendations made by the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, one in 2011 and the other in 2012.  It has taken three years to produce the draft scheme of this Bill, which will now go into consultation until September.  When does the Taoiseach expect the Bill to be published?

I welcome this, but it is four months after he announced this.  However, we know that HIQA's recommendations are often ignored by the Minister and the Department.  HIQA has said that had its recommendations been implemented, the risks to emergency departments, which even today dominate the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, would have been significantly reduced.

We were told at a briefing that Report Stage amendments to this Bill would be brought forward.  The deadline for us to put in amendments is tomorrow morning but the Government is going to bring in Report Stage amendments on issues unknown at the last minute.  That is completely unacceptable.  Are those amendments technical or do they deal with substantial issues, such as water and attachment orders?  If they are substantive amendments, when will we see them?  When will they be published, or will we see them at the last minute?  If they are substantive amendments, will we get a chance to have a debate before we go to Report Stage, given that they were not in the Bill when it was debated on Second Stage?  When will Report Stage take place?  Can the Taoiseach be precise on that?  Will it be next week or the week after?</p>  <p>  When will the Committee Stage of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, for which the deadline for amendments was this morning, be taken?  Will it be next week?  Will the two Bills be in the same week?  These are very precise questions about legislation and I would like precise answers and no fast ones being pulled.</p></speech>

As he knows, and as the Acting Chairman pointed out, Dunboyne College of Further Education recently received independent status and an enrolment number.  This time a number of months ago, the college, while operating as a post-leaving certificate college, was under the umbrella of St. Peter's secondary school in Dunboyne.  This meant that staffing and budgets had to be shared.  The college has been in temporary accommodation since it started ten years ago.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, who is my colleague in Meath West, for working with me, the college, departmental officials and the college advisory board on which I sit.  The new independent status changes matters for the college and means a great deal for the people who work there and its students.  It changes the direction in which the college is going, allowing it to become the college that it is capable of becoming.</p>  <p>  While the college has many constraints, it has become the centre of excellence in the county and, indeed, the wider area.  It serves a large catchment area of approximately 400,000 people.  It integrates school leavers, mature students and non-national students.  It has grown out of nothing with just a handful of courses a number of year ago into a college that has developed new programmes in conjunction with business, industry and third level needs.  More than 90% of its graduates go on to receive third level offers, which is a fantastic record.</p>  <p>  Until now, the college's main impediment was its status.  The staffing, budgets and everything else had to be shared.  While the college has just received its enrolment number, for which we are grateful, and the feeling among some is probably one of "go away and leave us alone for another while," the main problem that the college now faces is that it is not able to grow in numbers or in size.  While this is mostly due to the post-leaving certificate allocation, it is also because its temporary accommodation is located in a business park.  While the accommodation has served the college well up to this point, it comprises business units.  Recently, the college had to give back space because its lease had ended.  Obviously, the units went back to their owner to be leased out to somebody else.  There is a fear that such could happen again and the college would have to downsize once more.</p>  <p>  Funding for post-leaving certificate colleges comes through SOLAS, which is funded through the Department.  SOLAS has stated that it does not have money for capital projects.  After ten years, though, the college is now paying &euro;100,000 in rent per year.  Obviously, the rent did not start out at that amount, but it makes sense to invest now.  We will or already have a demand for an educational training centre in the region, which comprises a catchment area of 400,000 people in Meath, north Dublin, Kildare and Offaly.  As SOLAS is not just the new further education authority, but the new training authority, Dundalk is the nearest facility.  As the Minister of State has mentioned, given the fact that his portfolio crosses the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, it will not be a shortage of jobs that is likely to be the problem in a few years' time, but finding people who are sufficiently skilled and trained to fill those positions.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has been supportive of the college on its journey so far.</p><p>I know he will continue to do that.  I ask him to support this endeavour.  A new building is needed not just for the county but also for the 400,000 people served by the college.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, Dunboyne College of Further Education was awarded stand-alone status by the Department in February 2015.  It has been acknowledged that there was a long battle behind that.  A great deal of good work was done by many people over the years to try to make sure that happened.  I am glad that it has happened and that the great work which has been done at Dunboyne College of Further Education has been recognised.  As Deputy McEntee has said, the college's catchment covers a massive area that is much bigger than County Meath.  We are familiar with the great work that the college does and the presence it has.  It is right and just that it has been given a chance to operate as a stand-alone college.  I hope it can develop its numbers over time.</p>  <p>  After the decision to award stand-alone status was made, the college was allocated a separate roll number for administrative purposes.  This entitled the college to appoint a principal to the separately located post-leaving certificate college.  This allowed the principal of St. Peter's College to concentrate on the second-level school.  In making the application for stand-alone status, Louth and Meath Education and Training Board acknowledged the fiscal constraints which direct the Department's capital spending decisions in the context of any expectation that the application might have for capital investment by the Department.  Subsequently, in granting stand-alone status last February, the Department advised the board that in view of the need to ensure every child has access to a physical school place, the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years will be the delivery of major and smaller school projects to meet demographic demands nationally.  For that reason, according to the Department, it was not possible to give consideration for a dedicated new building for Dunboyne College of Further Education at that time.</p>  <p>  Deputy McEntee outlined many of the reasons that a new building needs to be constructed.  As a local Deputy, I share much of her understanding of the matter.  It is a question of actually finding the capital budget.  There is a great deal of pressure on the budget at primary and secondary levels.  That is where much of the money will be concentrated in the near future.  All applications for major capital funding, including Louth and Meath Education and Training Board's application for a dedicated new building for Dunboyne College of Further Education, must be assessed in the context of the competing demands on the Department's capital budget.  The Deputy will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system.  I will go through the numbers.  Total pupil enrolments in primary and post-primary schools are expected to increase by approximately 107,000 between 2012 and 2019.  This comprises an increase of over 70,000 at primary level and over 35,000 at post-primary level.  It is projected that pupil numbers at post-primary level will continue to increase up to 2026 at least.  That is as far as we can predict.  The challenge for the Department is to ensure our school system at primary and post-primary levels is in a position to cater for increasing pupil numbers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the current five-year construction plan contains details of major projects, including new schools and extensions, that are planned to commence construction over the duration of the period of the plan.  I hope there will be a new additional plan on that front as well.  A nationwide demographic exercise is being carried out by the Department currently to identify the location and distribution of the additional projected pupil numbers and consequently the need for additional primary and post-primary accommodation in all our counties.  The provision of this accommodation continues to be the Department's over-riding objective.  That is where funds will be prioritised.  Quite a high rent is being paid at Dunboyne College of Further Education.  The security of having a place is also an issue.  I am sure there is scope to look at other premises or come up with other initiatives using the same money.  Maybe some other place could be rented.  I think the current site is quite ideal and good.  It is a question of having permanency.  While we accept that this is an issue, we just do not have the capital budget at the moment.  It is something that is well known in the Department.  I hope that in the years to come, we will find some way to make it happen.  As it stands, there is no capital money to assign to it.</p></speech>

I understand where we are coming from.  We have just come through one of the toughest recessions this economy has ever seen.  We have managed to turn things around.  I understand we do not have the money to invest in all the projects we would like to invest in, or to undertake all the capital spending we would like to undertake.  We need to look at the bigger picture.  Obviously, we need to continue to invest wisely.  Dunboyne College of Further Education is already catering for more students than it receives funding for.  Over the past year and a half, I have got to know the staff at the college and the staff who have been loaned to it through St. Peter's College.  The staff have done everything in their power to make sure as many students as possible are taken on, to refuse entry to as few students as possible, to expand their courses and to work with neighbouring colleges and businesses to suit the needs that are out there currently.  I think they need to be rewarded for the work they have done.  It is important that the post-leaving certificate allocation for the area is increased.  Obviously, the space needs to be there to cater for that as well.  I know the Minister of State will continue to work on this with me, my colleagues and the advisory board.  I ask him to ensure it is not put on the back burner because it is too important.</p></speech>

I am happy to work with the Deputy and all our colleagues on this important issue.  I want to recognise the great work that is being done at the college, which is demonstrated by the progression rate of the students who go through the post-leaving certificate courses and into further and higher education or into jobs.  I understand that the success rate is over 92%, which is very positive.  We recognise the high level of demand on numbers.  A national review of post-leaving certificate places is being carried out this year.  I hope it will allay some of the concerns about the distribution of post-leaving certificate numbers around the country.  I think the demand for places in County Meath is certainly higher than supply is at present.  The capital end of it is close to my heart.  I will certainly be watching for an opportunity.  I assure the Deputy that the line Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and I will be banging the table to try to get more money into education and into capital expenditure.  In the years ahead, as more money comes in as a result of our job creation successes, naturally we will have more money to spend.  I hope that in the future, we will eventually be able to find some capital money for projects like this.  Currently, the priority has to be to have enough accommodation for existing pupils coming into primary and secondary levels and thereafter.</p></speech>

They are breaching the code in four areas: not seeking timely solutions, communications, fair processes, and process improvements and controls.  Some of them have committed offences like seeking additional <i>ad hoc</i>payments from borrowers with whom they have agreements in place and making unilateral changes to arrangements without prior agreement.  There was also a policy that permitted lenders to remove borrowers from the resolution process if they did not agree to an arrangement over the telephone.  Given that the ordinary people of this country have slaved and toiled to bail out the banks over the last seven years, it is quite incredible that the banks are still allowed to operate in this way.  Why has the Government given the banks such largesse?  I suggest that Government policy is leading directly to many of the problems in the banks.</p><p>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to the only penalty that looks likely to be imposed on the banks, which seems to be that they will be written to on 30 November.  There will be no 7 a.m. dawn raids like those that followed water charge protests, for example.  The banks are doing what the Government has directed, which is to take back possession of properties while prices are going up.  This has allowed the banks to operate in whatever way they like.  The rules do not really apply.  A slogan that is chanted on marches - &quot;the banks got bailed out, we got sold out&quot; - is very apt on this occasion.  Anyone who looks at what is happening with the banks in this country will have to agree that it is true.  When will the Government introduce some control over the banks, in the interests of working-class and ordinary people?  Repossessions have increased by 500%.  I ask the Minister of State to imagine a world in which the banks are owned and controlled by the 99% rather than the 1% - &quot;I wonder if you can&quot;, to quote from a John Lennon song.</p><p>I suggest that rather than people being evicted from the properties they are renting, which is happening every day of the week, there should be an agreement that those people would remain in their homes.  It is coming up to the first anniversary of the eviction of Violet and Martin Coyne, two pensioners who were turfed out onto the street by a receiver for Rabobank.  I have been asked on numerous occasions when the Government will introduce an order to protect sitting tenants in buy-to-let properties, rather than adding to the homelessness crisis.  All of the replies from the banks, including AIB, of which we own practically 99%, suggest that the bank will honour the terms of formal leases.  In other words, they will evict tenants when their leases are up in a few months.  Even though ordinary people are bailing out the banks, there is nothing to keep tenants <i>in situ</i>.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, planning and the Construction 2020 strategy, Deputy Coffey, has said that &quot;bringing in the rules too soon could result in property prices stalling [which] would be undesirable&quot; and that &quot;the falling incidence of negative equity is helping to restore banks' balance sheets&quot;.  Those comments reveal that Government policy is contributing to this crisis.</p><p>Threshold and others have asked for a code of conduct for people like that.</p> <p> The Minister of State might spare a thought for somebody who did get a helping hand recently from the banks, Deirdre Foley, co-founder of the property investment company D2, who has little sympathy for the Clerys workers.  She would not be in the position to fire them if she had not got a write-down from the bank in her hour of need.  She was struggling to cope with her company debts, estimated at &euro;450 million, but she was given a sufficient write-down to help her trade and operate.</p></speech>

It is essential that the code is fully implemented by all lenders and that borrowers are dealt with fairly in line with the code and that they can be confident that any breaches of the code will be swiftly identified and dealt with by the regulator.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank, in its supervisory role, must ensure that the banks comply with the CCMA and take appropriate and timely actions to ensure that they do.  The publication this morning of the findings of the Central Bank's themed inspection of lenders' compliance with the code is useful and timely in this regard and where weaknesses were identified by the Central Bank it is important that lenders address them immediately to the satisfaction of the Central Bank as the supervisory authority.  The Government expects the Central Bank to use the powers available to it and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all customers are protected.  I note that the Central Bank has stated that it has the necessary powers to manage this process effectively and that it has undertaken to use its supervisory powers where compliance levels are not in line with the Central Bank's expectations.</p>  <p>  It is essential that all lenders deal with their customers in accordance with the provisions of the CCMA and it is very disappointing when shortcomings are found.  It is through the publication of the findings of such inspections by the Central Bank and rigorous follow-up with lenders by the Central Bank that any shortcomings are identified and resolved.  That way we can be confident the code is fulfilling its objective of providing a strong consumer protection framework for distressed borrowers.</p>  <p>  While obviously, and understandably, our focus is on the weaknesses found, which I and the Government see as utterly unacceptable, we should also note that the Central Bank found that the examined lenders have implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA and a number of good practices were identified that go beyond the minimum regulatory requirements.  For instance, many lenders engage with borrowers and attempt to resolve arrears, even when borrowers have been classified as not co-operating by the lender and when legal proceedings have commenced.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears.  This has included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, the mortgage-to-rent scheme and the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives, such as support through the money advice and budgeting network.</p>  <p>  On 13 May last, the Government announced a number of new measures to further strengthen the framework to support mortgage holders who are in arrears.  Building on action previously taken, the measures aim to increase the supports available to people in arrears and to increase the number of people availing of them.  This further enhanced the personal insolvency framework, the mortgage to rent scheme and the services offered by the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.</p>  <p>  In this context it is important to also recognise that the numbers of mortgage accounts in arrears is declining and that many home owners are reaching solutions with their lender.  In its most recent statistical publication on this issue, the Central Bank reported that at the end of quarter one in 2015, over 117,000 principal dwelling houses, family homes, mortgage accounts were classified as restructured and the vast majority were meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the House that the Minister for Finance, I and the Government as a whole are acutely conscious of the impact of debt on families across the country and are determined to see it resolved.  In these difficult circumstances borrowers must be dealt with in a fair and transparent manner and on a case-by-case basis.  The CCMA is a central pillar in this regard and any shortcomings are not acceptable.  The Central Bank has the powers to deal with these issues and having identified the weaknesses it is critical that it follows up in a speedy and strong manner to ensure that all lenders fully implement the CCMA to ensure that the best interests of consumers are protected.</p></speech>

I do mean that literally, not metaphorically.  Where has it been implemented?  How many banks have agreed mortgage to rent schemes?  I would wager a handful in the entire country because it does not seem to be sought and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could give me figures for that.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that he is acutely aware of the impact of debt on families.  When this Government came to power five years ago, one of the biggest issues facing it was mortgage debt but it has done nothing to lift that debt or to ask the banks to reduce the debt.  Most people bought houses during the property bubble that were completely overpriced.  They are still saddled with 30, 35 and even 40 year mortgages.  The Government could have brought in rules for AIB because the State owns it.  It could have brought in a policy of no evictions of sitting tenants, if it really is concerned.  That policy has not been issued and I think that is because the bank is being fattened up for privatisation.  That is why it has been told to purge its loan books of bad debts as soon as possible.  It is now implementing rules the Government favours because it wants to sell the bank off, to privatise it, which is a real mistake.</p>  <p>  Developers are getting write-downs from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which was never intended to happen.  The late Brian Lenihan and the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, promised that would never happen and it is happening.  There is one law for the rich, the 1%, and another for the ordinary people, the 99%, who get only cutbacks in supports such as the lone parents allowance and get no bailouts from this Government.</p></speech>

Deputies on all sides of this House are concerned about mortgage arrears.  We all see the issue in our clinics and communities but it is not fair to say nothing is being done because the Central Bank statistics show that 117,000 family home mortgages had been restructured by the end of quarter one of this year.  Those are real people, some I would guess in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency and some in mine.  They are engaging with their lenders and are able to get their lives and their family finances back on track.  It is also true to say, however, that there is much more to be done.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the mortgage to rent scheme.  It could be of great help but it needs to be modified.  I will contact the Deputy with a note on the information she has requested on that scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note the Central Bank has identified shortcomings but it has also identified good practice.  It is important and right that we focus on the shortcomings.  It now needs to deal with those shortcomings in a speedy manner.  It has the powers it requires as it reiterated this morning.  There are several options available to it if it is not satisfied that a lender is in compliance with the code.  I encourage the Central Bank to act swiftly and I have every confidence that it will.  The letter it has sent to seven lenders is published on its website for all to see.  It sets out the shortcomings, the good practice and what now needs to happen.  Mortgage arrears and debt will continue to be a priority for this Government, which wants to sort it out.  I do not share the Deputy&rsquo;s view on the fattening up of the banks.  We have a commitment to recoup every cent the Government put into the banks so that we can do exactly what the Deputy wants to do, get it back into the taxpayers&rsquo; coffers and spend it on the crucial public services we need. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400026#Y00900"><p>This Government is fully committed to job creation and ironing out the red tape that prevents employers from taking on staff, yet at the moment there are 300 vacancies in the private sector nursing homes across Ireland largely due to the delays experienced in registering nurses with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.</p>  <p>  This issue has been raised with me on a number of occasions, particularly by nursing home owners in County Galway, who struggle to replace nurses when they leave.  Currently, there are nursing home beds in County Galway that are closed awaiting the registration of nurses.</p><p>Nursing home beds in County Galway have been withdrawn from service as the homes await the registration of nurses.  This delay in registering nurses has knock-on effects, including the possibility that further nursing home beds will be withdrawn, leading to difficulties in discharging patients from acute settings and placing pressure on accident and emergency departments.  The lack of registered nurses means that many owners of nursing homes must use recruitment agencies or engage directly in recruiting nurses internationally.  This creates a significant cost burden for nursing home owners, who, in addition to experiencing difficulties in registering nurses, face costs of between &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000.</p> <p> The current waiting time is listed as 90 days.  Up to 700 applications are before the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, awaiting processing.  If a query is raised about an application, as is common for applications from foreign-registered nurses, the application is placed at the bottom of the list and the nurse in question may not be registered for 90 days, six months or 12 months.  This is a bureaucratic nightmare.  Nursing home owners have informed me that it is very unusual for foreign-registered nurses to have registrations successfully concluded within 90 days.  Six months is too long for any business to have to wait for registration.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland will cite a lack of resources as the reason for delays in the registration process.  I also note that the board failed in its attempt to have the nurse registration fee increased by 50%.  The current impasse and the delays experienced by nurses and nursing home owners must be addressed.</p> <p> Rigorous procedures for the registration of nurses are necessary, and I do not propose any relaxation in current procedures.  However, faster turnaround times for registration are required, and if additional resources are required, they must be found.  Approximately 300 vacant posts could be filled and the additional taxes that would result could be used to offset any additional resources needed.</p> <p> The lack of available nurses in Ireland is resulting in ever-increasing recruitment and retention costs for nursing homes.  Nursing homes in rural areas are at a particular disadvantage because it is assumed that they have lower costs, and this assumption is reflected in the much lower fees they are allowed to charge by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The fees paid to many nursing homes in rural areas have remained static for the past five years, during which time the crisis in nurse recruitment has greatly increased the cost of recruitment and resulted in offers of ever-increasing salary packages in an effort to retain qualified registered nurses.</p> <p> The Government has adopted a common-sense approach to job creation.  The current delays being experienced in nurse registration could be addressed through simple action that would allow 300 vacant posts to be filled and remove a bottleneck in the health system.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>

Delays in processing nurse registration applications are directly connected to the volume of requests arising from current initiatives to attract and retain nurses.  My Department and the Health Service Executive are collaborating in sourcing several solutions to the issues affecting nurse recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  The background is that nurses who trained in a country outside Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as nurses with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, formerly known as An Bord Altranais.  In assessing an applicant for registration, the board seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice to protect the public, as nursing qualifications vary significantly from country to country.  According to the NMBI, the timeframe for completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration is up to 90 days, provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant.  The main difficulty in expediting timely applications, as reported by the NMBI, is delay or failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration.</p>  <p>  The NMBI, following the assessment of an applicant's qualifications, may require the applicant to undertake a six- to 12-week period of adaptation and assessment.  A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service.  If this adaptation is required, it must be successfully completed as a prerequisite to registration.  Two HSE adaptation courses are still available this year - in June and August - and these courses are between six and 12 weeks in duration.  They facilitate the integration of overseas nurses into nursing in an Irish context.  It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that since the nationally co-ordinated pilot adaptation programme commenced in June 2014, 151 candidates have completed the programme, 58 candidates are currently undergoing assessment and 126 candidates are due for assessment up to the final programme in August 2015.  In addition to the current provision for placements in 2015, 293 requests for placements have been received from employers.  These numbers are not reflective of a national total, as some hospitals have also run independent adaptation programmes.</p>  <p>  A collaborative group, including my Department, the Health Service Executive and Nursing Homes Ireland representatives, continues to explore options to facilitate adaptation and thereby registration with the NMBI.  It is important to acknowledge that the NMBI is dealing with a significant volume of applications.  The board is processing all applications as quickly as possible while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed to protect of the public.  I should also advise the Deputy that the NMBI has been allocated additional resources to address these issues.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the real challenges we are facing in nurse recruitment and retention, 500 more nurses are working in the public health system than at this time last year and more than 1,000 additional beds will be provided under the Fair Deal scheme this year, all of which will be staffed by nurses.</p></speech>

The issue raised with me by nursing home owners is that is taking a long time to inform nurses of problems with their registration applications.  Applications are being placed at the bottom of the pile when problems are identified.  A similar approach was taken some years ago in respect of student grant applications to Student Universal Support Ireland, and the same practice has been evident n local authorities for many years.  Surely, if an application is found to be incorrect, a call should be made to the applicant within one hour informing him or her what documentation needs to be submitted.  The NMBI can only deal with the applications it receives.  However, if it takes six or eight weeks to request further information from applicants, the entire process slows down, which is extremely frustrating for owners of nursing homes, who must wait six, nine or 12 months before a nurse can start work.</p>  <p>  While I accept the Minister's comments on changes to the Fair Deal scheme and the increase in the number of nurses as the economy improves, this issue is entirely a matter of red tape and bureaucracy.  As I stated, no one wants to cut corners in the recruitment process.  We expect nothing less than the best trained, most skilled and most qualified staff in our nursing homes and hospitals.  Surely it would be possible, with some additional resources and further consultations with the relevant stakeholders, to inform applicants of problems with a registration application much sooner than is currently the case.  I am informed that this process can take six or eight weeks, during which time the application does not advance, which is extremely frustrating for the nurse seeking registration.  I expect that nurses in many of the countries from which we are recruiting are able to move to other countries with much more efficient systems for recruiting nurses.  If we want to recruit the best nurses, we must clean up this minor bureaucratic mess.</p></speech>

The Deputy makes a valid point about efficiency.  While I am not sure precisely how applications are processed, I would be concerned if applications were allowed to mount before being examined one by one.  In such circumstances, an application could be left in a pile for several weeks before an administrator identifies that something is missing.  It would make sense to carry out an initial check to ensure all the documents are in order.  Any steps that would make the process more efficient would be welcome.  I meet periodically with representatives of the NMBI, and the chief nursing officer in the Department meets them more regularly than I do.  We will definitely raise this matter in our conversations.</p></speech>

Waterford Regional Hospital, now known as Waterford University Hospital, is the closest hospital to a large number of people in south County Kilkenny, many of whom are waiting for an outpatient appointment or inpatient day case treatment in the hospital.  The number of people on waiting lists for treatment at Waterford University Hospital is shocking.  In May 2015, some 26,553 people were waiting for outpatient treatment, an increase of 4,188, or 18.7%, in 12 months.  It is especially appalling that 10,866 people have been waiting to see a consultant for more than a year.  While the figure decreased slightly in April 2015, it increased by 1,744 between January and May and by 7,767, or almost 250%, in the 12 months preceding May 2015.</p><p>As such, 41% of those awaiting an outpatient appointment at Waterford have been waiting for more than one year, which is twice the national average of 20.5%.  If one examines the figures further, matters get worse as there are 2,965 people who have been waiting for more than two years for an appointment.  No other hospital in the country has so many people who have been waiting for more than two years and only Tallaght comes close with just over 2,000.  Of the almost 3,000 people who have been waiting more than two years in Waterford, more than one third have been waiting for more than three years.  That means 1,067 people have been waiting since May 2012.  There are a further 452 people who went on the list in May 2011 and are still waiting.</p> <p> It is not only outpatients who are suffering of course.  The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund figures from May 2015 show that 4,210 people are on waiting lists for day case inpatient treatment at University Hospital Waterford.  This compares to 3,773 in January 2015, 2,336 in May 2014, and 1,581 in May 2013.  Of the 4,210 waiting in Waterford in May 2015, 624 have been waiting for more than 12 months, which compares to 64 in January 2015, 20 in May 2014 and none in May 2013.  The numbers on the day-case inpatient list in Waterford have almost trebled in two years.  No other hospital in the South/South West Hospitals Group has experienced this.  Nationally, the waiting list has increased by 39.5% in over two years whereas in Waterford the increase has been of the order of 166.3%, which is appalling when Minister is seeking to have this addressed and substantially reversed.  We all accept that health services are demand-driven, but to have so many people waiting for so long is a scandal.</p> <p> I was in University Hospital Waterford at the weekend.  The pressure front-line staff are under is enormous and something must be done about it.  We must spend more money and appoint more front-line staff in Waterford because the hospital is unable to cope at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400028#AA00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline the concerted actions being taken to reduce waiting times, nationally and in University Hospital Waterford.  I recognise fully that too many patients are waiting too long for treatments and that this needs to change but reducing wait times is not that simple.  If it was simple, it would have been done by now.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is not long ago that his own party leader promised in office to abolish waiting times altogether, but that was not done.</p>  <p>  However, I can assure the House that reducing waiting times is a key priority for this Government and much work is underway.  Structural change in the organisation of our hospital sector, which is currently underway, will improve quality and access.  Hospital groups will help us to better manage patient flow and patient demand.  The reality is, however, that the major changes underway will take some time to implement and further time to show results.  In the meantime, we must address the significant pressures on hospitals, including pressures on waiting times for inpatient and day-case treatments and for outpatient appointments.  The HSE has specific measures in place to manage waiting lists more efficiently.  These include the national waiting list protocol, the national clinical programme guidelines, prioritising day-of-surgery admission over inpatient surgery and the validating of inpatient waiting lists.  Regarding this last measure, many waiting list entries are duplicates or relate to people who have since gone private.</p>  <p>  I want to drive improvements in waiting times and ensure that we make maximum use of all available resources.  Taking into account current pressures on acute hospitals, I have set a maximum permissible waiting time such that by the end of this month, nobody should wait more than 18 months for treatment or an outpatient appointment.  By year end, that outer limit will be 15 months.  This will be achieved in all but a small number of specialties in which there is a shortage of adequately trained staff which we cannot resolve.  The HSE is focused on delivering this objective through maximising capacity across hospital groups.  However, there are key limiting factors, primarily theatre nursing staff and consultant numbers in particular specialties.  Consequently, some outsourcing to private hospitals is required, which is being managed through a public tendering process.</p>  <p>  For my own part, I believe that new pathways to improve patient flow, such as medical assessment and local injury units, urgent care centres and non-hospital settings, can and must be used to provide a range of care to support the efficient use of hospital resources.  There is significant potential to further improve hospital performance and efficiency.  We must achieve the highest levels of efficiency ahead of providing new resources.  The Irish hospital redesign programme is working with clinical programmes to support local change and innovation and raise national standards through internationally recognised redesign and improvement methods.  I welcome this initiative.  It is now advanced in Tallaght and Limerick is next on the list.  At national level, the HSE's acute hospitals division is responsible for and manages hospital performance.  Weekly meetings are held with the hospital groups to review performance against agreed clearance plans for treatment waiting lists and for outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  University Hospital Waterford is contributing to the South/South West Hospitals Group plan to reduce waiting times through additional outpatient clinics in all specialties.  I am also advised that evening or weekend clinics are being held for ENT, orthopaedics, general surgery, vascular, neurology and urology.  In terms of staffing, two consultant urologists have taken up posts this year and a temporary part time ENT consultant will begin at the end of June.  Two much-needed consultant dermatologists are also expected to start in 2015 and a replacement consultant orthopaedic surgeon post is awaiting approval.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and hospital groups to ensure an appropriate focus and drive to improve hospital waiting times, including that in Waterford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1199" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400028#AA00300"><p>The figures I have quoted today give the lie to the December 2013 outpatient figures, which claimed that no one was waiting more than one year at Waterford.  On a national basis, the figures were much trumpeted by the then Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to show how well he was doing.  To say the least, the figures from December 2013 are inconsistent with the figures for last month which I quoted in my initial remarks.  The May 2015 figures indicate that 1,067 people have been waiting for an outpatient appointment since before May 2012, 452 of whom went on the list in May 2011 or earlier.  Nevertheless, the published figures for December 2013 told us no one had been waiting more than one year in Waterford; a complete fabrication.  The published figures for May 2014 indicated that just nine people had been waiting since before May 2012 with just two waiting since May 2011.  How does the Minister explain a hospital waiting list in 2013 which said no one had been waiting since 2012 when the waiting list from 2014 indicated that nine had been waiting since the middle of 2012 and the recent figures show that more than 1,000 have been waiting since the middle of 2012, almost half of whom have been waiting since 2011?  The figures do not add up.  The Minister has given me an assurance in his reply, but this is not going to do anything in University Hospital Waterford where waiting lists are double the average of those in every other hospital in the country.  There are over 3,000 people waiting.  The Minister must give a reply and explain how the list will be brought down and into line with the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I do not individually manage 50 hospitals.  That is not something any health Minister has ever done or could ever do.  However, I can discuss the issue in general.  I find it hard to get my head around the figures also.</p></speech>

In pointing to the anomalies, the Deputy makes a valid point.  I wonder if the major increase we have seen in people waiting in the last couple of months is a reflection of the fact that the numbers were not accurate before rather than anything else.</p></speech>

It is important that when the Deputy uses the figures, he understands them.  There may well be 400,000 people awaiting an appointment of some sort in our health service.  Some of those people are waiting a few days or a few weeks.  What matters to most people is how long they are waiting not what number they are on a waiting list.  If one is No. 120 on a general surgery waiting list, one may be seen in a couple of weeks, whereas if one is No. 60 on a particular surgery list, one might be waiting years.  What is most important in my view is ensuring that we reduce waiting times.  One must bear in mind that every time we establish a new service, there is a new waiting list and that every time a new consultant is appointed, people will be waiting to see him or her.  We have waiting lists now for services we were not providing a year or two ago.  As such, this is a trickier matter than people may think.</p>  <p>  In terms of the most up to date figures for Waterford, the total waiting list on 28 May for inpatient or day-case treatment is 4,210, of whom 1,195 have been waiting for less than three months.</p><p>A further 1,700 are waiting less than nine months, but there are more than 1,000 waiting more than nine months and 624 waiting more than 12 months.  With respect to outpatient appointments, approximately 6,000 are waiting more than 18 months and we would expect all of them to have appointments by the end of this month.  When we consider the figures in the round, 26,553 people are waiting for treatment but the largest single number of that group are waiting less than three months.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400030#CC00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015.  Given the purpose of the Bill, it is also worth taking stock of the progress we are making more generally in terms of our economic recovery.  Over 100,000 extra jobs have been created since the start of 2012, when the Government's Action Plan for Jobs was launched.  The latest live register figures from the Central Statistics Office show that in the year to May 2015, the level of unemployment fell by 40,500 or 16.2%.  The unemployment rate is now 9.8%.  In the 12 month period to May 2015, there was an annual net increase in employment of over 40,000, bringing the total number in employment to 1,930,000.</p><p>Most of the increase in employment was in full-time employment, which increased by 52,000, while part-time employment fell by 2.4%.  The long-term unemployment rate fell from 7.3% to 5.9%.  Tax revenue has increased, primarily as a result of the improving economy, while the social welfare bill has fallen in line with falling levels of unemployment.</p> <p> What these figures illustrate is the success of the Government's strategy of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work, particularly decent work.  The Action Plan for Jobs is accelerating Ireland's transition to a sustainable jobs-rich economy, while the Pathways to Work programme is ensuring that as many people as possible of those taking up work are from the live register.  However, we still have a long way to go to ensure that every person in Ireland who wants a job can get a job, a goal this Government intends to achieve by 2018.  I am also acutely aware that long-term unemployment levels, while heading in the right direction, are still far too high.</p> <p> Now that the recovery is beginning to be felt, however, those in work quite reasonably feel that the economic recovery should be reflected in their wage packets.  A return to wage bargaining is visible in many sectors of the economy, and IBEC's recent pay survey found that 57% of companies plan to increase basic pay this year.  According to that survey, the median pay increase is set to be 2%, and other surveys suggest that this figure may well be higher.  So long as pay increases are commensurate with the performance of both the enterprise and the economy and do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities or have an impact on competitiveness either locally or internationally, then such increases can only benefit the economy and strengthen domestic demand.</p> <p> The national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards.  Bearing in mind that social transfers differ from country to country, and also taking the cost of living into account, Ireland's rate is the sixth highest among the 22 EU member states that have a national minimum wage.  The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that just under 4.4% of all employees were being paid the adult experienced national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour, or sub-minimum, in quarter 4 of 2014.</p> <p> As it stands, under the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the national minimum wage can be adjusted by ministerial order in the following ways: following a recommendation in a national agreement; in the absence of such a recommendation, following an examination and recommendation by the Labour Court on foot of a request by a substantially representative organisation of employees or employers; or unilaterally by the Minister, whether or not a recommendation under section 12 or 13 has been made.  The ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the last Labour Court recommendation, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, with lengthy gaps between increases, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than more regular and, therefore, smaller and fairly predictable up-ratings.  For this reason, a significant benefit of the new approach provided for in this Bill is that minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and any adjustments in future will be incremental and less disruptive for business than the steps seen in the past.</p> <p> Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government's agenda, and setting up the Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the statement of Government priorities agreed in July last year.  The commission was launched last February, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, and is currently operating on an interim, non-statutory basis.  It has sought and received submissions, which are currently being considered, and I expect its first report by the middle of July.</p> <p> The Low Pay Commission is a nine-member body comprising an independent chair, three members with an understanding of the interests of low-paid workers, three members with an understanding of the interests of employers, particularly SMEs and those operating in traditionally low-paid sectors, and two members with relevant academic backgrounds.  The duties and functions of the Low Pay Commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage that are designed to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable, in such a way that the minimum wage, over time, is progressively and incrementally increased, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.</p> <p> Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to its functions under the Act, and it will be asked to undertake a considerable body of work each year.  The Bill provides that the commission can be requested to examine a particular matter within two months of its establishment in 2015.  In future years, such requests will be made to the commission by the end of February each year.</p> <p> The commission will be statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.  While it is not provided for in the Bill, it is intended that it will adopt a consensus-based approach to its reports and recommendations.  In discharging its function, the commission will be required to ensure that any advice or set of recommendations it makes to the Government is evidence-based, utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives, and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  Alongside this hard data, the commission will consult with workers and employers who are directly affected by the national minimum wage.  This real, lived experience will be vital for the commissioners when deciding on what the minimum wage rate recommendation should be.  I am aware that the commission, as part of its current deliberations, has engaged directly on a face-to-face basis with employer and worker interests.  This approach draws on that adopted in the UK, where, since 1997, the recommendations of the UK Low Pay Commission have brought about a progressive increase of the minimum wage that has had little detrimental effect on the functioning of the economy or the labour market.</p> <p> Work should always pay.  However, I am also conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair with one that is sustainable and that allows employers to continue to create high-quality jobs.  The changes proposed in establishing the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis are essentially taking much of the politics out of setting the national minimum wage.  It is very much in keeping with the dignity of work agenda I am pursuing, and complements work such as the study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts by the University of Limerick, which I have commissioned.</p> <p> I would like to briefly outline the purpose of each section of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the "Principal Act" as meaning the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Section 2 amends the Principal Act to provide for the insertion of a number of relevant definitions in that Act.  Section 3 provides for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and specifies that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions.</p> <p> Section 4 outlines the duty of the commission and, in this regard, provides that the commission will be required to make such recommendations regarding the national minimum hourly rate of pay that are designed to set a minimum wage that assists as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable, is both fair and sustainable, is adjusted incrementally, where adjustment is appropriate, and, over time, is progressively increased.  All of this should be done without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p> <p> Section 5 provides for the functions of the commission.  In this context, the commission will be required to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and make a recommendation and a report on the issue by 15 July each year.  This section also sets out the range of economic factors that the commission is required to take into account when making a recommendation, including changes in earnings, currency exchange rates and income distribution in the period since the previous minimum wage order; whether, during that period, unemployment, employment and productivity have been increasing or decreasing, both generally and in the sectors most affected by the making of an order; international comparisons, particularly with Great Britain and Northern Ireland; the need for job creation; and the likely effect that any proposed order will have on levels of employment and unemployment, the cost of living and national competitiveness.</p> <p> Section 5 also provides that the commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  In addition, the commission will be required to report every three years on the general operation of the Act.  The commission will be required to consult with employers and employees when preparing reports under section 5.  A copy of each report and recommendation submitted by the commission will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> Section 6 provides that the Minister shall, within three months of receiving a recommendation from the commission in regard to the national minimum hourly rate of pay, make an order in the terms recommended, make an order in other terms, or decline to make an order.  The Minister will be required to lay a statement before both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out the basis for any rejection or variation of a recommendation.  If the commission fails to make a recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate, the Minister may, having had regard to the economic factors specified in the legislation, make an order in regard to the matter.</p> <p> Section 7 provides that the Minister shall advance to the commission out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such amount or amounts as the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, determine for the purposes of expenditure by the commission in the performance of its functions.  Section 7 also provides that the Minister shall make available to the commission such officers of the Minister and reasonable facilities and services as the Minister, after consultation with the commission, may determine.</p> <p> Section 8 provides for a number of technical amendments to the Principal Act.  Section 9 provides for the repeal of sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Principal Act.  Section 10 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction provisions of the Bill.</p><p>The new Schedule provides that the commission will be a nine member body, comprising an independent chairman, three members who will have an understanding of the interests of low-paid workers, three members who will have an understanding of the interests of employers, in particular small to medium sized employers and those operating in traditionally low paid sectors, and two members who will have relevant knowledge or expertise in economics, labour market economics, statistics or employment law.  The Schedule also provides that the Minister shall, in so far as is practicable, endeavour to ensure that among the members there is an equitable balance between men and women.  The term of office of its members will be three years.  Members may serve two consecutive terms of office and will be eligible for reappointment after a break.  The Schedule also includes standard provisions dealing with resignation and termination, disqualification, remuneration and other terms and conditions of office, appearance by the chairman before a committee of either House of the Oireachtas and the regulation of its procedures by the commission.</p> <p> As I have said, throughout the crisis the Government has been committed to maintaining and enhancing employment rights and protecting the most vulnerable workers.  Where changes have been made or new legislation introduced, it has been to improve employment rights.  On low pay alone, one of the first actions of this Government was to restore the minimum wage to the level it was at before the last Government cut it just before leaving office.</p> <p> There is now general agreement that this year will be a good year for the economy, employment, those in lower paid jobs and industrial relations reform.  Separately, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 is progressing through this House.  Deputies are aware that this important Bill provides for significant reforms to industrial relations machinery in the fields of registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and collective bargaining.  We are determined to ensure that the economic recovery continues to strengthen, that employers hire more workers, as well as more full-time workers, and that the low paid, in particular, will share in a fair economic recovery.  That is what this Bill is about.  It about fixing a minimum wage that assists as many low paid workers as possible without threatening jobs or the economy.  Setting up the Low Pay Commission is one of the most important policy initiatives taken by any Government in recent years.  It is evidence of this Government's commitment to making dignity at work a reality.  </p> <p> I want to bring to the attention of the House my intention to introduce a number of amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 on Report Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has been implementing a programme of reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations procedures and institutions since 2012.  The aim of this programme is to establish a world-class workplace relations service and employment rights framework by streamlining the existing mechanisms and establishing a simpler structure, while building upon the recognised strengths of the existing systems.</p> <p> The relevant legislation, that is, the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was signed into law by the President on 20 May 2015.  The Minister has announced that the Act will be commenced on 1 October 2015.  It is a complex piece of legislation and its effect will be to replace the five existing workplace relations bodies with a new simplified two-tier structure.  It will also result in the establishment of new structures for the resolution and adjudication of complaints and disputes across the entire corpus of employment rights and equality legislation.  As a result of the introduction of these new structures it has been necessary to make consequential amendments to 24 primary Acts, 34 specified Parts or sections of Acts and numerous statutory instruments.</p> <p> As part of the very technical and complex drafting process, it became clear following the enactment of the Act that a number of technical and drafting amendments would be necessary in order to ensure the smooth running of the new structures.  This became clear as certain technical legal elements were worked through.  As a consequence, it is essential that these amendments be effected before the commencement of the legislation and the establishment of the new structures on 1 October 2015.</p> <p> I refer to the amendments to Workplace Relations Act that are required.  They include amendments to ensure that the transitional arrangements concerning the manner in which employment rights complaints referred to the existing workplace relations bodies for adjudication will be dealt with post-commencement of the Act are legally robust.  This will require amendments to sections 1, 2, 28, 40, 41, 53, 74, 76, 80, 81, 83 and 84 of the Act.  Consequential amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Acts are necessary to accurately provide for the new adjudication and redress mechanisms being introduced by the Act, as provided for in section 80 of the Act.  Amendments are required in order to take account of the proposed replacement of references to the director of the Equality Tribunal in the Act of 1998 and the Act of 2000 with references to the director general of the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p> <p> It will also be necessary to introduce an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to ensure that the exemption from the legislation which currently applies to the Equality Tribunal, in so far as it relates to its mediation functions, will be extended to the WRC upon commencement of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has agreed to the extension of the current exemption to ensure that it will cover records of the WRC mediation service, in so far as it applies to its functions regarding the resolution of complaints and disputes on a voluntary basis under equality and employment enactments.  It is my intention to introduce these amendments on Report Stage of the Bill in the Dail.</p> <p> During the crisis we remained committed to maintaining employment rights and protecting the most vulnerable.  Our aim in government now is to continue towards a balanced economic recovery.  That means jobs growth in the regions as well as Dublin.  It means spreading the recovery to all socioeconomic groups, because there is no future for this economy and for our society unless we remain committed to these twin objectives, that is, to sustain the recovery and to share the benefits.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400032#EE00200"><p>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is a significant development and the commission has the potential to be a significant improvement on the current system.  The commission has major potential in this area and it should be afforded more.  There is pressure on it to deliver its first recommendation, but I would like to see it examine areas such as the living wage because the debate on the minimum wage has moved on, as the Minister of State knows.  He referred to dignity at work.  The most important thing is that work pays, and people are rewarded for their work and treated fairly.  A discussion on the living wage opens up many areas that the Low Pay Commission can take on board.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that decisions on the minimum wage are, to a certain extent, being taken out of the political system and will be evidence based.  As part of our preparation for this Bill, we met the UK Low Pay Commission and saw its work in action.  I welcome, in particular, that the commissioners travel around the UK to meet businesses, employers and employees in the regions and learn directly how their decisions will impact on employees and employers.  I hope that our commissioners will take that message on board and travel across the country.</p>  <p>  While I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, I note the submission from the Department of Finance on the national minimum wage warned of serious risks surrounding the increase in the national minimum wage.  Its view was that any increase would reduce employment and put at risk gains made since 2008.  It also wanted a system to allow the minimum wage to be reduced in the future.  That was done once before and it was a mistake.  It says more about the ethos of the troika, which insisted on that happening, that as a body it wanted to engage in social engineering rather than financial assistance.  That should not be allowed to happen again under the new system.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on the Department of Finance submission, in particular as he has responsibility for employment and ensuring this does not happen.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il made a number of recommendations in its submission to the Low Pay Commission.  We sought to meet the commission but it told us it was not in a position to do so.  It is ironic that we can meet the UK commission but not our own.  I hope it is more open to meeting political parties and the various interest groups in its operation.  I know it is under pressure to reach an early decision, but that is not a good way to do business.</p>  <p>  Our submission calls for a 6.4% increase in the minimum wage, which would bring it to &euro;9.20 an hour and represent an increase in gross pay of &euro;1,115 per annum based on a 39 hour week.  We feel the State, as a major employer, should lead the way in terms of a living wage.  The remit of the commission should be expanded to begin work on defining what a living wage is and calculating the rates that need to be set to achieve this aim, and we will table amendments to this effect.  On the basis of that work, the State, as a major employer, should seek to ensure that the people it employs, as well as those it employs indirectly, are paid the minimum wage.  </p>  <p>  There is a need to examine minimum wages across the country.  Some cognisance should be taken of the fact that it is far more expensive to live in and pay for day-to-day costs, such as transport, rent and housing, in some regions.</p><p>Given that we are putting the resources in place, the time has come to name and shame rogue employers who fail to adhere to the law and pay the minimum wage, disrespect their workers and treat them unfairly, as well as seek competitive advantage by getting around the minimum wage laws.  It is time Revenue and other organisations kept a quarterly register of those employers prosecuted under the national minimum wage legislation.  People will then know those companies playing with their workers&rsquo; lives and seeking competitive advantage.</p> <p> The University of Limerick working group on zero-hour and low-hour contracts, established by the Minister of State, should be merged with the Low Pay Commission.  The calibre of those in the working group is very good but the Low Pay Commission has day-to-day experience with thousands of employers and employees.  It has the capacity, if given proper support, to carry on this agenda and to ensure the work under way at the University of Limerick does not end up in a cul-de-sac.  An extension of the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s remit to examine zero-hour and low-hour contracts would be beneficial for everyone.</p> <p> It should be recognised the Government doubled the cost of employers&rsquo; PRSI overnight.  Doing so resulted in people losing their jobs because of the cost to employers.  Employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions need to be reduced with a view to encouraging extra employment and ensuring it pays employers to take on people, particularly from the live register.  Despite the various statistics the Minister of State read out, we still have a serious problem with long-term unemployment.  The data show a cohort people stuck on the live register for two to three years.  We need to put serious investment and effort into targeting those people and giving them training opportunities to prepare them for the workforce.</p> <p> The Bill replaces the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Over that time, there were many increases in the minimum wage along with one decrease.  I have already commented on the role of the troika in that decrease and have previously acknowledged it was a mistake.  Now, there will be an annual research-based approach on the impact of the national minimum wage on employment and its relevance to people&rsquo;s incomes and day-to-day living standards.  This will ensure we have a backup in future.</p> <p> I am concerned about the changes the Minister of State has announced to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  Original work began on this legislation in 2010 and it was in gestation for four years.  Will the Minister of State provide us with a detailed briefing note on his proposed changes before he introduces them?  It is not appropriate to introduce legislation in the way proposed.  While I understand the rationale behind it, will he provide a detailed briefing note on the impact of these proposals to the legislation?</p> <p> The Minister of State made the usual comments about everything being relatively rosy in his garden and about economic recovery.  I acknowledge the growth in employment but the Minister of State threw in at the end that it is not regionally based.  In many of our regions, the numbers in the labour force are falling.  For example, the quarterly national household survey shows a drop in the Border, midland and western region.  The Government does not have a regional jobs policy.  It has been pointed out for many years that the Government is allowing employment go to the large cities which, in turn, piles on accommodation and transport costs.  These are many of the issues that lead to the problems that we have been trying to deal with over the past six years.  Once again, we are at risk of repeating this.</p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s response is a regional jobs action plan, which it intends to publish over the summer recess.  First, we will not have a chance to properly review it in the House.  Second, the fact it is an any other business, AOB, item on the Government&rsquo;s programme as it prepares to go into an election is an indication of how low down it is on its agenda.  There needs to be serious engagement on the regional economies, not just some public relations blitz over the summer.  He needs to ensure he works with IDA Ireland and that it takes the issue seriously.  It is unacceptable that in 2014 only 37% of IDA site visits occurred outside of Dublin and Cork core.  Those who want to set up small companies and create employment in their communities are still struggling to get finance and support from local enterprise offices and local Leader companies.  A start-up company was in contact with and it  has had to lay off staff because of difficulties in dealing with its local Leader company.  This is repeated across the country.</p> <p> This is happening in the absence of any regional jobs policy.  The main thing in the Government's jobs action plan is that it is cross-departmental, involves all the pillars of government and everybody focuses on it.  However, jobs are being lost and choked because of the inability of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to properly manage the Leader and rural enterprise programmes.</p> <p> I predict these regional job action plans will be much smoke and mirrors with big public relations announcements but little substance.  Will the Minister of State take it seriously?  He cannot allow the country to develop a dependency on employment in the capital city, leaving the regions behind.  He cannot allow the cost base for business to grow out of control because the Government is focusing growth in one part of the country.  If he pursues this policy, talk of minimum and living wages will be irrelevant to many people across the country when they do not have the opportunity for employment.</p></speech>

Mar is eol do ch&aacute;ch, t&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im sa t&iacute;r maidir le p&aacute; &iacute;seal agus daoine at&aacute; ag iarraidh a bheith ag obair go l&aacute;n-aimseartha sa gheilleagar.  T&aacute; an g&eacute;arch&eacute;im seo ag dul in olcas agus t&aacute;imid ag bun an dr&eacute;imire i gcompar&aacute;id len&aacute;r bp&aacute;irtn&eacute;ir&iacute; thar timpeall na hEorpa.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the establishment of a Low Pay Commission but wants it to be fit for purpose and ambitious for the results it seeks to achieve.  The Labour Party's limp Low Pay Commission will not scratch the surface with regard to the damage done to this society over the past eight years.  The Minister of State stated the commission has been modelled on its British counterpart.  Alan Buckle, a senior adviser to the Labour Party in Britain and former deputy chairman and chief executive officer of KPMG, carried out a comprehensive report on low pay in Britain, published last year.  In it he described the British commission:</p>  <p>[However], its role is short term and narrow.  The current regime was designed in the 1990s to stop extreme low pay and abuse.  Today the challenge is different, with millions of people earning just above the minimum but still living in poverty.  This requires a broader and more ambitious strategy to tackle low pay.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s Resolution Foundation&rsquo;s review of the future of the national minimum wage also found the role of the commission in Britain needs to change.  The report&rsquo;s first recommendation stated, &ldquo;the government should make it an explicit long-term ambition of economic policy to reduce the incidence and persistence of low pay in the UK labour market&rdquo; and that it should &ldquo;broaden and elevate the body into the government&rsquo;s official watchdog on low pay, monitoring and pushing progress in the manner of the Office for Budget Responsibility on fiscal policy.&rdquo;  The expert panel that completed this report was chaired by Professor George Bain, the founding chair of the Low Pay Commission in Britain.</p><p>These people, who have deep insight into the function of a low pay commission, when analysing how it worked in Britain over a period of time, came to the conclusion that the Low Pay Commission should be broadened and elevated.  I and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in have raised these reports with the Minister of State in the Seanad and at committee meetings, but he has refused to constructively engage with Sinn F&eacute;in, trade unions and NGOs on the recommendations contained within.</p> <p> Britain&rsquo;s experience offers us a real opportunity to construct a commission that is relevant and ambitious in its purpose.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  We can see what has been invented.  It is as if we are inventing the calculator on this issue while Britain is inventing the iPad.  What we are constructing is a generation behind our counterparts in the rest of Europe, who are realising the faults within it.</p> <p> Ireland is at a crossroads, and while it is not politically opportune for Fine Gael or the Labour Party to acknowledge the scale of income and economic inequality in Ireland, the Minister of State has a responsibility to do so.  He has excluded the provision of public services and social security as provided for under the International Labour Organization's minimum wage fixing convention as a consideration for the commission, and there is not even a fleeting reference to inequality or poverty, two major problems in Irish society.  The Minister of State could have given the Low Pay Commission the role of watchdog on low pay and given its members the power to set targets to reduce low pay across a number of policy areas, but he chose not to do so.</p> <p> In Britain it has been recommended that as part of its broader remit the Low Pay Commission should examine annually the effectiveness of policies to enforce the national minimum wage and make recommendations for improvement.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports this proposal, and it is clear from other areas of employment law that enforcement is a massive and damaging problem.</p> <p> In evidence to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Migrant Rights Centre opined that focusing on extreme low pay is a restrictive approach, adding that the work of the commission should be far more ambitious.  The organisation recommended that the Government set a goal for the elimination of low pay, that the remit of the Low Pay Commission be expanded so that it becomes a watchdog on low pay, and that it be given powers to set targets to reduce low pay across a number of policy areas.</p> <p> The National Women&rsquo;s Council also appeared before the committee and sought the extension of the work of the commission to have regard to gender equality and other equality factors as a named aspect in its deliberations, as are the cost of living, in-work poverty levels, quality of job creation and the social and economic impact of wage levels and the associated cost or benefit to the State.</p> <p> The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice highlighted the organisation's concern that people working a full week come home with a wage that does not meet their family&rsquo;s minimum essential standard of living.  It is very difficult to see members of a family carrying out a full week's work but not having the money to pay for accommodation, food, clothing, health and education.  An economy built in this manner is an unfair economy.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice stated that it is difficult to see how the question of the adequacy of the national minimum wage cannot be part of the remit of the commission.  It accepted that it is not the only consideration, and accepted the importance of employment, competitiveness and economic issues, but argued that adequacy must also be taken into account.</p> <p> ICTU in its presentation described the omission of any reference to the median wage as surprising, given that when the national minimum wage was introduced it was recommended that it be set at two thirds of the median wage.  It added that the median wage is the normal criterion against which national minimum wages are considered and set.</p> <p> All of these contributions reflect some of the debate taking place in Britain on the shortfalls of the current Low Pay Commission, the model on which the Minister of State has based the Irish Low Pay Commission.  The bottom line is that he has limited the work of the commission to advising on the setting of a national minimum wage, and it is impossible for us to fathom why this is the case.</p> <p> High levels of low-paid, insecure work are now entrenched in the Irish labour market, and this type of work is seeping into non-traditional low-paid sectors such as journalism, health and legal services.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in the OECD and of underemployment in the 28 EU member states.  It is no accident, because the Government and the previous Government have focused on creating two competitive advantages: a tax break economy and inherent low wages.  Sinn F&eacute;in has cried out over and over again that if we want a functioning and sustainable economy we need to look at competitive advantages in our infrastructure, education and health services.  To focus on low wages and bargain basement tax opportunities is unsustainable and costly to our citizens.</p> <p> A total of 60% of people on low pay are women, and 50% of women in Ireland earn &euro;20,000 or less.  These are shocking figures.  Gross income inequality in Ireland is the highest in the EU before social transfers.  The Government admits this and then lauds the fact that it has a social welfare system to try to beat this massive problem. The social welfare system is in effect providing a sizeable subsidy to employers with regard to pay.  If these social welfare supports were to be pulled away, of course enormous damage would be done to employers, but it would also mean that employers would not be able to employ people on the wages they pay to carry out the work they do.</p> <p> As TASC and others have extrapolated from significant domestic and EU-wide research, there are now structural deficiencies in Ireland and in the EU economy which, if left unchecked, will continue to result in wage dumping and stagnation.  Squeezing wages will not deliver the growth we need and, more importantly, it will not tackle inequality or deliver the goods and services on which citizens rely.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael&rsquo;s low-pay, low-tax and high-cost economic model is not serving us well.  Wage share as a percentage of national income has fallen in Ireland by roughly 20% in the past 30 years.  This trend is replicated across the EU 15, and while the fall in some instances has not been as sharp, it is between 10% and 20%.  Therefore, the proportion of people's wages as national income has been decreasing over the past 30 years.  This trend has not gone into reverse under the watch of the Labour Party.</p> <p> Recent research conducted by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies and presented to the TASC annual conference last week argues that, instead of allowing the continuation of wage moderation or dumping policies, we need to fundamentally rethink our economic policy.  Wages are a driver of the economy, and if we do not tackle low pay, consumption will fall, private investment will not make up the shortfall and most of the positive effects of net exports will be wiped out.  However, as the remit of the commission is constructed currently, it is not instructed to consider any of these matters.  This makes no sense.</p> <p> Ministers have claimed that establishing the Low Pay Commission pushes pay outside the realm of politics, which ensures that low pay issues stay front and centre in public debate and are never allowed to drift off the agenda.  The Minister with responsibility for business and employment has said that the establishment of the commission essentially takes politics out of setting the minimum wage.  This makes no sense to me.</p><p>I challenge anybody to stand in front of the electorate in the upcoming election and state that low pay is outside the basis of political debate and is not a political issue.  I challenge the Minister of State to stand in front of the people at the next election and say to them that if he is re-elected, he will ensure that he has a hands-off attitude with regard to low pay and it will not be directly in the political debate.  Setting the national minimum wage is a political decision underpinned by the fact that the Bill itself provides that the Minister can accept, reject or vary the recommendations of the commission.  The Government&rsquo;s use of State-sponsored bodies as a mechanism by which to wash its hands of responsibility for policy and political decisions is completely disingenuous and fools nobody.</p> <p> We need to be ambitious for what the Low Pay Commission can achieve and we need to draw from the existing wealth of expertise and research available on how we can meet this objective.  As the Alan Buckle report notes, in advance of the national minimum wage being introduced, warnings of huge job losses proved false, and most businesses now see the minimum wage as integral to protecting them from being undercut by those competing with extreme low wages.  It is also important to realise that we are living on a planet that has seen massive change in wage equality issues, with 1% of the population now having almost the same level of income as the poorest half of the population.  We live in a country where wage inequality is strongly and radically different from what it was in the country in which I was born in the 1970s.  It is not business as usual with this issue and it is not simply the left and right having a barney over what wage should be set.  This is an issue on which nobody, regardless of his or place on the political spectrum, should shirk responsibility in dealing with the catastrophe that is the low wage economy that has become embedded in society.</p> <p> There is also a strong business case for expanding the remit of the commission to consider low pay, zero-hour contracts and the introduction of a living wage, as well as working towards a higher skill, higher wage economy.  Tackling low pay is good for society and for the economy; it is good for people and business, and it is also good for the Government's finances.  Limiting the debate, policy and political agenda to a discussion solely on the minimum wage is a wasted opportunity for the Government.</p> <p> The Minister of State made a number of references to the general state of the economy but the truth is that emigration has made a far larger impact on the unemployment figures in this country than any Government policy from the past four years.  There are between 80,000 and 90,000 people "employed" in job activation schemes, and these individuals are not getting the proper compensation for the jobs they do.  The figures mask the reality and Ireland is still in a jobs crisis.  We have seen the development of a two-tier Irish society with respect to wages and poverty, for example.  We also live in a two-tier society in a geographical sense, as outside the M50 many people can only read about so-called growth and consume it through the media.  The south west has seen a fall in the number of people employed and the Border region is still in significant recession.  If we consider this from an age perspective, we are still seeing falls in the numbers of young people employed.</p> <p> There is a major opportunity in this economy but the Government has not pursued it.  On numerous occasions I suggested to the Minister that there must be a radical approach to e-commerce, as billions of euro are flowing out of the economy because retail is migrating towards e-commerce.  Nevertheless, most Irish retail is not ready for e-commerce.  The issue will worsen if the Government does not take radical action.</p> <p> I make an appeal to the Minister.  Instead of writing pre-election scripts and bringing them to Leinster House, he should take cognisance of the deep and damaging scenario that we have in this country with regard to unemployment and entrenched low pay.  Instead of developing a limp Low Pay Commission, the Government should have ambition for the opportunities that the Minister could have.  I have said it before and will repeat it that the Minister may not have another crack at this, and it may be the last opportunity he has to address this significant problem and build on to the Low Pay Commission the ability to focus on all aspects of low pay and public services, which have a phenomenal impact on people's purchasing power.  It is not too late to make those changes.  We will present our amendments on Committee Stage and I urge the Minister to close his ears to Fine Gael backbenchers and open them to the plight of those on low pay.</p></speech>

He declared that he was very much worth it.  The approach of the Government is to set up this Low Pay Commission, express some concern about the crisis of low pay and wage inequality in society and then hive it off to a supposedly non-political body while standing over and continuing the drive of basing the recovery on a model of low pay and poor working conditions.</p>  <p>  We have a crisis of low pay in this country and the second highest rate of low pay within the OECD.  Average wages fell again in the course of last year, according to the Central Statistics Office, despite the much vaunted recovery.  Together with this is a crisis of working conditions, which has been highlighted most graphically with the Dunnes Stores dispute, with workers being treated like they were on 19th century docks.  The employer has complete control of hours worked and wages earned, etc., and this is used as a means to gain submission from workers, who can be punished for going on strike.  We also saw the callous way in which the Clerys workers have been treated, thrown aside by an employer which was legally allowed to do so, with the previous employer walking away with a large amount of money.  This is linked to the model of recovery taking place and the nature of work that is changing in this economy.  The fact that the commission is solely focused on the question of low pay means it is missing a very important issue.</p>  <p>  There were 272,000 fewer full-time jobs in the economy in 2014 compared with 2008, or a 15% drop in full-time jobs.  At the same time, there are 55,700 more part-time jobs in the economy, a 14% rise, which speaks to the fact that previously reasonably secure and perhaps unionised or reasonably well-paid full-time positions have been replaced with a so-called jobs recovery made up of part-time, unsecure, un-unionised work, which may include zero-hour or low-hour contracts and precarious conditions, with workers subject to gross exploitation.  That is not accidental and the Government cannot just wash its hands by saying it will have a Low Pay Commission to consider the low pay issue.  The Government has actively promoted that model of recovery; it consists of low pay, zero-hour contracts and extra profitability for employers.  We are a low wage but high profit economy.</p>  <p>  A key method of the Government, which should be examined by the Low Pay Commission, is the use of so-called job activation programmes.  These are the likes of JobBridge, Gateway, T&uacute;s, First Steps or whatever new name is formulated to try to rebrand people working for free, with employers getting free work in the public or private sector and people just receiving the dole and a very small extra payment of &euro;1 or slightly more per hour.</p><p>That is in itself gross exploitation of those people, who in many cases are forced to work for free, with the threat of losing their dole, or a portion of it, hanging over their heads if they do not agree to work.  It also drives down wages and conditions across the economy, because employers can use free labour, rather than paying people to work, and may use that against other workers.  The Low Pay Commission should investigate the role of those so-called job activation programmes in pushing down wages across the economy.</p> <p> I want to draw particular attention to one submission to the Low Pay Commission.  IBEC has said it does not see any reason to favour an increase in the minimum wage but the Department of Finance has effectively said the same thing.  This is an incredible situation, where one Department has made a submission to a body set up by the Government, supposedly to look at an increase in the minimum wage, and it argues that an increase in the minimum wage above the market clearing wage is likely to reduce employment.  That is based on very few empirical studies.  The vast majority of such studies give no evidence for that.  It then argues that, in principle, this suggests that adjustment of the minimum wage should be symmetric and allow for consideration of a reduction in the rate in response to a shock to demand or a sudden loss in competitiveness.  The fact that the Department of Finance made a submission potentially arguing for a reduction in the minimum wage sums up the Government's approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1195" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400036#JJ00200"><p>A year ago in this Chamber, the T&aacute;naiste was being enthroned as the new Labour Party leader and T&aacute;naiste and she promised a Low Pay Commission.  It is very difficult to take that seriously when on one hand she is setting up a Low Pay Commission, and then this very week she is launching large-scale attacks on low-paid workers, mainly women, mothers who work part-time, through the one-parent family cuts.  These are the low-paid women who get up early in the morning and clean our floors and offices, care for our relatives and who serve our coffee in Starbucks and elsewhere.  It is women who are concentrated in the low-paid, casual sector, in the main, due to child care responsibilities.  The opposition building up to the T&aacute;naiste's cuts and the fact that she is launching a Low Pay Commission when she is attacking low paid workers must be registered.</p>  <p>  We do not need a Low Pay Commission.  There are no low-paid people on the commission, by the way.  We have two union representatives, a representative from the Migrant Rights Centre, which is good, and we have academics.  However, they are outnumbered by chief executives and company directors.  There is already in-built discrimination in the body fighting for the low-paid.  We have the CEO of Maxol.  I wonder what he will have to contribute about low pay.</p>  <p>  Ireland is scourged with low pay.  Around 20% of workers earn less than two thirds of the average wage, which is one of the highest rates of low pay in the European Union.  Ireland's minimum wage is only 75% of what is calculated to be a living wage, which is calculated at &euro;11.45 an hour with which people would not be throwing many parties.  If the T&aacute;naiste really wants to stop low pay, the first thing she should introduce is an increase of &euro;2.80 an hour to bring it up to a living wage at least for the few who are on it.  If our minimum wage were nearer to a living wage, &euro;1 billion more could be spent in the local economy, because it is obviously spent by people who live and work here.  It would be a huge stimulus after the recession.</p>  <p>  Income inequality is particularly hard-hitting in Ireland because our public services are inadequate compared to those enjoyed by other European countries.  We have high fees for GPs and emergency department visits, child care costs and school book costs, which other European countries would not have.  The cost of living is 20% higher here than the European average.  Leaving aside the tax and social welfare systems, income inequality is among the highest in the OECD.  Governments must then use social welfare to subsidise employers and this inequality through mechanisms like the family income supplement, which renders the attack on lone parents even more reprehensible.  The inequality in society is growing.  It is obvious and it is well-known, which is why there is a movement against austerity right now.</p>  <p>  The top 10% in Ireland take one third of all income, which is up from 27% in the 1970s, so the bottom 90% have 66% of income.  This is a global pattern.  We see the shocking statistic from Oxfam that 80 people have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion on the planet.  That is an obscenity, which cries out for the system to be changed.  In the cradle of capitalism, the USA, one would imagine minimum wages would be much worse than ours.  However, there is a movement of low-paid workers in America - fast-food workers, migrant workers and female workers - who are winning pay increases, without parliamentary commissions, because it is not generally commissions and governments that grant these things.   I was recently in Seattle, which has established a minimum wage of $15 an hour.  That is much higher than even the living wage I called for.  It is not just in Seattle.  It has set a precedent for other states.  Los Angeles is now also adopting a $15 an hour minimum wage.  That means that companies like McDonald's have to pay workers $15 an hour, but they can pay them much less in Europe, which is quite amazing when one considers how the balance has shifted.  Even presidential candidates running in next year's presidential elections are raising the idea of a $15 an hour minimum wage in the US.  We can see how far the Labour Party has fallen when we have &euro;9 an hour, which is much less, despite having similar costs.  We do not need a Low Pay Commission.  It is a waste of money.  It is obvious that workers need a pay rise.</p></speech>

The idea of a Low Pay Commission is welcome, but I have the feeling that its recommendations are likely to be unimpressive and if the neoliberal agenda and austerity measures introduced by the last two Governments are not seriously scaled back, it will take more than a rise in the minimum wage to stop the march of rising inequality in Ireland.  In the proposed Bill, it is stated that when making a recommendation on a national minimum hourly rate of pay, the effects of any proposed order on the cost of living will be taken into account.  It is highly instructive as to the Government's framing of how the Low Pay Commission will work that there is no mention whatsoever in the Bill of taking into account the cost of living when making a determination as to what the new national minimum wage should be.</p><p>On top of this, the Government has done next to nothing to address the fact that we have one of the most inadequate universal public service systems in Europe, along with a cost of living that is 20% higher than the EU average.  Instead of improving public services and investing in networks of the State so that we can continue to provide funding for social goods, this Government has engaged in the fire sale<font color="#FF0000"> </font>of national assets and investments through the medium of NAMA, IBRC and State-owned banks.  It has attacked the social welfare system that is one of the last barriers to abject poverty for so many people and proposed tax cuts that will overwhelmingly benefit the highest-income earners.  To quote Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, <blockquote>I suggest that we are wary of politicians, commentators and economists who come to our TV screens offering treats of &lsquo;more money in your pocket&rsquo; through tax cuts.  We might ask them to price these tax cuts in public service forgone, community health centres not opened, public transport not invested in, quality and affordable childcare not provided.</blockquote>Last Friday, the T&aacute;naiste told an audience in the Croke Park conference centre that not having a job or losing a job is the root cause of inequality.  This is a strange way to view the problem of inequality, which does not have a single root cause.  It has multiple root causes, which create inequalities of outcome that contribute to worsening inequality of opportunity.  Many people in Ireland work and are still poor.  This is due to many factors.  First, there has been no Government policy to tackle the problem of low pay.  More than 20% of people in employment earn less than two thirds of the average wage.  This is one of the highest rates in Europe.  Members of Fine Gael have uttered the phrase &quot;living wage&quot; just three times in this Chamber, twice in response to someone else bringing up the issue.</p><p>In Scotland, the government has been paying all of its staff above the level of the living wage for some time.  More than 200 Scotland-based employers display the living wage accreditation mark, and they are on target to have more than 500 companies on board by March 2016.  The living wage is an hourly rate that is set independently and updated annually.  Employers choose to pay the living wage on a voluntary basis, while the national minimum wage is statutory and enforced by Revenue and Customs.</p> <p> Instead of doing something as meaningful as this that brings the issue of low pay to the forefront of the national conversation, the Government is promising to have a discussion about the minimum wage as long as it does not jar with any of the rules of neoliberal economics, namely that any recommendations by the commission should be made "without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness."  Globalisation, neoliberalism, the dismantling of international trade barriers, the rise of big business and the power of markets, and the consequent pressure put on countries to be internationally competitive, have led Europe from the golden age of economic stability and household income equality of the 1950s and 1960s to a situation in which, according to the French legal scholar Dr. Alain Supiot, "the problem is not that of adapting the economy to the needs of human beings, but rather the reverse - adapting human beings to the needs of markets, and especially to the needs of financial markets, which supposedly create harmony by making self-interest the basis for all human activity."  This position is one that fails to recognise that there is no wealth other than human beings and that an economy that ill-treats them has little future.</p></speech>

It is probably fair to say that if James Connolly was not already worn out from turning in his grave, he would be going into a massive tailspin.  Let us face it: this is a cosmetic exercise, a pretence at dealing with the reality of poverty experienced by workers in this country that sees half of the population on earnings of less than &euro;27,000.  Whether a person on such a wage is fortunate - or unfortunate - enough to have a mortgage or is renting accommodation, the average price of a unit will be &euro;1,200, and almost half of his or her earnings will go on accommodation costs.  The backdrop to this discussion is that in 2013, Ireland had the second highest percentage of low-paid jobs across its labour force in the OECD.  Michael Taft has stated that workers in hospitality and retail, two of the lowest-paid sectors in the economy, would need a 20% increase to reach the average paid in central European countries.  We are not even talking about doing anything as dramatic or radical as that.  This is merely tinkering at the edges.  It is a pretence at doing something after a D&aacute;il term when nothing has really happened other than the expansion of a gulf between those at the bottom, those in the middle and those at the top of Irish society.</p>  <p>  We are told that, under the provisions of this Bill, as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable will be assisted by the Low Pay Commission.  What does "reasonably practicable" mean?  According to the Bill, it means that the wages of low-paid workers will be incrementally increased as long as those increases do not have adverse consequences for national competitiveness and as long as increasing the wages of workers who earn approximately &euro;18,000 before tax - if they are lucky enough to be in a full-time job, which, obviously, most of them are not - does not have an impact on productivity.  We must look at those low level of wages in terms not only of the amount but of the society that we live in, the utter decimation of the social wage and the non-existent public services in Ireland, which means one must pay out of one's wages for health care, education and parking, even if one must visit a relative in a hospital or shop on a main street.  Instead, we are talking about considering wages in the context of national competitiveness.  I support the call of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to consider these issues in the context of a living wage, much more so than what is being proposed here.</p>  <p>  The race to the bottom in Irish society is not accidental.  It is a deliberate product of neoliberalism.  What is missing from this Bill is almost as telling as what is in it.  Other points have been made that the cost of living will be increased, but at the same time it is not enough.</p>  <p>  We need to look at issues such as quality of life, precarious employment, employment conditions, public services and unpaid care work, not only for low-paid workers but for everybody.  We need an examination of what is going on in the workplace across this country.  There is not one mention anywhere of the idea of a living wage.  We live in a country where 60% of pilots in one of our biggest airlines are on zero-hour contracts, where Dunnes Stores workers have been fired in retaliation for going out on strike and where the entire staff of Clerys lost their jobs overnight two weeks ago.  We are talking about low pay, but we are not really delivering on any of these issues because the discussion is taking place within the confines of neoliberalism and we are dressing it up as measures to address inequality.  However, in reality, when we confirm that premise, we cannot address it.</p>  <p>  I will finish with correspondence I received from a worker in Ryanair.  I suppose he is one of the fortunate ones who has a job.  Indeed, he is not so fortunate.  He states that on a daily basis he and his co-workers are disgustingly exploited and that every month his duty plan shows that his ground hours exceed flight hours, the only kind of hours for which he gets paid, by at least 30 hours.  He states that if they get sick they do not get a penny, that the company does not provide them with any kind of pension or health insurance whatsoever, and that if they get fired they will not get a cent either - in fact, they will be lucky if they do not have to pay for the privilege.  Those are the issues that we need to be seriously addressing, rather than implementing cosmetic stunts in the run-up to an election.</p></speech>

The commission is tasked with making annual recommendations to the Government which it considers appropriate on the level of the minimum wage and so-called "related matters".  The commission has been up and running for the past number of months.</p>  <p>  I note from the press release when the commission was established that, according to its terms of reference, it was to look at the changes in earnings since the minimum wage was last increased in 2011.  This is interesting because I thought it had been restored.  The last increase in the national minimum wage was in 2007.  It had been cut as part of an austerity measure, but the Minister made much of the fact that he restored it.  The Low Pay Commission should be looking a lot further back than 2011.</p>  <p>  Another issue I note with interest is currency exchange rates.  This is an interesting one for them to consider as well, because I assumed we lived in the euro area and workers would be paid in Ireland, but maybe there are many workers out there being paid in sterling or other currencies, which has to be taken into account.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the commission will consist of nine members and that the Minister, or whoever the next Minister is, will appoint them.  I am concerned that the recruitment process is not clear or transparent.  As I stated, the Minister is involved in appointing each member.  A commission appointed by a different Minister could have a different slant.  The make-up of the commission includes two academic members, but many academics could have a particular political stance on how the economy should work and could bring that to bear in deciding how the commission works and what its recommendations are.</p>  <p>  It is clear after years of austerity that work has increasingly become precarious and riddled with insecurity for those involved, and there are new forms of work emerging, including zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  Income inequality is soaring.  Ireland is witnessing a widening income gap, with over a third of all income concentrated in the hands of the top 10% of earners, according to TASC.  Ireland is now the most unequal country in the EU when it comes to how the economy distributes income, before taxes and social welfare payments are included.</p><p>This precariat is a characteristic of 21st century capitalism and is based on flexible, periodic and insecure unemployment, transiency, a lack of control over time, overqualification and uncertainty.  This best describes the situation facing many workers, including seasonal ones in my constituency in Donegal.  The experience of greater insecurity in work has increased alongside a reduction in social security.  Perhaps it should be called social insecurity, as it does nothing to provide a safety net as matters stand.</p> <p> Unemployment remains a major issue for rural Ireland.  Although employment levels have increased, the quality of such employment has decreased since austerity started.  These effects will be felt for many years to come.  Some of the statistics are startling and should be examined.  There are 272,000 fewer full-time jobs in Ireland today compared with 2007, a decrease of 15%, the number of people in part-time jobs is 55,700 higher, an increase of 14%, and more than one quarter of part-time workers, 115,000 plus, are underemployed.  Between 2010 and the end of 2014, the number of long-term unemployed persons fell by 48,700.  In the same period, though, the net loss to emigration was 123,000 people.  Some 58% of the unemployed are long-term unemployed.</p> <p> Now more than ever, a low pay commission is necessary.  I welcome its introduction, even this late in the day.  That the Central Statistics Office, CSO, quarterly earnings, hours and employment costs survey showed that 4.7% of employees, or just over 73,000 workers, were paid at or below the national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in the second quarter of 2014 should be a worrying statistic.  I am surprised that the percentage is that low, as I believe that more are paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p> To date, the mechanism for reviewing the national minimum wage rate involved the Labour Court, which made recommendations to the Minister after taking into account submissions from interested parties.  The last Labour Court recommendation was made in November 2006 and recommended an increase to &euro;8.30 and then &euro;8.65 from 1 July 2007.  The wage was decreased in 2011 but quickly restored by the current Government.  It is in respect of the most recent increase that the minimum wage commission must work.</p> <p> We should be discussing a living wage commission rather than a low pay commission.  We should be working towards the achievement of a living wage instead of tinkering with the minimum wage, which becomes a ceiling for low pay and the many workers earning less than it.</p></speech>

Compared with our European counterparts, our standing in this matter is stark and shameful.  We have the second highest level of low pay in the OECD.  We are the worst in Europe, with 22% of people being low paid and 16% of workers living in poverty.  One might claim that all of this is down to the recession, but compare it with the rest of Europe.  The digest provided by the library service was helpful, as it supplied a table of comparisons with minimum wage rates everywhere else in Europe.  It is extraordinary that there have been significant increases in minimum wage rates virtually everywhere.  Belgium's has increased by 15% since 2008, Bulgaria's has increased by 64% and the Czech Republic's has increased by 11%.  Spain, one of the worst hit countries, has managed to increase its minimum wage by 8%.  France's has increased by 14% and Latvia's has increased by 57%.  Portugal, another country that we might be compared with, has seen an increase of 19%.  The UK's has increased by 11% and the minimum wage in the US has increased by 50%.  Here, there has been nothing, but four years into office, the Government has suddenly decided that it is worried about low pay.  One must be cynical.</p>  <p>  Given what this Government has been responsible for, it suggests that the Government has been encouraging a race to the bottom or has failed to take action about factors that result in low pay.  Gateway, JobBridge and the cuts to lone parents payments that I tried to demonstrate to the T&aacute;naiste this morning have reduced the economic benefit and incentive to lone parents to work.  They will lose money thanks to the cuts that the T&aacute;naiste is imposing while Gateway and JobBridge displace and undermine jobs, although I will not say "well-paid jobs".  Those schemes further encourage a race to the bottom, with people working for nothing when they should be paid proper wages.</p>  <p>  The consumer price index, CPI, is not increasing dramatically, but the largest outlay for workers is accommodation.  Rents have increased by 21% in Dublin and property prices have increased by 41% in the past year.  The cost of putting a roof over one's head has increased significantly, yet there has been no increase in wages.  As a result, there has been a dramatic spike in the number of people living in poverty, including those who are working, and a spectacular growth in the gap between rich and poor.  Meanwhile, the Government has done nothing about the spike in recent years in the wealth levels of those at the top.</p>  <p>  In the past 25 or 30 years, the proportion of national wealth that goes to wages has decreased by 10% while the proportion that goes to profits, shares and bonuses - basically, to the rich - has increased by 10%.  The recession has accelerated this.  There has been a transfer from workers to the rich, but the Government has done nothing about it.  The idea that the Low Pay Commission will deal with it is ludicrous.</p></speech>

Listening to the Deputies opposite, one would believe that the Low Pay Commission was being set up to take money from workers rather than to examine increasing homes' incomes or to consider strategies that involved proper analyses of how to achieve consent on increasing low incomes, which are concerning for people who find it increasingly difficult to live as we emerge from the recession.  It should form part of an analysis of the structure of society with a view to helping people return to work.</p>  <p>  We have 100,000 more people working today than we had on the day that we entered office.  Significant changes are taking place in society and there is an increasing awareness of improvements in our economy.  Our export levels have increased and there is a general increase in confidence in the Government's capacity to deal with the recession in a pragmatic way that has resulted in major changes to how people view their future prospects in this country.</p>  <p>  A question that we must address, and which the Government has addressed in some respect, is on how to provide additional money to people who are working.  One way is through tax reductions.</p><p>A reduction in income tax makes it more attractive for people to go to work or stay in work.  A significant part of the Government's strategy involves reducing the contributions made under the much-condemned universal social charge, particularly by lower-paid workers.  The number of people not paying the charge has increased significantly since we came into office.  I know the Taoiseach is committed to making that number larger and more significant in the forthcoming budget.</p> <p> Many of those with whom I speak think it is important that going to work be made a much more attractive option for people.  The Government has made significant progress to that end - for example, through the back to work schemes.  I do not think people who are going back to work should lose some of the benefits they enjoy at present.  I refer particularly to medical care benefits such as medical cards.  Such people should also be entitled to retain portions of their social welfare income.  While a rising tide will lift all boats, it is a fact that the lowest-paid workers comprise the most significant cohort of people whom we need to help and continue to help.  I acknowledge that there is absolutely no doubt that significantly increased resources are required to make the move from unemployment and long-term unemployment to going back to work.</p> <p> The shortage of housing means that unemployed people who want to go back to work are facing big difficulties in trying to find accommodation.  Regardless of whether one is unemployed, a significant increase in resources is needed to rent a house.  We have a difficulty in County Louth with housing assistance payments and rent allowance.  I refer to the Government's proposals.  The only accommodation that is available is at a much higher price than the going rate from the HSE or from local authorities will support.  I think this is an area in which we need to significantly increase our resources and indeed our attention.  Like other Members of the House, I know of families with children that are practically homeless.  I am being contacted by an increasing number of people who are sleeping in cars, on sofas or on camp-beds.  I believe that if the Government increases the cap, the whole system will shift upwards and prices will increase again.</p> <p> The proposed Low Pay Commission is a significant part of our strategy to get people back to work and to make work more valuable for lower-paid workers in particular.  It is part of a balancing and a readjustment.  It is terribly important that those who are employing people and offering employment are very much a part of all this.  There is no point in saying we are going to increase the minimum wage by a certain amount if employers are not on board.  They have difficulties as well.  They have to compete in the marketplace.  They have to be competitive.  Much of what we produce is sold abroad.  We have to compete abroad.  We cannot increase costs at a rate that is disproportionate to growth in the economy.  We priced ourselves out of the market previously.  Our competitiveness as an economy decreased significantly over the period of the boom.  We paid ourselves far too much and we saw the result of that.  Government expenditure increased out of all bounds.  It was absolutely ridiculous that we relied on a tax on the sale of houses as a basic income tax for our day-to-day spending.</p> <p> I agree with the constructive and positive analysis of the Minister of State, Deputy Nash.  It will bring about change.  It will bring additional resources to encourage people back to work.  The level at which people have the least amount of money is where this encouragement will be most effective.  When they are trying to get back into the workforce, it is a most difficult time for them.  I would like to see an increase in child allowances that would help families on law pay to survive in a much better work environment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, is doing the right thing.  I welcome that.  It is not the panacea to cure all ills.  I believe he is bringing the employers on board, which is absolutely essential.  There cannot be a gun to any employer's head as a result of this.  We will move forward together.  That is how this country will increase its capacity to sell its products abroad, while becoming a fairer and more competitive society at the same time.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, for his work on it.  Over the past four years, the Government has worked hard to steer this country through a very difficult economic crisis.  I believe we are finally seeing light at the end of that tunnel.  More than 100,000 new jobs have been created since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  In April of this year, the unemployment rate fell below 10%.  It has been said time and again that work should pay more than welfare and that no household with a person in full-time work should be poor.  I could not agree more.  I know the Government is continuing to commit itself to making work pay.  It is committed to protecting the most vulnerable workers and to addressing the issue of low pay.  In fact, one of the first actions it took when it came into office was to restore the minimum wage to &euro;8.65 after the previous Government had cut it to &euro;7.65.</p>  <p>  The Government's commitment to this issue is reflected in the decision to establish an independent Low Pay Commission with the important task of making an annual recommendation to the Government about what the appropriate level for the minimum wage should be.  The interim commission, which comprises a number of people, first met in February to examine existing data, commission new research if necessary, and consult directly with workers and employers to decide on what the national minimum wage should be.  In this context, it is important to look at the hourly living wage rate, which should provide employees with a level of income that is sufficient to allow an acceptable minimum standard of living.  As we all know, the current hourly living wage rate is &euro;11.45.  At a time when 100,000 workers are on the minimum wage, I am hopeful that the current rate will increase in the near future.  The Low Pay Commission will also take account of changes in earnings, productivity and overall competitiveness, and the likely impact that any adjustment will have on employment and employee levels.  It is important that job creation and competitiveness are taken into account during this process.</p>  <p>  It is important to refer to low-hour contracts in the context of this Bill.  This issue has received a great deal of attention recently following the Dunnes Stores strike.  We have been told that almost three quarters of Dunnes Stores employees are on part-time contracts.  These people are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours of paid work each week, yet they must be on call in case their employer wants them to work.  How can we expect people to live - to have a life outside work - if they cannot plan from one week to another?  Employers who engage in this behaviour must be taken to task.  I think legislation is needed in this area.  I was pleased to see that the University of Limerick has started work on a study of zero-hour and low-hour contracts in the Irish economy, with specific reference to how such contracts are affecting employees.  This study will cover the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, health and education sectors.  It will also assess how current employment rights legislation applies to employees on such contracts.  One of the key objectives of the study is to fill the gaps in the knowledge that is currently available about the impact of the use of contracts on employees.  This will enable the Government to consider any evidence-based policy recommendations that may be necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will advise the Government each year on any changes required to the national minimum wage.  Its first report is due in July.  I look forward to reading it.  This is a challenging area.  I thank the Minister of State for the work he has put into it.  We are moving forward with this Bill as a first step.  Members of my own family are in the minimum wage bracket.  Some of them are on contract hours.</p><p>They are not happy, and rightly so.  The Low Pay Commission is really the beginning of an improvement in everybody's life, particularly those on low earnings.  My father used to say we have to creep before we walk and walk before we run.  I am constantly reminded in this Chamber that some people do not think there is any process for getting from A to Z.  Many Deputies have described this Bill as a cosmetic process.  It is easy to criticise without having anything concrete to offer instead.  For 15 years during the height of the boom and employment, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government had people on the minimum wage.  Only when Fine Gael and the Labour Party came into government was the minimum wage cut reversed to &euro;8.65 from &euro;7.65 an hour.  We should keep on reminding people of that.</p> <p> Nobody likes not being able to plan his or her week and plan what he or she does around their earnings.  Unfortunately, in this country everybody has to do that, whether on the minimum wage or not.  People have to change their lifestyle and do other things.  I hope this commission will open up a new avenue for those who should be on more than &euro;8.65 an hour.</p></speech>

This commission will be tasked with examining the national minimum wage rate every July.  It will also be expected to make expert recommendations to Government on the minimum wage issue.</p>  <p>  The national minimum wage for a person over the age of 18 stands at &euro;8.65, one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union and it has once again become a major talking point in Irish politics.  As the Irish economy continues its strong export-led recovery, many unions and representative organisations and bodies have begun the process of lobbying for the national minimum wage rate to be increased by Government.</p>  <p>  While I agree with the argument that low-paid workers and the less well-off in Irish society need to be assisted and while I also cautiously agree with the argument that an increase in the minimum wage needs to be introduced, I believe the Government needs to be extremely careful about how it deals with this sensitive pay issue.  Many populist arguments are gaining ground which say that the Government should increase the national minimum wage in order to offset the effects of inflation and to give hard-pressed Irish people more money in their pockets.</p>  <p>  The Government, however, also needs to ensure that small businesses and vulnerable companies, such as those in the north west, are protected from the effects of any potential increases.  For example, raising the national minimum wage rate across the entire country may benefit a percentage of people in one particular area.  It may, however, ultimately have a detrimental effect on small businesses which are already struggling to survive in many other parts of the country and which would not be able to handle any further increases in their business costs.</p>  <p>  I recently met with a delegation from the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, from the north-west region to discuss a wide range of issues, including road infrastructure, broadband and barriers to growth and development.  The raising of the national minimum wage was a major concern for many of the business people I spoke with.  If there is to be an increase in the national minimum wage, it needs to be done in a fair manner, with due consideration given to all sections of society, in all geographical locations throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In line with this sentiment, I am pleased that section 4 of the proposed Bill states that any decisions on the minimum wage will be taken in a fair and sustainable manner by the Low Pay Commission members, and that these decisions will be taken without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.  I very much hope this will be the case.  I am pleased with the level of detail in section 5 of the Bill which lists the functions of the proposed commission.  It will be tasked with investigating a wide range of mitigating issues which surround the overall minimum wage debate, including whether employment is increasing or decreasing, comparisons with the UK minimum wage, the overall cost of living in the country, the levels of unemployment and employment, the need for job creation and overall national competitiveness.  Due to these two sections of the proposed legislation in particular, I have full confidence in this Bill as I believe that their inclusion will ensure that the new Low Pay Commission will act in a fair and proper manner to provide expert analysis on the minimum wage debate.</p>  <p>  I fully support this legislation as I believe that the new Low Pay Commission, if established, will provide expert analysis to the Minister, enabling him or her to make a fully informed decision on the topic, away from the populism which follows it.</p>  <p>  We, as legislators, need to continue to stand up for the less well-off in Irish society, but we need to do this in an informed and educated manner.  Too often in the past bad and uninformed Government decisions led to detrimental effects for many.  We need to take greater responsibility and I firmly believe that this commission will help to address one aspect of this approach.  It has taken a great deal of time and effort to bring this Bill to the House and I commend the Minister of State and his officials for the work they have put into getting it this far.</p></speech>

It is not good for the person, families or society.  We need solid action on low pay.  It is not good for economic growth or spending in the wider society.  When I hear the talk about the so-called recovery and the end of austerity, I ask why so many people are on low pay.  Why are so many families struggling to survive?  Why are so many living in poverty?  These are all very important questions for the Minister of State and need to be addressed.  I want to see a society built on social justice and equality and yet when I look around I see families struggling on low pay.  </p>  <p>  Only a few days ago a young family of five came to me, both parents work on low pay but they cannot get a mortgage.  They are paying a massive sum of money in rent and would love to own their home.  There is nothing wrong with the dream of having one's own home.  People in wealthier sections of society say we need to get into the mentality of renting a place as people do in other countries.  I do not buy that.  In the Irish case, most families would like to have their own home and are entitled to have that.  We need to stand by those people, listen to their concerns and help them get out of the situation they are in.  We need to deal with that by tackling the issue of low pay, as this legislation does.</p>  <p>  Currently, 138,000 children are living in poverty.  Consistent poverty increased recently from 6.8% to 11.7% but in some communities, it is higher.  Recently, 1,054 children were deemed homeless.  When we talk about low pay, we are also talking about real equality, including children's rights.  </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the establishment of a Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis, which I welcome.</p><p>While I frequently give out about the Government, I accept that the Minister of State is serious about this issue and has a genuine track record in this area.  </p> <p> The Low Pay Commission will be tasked with making annual recommendations to the Government about the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters.  The commission will comprise a chairperson and eight ordinary members, each of whom will be appointed by the Minister.  However, the Minister will not be bound by its recommendations.  </p> <p> Many Deputies have wrung their hands in the House about the closure of Clerys.  The Government must legislate for improved workers' rights and more effective employee information and consultation in line with the principles set out in Article 27 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Articles 21 and 29 of the European Social Charter.  This would not only benefit all employees, including former staff of Clerys, but also all citizens.  The Government has an opportunity to correct an injustice and pursue the long-term objective of building a better society and this important commission must be part of achieving this. </p> <p> Last week, I signed a new charter for enhanced rights for workers, which was drawn up by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The document has five main points covering pay, hours of work, representation rights, respect in the workplace and the right to earn a living income from full-time work.  A single adult would need to earn at least &euro;11.45 per hour to have a living income and ICTU has called for the introduction of this rate over the next three years.  The charter also calls for an end to certain work practices, including low and zero-hour contracts.  I signed the charter before the general election because its implementation would be good for workers, society and the economy.  This is an example of the "pound in the pocket syndrome" where an extra &euro;1 given to families, especially low-paid earners, will be spent in a way that will support the economy. </p> <p> I referred to the composition of the Low Pay Commission.  The commission's members should also include someone who is unemployed or on low pay.  Employer and employee interests will be represented by three members each, while two members will have particular knowledge and expertise in economics, labour market economics, statistics and employment law.  We must ensure the commission includes members who know what it is like to be unemployed or on low pay and have experienced the struggle for survival.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400041#OO00200"><p>I find it deeply ironic that the Government has set out to address the plight of low-paid workers in the months preceding the general election, having spent the past four years pushing this group of people into abject poverty.  One in six people is in low-paid employment and this figure grew rapidly during the recession.  European research shows that since 2007 the gap between the minimum wage and the median wage, that is, the point on the income scale where 50% of workers earn more and the remaining 50% earn less, has widened more in Ireland than in any other country in Europe.  While some will argue that I am repeating a slogan of the left, it is a fact that the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer.  All the statistics show this to be true.</p>  <p>  Declining disposable income results in lower consumption which further destabilises the economy, as economists will agree.  Research has consistently shown that workers spend more as a proportion of income than those who earn income from profit.  Half of workers in this State have little disposable income because fewer than 50% of employees earn &euro;25,000 or more while 30% of all workers earn less than &euro;20,000.  Every day, 135,000 children face material deprivation as their parents struggle with the tax burden imposed on them through the household charges, water charges and so forth.</p>  <p>  One of the previous speakers on the Government side stated that Ireland has one of the highest minimum wage rates in Europe.  While that may be the case, Ireland is also one of the most expensive countries in Europe.  Rents, grocery costs, medicine prices and doctors fees are all higher than the European average.  Furthermore, people have the universal social charge, the property tax and water charges heaped upon them.  If the Government is serious about increasing living standards, it must address these costs. </p>  <p>  There is a bigger picture at play here than the minimum wage.  It is crucial that the low pay commission examines the cost of living for low income workers, including the costs of rent, food, energy, transport, clothing and services.  I specifically request that the commission fully examine recent proposals on a living wage.  This is a sum that his higher than the minimum wage but below the level campaigners consider to be sufficient to make ends meet.  One in five workers currently earns less than the minimum wage.  I am disappointed by the narrow focus of the proposed low pay commission which will only investigate the minimum wage.  It is a stark omission which must be altered before the Bill is passed.  I will not vote in favour of the legislation unless a change is made in this area. </p>  <p>  Almost 125,000 workers are under-employed meaning they are part-time workers who are not working as many hours as they wish to work.  This figure, which is included in the latest quarterly national household survey, is one of the highest rates in the European Union.  Trade unions have stated that these contracts make a significant contribution to what is described as "in-work poverty".  It is beyond me that these types of contracts have not been included in the proposed study of vulnerable workers.  The Low Pay Commission will not do much for the types of workers I have described, many of whom are stuck in short-term contracts, particularly in the retail sector, pubs and restaurants.  A growing number of short-term contracts are being used in other sectors, with even the Government getting in on the act.  I learned this morning, for example, that 25% of newly qualified teachers are on the Government equivalent of a zero-hour contract.  Schools are interviewing for contracts of two and three hours' work per week and successful candidates must make themselves available from Monday to Friday in case additional hours become available.  This makes it impossible for parents to organise child care.  Employees on this type of contract do not have the security of knowing whether they will earn enough to cover their basic bills.  It is outrageous that these highly skilled individuals are being treated in this manner.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that a recent survey of zero-hour contracts carried out by a group of SIPTU members found that 89% of those aged under 35 years are struggling to make ends meet, while one in five respondents indicated that his or her employer gives less than one day's notice of working hours.  We are letting young people down in not urgently addressing this issue, on which I spoke a couple of weeks ago. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that a team from the University of Limerick has been appointed to examine zero and low-hour contracts and their impact on workers.  While we await the findings of that study, I ask the Government to task the Central Statistics Office with recording the incidence of low-hour contracts as part of the quarterly national household survey.  All of the conjecture about these contracts is painting an unfair and damaging picture of employers in the sectors in question, many of whom treat their staff well.  </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will go nowhere if it does not deal with the substantial number of workers who are on zero-hour contracts.  The figure appears to be increasing rather than decreasing.  If the commission does not examine this issue, the legislation will not improve the lot of workers.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400041#OO00300"><p>I will begin with a quotation from Franklin D. Roosevelt: "[N]o business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country."  These words were spoken many years ago about the United States but are, nevertheless, relevant to all countries and to this debate.</p><p>We cannot just talk about a minimum wage; we must also talk about a living wage.  What we are seeing are the ill effects of where the emphasis in Ireland was not on the latter.  What we have seen and are seeing is growing inequality in Ireland.  What contributed to that was the way in which the recession and austerity hit society disproportionately.  One statistic shows that 250 people hold a combined personal wealth of over &euro;75 billion here.  While the Nevin Economic Research Institute gave a relatively positive picture of recovery, it had serious concerns about the low paid; some 25% of employees, or 345,000 people in the labour force, who earn an hourly wage of less than the living wage threshold of &euro;11.45.  Of the low paid, 60% are women.  Everyone wants to see an increase in the number of those employed, but if people are going into employment that does not allow them to live in dignity, it distorts the unemployment and employment figures.  People must have a decent living wage; otherwise, we will continue to have the working poor.</p> <p> In the USA, there is a campaign, Fight for $15, which sets out to ensure that all those working in low-paid professions have the means to live adequately and support themselves and their families.  I acknowledge that there is a difficulty with the concept of enough to live and having a uniform level in that regard as it can vary depending on where one lives.  However, there is not that much divergence in this country albeit I accept that there is a divergence between Dublin and the rest of the country.  The report on OECD member countries includes concerns about the gaps between Ireland's minimum wage and the median wage, the figure where 50% of workers earn more and 50% earn less.  That has widened significantly since 2007 to a greater extent in Ireland than in any of the other countries on that OECD list.  I am looking at the functions provisions of the Bill and the section setting out to what matters the commission must have regard in making recommendations.  There is no specific mention of poverty and considering the effect of levels of poverty, particularly on children.</p> <p> There is a tug of war between trade unions and workers on the one hand and small and medium businesses on the other.  I have examples from Dublin Central of small businesses that have been crippled by commercial rates, forcing some to let a member or two of staff go.  If rates were more equitable and reflected the size of a business, whether it is a start-up or more established and where it comes in terms of the recession, there might be more give among small and medium enterprises on the side of a positive response to increasing the minimum wage.  Employers have been asking for leeway on PRSI and an amnesty in the first six months.  It is about a balancing act where the profits for business are concerned.</p> <p> The commission is going to examine unemployment and employment rates, but it must examine how much of the employment is fair, fruitful and progressive.  Many workers are on contracts that would have been unimaginable in pre-recession Ireland.  We have seen an increase in zero-hours contracts which are really zero-fairness contracts.  The commission must distinguish between casual and meaningful employment.  The minimum wage has implications for how a parent earning it can provide for his or her children.  We have seen the numbers of children in consistent poverty increase.  An April report from Focus Ireland states that 138,000 children in this country live in poverty.  The effect of the wage on children should be a matter considered by the commission.</p> <p> What can one say to someone who works 40 hours a week, just about pays the bills and has no disposable income to spend on other items or events which would have knock-on effects in society?  An obvious feature that emerged during the recession was where long-serving older employees were edged out of jobs - by foul means in many cases - in which they had given faithful service.  New staff were then brought in to work on lower wages and contracts with no mention of permanency.  I have sympathy for small and medium enterprises and their struggles to keep businesses going and to hold onto their employees, but larger employers, including the banks, large enterprises and multinationals, have been manipulating the labour market and taking advantage of the recession to introduce poorer working conditions.  In April, Social Justice Ireland published a paper on the nature of employment which showed that there were 15% fewer full-time jobs in Ireland in 2014 than in 2008 when the downturn began.  The paper stated that there had been a 14% rise in part-time jobs in 2014.  We have also seen an increase in the number of families applying for family income supplement.  These workers need State support to supplement low wages in order to live.  The report says that recovery is at the price of the exploitation of workers.  Clerys is just one example of shoddy, unfair and immoral treatment.  One does not sell a company overnight.  They knew this was going to happen and to give some 400 workers 30 minutes notice is absolutely disgraceful.  Businesses are there to make a profit, but that does not mean they have to trample all over workers' rights to increase and maximise that profit.  The Government bailed out the banks and it is time there was some redress for workers.  Business and morality can go together, but we are not seeing too many examples of that.</p> <p> While I welcome the annual recommendations, more than recommendations is needed.  There must be a timeframe and a mechanism for responding to those recommendations.

In its statement of priorities for the period 2014 to 2016, the Government gave a commitment to establish a low pay commission on a statutory basis as an independent body charged with making annual recommendations to the Government of the day on the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters.  I welcome the introduction of the Low Pay Commission as I strongly believe it will protect those working at the minimum wage rate and also give clarity to employers, particularly in SMEs which have been the backbone of the current economic recovery.  I am particularly pleased that both employers and employees will be represented on the commission.  The commission will have nine members, including an independent chairperson, three members with a particular interest in and understanding of low paid workers, three members with a particular interest in and understanding of employers and two members with relevant academic backgrounds.</p>  <p>  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be to investigate and report to the Minister of the day on an annual basis regarding the national minimum wage and the rate at which it should be applied.  The commission will also have other functions including examining matters related to the functions of the commission under the legislation.  I agree with the ESRI's 2006 analysis of a Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage.  The ESRI concluded that adjusting the minimum wage rate by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, as happened in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and employees.  The establishment of the commission should ensure that this situation does not arise in future.</p>  <p>  As a former employer and employee, I consider that work should always pay at a fair and reasonable rate.  There is no doubt that a job that pays a fair and reasonable wage is the most effective protection against poverty.  Time and again, I have seen in my clinics in Dundalk and surrounding areas the immediate impact securing full-time employment has on a person and his or her family.  We are now seeing the benefits of the many sacrifices the Irish people have made over the past number of years.  With the economy now starting to recover and grow, we must not forget that the recovery is not being felt in all areas of our society.  We must ensure therefore that the benefits of the economic recovery are felt by all sectors of society.</p>  <p>  I was surprised to learn that the national minimum wage in Ireland is high by international standards.  The most recent figures from EUROSTAT show that Ireland's minimum wage rate is the fifth highest in the EU.  When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland has the sixth highest rate among our European partners.  The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that 4.5% or fewer of all employees were being paid the national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in the third quarter of 2014.  That is approximately 71,000 workers earning the minimum wage.  It is our responsibility and duty to protect the low paid workers of this economy who are not getting the full benefits of the continued economic improvement.  Unfortunately, not all areas and sectors are seeing the benefits of recovery.  The Low Pay Commission will be of great benefit to the low paid workers of our economy and ensure that the balanced statutory minimum pay rate is fair and assists the low paid and vulnerable workers.  I particularly like the idea that the commission will have total independence, which will no doubt take the politics out of the setting a minimum wage rate.</p>  <p>  We must not forget the employers, especially the many SMEs and small family businesses that have been the backbone of this economic recovery.</p><p>This legislation will be of significant benefit to these employers and their employees and will offer clarity and certainty as we move forward.<br/><br/>I welcome the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  I look forward to its first report in the coming months and I am sure the many people who earn the minimum wage or less will also look forward hearing the recommendations of the commission's first report. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1021" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kenny" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400043#QQ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Ged Nash, on bringing it before the House.  The establishment of the Low Pay Commission was a key commitment in the statement of priorities agreed by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in July 2014 and it was launched at the end of February of this year.  It has the important remit of making recommendations to Government on the setting of the minimum wage and it will take an evidence-based approach in doing so.</p>  <p>  A national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  In April 2000, the then Government set a minimum rate of &pound;4.40 per hour for the minimum wage.  The current rate is &euro;8.65 per hour and it has remained at that rate since 2007 except for a period in 2011 when it was cut by the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  As soon as the current Government came to office, it reversed that cut in July 2011.  That restoration and the Low Pay Commission clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to tackling the whole question of low pay.</p>  <p>  Low pay is not only some abstract economic issue.  As with other economic issues, such as the question of banking debt, the minimum wage is a matter that is the subject of intense debate.  Supporters of a minimum wage, of which I am one, argue that it is necessary to ensure that workers are not forced to work for wages that are below the poverty line.  Opponents of it argue that it is an artificial Government imposed wage which increases unemployment as some employers cannot afford to pay the rates.  I have never known an opponent of the minimum wage who knew what it is like to work for low or minimum pay.  Arguments in favour of it focus mostly on the fact that employers should have a responsibility to ensure their workers are given a living wage.  This is something for which the Labour Party has campaigned.  On the other hand, opponents argue that in a global economy where economies and countries compete with each other, there is always the threat of moving production of goods overseas to where wages are lower and to where workers have fewer rights.  An recent example of this was the announcement in my constituency by Cadbury's in Coolock that it proposed to move production of its Time Out bar to Poland with the projected loss of 60 jobs.  This is known as the race to the bottom and such a race needs to be strongly opposed.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the commission plans to take an evidence-based approach to the task in hand.  This will involve examining existing data, commissioning new research, if necessary, and consulting directly with workers and employers in order to decide on what the new minimum wage should be.  The chairperson of the commission is Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and he is being supported by eight commissioners, namely, Vincent Jennings, Patricia King, Gerry Light, Caroline McEnery, Edel McGinley, Mary Mosse, Tom Noonan and Donal O'Neill.  </p>  <p>  Quite a range of issues will have to be examined before the commission makes its recommendations.  These issues include the changes in earnings since the minimum wage was last increased in 2011 and the rate of employment generally since then.  As well as that, the expected impact of a change to the minimum wage on employment, the cost of living and national competitiveness will have to considered and examined.  Changes in income distribution and currency exchange rates will have to be considered.</p>  <p>  The commission has been given a tight schedule.  By mid-July it must settle on an appropriate wage rate, and perhaps that is a good aspect as setting a deadline will bring the issue to a head quickly, and I hope it will avoid the whole matter being procrastinated over a long period.</p>  <p>  My view is that the Low Pay Commission represents the next step in the Government's prioritising work and fairness as the economy gradually improves.  Having a job is the best protection against poverty and fair wages and conditions are essential to achieving that.  I wish the Low Pay Commission well in its work and I commend this legislation to the House.</p></speech>

I may be incorrect but it is interesting that the first mention of a minimum wage in an Irish context within the labour-trade union movement dates back to 1924.  We have had to wait from the time of the men and women of 1924 until now for this legislation.  Those of us who are a long-standing members of the labour movement will take what we can get in terms of legislation.</p>  <p>  No legislation is perfect.  I listened to the critique of some of the speakers who spoke at the start of debate, not that I would give any great credit to their relationship with the labour or trade union movement.  I thought at one stage the Minister of State must have felt he was being attacked by a dead goldfish such was the nature of the critique.  It was utter opportunism and begrudging comments were made about legislation which I am prepared to acknowledge is not perfect but it is a start of something which low-paid working people can only welcome and it is up to us, as legislators, and up to the trade union movement to make it stronger.  That is the important point.  The fact that it exists and that we have had to wait 102 years for legislation that can protect the lowest paid in our society must be welcomed.</p>  <p>  There is a myth abroad that during what were popularly known as the Celtic tiger years when we went through a period of what some people describe as full employment, of which I am all in favour, that everyone working was on Celtic tiger wages, driving 4X4s and having 16 holidays a year.  That is the greatest load of nonsense in respect of everyone who participated during those years of so-called full employment.  Thousands upon thousands of people, particularly women, were on very poor wages and the reason for that is that legislation like this did not exist, which highlights the importance of this Bill.  The importance and significance of it should not, in any way, be undermined.  It is something we can improve on, which is the important point about it.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, or any legislation, which forms part of labour legislation to improve conditions, whether wages, working conditions or holiday entitlements - conditions that have improved during the period since Independence.  I have never heard anyone argue that all the labour legislation, whether the legislation on equal pay for women in the 1970s, the Redundancy Payments Act, the Holidays (Employees) Act or the Unfair Dismissals Acts, has not improved and protected workers.  I am not only referring to employers but some people, including some Members, give the impression that all this legislation somehow came through this roof at the generosity of the masters of industry and of the establishment in Ireland, but none of it did.  All of it was fought for, including in this House and in the trade union movement.  Every piece of labour legislation was fought for and, in this case, that fight continued for 102 years.  That is part of the importance of this Bill to working men and women.  I commend the Minister of State and repeat that it has been introduced within the timeframe he gave.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  Let us go forward to strengthen it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1190" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400044#RR00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill, which I strongly support.  I know the Low Pay Commission has been operational since February of this year, and I understand that the first report will be due in the very near future.</p><p>I welcome the legislation, which provides the constitutional and legislative bulwark for the national minimum wage, and amends the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  It remains to be seen how it will protect the lives of hundreds of thousands of low paid workers in coming years and decades.  Nearly 5% of all our workers, just over 73,000, are earning the national minimum wage of &euro;8.65.  This is, of course, the experienced adult rate; those who are starting out in employment or are in structured training are on reduced rates of about 70% to 90% of the national minimum wage.  The lower paid workers in our economy are typically those in the restaurant and hospitality sectors; those working as carers, particularly carers for seniors; cleaners; security workers; retail workers; and of course younger people.  Many of us in this House had experience of those professions when we were starting out in our careers or studying.</p><p>There is also a distinct gender bias, as Deputy Maloney said.  It has been noted by the National Women's Council of Ireland that this is a gender issue, as 60% of workers on low pay are women.  We know that 50% of women in Ireland are earning less than &euro;20,000.  Women, younger people, migrants and those working in lower-skilled jobs such as trainees and apprentices in areas such as hairdressing and clerical work - even in the public sector although less so there than in the private sector - are most affected by lower pay and zero-hour contracts. </p><p>I am aware that the Minister of State has had widespread consultations, and that employer organisations have argued that we have the fifth highest national minimum wage rate in the European Union.  This argument, of course, falls on its face because it totally ignores the higher living costs of our country.  Higher wage economies like ours come with very high costs of living.  We only have to think of energy costs, which the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, is doing nothing to address; mortgage and rental costs; extortionate child care costs; and transport costs.  Our public transport system is totally lacking compared to many other countries.</p><p>Over the last decades, but especially since the economic crash, the ideal of social Europe seems to have been buried by fiscal and economic neoliberal conservatism.  A feature of this new, harsh economic Europe is the steady fall in wages across many eurozone economies.  An article in the <i>Guardian</i>newspaper earlier this week discussed the failures of the eurozone and argued that, since the introduction of the single currency, wages across Europe have been driven down.  Workers, along with their wage rates and conditions, have been used as the mechanism to make economies &quot;more efficient&quot;, as our leaders in Frankfurt and Brussels would say.  Those workers have borne the brunt of this.</p><p>The heaviest loss has been to the German workforce.  In 14 years, German workers have seen hardly any wage rises.  According to the article, the higher skilled, higher paid jobs are disappearing out of Germany and going to the much lower paid states in eastern and south-eastern Europe.  Gerhard Bosch, a German expert on inequality, said that lower paid jobs and the numbers of the low-wage workforce are almost at US levels.  There is a neoliberal economic movement to try to transform the European economy into an American-type one, which is a totally different constitutional, economic and political set-up.  I do not think we should emulate it in Europe. </p><p>More recently, our focus has been on Greece.  This is the first opportunity I have had to discuss the matter.  I find the weasel words of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on the Greek crisis disgraceful and an affront to the Irish people.  We are naturally in solidarity with the Greek nation and recognise it as the home of European civilisation.  The Greek people are valiant and hard working, and they have been absolutely traumatised by vicious austerity for seven and a half years.  I hope that, tomorrow or Friday, the Government will be able to stand over some sort of a settlement which gives Greece reasonable prospects for the way ahead and does not bury them further under this crushing austerity.</p><p>The crisis and the phenomenon of austerity are not just limited to Greece.  As I said to the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, this morning, the housing and homeless crisis is the legacy of their term in government and is of Greek proportions.  Across Europe, we are seeing an increase in austerity and a concentration of low pay in many sectors.  The media, often controlled by wealthy individuals, as we have seen, have the relentless mantra of constantly cutting back on rewards for workers.  Their arguments often make no economic or political sense.</p><p>In Europe, the rich continue to grow their wealth while the poor and the ordinary are feeling the pinch the most.  While the banks got bailed out, Europe's ordinary citizens were sold out.  What happened to the social Europe of Jean Monnet and Jacques Delors, great visionaries in the foundation of Europe and in the Socialists and Democrats grouping in the European Parliament?  They were the founding fathers of Europe and of the euro and we are now looking at a landscape of ferocious pressure on workers and a downward spiral of wages.  In that context, I welcome the Bill.</p><p>Section 4 of the Bill outlines the duties of the Low Pay Commission, stating that it &quot;is designed to assist as many low paid workers as is reasonably practicable&quot; and that &quot;over time, [the national minimum hourly rate] is progressively increased&quot;.  I am aware of the contrast with the British system, which has applied incremental rate rises while we have had major stops and jumps.  I commend the Minister of State on seeking to address that.  A 2006 Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, study found that irregularly adjusting the minimum wage can have a detrimental impact on employment as it can create uncertainty for workers and indeed employers.  The study noted that smaller, incremental increases, which might follow from this legislation, were preferable.  I, therefore, welcome those provisions.</p><p>Why, though, has the Minister of State chosen to retain the power to accept or reject a recommendation by the commission as outlined in section 6?  I hope that the recommendation would always be positive.  Why did he decide to follow the UK's model of keeping the Low Pay Commission in an advisory role, as opposed to the German <i>Mindestlohnkommission</i>, minimum wage commission, founded in January, which has the same set-up as the Irish Low Pay Commission?  I note that the structure of our Low Pay Commission is similar to that of its counterparts in other large European economies. </p><p>I agree with the Minister of State that a consensus-based approach is usually best for recommendations on public policy.  However, a consensus may be difficult to reach with employers in sectors which are historically characterised by very low pay rates.  It can be particularly difficult when we already have statements from organisations such as the Small Firms Association criticising the functioning of the commission as well a likely recommendation to increase the minimum wage this year.  I completely disagree with the argument that increasing the minimum wage will automatically lead to those on higher pay scales demanding increases.</p><p>Schedule 2 of the Bill provides for the membership of the commission and seeks to strike a balance.  There are three members representing low-paid workers and three representing employers.  There are a further two experts with proven competence in economic research and statistical analysis.  I asked a parliamentary question on the recruitment process for the commission earlier in the year and the Minister of State gave me a reasonable answer.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, released a research paper entitled &quot;Cherishing all equally: economic inequality in Ireland&quot;, which highlighted growing inequalities in our country.  The research indicated that Ireland is currently the &quot;most unequal country in the EU [...] before taxes and social welfare payments are included&quot;.  This confirms the importance of progressive taxation and social protections such as this legislation.  As I have previously stated, the TASC report cogently notes: <blockquote>The two poles of economic inequality are the concentration of income and wealth on the one hand and the number of people unable to meet their material needs on the other.</blockquote></p><p> Various IMF studies have shown that reducing income inequality through redistributive methods does not hurt economic growth and actually helps it.  Indeed, at TASC's annual conference, which took place on Friday last in Croke Park, Professor &Ouml;zlem Onaran, a leading international economist based at the University of Greenwich, suggested that a pay rise generally across Europe would stimulate growth.  Professor Onaran argued that "wage moderation policies are counter-productive and lead to a stagnation of economic growth".  She went on to explain that her research, which included Ireland, showed that "a fall in wages leads to lower consumption because workers spend more as a proportion of their income compared to those who earn income from profit".</p> <p> The Pobal HP deprivation index involves studies of small areas of the Irish population and has been an ongoing process over the years.  To what extent will the Low Pay Commission address the disparities in costs for workers in different parts of the country?  The Minister of State and I are familiar with the urban costs, and the Minister of State also represents rural areas.  This is an important issue which I hope the commission will look at.</p> <p> Will the Low Pay Commission have a role in examining a living wage in further detail?  The T&aacute;naiste told me on a number of occasions in earlier debates that this was an idea of which she was very much in favour.  I have long been a supporter of the idea of introducing a national living wage, which was first advocated in the UK by a community coalition known as "London Citizens".  They began the campaign based on the principle of fairness and this has had a great impact on the adoption of a living wage in various areas of the UK, even to the point of agreeing a model for calculating the living wage, which is then reported each year.  In Ireland, the living wage has been calculated by ICTU to currently be &euro;11.45 per hour, significantly higher than the current national minimum wage.</p> <p> The UN Declaration of Human Rights in Article 25 and the UN International Covenant on Economic and Cultural Rights in Article 11 both highlight the right to an adequate standard of living, and a living wage is defined as one which "makes possible a minimum acceptable standard of living".  At the beginning of May, I asked a parliamentary question as to whether the Minister of State might consider introducing a living wage and continuing the tradition Deputy Maloney talked about earlier.  I was told the Minister of State had a deep interest in the living wage initiative and that he was going to hold a forum on the issue at some stage this year.  What was the outcome of that?  Was the forum held and what input might it have in the discussions on the minimum wage?</p> <p> Ms Nicola Sturgeon, the current and, we should say, great First Minister of Scotland, leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party and the other Taoiseach - as we know, there are two taoisigh in these islands - has been brave enough to ask businesses in Scotland to sign up to a nine-point Scottish business pledge whereby pay would be at least &pound;7.85 per hour, which is over &euro;11, instead of the current minimum wage of &pound;6.50.  The pledge is part of a campaign to promote fairness and economic growth.  NERI's paper from March 2014, A Living Wage for Ireland: Some Considerations and Initial Estimates, also concluded that "the implementation of a living wage offers significant potential to enhance the living standards of low income workers and their families".  This is something we could look at in the longer term as a core objective of social policy in this country.  While I agree this Bill is a step in the right direction, there is certainly more that could and should be done to help lower-income workers.</p> <p> Earlier this year, the Minister of State and 70 others voted against my High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill, which we lost by 71 votes to 26.  That Bill provided for the establishment of a high pay and wealth commission on a permanent basis in the Central Statistics Office.  The fact that I wanted to put it within the CSO was one of the Minister of State's main points of opposition to the Bill.  However, I only did that because the Bill would have involved expenditure and I could not have a charge on the Exchequer when bringing legislation before the House.  That commission was intended to carry out research on all levels of pay and wealth in the State and to inform public policy, which I believe is the way forward.</p> <p> Coming up to October and the general election campaign, we will all be trying to put forward the best possible plan for the Irish people for the next four or five years.  However, we sometimes do not know what we are talking about and we do not know the realities of the issues.  It has often been said that people in Norway or Sweden can simply telephone their revenue organisation or the equivalent of the CSO and find out what a Minister, a parliamentarian or anyone else in the country was paid last year.  This gives us an idea of how we could frame taxation policy most efficiently in this country.  The Low Pay Commission and low pay idea is only part of what we need to do.  We need to look at everything and we need to find out who is worth what.  For example, there were obscene levels of pay in the banking and financial services industry before the crash.  Pay of &euro;500,000 might be regarded as chicken feed and only a minor salary, and some people wanted &euro;3 million, &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million, and sometimes up to &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million, and that type of obscenity.  At the same time, the political representatives of such people are calling for harsh measures to contain costs and wages at the lower end for the vast bulk of workers.</p> <p> While the Bill before us today is creating a commission to look at the low income earners, my Bill was intended to take a top-down approach and to examine the levels of very high pay and wealth in the country and to look across the full parameters of the private sector and public sector, and then to inform public policy coming into the budgetary process.  While today is a very important step, and I commend the Minister of State on getting us to this point, I would hope that, in future, we would know what we are talking about in terms of remuneration, or, as the famous AJF O'Reilly used to say, compensation.  We should all know clearly what compensation we will get for doing our various tasks in the economy.  I support the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response and to receiving the commission's first report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400045#SS00200"><p>I thank Deputies Broughan and Calleary and all those who made what were largely constructive contributions.  I welcome the general expression of support voiced for the main objectives of the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  Setting up the statutory Low Pay Commission is, as I have said time and again, about taking much of the politics out of the setting of the minimum wage.  That reference I make is often confused and people sometimes interpret it in a deliberately disingenuous way.  I do not think the rate of the minimum wage should become a political football for anybody.  The Low Pay Commission is about trying to make sure there is institutional change for people who are experiencing low pay, who are some of the most vulnerable in our society.  When I talk about taking the politics out of the minimum wage, I mean that we would set up an institution that protects the interests of those who earn low pay because we cannot always assume we will have a Government in place that will do that.  What we do not want to encounter again, when the next recession comes, is a situation where the first people to get a kicking from the Government of the day will be those who are merely existing on the minium wage.  I believe this provides an important protection for people who earn low pay.  The Low Pay Commission can be a transformative institution.  It has enormous potential to protect and promote the interests of those who are on low pay and to create an equal and fairer society.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased with the high calibre of people whom I have appointed to the commission on an interim basis.  The commission was launched on 26 February and it has been operating on an interim basis for the past few months, as Deputy Broughan remarked.  The enactment of this Bill will underpin its first recommendation of a new rate for the national minimum wage and that recommendation will be made by the middle of July.  The establishment of the commission is a very important expression of my and the Government's commitment to the dignity at work agenda and it complements work I am undertaking in other areas around zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  I very much look forward to receiving the study from the University of Limerick, which will assist me in pointing a way forward in terms of dealing with that whole area.</p>  <p>  As I have said before and will say again, we are very aware of the need to balance fair pay with sustainable pay and sustainable job creation.  However, we will not preside over an economic recovery which involves a ruthless race to the bottom.  Neither will we sacrifice the economic and social gains and rights that have been hard won by, for example, the trade union movement since the foundation of the State, as referred to earlier by Deputy Maloney.</p><p> I make no apology for saying that.  As the economic recovery continues to accelerate and unemployment continues to fall, we expect to see the benefits being shared by way of better working conditions and improved pay, particularly for low-paid workers.  We are all winners when we move people out of poverty by providing decent jobs.  Industry cannot prosper if we do not have the resources available in our communities to support economic activity and ensure we have people who are willing to pay for goods and services.</p> <p> I want to see the minimum wage increased progressively when economic circumstances, the demands of job creation and social conditions and requirements converge.  I have said throughout the crisis that while other countries that have been subject to bailouts have hollowed out employment rights and ripped down the architecture of protections for people on low pay and those who are vulnerable, we are enhancing the architecture and framework of employment rights, which is crucial and reflective of a fair society.  I am very proud of the contribution that the Government and I are making to that, because it would have been easy to take an alternative position, as was the case in many other countries.</p> <p> We have demonstrated our commitment to the well-being of lower-paid workers.  One of the first things we did when we were elected to government was to restore the national minimum wage rate, which had been &euro;7.65, to &euro;8.65.  We also reintroduced the joint labour committee system.  We are introducing collective bargaining legislation and legislation to reintroduce registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders, and embarking on a process to tackle zero and low-hour contracts.  We also enacted the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act in 2012 to protect people who are working as temporary agency workers.  Having restored the economy to sustainable growth with transformational policies implemented through the twin-track approach of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, we are determined to make sure that the economic recovery is shared right across the country in every single region, by all families, all working people and those who are unfortunately in a situation in which they are depending on social welfare. </p> <p> It is also clear that we are committed to maintaining, enhancing and improving the employment rights architecture in this State.  I will not rehearse those arguments again, as I have done so many times in this House.  We are seeing the benefits of the ideas and imagination of the Government.  Unemployment is now less than 10%.  In the year to May 2015, the unemployment level fell by 40,500, or 16.2%.  Most of the increase was in full-time employment.  It is not just me saying that; the information comes from the Central Statistics Office and others.</p> <p> Deputy Murphy and others have argued that this is an economic recovery that is characterised by an over-dependence on activation measures, but the numbers and tax returns do not lie.  We know when we knock on doors in our constituencies and hold clinics that we can hear about what people are going through and the changes they have experienced over the past two years in particular.  Many people are migrating from part-time work, which was a feature of the recovery in 2012, into full-time positions, often within the same company, which is a very healthy sign. </p> <p> I refer to some issues raised by Members.  Many raised the issue of a living wage.  I have said inside and outside the Chamber that I will hold a living wage forum in the autumn, the first of its kind, to which we will invite civil society organisations, trade unions and, crucially, employers to discuss the concept of a living wage in Ireland and how it can be applied here.  I have examined closely the various campaigns and initiatives in the UK, where there was a very successful civil society campaign.  That is where the living wage concept draws its strength from - namely, the fact that it is a grassroots civil society campaign.  It has been really successful in the UK, with around 1,500 separate employers across the country having endorsed the approach.  It is a concept that I, along with the T&aacute;naiste and my Labour Party colleagues, support.  </p> <p> Deputy Calleary mentioned the need for commissioners to meet employers and employees across the country.  He is quite right.  Low pay commissioners have met those who are on low pay and those on the minimum wage, and employers who are actively engaged in economic sectors that are associated with low pay.  This happened a number of weeks ago in Galway as well as elsewhere.  It is really important that those on the Low Pay Commission get a grasp of the real experience of those who are dependent on the minimum wage and those who operate companies in such sectors.  </p> <p> I give credit to Deputy Calleary for ensuring that he and his party made a detailed submission to the Low Pay Commission encompassing their views on the national minimum wage.  I find it very difficult to accept arguments put forward by the likes of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and some of his Sinn F&eacute;in and populist left-wing colleagues in the House on the national minimum wage when Sinn F&eacute;in made no submission whatsoever to the Low Pay Commission on the national minimum wage.  That brings great shame on the party.  How can we take seriously its so-called commitment to those on low pay if it does not see fit to make a submission to a new institution created by the State that seeks to protect the interests of people on low pay?  Unfortunately, Sinn F&eacute;in's interest in low pay does not extend to making a submission to the actual institution that will make a recommendation to me over the next few weeks.  Fianna F&aacute;il made a submission, which is to its credit, as have the Green Party and the Young Greens, but no other Deputy made one to the Low Pay Commission on what the national minimum wage should be.  I take some of the contributions from those in the populist left and Sinn F&eacute;in with a large pinch of salt. </p> <p> Deputy Calleary mentioned the need to name and shame employers which do not pay the national minimum wage and have been convicted in this regard.  Since 2012, NERA has published the names of such employers, and it is its intention to do the same in its annual report for 2014, which has yet to be published.  I encourage it to do so.  He referred to the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act, and I will ensure that a detailed briefing is available to Opposition Members to ensure they are fully briefed.  That is only right and fair and will contribute to a debate in the House. </p> <p> Deputy Calleary will be pleasantly surprised when he sees the extent and range of the actions that will be set out in the regional action plans for jobs.  They are very detailed and I do not think representatives of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, local chambers of commerce, local enterprise offices and people in private industry would dismiss the various stakeholder forums we have undertaken over the past few months on the execution process of the Action Plan for Jobs.  I do not think they will be dismissed as PR stunts.  It has been a very significant exercise and I hope the Deputy is pleasantly surprised at the details, vision and ambition that will be contained in our job creation strategies for the regions.  It is a critical project and I share his interest in ensuring that job creation is extended across this country.  </p> <p> The figures we have seen for the past 18 months in particular will show that areas such as the Border region and the south east, which have suffered considerably, are on their way back and job creation has been accelerated.  In his absence, I would like to thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for referring to the Resolution Foundation in the UK.  I have followed its work for quite a number of years and met its representatives privately in recent months to discuss some of its report.  I remain in very close contact with them.  It is a very interesting organisation with a very interesting perspective.  I wonder how interested the Deputy is in the research it carried out on low pay and economic activity or inactivity in Northern Ireland.  I have read its figures and those from other sources in the UK that point to the fact that, unfortunately, the North is an area that is majority welfare-dependent, has a large amount of economic inactivity and is an economy built on a foundation of low-paid jobs.</p><p> The Northern Ireland Administration has come in for some criticism in recent times about the budget it is preparing to ram through the Stormont assembly.  We have seen all sorts of shapes being thrown by Sinn F&eacute;in, which I do not take that seriously, about its concerns about the budget in that particular jurisdiction.  It is in the process of sacking 20,000 civil and public servants there, the equivalent of letting go about 80,000 civil and public servants in the South.  Sheila Nunan, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, has said that what is proposed in the Northern Ireland budget will copperfasten it as a low-pay economy.  We are all aware of the difficulties experienced in Northern Ireland around low pay, labour market and economic inactivity and high degrees of welfare dependency.  Sinn F&eacute;in, however, has done diddly squat in Northern Ireland.  I take its advice with a large pinch of salt.  The pious platitudes that its Members offer here in this House will not put bread on the table in the North.  I would urge them to get their own house in order before they start lecturing me or anybody else on the issue of low pay because their record is absolutely appalling.</p> <p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n was deliberately disingenuous about the references that I have often made about taking the politics out of low pay.  I will not rehearse the arguments again.  This legislation is about trying to protect people on low pay.  We do not know what kind of complexion future Governments will have.  Will they target people on low pay?  The Low Pay Commission is about ensuring we protect the interests of people on low pay and make evidence-based policy decisions to support people to move their situation on, improve their pay and general prospects.  No one in this House would reject that.  No one in this House is more passionate than I am about ensuring people&rsquo;s prospects are improved and people can access decent, good sustainable jobs to provide for themselves and their families.  I will not take lectures from Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody else on that front.</p> <p> When Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n compares our regime to those in other jurisdictions, what he always deliberately fails to acknowledge is the range of other measures and institutional reforms we have introduced around the re-establishment of joint labour committees, registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and so on.  These make a real difference to people working in often vulnerable sectors of society.  I challenge those who are concerned about low pay and employment standards to examine and judge the Government on the suite of measures it is seeking to introduce around collective bargaining, registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and its efforts to tackle zero-hour and low-hour contracts.</p> <p> Deputy Wallace was selective in the references he made on the criteria laid down in the legislation that the Low Pay Commission will consider when it is making recommendations on the national minimum wage.  He failed to acknowledge that, for the first time ever, primary legislation will be in place with the ambition to progressively increase the rate of the national minimum wage, albeit when the social and economic circumstances converge.  It is a positive aspiration and ambition to nail that down in primary legislation.</p> <p> Deputy Pringle referred to the appointment process to the Low Pay Commission.  I am satisfied its membership has the right balance with people with strong expertise, experience and track records in their own areas.  They can bring much to the commission.</p> <p> I welcome Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point that some Members on the Opposition benches make it out as if the Low Pay Commission was setting about attacking the interests of low-paid workers, not supporting or promoting their interests.  Some of the contributions made were entirely cynical and opportunistic.  They came from Members who have never achieved a single thing on behalf of people dependent on low pay or who want decent sustainable jobs.  We hear much rhetoric and cant but absolutely no contribution whatsoever in improving the lot of low-paid workers.  This can be a transformative body of legislation for people on low pay.  The ambitions, aspirations and the objectives of this legislation are endless and will evolve over time.  We should all acknowledge that it is a good start and strong institutional reform for those on low pay.</p> <p> I reassure Deputy McLoughlin about the concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, may have around increases in the national minimum wage.  We are taking a very balanced approach to reviewing the wage on an annual basis, as will be required under this legislation.  Some extreme elements in the business community do not believe in the principle of a national minimum wage, however.  The majority in this House would reject such a view.  A balanced and robust set of mechanisms are reflected in this legislation which will ensure the commission&rsquo;s recommendations are made in an evidence-based way.</p> <p> Deputy Broughan welcomed the legislation and the principles it reflects.  He asked why it was decided not to give all responsibility for setting the minimum wage rate to the commission.  It is crucial that the democratically elected Oireachtas and the Executive have the opportunity to accept or reject a report from the Low Pay Commission, albeit one established on a statutory basis with the important function to make a recommendation every year on the national minimum wage.  It is important constitutionally that this House retains that right.  In some ways, he answered his question when he commented on how difficult it might be for the commission to reach consensus on a recommendation.  Under this legislation, the Government will retain the right to set a rate in the absence of recommendation being forthcoming from the commission.</p> <p> This is well-balanced legislation and its provisions have been given a significant degree of consideration.  I ask that all Members support the Bill, its principles and what it is trying to achieve.  We will be able to tease out in more detail some of the propositions made today on Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400048#VV00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014 on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Criminal Justice Mutual Assistance Act 2008.  That Act already gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework on the provision of mutual legal assistance.  The Bill is necessary to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act.</p><p>I will set out what mutual legal assistance means in practice.  In simple terms it enables one state to provide in its own jurisdiction a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter.  The type of assistance may concern such matters as the investigation of serious international crime, including the gathering of evidence for use abroad or the service of documents issued by a judicial authority.  It may also involve freezing or confiscation of proceeds of crime which have been trafficked across international borders.</p><p>I will now go through the six international agreements to which the Bill gives effect.  Council Framework Decision 2005 on mutual recognition of financial penalties establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a financial penalty order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state.  This agreement will allow fines imposed by courts in one member state to be collected in another member state where the person concerned resides or is a citizen.  The agreement applies to fines imposed which exceed &euro;70 in respect of any criminal matters, including road traffic offences.  It would apply to any fine imposed which is appealable to a criminal court.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 26 November 2003.</p><p>Council Framework Decision 2006 on mutual recognition of confiscation orders establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state.  These confiscation orders are used primarily to recover proceeds of crime which have been trafficked from one state to another.  They can be used to recover stolen objects or to seize financial criminal assets.  We already provide for this type of mutual assistance under a number of existing international instruments such as the 1959 Council of Europe Convention.  Ireland receives approximately five or six such requests each year.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 2 June 2004.</p><p>Council Decision 2008 on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations aims to improve co-operation between member states' special intervention units in man-made crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat, such as terrorist incidents.  It should be noted that the framework decision would only become relevant in the event of a very serious terrorist or similar incident.  The situation envisaged would involve a large-scale crisis where a single member state may not have the means, resources or expertise to deal with the crisis.  Assistance could take the form of the provision of equipment or expertise or direct assistance on the territory of the requesting member state.  Any visiting specialist units would operate under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting member state.  In addition, they would only be able to operate within the limits of their own national powers.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 4 June 2008.</p><p>Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 refers to the strengthening of Eurojust, an EU agency based in The Hague dealing with judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  This Council decision amends the earlier Council Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust, and provides for increased co-operation of Eurojust with other agencies such as OLAF or Europol, and strengthens its operational capabilities.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 26 November 2008.</p><p>Council Framework Decision 2009 of 26 February 2009 enhancing the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial seeks to ensure adherence to principles of natural justice in cases where judgments <i>in absentia</i>arise in regard to requests for mutual legal assistance.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Framework Decision on 10 December 2008.</p><p>Council Decision 2010 on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters provides for mutual legal assistance between EU member states and Japan, based on the laws of the requested state.  Implementation by Ireland will be based on existing provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 25 November 2009.</p><p>These international agreements have all been approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas prior to signature by Ireland.  For ease of reference, the text of each of these international agreements is being added to the Schedules to the 2008 Act by this Bill.  In addition to making the necessary legal provision for these international agreements, the Bill makes a number of minor corrections to existing legislation.  The legislation being amended includes the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1998, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.</p><p>I will now turn to the Bill and explain briefly the elements in the Bill.  Sections 1 to 6 of the Bill amend the 2008 Act to provide for the definition of additional EU instruments and related terms required in the Bill.  Sections 7 to 23 amend the 2008 Act to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA.  These sections are probably the most technical part of the Bill and it will be helpful to Deputies if I elaborate a<i></i>little on the need for these sections and the effect they will have on the legislation.</p><p>The instrument establishes new rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state.  Under the existing provisions of the 2008 Act, all external confiscation orders must be translated by an Irish court into a domestic confiscation co-operation order.  However, under the provisions of this framework decision, courts will in future recognise confiscation orders from member states without the necessity to issue a domestic confiscation co-operation order.  This means that effectively we are required to operate two different regimes for dealing with confiscation orders received from other states.  Those received from EU states do not require a domestic confiscation co-operation order.  Those received from non-EU states will continue to require a domestic co-operation order issued by an Irish court.</p><p>The next element of the Bill, in section 24, is a new element in mutual assistance legislation to give effect to the Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on mutual recognition of financial penalties.  When this part of the Bill is enacted and commenced, the effect will be that fines greater than &euro;70 which are imposed in the State can be collected by another member state if the person concerned is a resident or citizen of that other EU state.  Furthermore, penalties imposed in other EU states on persons who are residents or citizens of this State will be collected in this State.  The provisions of the Fines (Payment and Recoveries) Act 2014 will apply to such fines.</p><p>A number of sections make minor technical amendments to the wording of the 2008 Act.  Sections 31 and 35<i></i>of the Bill give effect to the 2008 Council Decision on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations.  Deputies will see from the Council Decision text that the type of crisis situations envisaged are situations like major international terrorist incidents which are of a scale which might require a member state to seek assistance from other member states.  It should be recognised at the outset that it is considered fairly unlikely that Ireland would experience a crisis situation of the scale that would require this type of assistance.  Certainly, an incident of this type and scale has not happened to date in Ireland or in any other EU member state, but in the event that such a major international incident did occur here we would be able to request appropriate assistance from other member states.  Deputies will note the express agreement of Government will be required if as a result of the commission of a criminal offence a crisis situation exists and it is in the public interest to seek the assistance of a special intervention unit from another state.</p><p>The next element in the Bill I will mention is required to give effect to Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 on the strengthening of Eurojust. <i></i>Section 32 of the Bill provides that the Minister may designate a Eurojust national member who may transmit and receive information in accordance with Council Decision 2009/426 JHA.</p><p>I thank the Deputies for their interest in this legislation.  I am sure it will receive much support in this House.  The legislation will assist in enhancing existing mutual assistance provisions and provide for wider and more efficient co-operation in fighting transnational crime.  The increased mutual assistance powers provided here will be of use in detecting and prosecuting criminals.  It is in my view essential legislation in a world where crime is international and does not respect borders.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400048#VV00300"><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the Bill which will implement six EU Council decisions agreed during the period from 2005 to 2010.</p><p>These Council decisions allow for mutual assistance and recognition of legal actions arising from other member states in the Irish courts system.  Effective co-operation between member states of the European Union and between states worldwide is of increased importance in the area of criminal justice.  Organised criminal groups exploit modern phenomena such as globalisation, an increasingly border-free world and rapid technological advances in computers and communications.  Organised criminals have become increasingly sophisticated and regularly use international networks to carry out their activities.  Faced with this reality, organised crime can no longer be effectively tackled on a national level, and we welcome the fact that this legislation seeks to address these matters.<br/><br/>It has been stated that the opening of borders across the EU, in particular, after the Cold War, led to a rise in transnational criminal activity across Europe.  Human trafficking, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and terrorism are all crimes that now operate beyond national boundaries, and it is not in the gift of any single jurisdiction or police force to tackle successfully these crimes.  The first EU-level response to the issue of transnational crime in a substantive way occurred in the Maastricht treaty, creating the justice and home affairs policy at an EU level.  Recognising the sensitivities and differences across Europe's criminal justice systems across our many jurisdictions, this policy was placed under the remit of the European Council.  This designated asylum policy and immigration, as well as judicial, customs and police co-operation, as &quot;areas of common interest&quot;.  As we are all aware, the Treaty of Amsterdam went further, giving EU institutions full control over some areas of justice and home affairs policy, such as asylum and immigration.<br/><br/>The Treaty of Amsterdam also brought the Schengen Convention into EU law, which has served as an impetus for further co-operation on justice and home affairs matters.  The Tampere European Council of 1999 established supranational bodies such as the European Judicial Network, EJN, and Eurojust to help tackle cross-border crime.  In December 2001, EU leaders agreed to create a European arrest warrant and in 2006, a European evidence warrant was also approved.  The Lisbon treaty of 2007 extended the EU power on justice and home affairs issues further because it gave the European Court of Justice jurisdiction over the sector for the first time and renamed the policy area &quot;justice, freedom and security&quot;.  As a continent, we have come a long way from the early days of co-operation in the justice field.  This must be welcomed, given the increasingly globalised world in which we live.<br/><br/>Current legislation surrounding mutual assistance at an EU level is to be found in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008. It was stated during the Second Stage debate of that legislation in the D&aacute;il:<blockquote>Mutual legal assistance, in simple terms, enables one state to provide, within its jurisdiction, a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter. The type of assistance may concern such matters as the investigation of serious international crime, including the gathering of evidence for use abroad or the service of documents issued by a judicial authority.</blockquote>Due to the passing into law of that Bill at that time, any country may make a request to Ireland for legal assistance in criminal investigations or criminal proceedings.  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 includes provisions that allow Ireland to take evidence in connection with criminal investigations or proceedings in another country; search for and seize material on behalf of another country; provide mutual assistance in relation to revenue offences; serve a summons or any other court process on a person in Ireland to appear as a defendant or as a witness in another country; serve a document recording a court decision on a person in Ireland; enforce, in Ireland, confiscation and forfeiture orders made in another country; and transfer a person imprisoned in Ireland to another country to give evidence in criminal proceedings there, to be identified there or to assist proceedings there.  These are important provisions granted to our justice system and to the justice systems across the Union and beyond in order to combat transnational crime.<br/><br/>The European Union is a zone of free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Along with those freedoms come responsibilities.  There is a responsibility on member states and the Union as a whole to ensure that with the opening of borders, transnational agreements can be put in place to allow for the increased opportunities that are gained through open borders but also to deal with the challenges that inevitably arise.  I understand from previous information provided to this House that in 2013 Ireland made 200 requests for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.  Of these, 129 were transmitted to other member states of the EU and 71 were transmitted to other countries.  In the same year, Ireland received 583 requests for assistance, of which 516<i></i>were received from within the EU and 67 were received from outside the EU.  This is a significant number and demonstrates the importance of this legislation in certain cases.<br/><br/>We believe this legislation builds on the existing legislative framework for mutual legal assistance and seeks to address the challenges brought about by the EU's Internal Market.  It provides for the effective co-operation between member states of the European Union and between states worldwide.  We welcome the fact that the Bill will finally give effect to Council decision 2006/783/JHA of 6 October 2006, on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders; Council framework decision 2005/214/JHA of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties; Council decision 2008/617/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the improvement of co-operation between special intervention units of the member states of the European Union in crisis situations; Council decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 on the strengthening of Eurojust and amending decision 2002/187/JHA, setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime; Council decision 2010/616/EU of 7 October 2010 on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters; and a Council decision to enhance the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial.<br/><br/>By harmonising the recognition of decisions made by courts across the EU within a common legal framework, member states will be better equipped to tackle cross-border crime within the Union.  We believe that domestic legislation creating this mutual recognition is preferable to EU-level laws with direct effect.  This is particularly important due to the significant variants through member states' criminal justice systems, yet this framework recognises that EU criminals do not have regard for member states borders and see them as a means to escape or delay detection.<br/><br/>As organised crime and terrorism become more sophisticated, it is essential that every technique and support is given to police across the Union to enable them to apprehend and bring to justice those responsible.  In the modern world, our justice systems are dealing with extraordinarily sophisticated communications, financial networks and ease of transport from one jurisdiction to another.  If crime is becoming globalised, our systems must also globalise the means of fighting it.  However, it is important the resources are provided to the courts and the Garda to implement this Bill.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party's first priority in justice is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary membership and technology to provide a first-class police service.  As such, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to increasing the Garda numbers to 14,000 and maintaining them at this level, as this is the optimum level of garda&iacute; required to ensure our communities can live in safety and security across Ireland.<br/><br/>If we consider the Government's record in this area, there is a lot left to be desired.  Garda numbers are down by approximately 1,500 in four years; 139 Garda stations have been closed by Fine Gael and Labour in government; and our main prisons are overcrowded, with the Fine Gael revolving door having returned.  On 15 June 2015, there were 489 prisoners, or 11% of the total, on temporary release across the prison system.  Thousands of court summons and bench warrants remain outstanding, undermining our criminal justice system, and we have had a record number of inquiries to investigate malpractice in justice; with one resulting in the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.</p><p> While we accept that the current Minister is seeking to clean up the mess left by the previous one, we are still waiting for the independent review mechanism to give details of its conclusions and we are still awaiting the establishment of a fully functioning independent Garda authority.  We also have yet to see a Secretary General appointed to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that these areas need to find a conclusion sooner rather than later.  In any case, my party and I are happy to support this Bill.  It is our hope that this legislation will go some way towards enabling the State to globalise our fight against crime through co-operation with other EU member states and beyond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-06-24a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015062400050#XX00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  First, like Deputies on all sides of the House, I understand the growing international aspect of crime.  It is obvious that crime does not confine itself behind borders.  As legislators, it is our job to be aware of such dynamics and play our part in making sure that such crime is combatted so that our communities are safe.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill's passage to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  International mutual assistance is an important part of tackling the growth in cross-border crime.  We must be able to rely on other states to help us ensure that criminals are brought to justice.  The same is true in reverse.  Other member states must be able to seek our help, where possible, to achieve justice.  However, we must be mindful of how such information is passed on and how the practical application of mutual assistance in such matters is balanced with the human rights of citizens.</p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to amend the Act of 2008 to provide for the enactment of outstanding instruments that the Oireachtas has previously ratified.  This amending Bill, as the Minister has already pointed out, has many technical aspects.  There is no need for a debate on these technical aspects; rather, it is important to focus on the broader principles of law that the Bill seeks to amend and the implications of such amendments for citizens.  In this regard, it is appropriate to outline Sinn F&eacute;in's view on international justice co-operation.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports, in principle, inter-jurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension.  We want to see a scenario in which such co-operation is authorised on a case-by-case basis, limited to the necessary, and with appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place.  Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports effective action against cross-border organised criminal activity, such as the trafficking of human beings and drugs, evasion of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of fuel and tobacco, and offences involving the trafficking of children.  However, we believe it is equally essential to safeguard against the creation of further victims through human rights violations.  Judicial and legal harmonisation, such as the mutual assistance aspects of this Bill, must only be to the extent that it advances human rights standards.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the people of Ireland should have full sovereignty over justice matters.  The Irish people alone have the right to determine policy questions and set the law regarding the administration of justice in Ireland.  Although we recognise the merit of this particular Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in does not support the development of an EU super-state architecture in respect of justice matters. We do not support the creation of a so-called European legal area with a European criminal code and a European public prosecutor.  Sovereignty over justice matters must remain firmly in the hands of the people of the EU member states.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in rejects the federalist trend towards incremental integration and the centralisation of policing and judicial powers, ending in the eventual establishment of an EU border guard, EU police and an EU public prosecutor.  We believe these are matters for sovereign states.  We also reject the accelerating impetus to harmonise criminal law between EU member states, because it is being done without first ensuring the harmonisation of rights protections, which currently vary widely from state to state.  These are issues that must be debated seriously on Committee Stage.  Although the implications of this Bill may be small in the grand scheme of things, it is the grand scheme of things that we need to focus on.  We cannot lose sight of where instruments such as those contained in this Bill are leading us.</p>  <p>  In turning to the specific provisions contained in this Bill, I note the Minister's comments during the debate in the Seanad.  In explaining the term "mutual assistance", the Minister stated that this enabled "a state to provide, within its own jurisdiction, a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter".  There is no doubt that co-operation of this kind is necessary, but there are a few observations that I would appreciate clarification on.  Perhaps this could be done on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  First, the new procedures relating to confiscation orders under section 7 to section 23 would mean the creation of a third way by which confiscation orders could be dealt with.  We already have a system whereby a domestic confiscation can be granted or an international confiscation order can be transposed and a domestic co-operation order issued.  Under this new Bill, the way in which an international confiscation order is dealt with will now be split in two.  Provision will be made to deal with EU member state confiscation orders, and there will be a separate way of dealing with non-member-state confiscation orders.  It does not appear that this Bill makes the system any more efficient or any clearer.  In fact, it appears to create more bureaucracy.  Why is this third method of dealing with confiscation orders necessary?  What does this measure achieve that cannot be achieved through the processes currently in place?</p>  <p>  I also have a number of queries on the recovery of fines from other member states on which I would like the Minister to comment.  I understand the need for fines to be collected on a cross-border basis, and indeed I support this.  However, this is one of the areas of the Bill that may have human rights implications.  How does the Minister envisage the appeal process working for an Irish citizen who has been fined abroad and wishes to challenge the fine?</p>  <p>  I will briefly mention another concern regarding data protection issues.  Any data collected under the legislation should have to comply with our standards in this State and not those of any other member state.  It goes back to the principle that sovereignty on justice issues must lie with the Irish people themselves.  We do not want to see a situation whereby data shared in good faith, when it leaves the hands of another member state, is no longer under the standard under which it left Ireland.  We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area.  As a party, we call not only for international co-operation on matters such as this, but also for a strong all-Ireland and all-island policing policy for these matters.</p>  <p>  The amendments being put forward in this Bill raise the same issues that were raised in 2008, particularly regarding human rights.  The Irish Commission on Human Rights raised the issue of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in its submissions on the scheme of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Bill, and I believe the same issues apply to this Bill.   In respect of the passing of data between member states relating to a person's alleged involvement in crime, we must always be mindful of how a balance is struck with a person's human rights under Article 8.  We know from European case law that the storing of data relating to the private life of an individual in a register and the release of such information falls within the application of Article 8(1) of the ECHR.  Therefore, in order for disclosure through mutual assistance to be considered necessary in a democratic society, the disclosure of such data must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  In most criminal cases, I accept that this will be the case.  However, there have been a number of cases in the past in which this was not the case, and a person's good name has been tarnished where that person was not guilty in the first instance.  This is something of which we must be mindful.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the need to tackle cross-border crime, and for that reason we will support this Bill on Second Stage.  I have outlined the concerns we have.  We must always ensure that the provisions we adopt are fully compliant with human rights, and for that reason I look forward to the Minister's response to the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

I do not see him.  We will use up the time anyway.</p>  <p> I do not have anything against the Minister of State, but I miss the Minister.  Having said to some journalists recently that I would love to be the Minister, I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is not too worried.  In case the programme does not add the proviso I included, I did say that under no circumstances would I be part of any neoliberal grouping.  That rules out the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties and, judging by the past four and a half years, the Labour Party.  It is probably unlikely that I will ever be the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I would add that I would just love to be the manager of the Italian national football team but it is also probably unlikely to happen.</p><p>On the issue of the Bill and terrorism, I will start with an interesting statistic.  The US State Department reported that only 17 US citizens were killed worldwide as a result of terrorism in 2011.  That figure includes deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq and all other theatres of war.  In contrast, in 2013 there were 33,636 gun-related deaths in America.  We should try to keep matters in perspective.</p><p>The Act we seek to amend today, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, was introduced in a pre-Snowden environment, well before the revelations of the true extent of state surveillance on citizens and the chilling effect this is having on individual rights and freedoms.  Instead of further militarising our response to the perceived threat of crime through increasing the powers of State security forces and deepening our police co-operation with other highly securitised states in the EU, the focus should be on restoring the right to privacy of citizens.</p><p>Today's Bill allows for the creation of special intervention units for the purpose of providing assistance in the control of a crisis situation.  The idea of pumping resources into the creation of these special intervention units does not make sense when there are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently on incomes just above the minimum wage.  On top of that, many new recruits are living in poverty due to high rents, low wages and cuts to their rent allowance.  Instead of creating some unnecessary Navy Seal-type terror-busting force, we should be trying to restore pay and morale in the existing force.</p><p>This legislation is another example of states capitalising on an atmosphere of fear in order to introduce anti-terror initiatives which will give security agencies greater access to personal data and greater powers of retention.  Tragic events around the world are being used as an excuse for legally extending the powers and remit of many states' security apparatuses, badly prioritising a type of dystopian national security over the individual's rights to freedom and privacy.  The horrific attack on the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>office was used as justification for a new draconian surveillance Bill in France whereby the authorities can legally spy on the digital and mobile phone communications of anyone linked to a terrorist inquiry without prior authorisation from a judge.</p><p>In the case of Ireland, in December last year the ministerial order, SI 541 of 2014, was quietly passed, commencing Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, which is the Act today's Bill seeks to amend.  This section of the legislation allows for the interception of Irish communications by the authorities of other EU member states for the prevention or investigation of a criminal offence.  Under the legislation, companies that object to an intercept order could be brought before a secret court.  Interestingly, the commencement of Part 3 coincided with the revelations of underwater tapping of Irish telecommunications cables by United Kingdom's GCHQ, an action which, according to the Minister for Justice and Equality, if it even happened at all, was a matter for the United Kingdom jurisdiction, in other words, out of our hands.</p><p>In response to my recent parliamentary questions on the tapping of underwater cables, the Minister for Justice and Equality stated: &quot;The majority of citizens would accept that there should be a balance between personal privacy and public safety once the mechanisms by which such data is accessed is both legal and proportionate.&quot;  I agree that there needs to be a balance between personal privacy and public safety, but it is essential that all legislation we bring in upholds the best interests of the citizen.  The danger is that the terms &quot;public interest&quot; or &quot;national security&quot; will be trotted out as a mark of it being proportionate.  Although it may be legal, is it proportionate that garda&iacute; can break in to one's home, install a recording device and leave it there for three months, or that Revenue can bug one's vehicle and track one's movements for four months?  Undoubtedly, terrorists spread fear.  It is their stated intention.  However, it is the State that allows this fear to fester and the State which takes advantage of it.  This fear is what allows section 13 of the 2008 Act to place an individual's personal data entirely in the hands of the State to keep or share, as it pleases.</p><p>In 2002, the European Council framework decision on combating terrorism laid out what we should regard as terrorist activity.  One of the first acts it mentions is seriously intimidating a population.  Most people of independent mind would agree that if one asks what populations on the planet have been most intimidated of late, one would not have to think too hard given that over 1 million people in Iraq have been killed, Afghanistan has been a fairly tough place to live, Yemen is not easy, neither is Somalia and Syria certainly is not.  I wonder if the Government would agree, given that the European Council has argued that seriously intimidating a population is a terrorist activity, that we should have serious reservations about allowing the US military machine to use Shannon Airport in order to continue to seriously intimidate populations.  People are probably tired of listening to us raising this issue but, sadly, we will have to keep raising it until something changes.</p><p>Another act of terrorism is seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country.  Nobody has done it better than the US military machine.  One can also be deemed to be a terrorist for attacks upon a person's life which may cause death.  In 2014, US military operators killed people in 133 different countries.  In other words, they carried out military missions against citizens in 133 countries.  There are not many more countries in the world.  Only 196 play in the World Cup.  There might be 200 in the world, but 133 is a frightening number.</p><p>Another terrorist offence is kidnapping or hostage taking.  Any of the Members who followed the court case in Ennis when myself and Deputy Clare Daly were brought up for trying to inspect planes for possession of weapons will be aware that different individuals came forward and testified under oath that they saw guns on military planes.  Different witnesses testified that certain planes were parked a long way away from the terminal building where the airport personnel were not allowed the normal procedure where they would go in, clean the plane, put on food and whatever.  They would be met at the door because what was inside was not fit for their consumption.  At this stage, given the leaks from the likes of Snowden, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, there are not many doubting anymore that Shannon was used for rendition flights.  Are we complicit?  I am not saying there were any rendition flights during the lifetime of this Government.  However, the State should investigate our politicians who made the decisions that allowed Shannon Airport to be used in such a manner.</p></speech>

It is getting tiresome and repetitive.  It reminds me of the slogan, &quot;No justice, no peace&quot;.  We would be better off spending our time examining the conditions that gave rise to international terrorism and destabilisation, the break-up of areas like the Middle East and the role of Western imperialism therein than spending it on an even greater securitisation of the EU.  We would also be better off discussing mutual assistance across the EU, for example, in debt write-downs and in solidarity with the ordinary people of Greece and Italy on whose shores have been landed tens of thousands of refugees of whom other European states have failed to accept their equal share.  I am not interested in the type of mutual assistance that has seen the British Government co-operating with the Swedish Government and American authorities in the incarceration of Mr. Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than three years.  He has played a key role internationally in highlighting the nature of modern surveillance, including surveillance of the past three French Prime Ministers and so on, and in exposing the role of Shannon Airport in the US military machine, as Deputy Wallace stated.</p><p>This Bill is another part of the securitisation of Europe.  The Part 7A to be inserted by it includes provisions on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in so-called crisis situations.  This stems from a 2008 European Council decision and is an instrument that we are told is aimed at improving co-operation between member states' special intervention units in man-made crises that present a serious and direct physical threat, such as a terrorist incident.  Of course, this could also mean an outpouring of civil unrest.  Let us be clear, in that special intervention units in the old Hollywood era were elite police forces, but the legislation calls them paramilitary police units that assist under Article 18 of the Pr&uuml;m decision with policing mass gatherings and similar major events, disasters and serious accidents.  The Council decision to which this Bill gives legislative effect complements and extends the provisions of the Pr&uuml;m decision and allows for forms of police assistance between member states through special intervention units in other situations, namely, crises presenting a serious physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions, for example, hostage taking.  Obviously, no one will object to a bunch of paramilitary units rescuing hostages, but we must be careful.  Paramilitary units are neither police nor army.  They are an amalgam of both.  Our State has experienced difficulties with a civilian police force and a lack of accountability.  How much worse would that be when dealing with military and paramilitary aspects?</p><p>In a European context, these special units operate transnationally under the umbrella of the ATLAS Network, which was set up following the September 11 attacks.  That network works under the supervision of and is financed by the European Commission's Directorate General of Migration and Home Affairs, but neither the Commission nor the directorate is democratically elected.  As such, the ATLAS Network is not accountable to anyone for its activities.</p><p>The terrorist attacks in the US and Europe in the years since 2001 have led to the relentless focus on international terrorism that we are fond of hearing about.  The so-called new security agenda has gone hand in hand with that.  It has been a strong driver of the reorganisation of police institutions in many countries.  As sociology Professor Mathieu Deflem stated: &quot; ...as terrorism is conceived as war-like behaviour and is responded to by military actions, it brings up the problem of a potential militarisation of the police.&quot;  There are many reasons to be wary of this, the most obvious being that, in everyday life in Ireland and most of Europe, we are not living in a combat zone.  We should not invite combat-ready militants into our midst.  Unfortunately, that is what the ATLAS Network is.  Professor Robert Warren called it a pop-up army that was mobilised transnationally to pre-emptively militarise cities facing major demonstrations.</p><p>Our special intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit, was pulled in to help with the G8 Summit in Fermanagh in 2013, which saw a major lockdown of citizens' democratic movements.  When the G7 Summit took place in Brussels last year, Belgium's special intervention unit, the CGSU, sat on top of President Barack Obama's hotel, snipers at the ready.  During the visit of the Queen and President Obama to Ireland in 2011, we had a lockdown of this city.  Although the Government had to get rid of many of the emergency GMC-Sierra barriers that it had bought, it was ridiculous when the D&aacute;il was locked down last winter.  According to a 2013 <i>Irish Independent</i>article about the Emergency Response Unit in 2013, it was deployed on more than 100 VIP duties per year.  Heavily armed and State-funded paramilitary police units are being deployed to protect VIPs.  There is something untoward about that.  The idea that the EU would have a transnational paramilitary force is even worse.  It is what Professor Stephen Graham called the &quot;startling militarisation of civil society &ndash; the extension of military ideas of tracking, identification and targeting into the quotidian spaces of everyday life&quot;.  He also wrote:<blockquote>It leads to the creeping and insidious diffusion of militarised debates about &quot;security&quot; in every walk of life.  Together, once again, these work to bring essentially military ideas of the prosecution of, and preparation for, war into the heart of ordinary, day-to day city life.</blockquote>Security trumps everything.  On Monday, Deputy Wallace, a number of cross-party Deputies and I visited Maghaberry Prison where we considered issues like improving prisoner conditions and welfare, but we were met with the barrier of security in respect of some of those.  Making a heavily militarised transnational network of police normal, which process this Bill forms part of, is just one element in a relentless securitisation of our lives.  We see it in increasingly sophisticated border controls, biometrics, mass data collection, surveillance, brutal crackdowns on protests, sinister fringes at home, etc.  It is a worrying trend in terms of the erosion of human rights, as states of security exception rapidly become states of everyday normality.  We saw that with the riot police in Greece who were deployed at protests <i>en masse</i>in 2010 but who, two years later, were standing guard on street corners in Athens every day of the week.  We saw 3,000 armed police officers bring Athens to a standstill last March as students from hundreds of schools took part in a parade.  We see it in Spain's new gag law, which effectively outlaws protests on pain of &euro;600,000 fines.  We saw it in the lockdown of our cities.  This is not healthy.</p><p>This debate is feeding into a security industry across Europe.  We have security fairs with names like Counter Terror Expo and Infosecurity Europe where government representatives rub cheeks with the private security industry, each selling its wares to the other.  Information exchange does not just happen between the special intervention units of the EU.  Israeli expertise is being used.</p><p>While the particular provisions of this Bill do not explicitly relate to protest, I think there is an overlap there.  It is a further extension of a security state and a further normalisation of a discourse of constant war.  In my view, this is as dangerous as it is at odds with reality.</p></speech>

This is an important debate because criminal justice issues are very relevant in the modern world, which sadly seems to be deteriorating.  Human life now appears to be very cheap.  One can now get gunned down on the streets of Dublin for owing &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 to some gangland criminal.  We see the consequences of that each day for the children and families that are suffering.  Along with my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I am working on this important issue, which needs to be resolved.  I hope the Minister will listen to our recommendations when we make our final report.</p><p>The Bill before the House is part of a process.  We all have to buy into a fair and just criminal justice system that is based on equality and respect for all citizens.  We need quality political leadership.  We need quality policing management.  We need trust and support from the local community.  These things are currently lacking in many areas of Irish society.  People are crying out for a proper system.  This is a wake-up call.  Reform must be implemented.  Trust and confidence must be given back to the citizens and the people of this country.  We cannot come in here and demand trust and respect - we have to earn them.  States cannot demand support and respect when they are often involved in breaking the law and do not assist other countries where crimes have occurred.</p><p>I would like to mention the Dublin and Monaghan bombings as an example in this context.  I commend Margaret Irwin and all the members of Justice for the Forgotten on their magnificent work in helping the families of those who died in and survived the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Justice for the Forgotten was formed in 1996 with the aim of campaigning for truth and justice for the victims of the bombings in question, which took place on 17 May 1974.  Some 34 people, including an unborn baby, died that day.  It was the greatest loss of life in a single day of the Troubles.  The membership of Justice for the Forgotten includes an overwhelming majority of bereaved families and many wounded survivors.  In 2001, the bereaved families and survivors of the bombings of 1 December 1972 and 20 January 1973 united with those of the 1974 bombings to create a single organisation, the aim of which is to demand the truth about why their loved ones died and so many others were maimed.  Justice for the Forgotten also represents the families and survivors of the Belturbet, Dundalk and Castleblayney bombings and the families and survivors of the Miami Showband massacre.  Justice for the Forgotten supports all of these victims.</p><p>I am raising these matters during this debate because the legislation before the House deals with mutual assistance.  Not a single person has ever been prosecuted in connection with any of the cross-Border bombings.  Indeed, the official silence about these events was maintained until the early 1990s.  Over the years, the bereaved and injured have come to question the complicity of British state forces in the North in the bombings, the actions of the Irish State in pursuing those responsible, the integrity of the RUC and its investigations at the time and the integrity of the Garda investigations.  I sat on the sub-committee on the Barron report in 2003.  We also had the second Barron report in 2004.  Many people worked on this issue.  The weak link was the lack of co-operation from a state.  How dare any state lecture people and look for co-operation internationally if it is refusing to hand over certain files?  A motion to this effect was agreed by all Members of this House many years ago, but we have yet to get action on it.  I would also like to mention the case of Pat Finucane.  His family has been badly let down.  I commend RTE on its recent programme about collusion.  We have to face up to the reality of these issues when we are discussing the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>This legislation will give effect to a number of EU agreements on mutual assistance in criminal matters, including agreements relating to confiscation orders and financial penalties.  It will also give effect to an agreement of mutual assistance between the EU and Japan and to the strengthening of Eurojust.  It also gives effect to an agreement that will allow Ireland to take part in special intervention units in certain times of crisis.  I would like to elaborate on two of those agreements, the first of which involves co-operation with Japan.  Many people in the Japanese community and many Japanese citizens are concerned about a drift in the Japanese Government in recent times.  Following its experiences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has tried to keep out of international conflicts but now it is being dragged back to breach its own official policy of neutrality in many conflicts.  This concerns me.  I join the members of the Japanese community and the peace activists around the world who strongly support that position.</p><p>The second agreement I would like to mention is that allowing Ireland to take part in intervention units in certain times of crisis.  I am in favour of intervening to help people.  I commend the members of our Defence Forces on the <i>LE Eithne</i>who have been trying to assist and rescue families in European waters in recent weeks.  I am keen to see our forces being involved in such situations.  I am very proud of the work of our UN soldiers in international peacekeeping as well.  I have family members who have served abroad, both in the Middle East and in Africa.  We are all very proud of them.  We have to ensure they are used for peacekeeping and not for getting involved in international conflicts.  It is very important that we say this as part of the broader debate.</p><p>I would like to speak about the background to the Council decision on this legislation.  The Commission states:<blockquote>The fight against organised crime and the disruption of criminal organisations remain a daily challenge.  Regretfully, the past decade has seen an explosion of cross-border crime.  Drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, terrorism and cybercrime, including child pornography are some examples.</blockquote>We need to ensure we have this kind of co-operation.  I note the statement that &quot;disruption of criminal organisations remain a daily challenge&quot;.  That is something we have to learn from in Ireland as well.  It is not acceptable that 12 people have been shot down in cold blood in recent times when engaging in activity like going into a pigeon club.  That figure has probably increased to 14 more recently.  There has been no response and no serious action.  We need reactions to these incidents.  We also need crime prevention measures.  The important thing is to ensure this happens.</p><p>Under the Lisbon treaty, new possibilities to enhance Eurojust's efficiency in tackling these forms of criminality have been introduced.  Article 85 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU explicitly recognises Eurojust's mission of supporting and strengthening co-ordination and co-operation between national investigating and prosecuting authorities in relation to serious crime affecting two or more member states or requiring a prosecution on common bases.  Therefore, it is important to ensure the best possible use is made of Eurojust and obstacles to its efficient functioning are removed.  That is exactly what is going on as well.</p><p>I would like to speak about what is happening in relation to Ireland.  The Minister said in June 2014 that, in the previous year, Ireland had made 200 requests for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, of which 129 were transmitted to other member states of the EU and 71 were transmitted to other countries.  In the same year, Ireland received 583 requests for assistance, of which 516 were received from within the EU and 67 were received from outside the EU.  Ireland made 1,070 requests for legal assistance from other countries from 2008 to 2013.  The majority of those requests went to the UK, the North and the US.  As we are talking about mutual assistance, I reiterate my request to the British Government to listen to the families of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Finucane family as well.  Over the past six years, Ireland has dealt with more than 4,000 requests from other countries seeking legal assistance in criminal justice proceedings.  I have given the statistics and figures.  We need to ensure we have co-operation when we are talking about this legislation.  If countries are not fully co-operating, they have to be challenged in this House, at UN level and at European level.</p><p>Co-operation is based on trust and confidence but it also involves respecting the rights of citizens, whether in Ireland, the EU or other countries.</p></speech>

As I indicated in my opening remarks, the primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, which gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework for the provision of mutual legal assistance.  This Bill is necessary in order to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act.  These are international instruments which have already been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Most Deputies fully recognise that the Bill is not controversial but is necessary legislation required to adhere to our international agreements within the EU and with non-EU states.  This legislation will assist in enhancing existing mutual assistance provisions and provide for wider and more efficient co-operation in fighting transnational crime.  The international mutual assistance powers provided here will be of use in detecting and prosecuting criminals.  Given that we live in a world where crime is international and does not respect any borders, this legislation is an essential part of dealing with crime.  I appreciate the broad support for this legislation here in the D&aacute;il and look forward to further debating it on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Bernstein's main thesis was that inequality plays a major part in the lives of children before they reach the school gates.  Any discussion of children in detention must consider the root causes and reasons for the detention of children.</p>  <p>  Schools are doing great work, for example, through the school completion programme.  I encourage the Minister to give this programme as much support as possible as it has great potential and tremendous work is being done under it.  Having met a number of people working in the area of school completion, I am very encouraged by the results being achieved.  Much more can be done under this programme, which comes within the remit of the Department and Tusla.  </p>  <p>  Last week, I attended an event at a local school, Midleton CBS Primary, to launch an active schools flag. </p></speech>
