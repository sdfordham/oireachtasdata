    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200003#A00600"><p>Following consultation with my Government colleagues, I issued an invitation to the representative organisations for public servants to enter discussions with public service management.  The discussions commenced today and I am sure the Deputy will understand my reluctance to engage in negotiations in public.  Further formal discussions will take place in the coming weeks and although I am not in a position to predict when the talks will conclude, early agreement will facilitate the assignment of resources and better budgetary planning. </p>  <p>  The end of the period of acute financial emergency which necessitated the introduction of the FEMPI legislation by this and the previous Government is now in sight because of the actions of the Government.  Planning for the orderly wind-down of the legislation in an agreed and sustainable process, rather than risking a successful legal challenge, is the appropriate, prudent and correct approach.  The Deputy is aware that I am required to review the FEMPI Acts annually.  My next review of the Acts is due to be carried out and a report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of June this year.  Any proposed change to the legislation arising from the discussion process will be subject to Government approval and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  When the economic crisis determined that further reductions were required of public servants in 2013 under the Haddington Road agreement, agreement was secured by negotiation and discussion with the representatives of those directly affected.  A similar approach in current circumstances is also appropriate.  The Government considers any pay agreement should be prudent, modest and sustainable in the overall budgetary context as set out in the spring economic statement.  Through the Haddington Road agreement and its predecessor, the Croke Park agreement, and through the supporting FEMPI legislation public servants have made a significant contribution to our fiscal recovery, including by way of  direct reductions in pay and pensions.  From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.  Notwithstanding the improving economy, because of the magnitude of these reductions, the Exchequer could not sustain the immediate restoration of such reductions.  I have stated previously that both sides need to be realistic in terms of the expectations and outcomes of the talks regarding what can be achieved in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

He must, however, be going into the talks with some overall objectives and we did not hear about them in his reply.</p>  <p>  The Minister will agree that every family has suffered financially in the past eight years and all families in Ireland, both in the public and private sectors, are entitled to share in any improvement in the economy.  He will also agree that the initial focus should be on low and middle income earners.  There is room in the public sector area for improvements in pay through not just pay rate adjustments but also reductions in the public sector pension levy, the USC and various other taxes.  It is important that any discussions take place in the context that every household has contributed and any pay increases in the public sector should be in line with pay increases in the private sector.  The public sector should not run ahead nor should it fall behind.  What was missing from the Minister's reply was the 85% of the workforce outside the public sector whose position should also be taken into account.</p></speech>

The FEMPI legislation underpins the cuts and that legislation is anchored in the emergency but, mercifully, we are now exiting from that emergency.  The prudent and right approach is to prepare for the exit in an orderly way but in a way that does not risk the recovery that the Irish people have worked so hard to achieve.</p>  <p>  I agree that we need to share in the improvement and that is why, during the discussions last year, we began the process of reducing the universal social charge on all workers from 1 January this year.  Up to three pay reductions have been imposed on the public service and we agreed in the teeth of the emergency that when we next spoke we would be talking about pay recovery and that is what is under way right now.</p></speech>

I welcome his acknowledgement of the great achievements in that area under the Croke Park Agreement, even though an agreement was very difficult to get at the time.  We paid a price in the short term for introducing those measures and it has taken time for them to work their way through but I am pleased that the Minister has continued to work with the FEMPI legislation that he inherited when he came into office.   I acknowledge that he continually refers to reductions in the public sector pay bill from 2009 to the current date.  He knows that the majority of those decisions, which have put us on the right road, were taken in 2009, 2010 and 2011, prior to the present Government coming into office.  Everybody in Ireland suffered financially and every family is now entitled to some share of the recovery, both in the public and private sector.  It should not, however, be at the expense of front-line services.</p></speech>

It was necessary because of the collapse of our economy due to a variety of factors, above all poor administration, politically, in the last part of the previous Administration.  We have had to do a number of difficult things including bringing in the FEMPI legislation, which we have maintained because we could not have survived and made the adjustments we needed without it.   Unfortunately, that is the position we were left in but I want to look forward.  The Irish people have gone through a very difficult period but public service workers, unlike many in analogous countries who were in difficulties, did not go on strike, instead taking a round of pay cuts and working harder.  We are doing much more with less and we now have 10% fewer people working in the public service doing an awful lot more.  I want to keep that productivity so that we have a sustainable future for public services and for the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

In the course of making that series of announcements, the Government identified a 50:50 split in respect of taxation and expenditure, but provided precious little detail on the level of expenditure on investment in public services.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200005#C00200"><p>As outlined in the spring economic statement, SES, Ireland is on track to reduce the general Government deficit to 2.3% of GDP this year.  This will enable us to exit the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, at the end of the year.  After we exit the EDP, we will enter the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, which will require that we make sustained progress towards achieving the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO.  In Ireland's case, the MTO is to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms.  Our progress towards achieving the MTO will be judged against two fundamental pillars, namely, compliance with the expenditure benchmark and making the minimum structural adjustment of greater than 0.5% of GDP every year.</p>  <p>  Ireland has fully supported the EU fiscal governance reforms, given that we understand all too well the consequences of irresponsible management of public resources.  We also understand, however, that the rules need to be applied in a sensible manner.  Following interventions by Ireland, changes have been agreed on the technical application of the rules.</p>  <p>  The SES outlined that fiscal space of approximately &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion will be available for budget 2016.  The fiscal forecasts contained in the SES are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion in 2016, split evenly between expenditure and tax.  This provides the opportunity to reduce the tax burden for low and middle income earners, encourage further economic growth and increase investment in public services.</p>  <p>  The fiscal forecasts included in the SES post-2016 have been compiled on a "no policy change" basis, with provision made for a &euro;300 million increase in gross expenditure to offset demographic pressures.  While policy changes must be made, the only issue being taken into account beyond next year is the unavoidable demographic pressures in areas such as social protection, health and education.</p>  <p>  The SES assumes that after 2017, the voted capital expenditure allocations are left unchanged in nominal terms.  This is a technical assumption.  These amounts will be finalised by the Government in the coming weeks and announced in the capital review next month.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200005#C00300"><p>The concern is that, while moving outside the EDP and into the preventative arm, investment in real terms in essential public services will not see the kind of boom at which the Minister hinted during the spring economic statement.  In the Minister's Comprehensive Expenditure Review Report 2015-2017, the planned investment in areas such as health and education were underwhelming.  It suggests a Government strategy not of any great investment in such services, which have borne the brunt of very serious cuts, but of a holding position.  The Minister will agree with me that he cannot argue from one side of his mouth that there will be relief in terms of investment in services while adopting an "as you were" position on real investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200005#C00400"><p>In Sinn F&eacute;in's response to the spring statement, it accused us both of trying to buy the election and of being parsimonious in our expenditure.  Sinn F&eacute;in cannot have it both ways, although it tries.  We have been under pressure to provide a balanced budget.  We have reduced the deficit in actual terms from 30% of GDP in 2010, an underlying deficit of 11%, to 2.3% projected for this year.  Given that we are moving into the preventative arm, we have more flexibility.</p><p>We have said there will be space of approximately &euro;1.5 billion next year which will be divided in a 50:50 expenditure and tax reduction process.  Beyond this, we obviously have to look at how the economy will grow.  We have only given indicative figures for expenditure on the current side to cater for inflation and demographics.  We will see what real capacity we have closer to the budget in October.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200006#D00200"><p>It is the Government which wants to have it both ways.  On the one hand, it wants to send a message to the electorate that it will dispense largesse from the Government&rsquo;s coffers.  When one actually looks at and drills into the figures, however, one finds that this is not the case.  I am working on the assumption that the projections made in the comprehensive expenditure report still hold.  Will the Minister clarify that nothing in this document has changed in the light of the spring economic statement or from the forecasting in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance?  For all of the rhetoric and the Minister&rsquo;s compliance with the various rules and regulations for which he argued at the time of their introduction by way of treaty change, the reality is that the health system is still stuck in gridlock, with patients on hospital trolleys in accident and emergency departments and long waiting lists.  I cite the example of the Department of Health because, of all Departments, it is the one in need of the largest propping up year-on-year.</p></speech>

Last October the deficit we expected in 2015 was 2.7%.  The spring economic statement indicated that it would be 2.3%.  We have made more progress, with more people back at work and the unemployment rate falling quicker than we envisaged.  Thankfully, this is all good news and will give more scope to address issues such as, for example, the demographic pressures we are facing.  We have started recruiting garda&iacute; again, as well as 1,700 teachers, including resource teachers, and 1,000 nurses.  That is the capacity we have because of the improvement in the economy.</p></speech>

As I said last week, they are now hard-wired into public services.  When I took office four and a half years ago, I was given two jobs, namely, to balance the books as Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and to be the first Minister of Cabinet rank to reform the public sector.  A remarkable amount of reform has been carried out since.  That reform is not a crisis-only event but needs to be a constant part in the way public services are delivered.  This will ensure quality public services are available to all citizens which are not subject to boom and bust.  It will mean people who have grown used to a service are not suddenly deprived of it simply because we cannot afford to provide it.  That is a sustainable future on which we have set our sights and that we are determined to achieve.</p></reply>

Would the Minister accept that many people in the public service have seen their pay dramatically reduced over the last number of years?  It started with the pension levy which, I accept, this Government did not introduce.  Even those in the public service who were not entitled to any pension had their hours increased and sick leave reduced.</p>  <p>  During the week, Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, said that public service staff will have to continue to implement work practice reforms and improve productivity in future.  In addition, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, says he would prefer more staff and fewer earning more.  Would the Minister, Deputy Howlin, agree that the time has come to lift the moratorium, if we are to get a decent public service?  It has not happened, however.  An example of that is where class sizes have increased but the number of teachers has been reduced.  </p>  <p>  Increasing expenditure in the public service also increases consumer spending which allows the economy to grow.  What are the Minister's views on lifting the moratorium on public service recruitment, which many in the trade union movement have said is essential?</p></speech>

That is why, last year, I moved to recruit more garda&iacute; and in the budget I announced 1,700 more teachers.  We are recruiting more SNAs and are recruiting nurses again.  They are front-line staff.  That is part of what I have described as the dividend from the reforms we brought about.</p>  <p>  We have abolished the moratorium and are now devolving to each agency and Department control of their own pay bill.  They will therefore determine, within an agreed pay framework, what level of individual skills they need to provide their services.  With the exception of one adjustment at secondary level, we have always maintained the pupil-teacher ratio which required us to hire a lot more teachers.</p>  <p>  As regards the Haddington Road agreement, which I have been responsible for, we did not have a general reduction in pay.  We had a reduction in pay for those earning over &euro;65,000 per annum.  Even for those, it ranged from 5.5% at the bottom to 10% at the top, to be fair.  </p>  <p>  I will make a final point so that there will be no confusion about it.  In terms of the pay recovery we are now involved in, it is my intention that the pay ceilings I put in place immediately on taking office, will be retained.</p></speech>

However, we were also told that the public sector rises would have to come from the &euro;750 million within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Are we talking about a sum between &euro;250 million and &euro;300 million in 2016?  The Minister has also insisted that all cuts to public service pay and pensions cannot be measured over the next year.  There was a total of &euro;2.2 billion in cuts over that number of years.  Can the Minister give some indication to the House today in that respect?  If the cuts were &euro;2.2 billion, the Minister has &euro;750 million to spend within his remit.  That does not add up to increasing pay levels by much in the public service, however, as well as dealing with the moratorium.</p>  <p>  I revert to the two questions I asked earlier.  Will the Minister comment on what the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, said, that he would prefer more staff with fewer earning more, and what Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said?  If we cut &euro;2.2 billion and have &euro;750 million, it does not add up.  How will that be spent?</p></speech>

Obviously, however, that is not the totality of the pay bill reductions because we have also reduced numbers by 10% over the same period.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration or pay recovery will be part of the expenditure side of the equation, which is understood.  I have not put a figure on it, nor have I brought a figure to Cabinet concerning what will be determined in that regard.  I have a figure in mind myself.</p><p>We will engage with the public service unions.  Throughout my dealings with them over four and a bit years, they have been reasonable and understanding.  Every public servant - each garda, teacher, civil servant and local government worker - has a vested interest in our country recovering so we can have quality public services and a place in which families can thrive and find jobs.</p></speech>

The fiscal adjustment implemented in order to exit the EU-IMF programme of support and return sustainability to the public finances required significant tax increases and expenditure reductions.  We all know the figures in the House but they are very stark.  Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion last year.  In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority has been to ensure that a targeted approach was adopted in order to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  Budget 2015 marked a turning point in our recovery when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and we were in a position to begin a modest improvement in front-line services.  Additional funding in the education sector last year will go towards providing 900 new classroom teachers, 480 new resource teachers and 220 new special needs assistants and so on.  Last September this Government oversaw the first recruitment of new garda&iacute; since 2009.  To date, 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College, with a further 250 new garda&iacute; to be recruited this year.</p></speech>

He has spoken about extra teachers but the Government is not maintaining the pupil-teacher ratio; that has now deteriorated.  There are 27% of children in classrooms with 30 or more pupils around the country.  Despite the extra teachers, the number is not keeping pace with the number of new pupils attending schools.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister provide funding for the 400,000 people waiting for outpatient appointments?  There are people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments in record numbers this year and there are people waiting for operations, which is a very serious issue.  Key staff must be hired again in the education sector, including career guidance teachers.  Will the Minister do something meaningful about the housing crisis and the homelessness issue that is specifically a creation of this Government?</p></speech>

We have provided the additional teachers to do that.  We have also had to deal with the demographic pressure in the education area.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the health sector.  Deputy Fleming assaulted me for approximately ten days at the end of last year about providing a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;680 million for the Department of Health but he is now demanding more money for the Department.  I have provided &euro;650 million into its budget this year and since the beginning of the year I have allocated another &euro;74 million to deal with the issue of pressure in the fair deal scheme and accident and emergency departments.  This was to ensure people are treated in the appropriate setting.</p>  <p>  With respect to housing, Deputy Fleming will recall that I regarded this as the most important issue in my budget speech last year, and I allocated &euro;2.2 billion to start a social housing programme that had not happened in the entirety of the previous Government's term in office.  These are important issues and we are addressing them on the basis of our capacity to do that.</p></speech>

We will oppose the Government completely if the Supplementary Estimate is a cover-up for a flawed Estimate that was introduced in the first place.  With most of what the Government introduced last year, we told the Minister on budget day that the Estimate was flawed.  The HSE and the Minister for Health stated it was a flawed Estimate.  The Minister believes we should applaud him when he corrects his flawed Estimate but we will not do so.  I will support the Minister with a Supplementary Estimate to improve the health services.</p><p>In regard to the &euro;2.2 billion for housing, the biggest announcement in the budget last year, much of that is by way of public private partnerships in the private sector, none of which has been put in place.  Every time I hear the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, speak on the issue that &euro;2.2 billion moves from 2020 to 2021 to 2022.  I do not know where it will end.  That promise of &euro;2.2 billion will not even end in the lifetime of the next Government.</p></speech>

I want to know if and how the Minister will prioritise low-paid workers in the current round of talks.  I heard the Minister say earlier that anything that is agreed must be prudent, modest and sustainable.  He urged realistic expectations.  What does that mean for low-paid workers in the public sector?</p></reply>

I want to make it clear, however, that all public servants from the lowest paid to the highest paid have contributed to our economic recovery.  We designed the cuts imposed in the FEMPI Act I introduced in 2013 to be as progressive as possible.  We protected the core pay of 87% of public servants; that is those who earn less than &euro;65,000.  The Haddington Road agreement reiterates the commitment to give priority to those public servants on salaries of less than &euro;35,000.  The agreement also contains commitments to those who suffered an additional real pay cut in 2013 either through a direct cut in core pay or through the loss of the supervision and substitutions allowance paid to teachers.  The agreement is a collective agreement registered with the Labour Relations Commission and it contains detailed commitments on the restoration of those pay cuts.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will respect the terms of the collective agreement I solemnly entered into as should any person who respects the formal industrial relations processes of the State.</p>  <p>  My intention is that any agreement reached will maintain and build upon the productivity and other reforms delivered through earlier agreements, including the Haddington Road agreement, and secure an industrial relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change in the workplace.  Reform is now a constant part of employment for public servants and is a central element of my strategy to deliver a public service that will in turn deliver improved outcomes for all stakeholders, including the business sector and every family in the State.</p></speech>

Previously, he has stood up in the House and given a commitment of sorts that those on lower incomes within the public service, including the Civil Service, would be prioritised.  Ever since he made that commitment, the Minister has studiously rowed back from it.  He says that every public servant has made a contribution.  Yes, they were all captured by the FEMPI legislation.  However, the big scandal in terms of the payment system within the public service is that there is a small minority at the top end who are outrageously overpaid by international standards while there is a set of people further down the chain who do not even earn the living wage.  Some 4,000 of them, in fact, rely on family income supplement.  When the Minister talks about winding back FEMPI and reinstating pay, he should start with that set of workers as a matter of logic as well as decency.  What is the Minister going to do for them that is prudent, modest and sustainable?</p></speech>

The only clear action I have taken was in regard to the Haddington Road agreement whereby anyone earning less than &euro;65,000 received no cut in actual pay.</p><p>Those who earned more than &euro;65,000 received pay cuts ranging from 5.5% to 10%.  That is the reality and that is my record.  It is not the previous Government's record but my record. </p> <p> On pay comparisons, I am sure the Deputy has had an opportunity to look at the comparisons published by the CSO last week.  Up to 2006, the public service, on a pay comparison basis, was paid more than the private sector.  The snapshot of 2010 showed that situation no longer exists and that the public sector and the private sector were less than 1% apart.  However, where they were apart was in respect of the lowest cohort of workers in the public sector who were better paid than comparable workers in the private sector.  The highest half of public service workers were less well paid than their comparators in the private sector.  I am sure Deputy McDonald will be conscious of that when we have to recruit consultants, people to man our health service, judges and so on.</p></speech>

I have just told the Minister that some 4,000 of such workers rely on family income supplement.  This fact is an admission by the system that these workers do not earn enough to maintain a basic lifestyle - not luxury, nothing fancy, just the basics.  I want to know where low paid workers feature in the mandate the Minister has given to his officials in these talks.  It seems to me that the Minister has stepped back from what he said a number of weeks ago about prioritising lower paid people.  That is how this sounds to me.  I would like the Minister to get up from his seat and tell me that I am wrong and I respectfully ask the Minister not to tell me about everyone because I want him to focus on the low paid in the public and civil service.</p></speech>

It is logical that the first port of call be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, but some bodies fall outside its umbrella.  How does the Minister propose to co-ordinate and keep a level of coherence in the negotiations?  Bear in mind those workers who are reliant on the family income supplement, FIS.  Many of those whom I have met are members of the Defence Forces.  Is it not astonishing that we congratulate ourselves for our work with the UN and we applaud members of the Defence Forces when some of them rely on FIS?

An array of officials - 15 plus - will be involved in the talks.  Also, officials from all line Departments that are involved will be co-opted to the task as well as the economics evaluation unit within my Department, which will crunch the numbers in support of the talks.</p>  <p>  Regarding the process, I deal formally and directly with ICTU.  The public sector committee of the congress will be the formal interlocutor, but we and it will have parallel discussions with the others that I mentioned.</p></speech>

That was my point.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us how many officials will be involved.  He stated that there would be 15 from his Department, but how many might be involved when the line Departments and others are included?</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned June as a possible date for updating the House.  He has not told us much about the mandate that he has given his officials, although I have concluded that there is no specific emphasis on the low paid in the public sector.  What form or shape does he hope will be arrived at for the agreement?  I assume that he has in mind a single, all-encompassing agreement.</p></speech>

Haddington Road was a single encompassing agreement endorsed by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC.  I expect the LRC to be involved in the talks at the appropriate time so that its <i>imprimatur </i>and skill set is available to the process.</p><p>The numbers will vary.  Obviously, everyone from the official and trade union sides will not be in the room at the same time.  The way it will work is that there will be formal negotiations, break-out groups and report-back groups.  I remember speaking to the full gathering during the Haddington Road process.  There was a very large contingent of people.  One could not have a negotiation on that basis.  There will be small sets of people doing direct negotiations, reporting back to larger groups, getting mandates for individual positions etc.  I hope that we will advance the process in this way.</p><p>Maybe I am being optimistic but, before bringing my report on FEMPI to the House at the end of June, I would like to know where we stand on an agreement.  I would like to be in that position, but it may not prove possible.</p></speech>

It is probably opportune that a question has been raised about these bumper pensions for the great and the good on the same day that in this Chamber the Minister cannot make a commitment and has not mandated officials to zero in specifically on that set of workers within the civil and public service who do not earn a living wage.</p></speech>

I have said this in reply to Deputy Sean Fleming, as I have to the Deputy.  It is not appropriate for her to determine what these instructions are because I am not in a position to reveal them.  I do not know any negotiator who would set out his or her negotiating hand in advance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked for a list of the pensions of senior politicians, including former Ministers and Taoisigh.  Obviously, there are many in the public sphere in receipt of analogous pensions, including senior judges, senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, senior administrators in the public service and senior academics.  It is important that pensions comprise an important part of the package available to get people to work in the public service.  We will have to start discussing how we can ensure we get quality people to work in the public service because there will be pressures associated with the filling of senior positions when recovery comes and there will be much more lucrative opportunities in the private sphere.</p></speech>

I have said this to him previously when we have debated these matters and I readily concede that all of this has become something of a mantra of mine and others in recent years.  With all the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation, changes and reform that he claims have been introduced, the central disparity within the system - in which small numbers of people are overpaid and over-pensioned but as one moves down the chain people are on poverty wages, and we talk about the working poor but these are the working poor in the employment of the State - and the failure even to acknowledge that is quite astonishing.</p></speech>

I have made that clear and have given the Deputy gross figures as opposed to reduced figures for all these recipients.  We should not exclusively look at people who are in politics and exclude senior administrators, judges, senior garda&iacute; and senior academics.  If we are going to have quality people working in the public sphere, we need to acknowledge that we are going to have pay a reasonable rate for those jobs.</p></speech>

What are his plans to extend the role of the Ombudsman to cover State bodies not currently within its remit?  I know the Minister will say that he has extended the Ombudsman's remit but the legislation has a Schedule of exempted agencies which run to more than 110 organisations.  When can we get some of those exempt organisations to come under the remit of the Ombudsman's legislation?</p></reply>

This was the most significant extension of the Ombudsman's remit in 30 years.  Obviously the Ombudsman's office has to be scaled up and supported to take on this very extensive new task.  Furthermore, any new body that conforms to the definition of "reviewable agency" will automatically become subject to review by the Ombudsman into the future.   The Act also provides for the extension of the Ombudsman's remit by order to non-public bodies in receipt of significant funding from the Exchequer, where there is a clear public benefit in particular bodies being subject to review by the Ombudsman, in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  It became clear, following consultation with other Departments and with the Office of the Ombudsman, that it was not appropriate to bring certain public bodies within his remit.  On that basis, the Government decided that certain categories of bodies should not be included.  These categories, about which we have had a debate, include the commercial State bodies, economic sectoral regulators, research and advisory bodies with little or no public interaction.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may know, I am currently finalising arrangements for bringing privately-run nursing homes whose residents are in receipt of State funding or subvention within the Ombudsman's scope.  I hope to be able to do so by the end of next month.  I have written to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to ask that it might consider that and advise me.    </p><p>My officials are also considering the steps necessary to extend the review by the Ombudsman to non-public bodies in receipt of significant public funding in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  If the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform or the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has any suggestion to make in this regard, I will happily entertain it.</p></speech>

His reply was that An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Eirgird had never been scheduled and, as such, were never within the Ombudsman's remit.  Anyone listening to him today would think that with 180 bodies listed, everyone was included.  However, he keeps saying it is only reviewable agencies that are included.  There are 110 bodies that are exempt, while a further 14 are substantially exempt, except in the case of specific issues.  I will not go through the whole list which includes bodies such as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the Equality Tribunal but ask the Minister to reconsider three bodies, in particular, in the public interest.  He knows that there is a good case to be made with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Many people are dissatisfied that they cannot appeal its decisions to the Ombudsman.  I am not talking about having another court of appeal, but people who are not satisfied with how they have been dealt with administratively by An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot go to the Ombudsman.  People who are not happy with how Eirgrid is dealing with them also cannot go the Ombudsman, while those who are unhappy with the Environmental Protection Agency cannot do so either.  All three bodies are involved in public planning and there is no route, other than to the High Court, for those who are not happy with them.  I think the Minister will agree that this is not satisfactory.  These three bodies should be reviewable by the Ombudsman, while the public should have a right to go to the Ombudsman's office.</p></speech>

I changed the process, as I have in other legislation, to state bodies are included unless specifically excluded.  The fact that the Deputy now knows who is excluded is a novelty.  Up to now, only those specifically included would have been known.  The categories excluded include the commercial semi-State sector, for reasons we have argued repeatedly, economic sectoral regulators, as well as research and advisory bodies.  The Deputy made reference to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which was set up under statute by the Houses and has a quasi-judicial role.  No more than we do not have the Ombudsman oversee the courts, we do not give the office authority to oversee An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If there is a case to be made for administrative oversight of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I will happily hear it, but I am concerned to ensure its absolute independence in making planning decisions which have been so controversial for many decades will not be impeded in any way.</p></speech>

Eirgrid is not dealing with the public on its commercial activity, while the Environmental Protection Agency has a key role to play.  The Minister mentioned the Courts Service, which is generally exempt, except where it relates to an action taken in the performance of administrative functions under section 5 of the Courts Service Act 1998.  The Minister is trying to claim credit for the listing of 110 agencies in the Schedule to the Act.  However, he spoke previously about the "Second Schedule to the Ombudsman Act, 1980."  That Schedule was not included by the Minister last year.  I again ask him to consider the administrative functions of the EPA, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Eirgrid.  I understand his argument about commercial semi-State bodies and regulators being exempt, but these three bodies are significant and we will be revisiting the issue in the House.</p></speech>

The committee's role includes receiving reports of the Ombudsman which often went into the air in the past.  The Ombudsman now has a point of contact with the Oireachtas through the committee.  I would be very happy for a discussion to take place within it or at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform with the organisations to which the Deputy refers, if either committee was of the view that this should happen.  That said, I would be afraid that people dissatisfied with a planning decision would simply go down the road of making an appeal to the Ombudsman, as if that office could overturn planning decisions.  That would not be a desirable objective.</p></speech>

My intention is to open discussions today with the public sector and that has happened.  We understand the economic circumstances in which we are discussing these matters.  In an article I had published today I stated we did not have a greenfield site.  We cannot undo all of the cuts; that would take a very considerable amount of time.  I am very conscious that the sustainability of the public finances remains the first objective.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the contribution made by public sector workers to our recovery.  Without their forbearance, doing more for less, we would not have got through the past four, five or six difficult years.  As the cuts are anchored in emergency legislation, it is prudent and wise to see how we can unwind that emergency legislation in a rational way that would not put our recovery in jeopardy.</p></speech>

I know that he is just beginning the discussions and that it is too early to say how they might conclude.  As he knows, however, morale in the Garda has suffered in recent years.  Pay has been reduced substantially for new entrants to the Garda in comparison with members who joined many years ago whose pay is much more substantial.  Will a review of this issue be part of the agreement?  On the PULSE system and the lack of adequate infrastructure for garda&iacute;, will this issue be part of the reform agenda or will the Minister just be looking at the pay side?</p></speech>

This seems to be at variance with his party's position.  On the day of the launch of Renua Mr. Eddie Hobbs, a co-founder of the party, insisted on public sector workers not having their pay restored.  When asked the question, he said, "The answer is no.  It shouldn't happen because we have very scarce resources and they shouldn't be wasted restoring something that actually was one of the outcomes that contributed to the economic collapse."  I hope the Deputy will acknowledge - I think he is so acknowledging - that it is now time to acknowledge the work of garda&iacute;, teachers and other public sector workers who got us through difficult times by making their contribution, as every other citizen did.  Many people made a bigger contribution by losing their jobs.  Many were forced to emigrate.  We need to build a future that will be sustainable in order that we do not revisit a boom and bust cycle.  That is certainly the objective of the Government.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that there have been many cuts for ordinary public servants, particularly garda&iacute;.  Members of the Garda have told me that they are finding it very difficult to get by.  They accept, however, that reform of the public service is needed.  What level of reform does the Minister envisage within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with all of the deficits in equipment and even the question of starting pay?  There are two Irelands in the sense that pay has been reduced substantially in recent years for new Garda recruits by comparison with the pay of those who joined in better times.

In replies to parliamentary questions I have indicated that it is not my intention to see it restored.  We had a considerable debate about there being too many allowances, a debate to which I believe the Deputy contributed.  We now have a more rational pay structure.</p><p>For example, substitution is subsumed into teachers' core work and should be remunerated accordingly rather than as an add-on payment.  We are introducing remarkable and groundbreaking change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is establishing a new Garda authority, the chairperson of which has been named.  This is something for which I have campaigned for a decade and I am glad to see it happening.

That sounds complicated but I think the Deputy understands the point.  In order to take maximum advantage of the asset disposal proceeds, they cannot all be availed of at once but must be remitted to the Exchequer over a number of years.</p>  <p>  The State assets disposal programme announced by the Government in February 2012 has resulted in the following receipts for the Exchequer to date.  In 2014, &euro;347 million in special dividends was in 2014, comprising &euro;197 million from ESB and &euro;150 million from Ervia, formerly BGE.  In Jan 2015, a further &euro;203 million was received from ESB, representing the remainder of the &euro;400 million that had been requested from ESB as its contribution to the State assets disposals programme.  A further &euro;100 million is expected to be received from Ervia in mid-2015.  The balance of the approximately &euro;1 billion total net receipts expected as a result of the BGE sale is expected to be received between now and 2017, as required by the Government and in a prudent manner that protects Ervia's investment grade credit rating.</p>  <p>  It has been the Government's consistent position that funds released from asset disposals should be used, as far as possible, to support the economy and job creation, while also using some of the proceeds to reduce debt.  Since the State asset disposal programme was agreed by the Government, I have made a number of announcements including allocations of additional funding for capital investment to be funded from proceeds of asset disposals.  Details of these investment programmes are on my Department's website, and further details about individual projects and programmes are available from the relevant Ministers and their Departments.</p></reply>

Some of the dividends from Ervia came through in 2014 and an additional &euro;100 million came through this year.  The Minister indicated that the balance of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is can only come through in stages in 2016 and 2017.  If Ervia is profitable between now and 2017, EUROSTAT rules still will not allow it to remit dividends to the State.  Where is the money being held?  Is it held on Ervia's balance sheet as a contingent liability to be passed to the State in due course?  There is no possibility of any further receipts by way of dividends or sale of State assets from Bord G&aacute;is between now and 2017.</p></speech>

These talks are, of necessity, complicated, because we have approximately 290,000 public sector workers, somewhat less than the 300,000 plus we had.  The various groups have individual concerns and are paid in different ways.  The way the process works is that we have a lead from the public service union side of the ICTU delegation, that is the main players in the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They deal in the plenary negotiations with my lead negotiators from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, backed up by negotiators from key line Departments, those with large numbers, such as the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Local Government.  Other groups are not part of ICTU <i>qua</i>ICTU, like An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  They have bilateral discussions with my officials and bilateral discussions with ICTU.  In that way they are kept in the loop and can feed into the process.</p><p>On the last occasion we had talks, public sector pensioners felt excluded from the process.  I advised they should form their own organisation and they have done that and I have met with that umbrella organisation on a couple of occasions.  I have instructed my officials to keep in touch with them during the current discussion process and to keep them in the loop in terms of any issue that may impact on them and their remuneration.</p></speech>

First, it had a public expenditure role, to work towards a deficit of less than 3% of GDP and this has been the overarching fiscal imperative of the Government for the past four years.  Now that we have reached that, we have set a new horizon, in accordance with the fiscal rules voted upon by the Irish people, and we are working towards our mid-term objective, the MTO.</p>  <p>  Parallel to that and equally important has been the reform agenda - reform of the public service and reform of the political sphere, in terms of FOI and all the rest.  I have said that reform is now hardwired into our public services and just as every progressive private sector company will look for innovation and ways of doing things better and more efficiently, so will the public services.  We will not just do this in the period of the crisis, but forever, because the more efficient we become, the more resources I can redeploy - what I describe as the "reform dividend" - into providing more front-line services for crucial services delivered by people, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nurses, teachers and special needs assistants.  That will be the ongoing objective of Government strategy.</p></speech>

It makes for shocking reading, presents an appalling vista in terms of what happened at that hospital and raises a range of issues in terms of patient safety and the needless loss of lives of five young children and perhaps others of whom we are not aware.  The report is an extraordinary tribute to the perseverance and persistence of parents who faced obstruction after obstruction in their search for the truth.  Despite the latest attempt by the HSE to suppress this report, we witnessed its publication last week.</p>  <p>  It is evident from the report that patient safety was not a priority and that there were failures at local, regional and national level in regard to this issue.  What is extraordinary is the extent of the repeated warnings which time and again were not acted upon.  This morning I received a copy of an e-mail received by one of the parents involved.  This e-mail reveals systemic weaknesses and awareness of those weaknesses by senior people within the HSE.  Alarmingly, these weaknesses were identified not just in Portlaoise, but in almost every other site across the country.  This e-mail was sent by the Chair of the national incident management team, NIMT, to the director of patient safety.  In essence, he said that he knows the director is aware that the high rates of harm alluded to are reflective of what is occurring in other jurisdictions also and that the NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites.</p><p>I will repeat that: "The NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites".  This was known at a very senior level within the HSE.  Was the then Minister aware of the numerous sad and serious cases at the time?  Was the Government aware of what has essentially been revealed as a systemic patient safety issue?  I have repeatedly asked in the D&aacute;il when the national patient safety authority would be established but I have received no reply.</p> <p> Portlaoise was a band 3 hospital, which was confirmed by the Minister at an Oireachtas Committee meeting in 2011 and which means it was to be a 24-hour, 7-day, acute surgery, accident and emergency and maternity hospital.  As we know from the HIQA report the investigation team found that the hospital was neither governed, resourced nor equipped to safely deliver this level of clinical services.  Furthermore, in 2012 and 2013 the HSE had specifically identified clinical risks associated with surgery and emergency medicine, going as far as to say that surgical services at the hospital should cease.  Given that all this was known and given the decision of the Government to make it a band 3 hospital, why were the necessary resources for a band 3 hospital not allocated?  Why was the requisite funding that would have gone to other, similar level hospitals, not given?</p> <p> Given what we now know from the report that very senior people were aware of the systemic safety issues in Portlaoise, how does the Minister for Health ensure proper accountability and responsibility for the needless loss of so many young lives?  What steps does the Minister intend to take so that we will get accountability?  That is the least the families and parents in this situation deserve.</p></speech>

I am sure that on a matter as serious and sensitive as this, nobody wants to make political point-scoring the objective of their questions.  I know that is not what Deputy Martin is doing.  For the families of the five little babies who are no longer with us, Katelyn Keenan-McCarthy, Nathan Molyneaux, Joshua Keyes, Mary Kate Kelly and Mark Molloy, it is obviously a tragedy.  The persistence and dedication of the parents in following this through has brought about a situation where the HIQA report has been made and published.  It is not the first HIQA report - there have been seven on various sensitive issues in the past number of years, such as on the misdiagnosis of breast cancer several years ago and on warnings about inadequacies in maternity services going back as far as 2006.  There will always be occasions when adverse incidents unfortunately arise in hospitals.  That is not confined to this country but happens in hospitals all over the world.  It is imperative that actions are taken to minimise that risk and to learn fully from errors where errors occur.</p>  <p>  I recognise the courage and dedication of the families involved in persisting and following through on this until the HIQA report was published.  The publication of the report is welcome and its eight recommendations are all accepted.  This will drive much needed improvements in Portlaoise and will have implications for the standards of local, regional and national services not just in maternity but in other sectors.  The very least the families who have spoken out here deserve is that the tragic legacy of what happened will be dealt with so that, in so far as is humanly possible, it should never happen again.  </p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin that this report raises issues of grave concern.  The fact that patients in their greatest hour of need were not treated with compassion, respect and dignity is an indictment of the health service in some locations.  The fact that, at HSE corporate level, patient safety is not given the highest priority is disturbing to put it mildly.  It is a fact that there are accountability and disciplinary procedures in respect of doctors and nurses but not in respect of management and that is why this report is lengthy and complicated and one on whose content the Minister for Health has to reflect very carefully.  At the very least a comprehensive response is required to ensure that a culture of patient safety is evident in the health service as a matter of absolute priority and it is not just a service that pays lip-service to patients and their requirements but one where the patient and the patient's needs are at its centre.</p>  <p>  The Minister is engaging directly with the HSE directorate to ensure that the very serious findings of this report are addressed and, in accepting the eight recommendations of the report, that they are fully implemented and that other issues arising from it are dealt with appropriately.  Deputy Martin asked about resources and one would expect that.  It is not all about resources but it is in part about resources.  I have dealt with many health issues over the years and for many years there has been a failure to address fundamental questions about the nature, the structure and the kind of service we need for our people nationwide.  The Minister will have to bear this in mind as he looks at national, regional and local services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200018#Q00300"><p>I am no wiser at the end of the Taoiseach's reply.  My opening question raised a very serious issue, revealed in the e-mail of December 2012 from the national incident management team to the director of patient safety.  It states that, "The NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites".  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health to come before the D&aacute;il and elaborate on that e-mail?  To what does it refer?  What are the systemic risks in sites across the country?  The public and parents are fed up of waiting three years to get answers, as they had to in the case of the HIQA report.  These are very serious issues.</p>  <p>  I am not raising the issue of funding, as one might do.  It was HIQA which raised it.  I quoted earlier from the Health Information and Quality Authority report, which states, "the hospital is neither governed, resourced nor equipped to safely deliver this level of clinical services".  Furthermore, the HSE itself, in 2012 and 2013, had specifically identified clinical risks associated with surgery and emergency medicine, going as far as to say that surgical services at the hospital should cease.  At the time of the publication of this report, however, the hospital continues to deliver those services.</p><p>In 2011, a Government intervention specified categorically that it was to be at this level at Bantry General Hospital.  However, there was no follow-through in terms of resources, governance or equipment to deliver the level of clinical services it would mean.  This core question must be answered.  What happened?  To what degree were the risks suppressed and why?  People at a very high level are commenting on the numerous sad cases all over the country.  Is it all being kept subterranean?  Were it not for the parents of the five babies concerned, we would never have had the HIQA report.  The e-mail was written five months before Mary Kate Kelly died and before the Portiuncula cases happened.  It is time, not to give the pat or formulaic reply as tends to happen on such occasions, but to use the HIQA report as a catalyst for coming clean on what is happening and calling it appropriately and properly, which has not been done to date.</p> <p> The Taoiseach seems to be saying, as the Minister has said, that there will be no accountability on the management side.  It is not the classic tragedy.  These deaths should not have happened and could have been prevented had people acted on the concerns identified here.  Regarding prior consideration of these issues the e-mail states, "on this basis a decision was made not to initiate a service safety review".  The following question was put in the e-mail: "Do you now think that a service safety review or a specific review of the overall performance of this service is required?"  These are the people responsible for safety in the hospital and across the system.  They seem to be at sixes and sevens about what to do next.  This would have also gone elsewhere and others must have known about the very serious concerns that were being raised.  Was the Government aware of how serious the situation was in 2011 and 2012?  It is time the Minister came before the House to make a statement on the issue, on this e-mail and the HIQA report and to take questions from Members of the House on Portlaoise and other hospitals.</p></speech>

The old system of hospitals A, B, C, D, E and F, and their facilities and services always led to tension between different regions for their individual hospitals.  The establishment of the hospital grouping system allows for contracts to the group and much greater engagement between hospitals, medical personnel and the services they provide.</p></speech>

The HIQA report clearly points out that much has been done in the last period.  As the Deputy knows, all eight of the recommendations will be fulfilled.  New management is in place in Portlaoise and a memorandum of understanding has been signed with the Coombe to establish the country's first managed clinical maternity network in the Dublin midlands hospitals group, which is important.  The quality and patient safety position in the hospital has been filled; risk management has been strengthened; on-site incident reporting has been introduced; 16 additional midwives are in place to reduce the ratio of midwives per baby born; and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders in delivery and posts in diabetics and ultrasonography.  The director of midwifery in place is seconded from the Coombe; a training and needs analysis was undertaken and a training plan has been developed with Athlone Institute of Technology; all midwifery staff have attended cardiotocography, CTG, training, which is important; guidelines are in place for oxytocin administration; and a programme of diagnosis and treatment for neonatal hip dysplasia has been implemented.  The national mandatory reporting of serious patient safety events is in place; an improved patient satisfaction survey completed in 2014 indicated that patients were much happier with the quality of the maternity services they receive in Portlaoise; the maternity service has developed a multidisciplinary communications guideline; and a mandatory multidisciplinary customer care workshop was provided.  The Deputy might comment on whether he agrees with the view that the Portlaoise emergency department should be closed at 8 p.m.  I do not agree.</p></speech>

The Minister will come before the House at 5 p.m. and will have no difficulty indicating his intention and that of his Department to follow through on the implementation of the eight recommendations made by HIQA in this very grave and serious report.  If, out of the tragedy of the loss of these five little babies, and outside analysis, our national, regional and local services are improved, it can be a good thing for everybody concerned.  We must have a system that puts patient care and needs at the centre, and not one that pays lip service to it.</p></speech>

I will return to the issue later.</p>  <p>  Now, I will deal with the refusal by the Irish banks to cut variable mortgage rates for struggling householders and to pass on the European Central Bank's reduction in interest rates.  On 30 April, the Taoiseach said it was unacceptable, and he has voiced similar sentiments for years.  However, yesterday, in a report to the Department of Finance, the Central Bank said it does not want powers to compel Irish banks to reduce variable mortgage interest rates.  The 300,000 mortgage holders will have received the news with utter dismay.  They know, and the Taoiseach knows, and we should be very clear about what is happening.  Although the ECB reduced its variable interest rates, the Irish banks have refused to pass the reduction on to households but are pocketing the money.  Irish mortgage holders are being ripped off by the banks while the Central Bank is refusing to protect them.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Taoiseach to take action on this.  The Taoiseach must take the opportunity to state very clearly and robustly that he rejects the Central Bank's recommendations.  He must make it very clear that he will ensure the Central Bank takes on these new powers.  Will the Taoiseach assert clearly that he will ensure that mortgage holders who have been denied the benefit of the ECB reductions will, finally, be afforded some relief?</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance has made it clear on many occasions that were the Central Bank to request him for legislative authority to deal with interest rates, he would so legislate.  Deputy Gerry Adams is aware that neither the Central Bank nor the Government dictates what variable interest rates should be.  The Minister is returning from Brussels today from a Eurogroup meeting.  The Deputy seems to be quoting from the report in question which I have not received yet.  It has been received in the Department of Finance and I expect the Minister will have an opportunity to go through it this evening.  Obviously, he has made his intention clear of engaging with the banks, following receipt of the report, on variable mortgage interest rates.  Everyone knows that variable rate mortgage holders have struggled and are struggling in a very unfair position where the banks have not passed on rates that were reduced for themselves.  I suggest to the Deputy that it would be only appropriate for the Minister to assess and analyse the report which he asked the Central Bank to provide for him.  We will have an opportunity to discuss the report here in due course.  It is for the Minister to make recommendations to the Government on what is the appropriate and best thing to do, taking into account that the Government has made it clear that we do not find it fair or acceptable that this situation is continuing.</p></speech>

He says he is unhappy.  That has been a consistent theme.  He said it was unacceptable and not fair.  However, he is not a commentator or spectator.  Hand-wringing by him or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has not worked.  Polite conversation has also not worked.  As the Minister might put it, some of the bank chief executive officers are allergic to fairness.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach needs to take firm and decisive action.  He knows what the problem is.  The State owns most of the banks.  Accordingly, what is required is necessary insolvency legislation to support struggling home owners and provide legal protection for the family home.  Citizens have been waiting for some time for the Government to introduce some proposals to deal with this crisis.  The stress and the anxiety visited on these families are very real.  Compare this with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s willingness to have all-night sittings and develop, under a Labour Party Minister, unprecedented new legislation which will allow the Government to pickpocket people&rsquo;s pensions, welfare benefits and salaries to pay its water taxes.  On the one hand, there is no problem with it bringing forward all of these measures when it comes to ordinary folks.  However, when it comes to the banks, the Taoiseach waffles, engages in rhetoric and does not act.</p></speech>

Young people are our greatest resource.  There is a need at parliamentary level to recognise and acknowledge their role in a modern society.</p><p>I also wish to acknowledge the magnificent work done on behalf of young people by the officers, local organisers and voluntary helpers.  Over the years, they have built up excellent services and structures in various formats throughout their communities.  They have provided such vital support for our youth over several generations.  </p> <p> Youth clubs are crucial for character development, well-being and social inclusiveness of young people.  For many years, however, they have been cash-strapped and run on a shoestring budget.  They have tried to run various programmes and activities during the recession with a consequent shortage of funding.  In addition, cuts to vital services in the educational system, such as the reduction of career guidance counsellors, mean that up to 200 second-level schools cannot provide one-to-one counselling as they did previously.  It was a reasonably good service up to some years ago, but that has now been removed.  This is one of the main reasons why 15,000 young people have dropped out of education and do not sit the leaving certificate examination.  This is happening annually.  The provision of career guidance in schools is inadequate and, in addition, up to 1,000 pupils are leaving the system once they complete their primary education.</p> <p> I am asking the Taoiseach to provide the necessary adequate funding in the forthcoming budget to enable youth organisations to further develop activity programmes as well as enhancing facilities for our growing young population.  Additional resources are also needed for the comprehensive provision of guidance counselling and learning supports for school pupils with special needs.</p></speech>

Corporation tax has been a cornerstone of foreign direct investment here, from whatever country, as well as issues including technology and the track record of our people.  By far the most important issue is the talent pool of young people coming through.  That is a combination coming out of the secondary system and engaging with business, institutes of technology or universities.  Firms and investors look at the range of talent of young Irish people who measure up to the highest standards.  I have seen evidence of this in talking to people about challenges in the software, pharma, robotics and electronic engineering sectors.  Young Irish people have introduced innovative changes that affect businesses in so many ways.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also referred to youth services, which are a matter for consideration by Ministers as they prepare for October's budget.  I recently met with representatives of For&oacute;ige and have seen the extraordinary work they have done over so many years.  It is true that there have been reductions in the allocation to youth organisations as part of the overall cutbacks that applied for a number of years due to the economic situation.  Clearly, these are cases that can and will be made in preparing for the budget in future.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned career guidance teachers.  As he knows, for some time secondary schools have been demanding greater independence in this regard.  The decision by the previous Minister for Education and Skills was made in light of that.  One must consider that the vast majority of people to be employed in the next ten years will be engaged by companies that have not yet been established and whose products have not been progressed beyond a concept.  The world ahead is changing rapidly.  Teachers now need to be more than just deliverers of information because all that information - perhaps too much of it - is available to young people anyway in multitudinous forms.  They must therefore decide and define what the priorities are and what is really important.</p></speech>

That announcement is normally made at this time of year, and she will make it shortly.  That is designed and put in place so that young people who need particular attention will continue to get it.  In addition, cases as yet undefined or which have not been brought to the attention of school authorities, will also have access to it.  That announcement will be made shortly.</p></speech>

This is helpful in attracting foreign direct investment.  There is another aspect, however.  It has recently been ascertained that 2,000 students drop out of secondary education after just two years, which is alarming.  It is something we will have to address.  One in five students in the 13 to 15 age group are disengaging from education, so there is a need for corrective action to halt this worrying trend.</p>  <p>  Germany and some other continental countries have a scheme to identify problems facing students in the first and second years of secondary education.  Such students can be diverted to training centres to undertake trade apprenticeships while continuing their school education part-time.  The system operates for students who cannot adapt to full-time academic pursuits.  In that way, at 18 years of age, they are trained and available for employers who are seeking such people for the job market.  It is a good example of where Ireland should also be going in order to remedy this situation, particularly as our youth unemployment is exceedingly high.  It is currently one of the highest Europe and has been for some time.</p>  <p>  I commend the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to the Department of Health with responsibility for drugs.  There is a need for a greater awareness of drug abuse across all age groups, but in particular for our youth.  Kerry Life Education is providing a mobile unit in the county to promote awareness of drug misuse.  The group's professional staff are doing Trojan work in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Kerry diocesan youth services have a mobile unit which visits all corners of the region.  It is essential to bring such technological facilities to remote areas.  The services provided by such mobile units could be replicated around the country.  I ask the Government to provide the necessary support to enable all these organisations to continue operating.</p><p>I hope the Cabinet, specifically the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, will approve the necessary funding in the budget.</p></speech>

There are 81 questions of this type placed by Deputies today which were received on a weekly basis since that time and they have gathered on the Order Paper.  I delivered pre-Council and post-Council statements on the December 2014 European Council on 17 December and 27 January 2015, respectively, and pre-Council and post-Council statements on the March 2015 European Council on 11 March and 24 March, respectively.  It has not previously been the case that Deputies have had the opportunity to comment both before and after European Council meetings.  I have dealt with many of the issues raised in the questions today.  However, I am, of course, happy to go over this ground again with Deputies with respect to the questions they wish to ask today.</p>  <p>  I attended the European Council meeting on 19 December 2014 and reported to the House on it in my statement on 27 January.  The December European Council did not discuss or adopt conclusions on the Ebola crisis, Palestine, Syria or Egypt, or with regard to refugees from Africa and the Middle East.  There was no discussion about extreme right-wing racist groups or the growth of so-called anti-austerity parties in the European Union either in December or at other recent meetings of the European Council.  I attended the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government on 12 February.  The main issues were counter-terrorism, the situation in Ukraine and strengthening Economic and Monetary Union.  I had no formal bilateral meetings on the margins of that meeting; however, I did have an opportunity to engage in informal discussions with a number of colleagues, including the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, who at the time had just recently entered office.  Proposed military action by the United States against ISIS was not discussed at the February meeting.</p>  <p>  I attended the European Council on 19 and 20 March and reported to the House on the outcomes of that meeting in my statement on 24 March.  There were no discussions on the situation in Syria or about Israel and Palestine.  The agenda for the March meeting was prepared in the normal way.  President Tusk circulated an annotated draft agenda and draft conclusions which were then considered by COREPER and the General Affairs Council which was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  Ireland's views were contributed at each stage of the process.  I had no formal bilateral meetings at the March European Council, but I did, of course, see and speak to many of my counterpart leaders at the meeting.  There was an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 23 April which was convened to address the migration crisis in the Mediterranean, which is still of great concern to everybody.  The European Central Bank interest rate was not discussed at the meeting because it was not called for that purpose.</p>  <p>  I will respond to questions about specific thematic areas which were recently addressed by the European Council.  I did not meet specifically Italian Prime Minister Renzi about the recent tragic incidents in the Mediterranean.  However, the Prime Minister and I both attended the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 23 April.  I contributed to that meeting, as would be normal.  The scale of the recent tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean is appalling and shocking and underlines the importance of the European Union acting urgently and as one to address this complex ongoing crisis.  As we are in the House, people are walking from areas of strife and war, heading for borders in the hope they can make their way from Libya across the Mediterranean.  Foreign Ministers met together with Justice and Home Affairs Ministers before the extraordinary European Council and welcomed a ten point plan by the European Commission as the basis for further work in addressing the irregular flow of migration which has such serious consequences for many.  Tomorrow the Commission will publish its European agenda on migration which will propose a comprehensive approach to migration issues, including those highlighted by the European Council.</p>  <p>  At the extraordinary European Council I was pleased to be in a position to indicate that Ireland would contribute a naval vessel and crew to take part in humanitarian efforts, subject, of course, to the mandate and other legal issues being clarified.  This morning the Cabinet agreed to a memo from the Minister for Defence to approve this contribution.</p><p>The ship and its crew will make their way towards the Mediterranean in accordance with conditions and the understandings arrived at with our European colleagues.  I also indicated at the meeting that we had approved additional funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Relief and Works Agency.  That brings our total funding to those affected by the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million, which is a considerable allocation from a country of Ireland's size.  The issue of migration was also discussed in the context of the Libyan crisis at the March European Council.</p> <p> I was asked a question on the Juncker investment plan.  The December European Council, on which I reported, gave strong political backing to the investment plan put forward by Commission President Juncker and agreed that a European fund for strategic investments, or EFSI, should be established.  I am pleased to report that there has since been strong progress in establishing the EFSI.  Finance Ministers have agreed a general approach on the draft regulation and negotiations with the European Parliament are under way.  The March European Council reinforced its expectation that there will be political agreement on this by June.  I was also asked about the co-ordination of economic policy.  The December European Council reiterated the need for closer co-ordination of economic policies to ensure a smooth functioning of economic and monetary union.  It was agreed that the presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup, working together with the member states, will progress work in this area with a view to reporting to the European Council meeting in June.  The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in February also considered this issue on the basis of an analytical note presented by Commission President Juncker.  A further two follow-up meetings to discuss preparations for the June European Council have been held at senior official level and another meeting will take place later this month.</p> <p> On tax, I note that the European Council in December reiterated the urgent need to advance efforts in the fight against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning at both the EU and wider global level.  It also looked forward to the Commission's proposal on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings in the EU.  The European Commission has since published its tax transparency package, which includes a legislative proposal on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings.  Ireland supports the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities as an important tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its implementation at EU and global level.  Tax harmonisation was not discussed at the December European Council.  Ireland strongly opposes the harmonisation of tax rates as it would reduce the flexibility of member states, particularly smaller member states, to deploy taxation policy in support of broader economic policies.</p> <p> On the questions on energy, ensuring that Europe's citizens and businesses have a reliable, secure, affordable and sustainable supply of energy is one of the five priority strands of the strategic agenda agreed by the European Council in June last year.  The European Council in March discussed a number of concrete and measurable steps to deliver energy union and to ensure affordable, sustainable and secure energy for all member states.  The discussions focused on two key matters; enhancing energy security, and reaping the benefits of the internal energy market.  Diversifying the routes and sources of our energy and putting in place appropriate infrastructure to support that diversification are critical for Ireland.  At my instigation, a specific reference to peripheral regions was included in the section of the European Council conclusions dealing with infrastructure and interconnection in respect of energy.  With regard to implementing the energy union framework, the Commission is in the process of establishing a governance system in consultation with member states and will produce a state of the energy union report at the end of this year.</p> <p> The December European Council called on the EU and USA to make all efforts to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, by the end of 2015.  Since then, there have been two rounds of talks with the USA and a further negotiating round will take place before the summer.  Discussions on a number of areas are continuing and the basic architecture of the agreement is emerging.  During my visit to the USA for St. Patrick's Day, I reaffirmed to both President Obama and US trade representative, Mike Froman, Ireland's commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial and ambitious agreement.  I briefed my counterparts at the March European Council on these discussions on TTIP with US interlocutors.  The European Council discussed the state of play in the negotiations and agreed that the EU and the USA should make every effort to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement by the end of the year.  The fear is that if the agreement is not concluded this year, it will be difficult to get a conclusion given the movement towards the American primaries and subsequent presidential election.  It was also agreed that member states and the Commission should step up efforts to communicate the benefits of the agreement and enhance dialogue with civil society.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m took part in a well attended seminar on TTIP in Dublin Castle on 27 March where an authoritative economic analysis of the very positive likely impact of an agreement on Ireland was launched.</p> <p> I was asked about retrospective capitalisation.  The possible use of the European Stability Mechanism for bank recapitalisation has not been raised at recent European Council meetings or in my contacts with ECB President Mario Draghi.  While direct recapitalisation by the ESM remains an option, I reiterate that it is no longer the only, or necessarily the best, option open to Ireland.</p></reply>

I regularly discuss Ireland's economic situation with European Council counterparts and I had the opportunity at the March European Council to outline our progress to date.  We have not discussed the Irish bank guarantee in recent contacts.</p>  <p>  In regard to Greece and Greek debt, I note the meeting yesterday on this.  I wrote to Alexis Tsipras in January to congratulate him on his election as Prime Minister of Greece and to wish him and his Government well.  I had a short informal discussion with Prime Minister Tsipras in the margins of the February meeting of Heads of State and Government and again in the margins of the March European Council.  As well as congratulating him again on his election, I indicated that I would be happy to welcome him to Ireland and to have further discussions about how we worked through and successfully emerged from our EU-IMF programme.  The December European Council did not consider the question of a possible change of government in Greece or issues relating to the Greek debt situation.  The informal meeting of the European Council in February received an update from the Eurogroup President on negotiations in relation to the Greek programme.  While the situation in Greece was not on the agenda of the March European Council, Prime Minister Tsipras met informally with the Presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup and the leaders of Germany and France to discuss how to make progress in the discussions on Greece's economic and financial situation.  All parties expressed full adherence to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with other euro area member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  That is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government, which was elected by the people, while also respecting existing commitments.  Intensive negotiations on the Greek programme have been taking place in the Eurogroup and it is in all our interests that Greece remains in the euro area.  All members of the euro area, including Greece, have obligations and that is why all the parties signed up to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February, including the comprehensive list of reforms.  Progress in the discussions has been slow, however, and needs to be accelerated.</p><p>As a consequence, the situation of Greece's finances is very challenging, with immediate financing needs to be addressed now.  Therefore, urgent agreement of the necessary structural reforms is imperative to conclude the fifth review and release the associated disbursement.  As the House is aware, repayments are due in the very near future - this week in fact.  The Greek authorities are currently working with the institutions on the list of reforms.  Greece has committed to making its repayments.  Ireland does not support a writedown or cancellation of Greek debt.  There is, of course, room for manoeuvre in terms of maturity extension and other ways to reduce the burden of debt, which we have done in Ireland, in co-operation with our European partners.</p> <p> The situation in Ukraine and EU relations with Russia were discussed at the December European Council and the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in February and again at the March European Council meeting.  The February meeting took place on the same day that agreement was reached in Minsk on a package of measures leading to the current ceasefire.  I joined with my counterparts in the European Council in welcoming this development and recognising the central role played by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande.  People will have seen the statement from Chancellor Merkel at the recent press conference with President Putin.  Heads of State and Government also confirmed that decisions already taken on sanctions would remain in place.  At the March European Council, we agreed that the Minsk agreement remains the best prospect for the long-term resolution of the conflict in the region.  We decided that the sanctions against Russia should be clearly linked to the full implementation of the agreements and that we would keep this under close review over the coming months.  We will return to the issue at next month's meeting.  Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande set out their positions in their contributions to the meeting of the European Council.  I did not discuss the situation in Ukraine with either leader bilaterally.</p> <p> While Syria has not been on the agenda of recent European Council meetings, the March Foreign Affairs Council adopted a comprehensive regional strategy on Syria, Iraq and ISIS.  This sets out the EU's political and humanitarian strategy to address the impact of this conflict and to support conditions for a political framework to end it.</p> <p> In the margins of the December European Council and during a subsequent telephone conversation, I raised the issue of ECB support to the banking inquiry with ECB President Mario Draghi.  I also discussed the issue with former ECB President Jean Claude Trichet.  Mr. Draghi subsequently outlined the position of the ECB on his participation in the banking inquiry, which he also set out in a letter to Mr. Matt Carthy MEP in January.  He stated that owing to the ECB's accountability to the European institutions and primarily to the European Parliament, the ECB is not in a position to participate in formal inquiries conducted by national parliaments.  However, Mr. Draghi also confirmed that the ECB stood ready, in liaison with the Irish Parliament, to determine how best to interact on an informal basis, outside the context of the banking inquiry, as has been done with other national parliaments in the past.</p> <p> I was happy following the discussion with Mr. Trichet and, as the House is now aware, Mr. Trichet subsequently accepted an invitation to participate in an event in Dublin organised by the Institute for International and European Affairs, which took place in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham on Thursday, 30 April.  Following a presentation, Mr. Trichet responded to a range of questions posed by members of the banking inquiry committee.</p> <p> I am sorry for the lengthy reply, but there were all of these questions which had backed up, some of which we have reported on both before and after European Council meetings since December. </p></speech>

N&iacute;l ciall ar bith ann leis seo.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht inniu maidir le ceisteanna a chur m&eacute; c&uacute;ig mh&iacute; &oacute; shin.  There needs to be a review of how Questions to the Taoiseach is structured.  This is not the first time this issue has been raised.  I have 20 questions.  Some of them concern events which occurred five months ago.  Things have changed in the meantime and the questions are no longer topical or current.  It is clear that I will not get through the 20 questions which I tabled.  I also had supplementary questions to all of them.  I would like to speak, if I can, and I will be brief as I can, on a number of the questions.</p>  <p>  Of huge importance is the Taoiseach's acknowledgment for the first time, to my knowledge, in this Chamber that the issue of bank recapitalisation has not been raised by the Taoiseach or his Government.  That is shocking news.  If the Taoiseach recalls June 2012, it was claimed that a deal hammered out at an EU Council meeting would allow banks to be bailed out directly using the European Stability Mechanism.  It was also claimed that the same measure could be applied retrospectively to this State.  The then T&aacute;naiste said on "Morning Ireland" that this news "changes the game for us as far as bank debt is concerned" and that the method of breaking that link can now be applied to Ireland.  The Taoiseach described the decision as a "seismic shift" in European policy.  I repeat, a seismic shift in European policy.</p>  <p>  Almost three years later, there has been no retrospective bank recapitalisation.  We know from correspondence received last August by Mr. Matt Carthy MEP from the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism that it was unlikely that the direct recapitalisation instrument would be used.  Critically, he said that any decision would relate to the circumstances in the requesting ESM member, which does not even arise, as we have made no request.  The issue has, therefore, not even been considered because to avail of this seismic shift and to avail of this game changer our Government would need to make the request.  Today we are told that this has not happened.</p>  <p>  We accuse the Taoiseach, at different times, of being compliant, rolling over and accepting the position.  The citizens of this State, who make up less than 1% of the EU population, have been burdened with 43% of the cost of the European banking crisis.  Citizens will be loaded for generations.  When none of us is even a memory, people will still be paying back this legacy of bad decisions made by EU bodies, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il led Government and the Taoiseach's Government.  Is ceist shimpl&iacute; at&aacute; agam.  Is it not true that we have now got clarity from the Taoiseach that he never applied for a retrospective bank recapitalisation and that he never had any intention of doing so?  This was all spin.  This was all soundbites and an attempt to influence public opinion.  Will the Taoiseach face up to that fact today and will he apologise, not least to his own electorate, the Labour Party electorate, the Fine Gael electorate and those people who voted for him, for misleading them on this matter?</p>  <p>  I will rest it there but I would like to think I will get to speak on the other two questions which are of huge importance.  These questions concern the Palestinian state and the dreadful plight of the refugees who are drowning daily in the Mediterranean Sea.</p></speech>

As I said, this Government did not put a cent into Anglo Irish Bank - &euro;34 billion gone down the tubes, gone, lost to the taxpayer, to the next generation.  This Government has put in restructuring of &euro;30 billion.  We expect to get all of that back.</p>  <p>  There are two options to be considered here.  One is the decision of June of 2012, when the European Council agreed with my proposition that there should be a capacity and a facility for direct recapitalisation for countries like Ireland that were unfortunately first out of that gap.  The banking inquiry is doing its business at the moment in regard to other matters around that.  That position stands.  That decision still stands and has not been changed or altered in any way.  In fact, to use a phrase of the Deputy's own, I might say: "It hasn't gone away, you know."  It is still there.  So, the question for the Government, Deputy Adams, is what is the best thing to do here in the interests of the Irish taxpayer.  The &euro;34 billion squandered by the previous Administration is dead, gone, washed away.  So, on behalf of the taxpayer in restructuring the banks - not for the banks' comfort, but for their customers' futures - that money was invested.  We expect to get all of that money back.</p>  <p>  So, what is the best thing to do?  We have put money into Bank of Ireland.  We have got back in excess of what was put in and we still own, on behalf of the people, a proportion of that bank.  The same applies in respect of the ownership of the vast majority of Allied Irish Banks.  The PTSB had its valuation at about &euro;2 billion recently.  The Minister for Finance is very clear that the Irish taxpayer will be able to recover all of that money, and possibly more, in the time ahead, so the question for the Government is what is the best option to choose here.  Is it to go the route of recapitalisation, which was made by the European Council on my proposition back in June of 2012, or is it to see what the valuations of the banks are and how those might be progressed in the interests of the Irish taxpayer?  So, instead of having one option, we now have two.</p></speech>

We had some response in respect of moneys invested in Bank of Ireland.  We now have PTSB being valued at approximately &euro;2 billion, and the Minister has made it clear that he intends to have a determination on a proportionate value of a section of Allied Irish Banks to see what that might be.  So, we are not in a position just yet to make a decision as to which one is in the best interests of the taxpayer.  The Government's only priority here is to pursue this to a point so that we can determine which is in the best interests of the taxpayer.  Is it the route of recapitalisation or is it the route of getting the return on the people's money by virtue of moving on the banks?  Work is proceeding on that element, with the Minister for Finance being very confident that, in respect of the Irish taxpayer, we will get back all of the money invested by this Government.  Unfortunately, what happened before is dead and gone and washed away.</p></speech>

It must be addressed.  These questions relate to Europe and I take the point about European statements, post and pre, but a backlog in questions to the Taoiseach is constantly building.  More time needs to be allowed for them and we should be allowed to asked topical questions to avoid a backlog building.  If the Taoiseach is committed to the democratic and political reform about which the Government promised so much, he should take this point on board.</p>  <p>  Is it not the case that Europe and European leaders are sleepwalking towards the possible break-up of the EU?  If that happens, responsibility will lie entirely with the EU's leaders and authorities, given their blind commitment to a failed and, in the case of Greece, vindictive policy of inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable and least well-off sectors of society.  The belligerence of the EU in wanting to continue inflicting these discredited policies on the Greek people, to the point of millions of ordinary Greeks experiencing extraordinary suffering, and the failure of the policy being self-evident mean that we are at the brink of the dominos within the EU falling.  Despite this, there is an utter complacency, behind which seems to be what cannot be described as anything other than a politically motivated vindictiveness towards any group of people who refuse, even in the smallest way, to accept crushing austerity.</p>  <p>  The issue that has brought us to the brink is the EU's determination to have Greece cut pensions, make it easier to fire workers and refuse to rehire workers into a public sector that has been slashed to pieces.  These are the points of conflict in doing a deal, with the EU saying "No, no, no" to a country that has been savaged, where the levels of suicide and poverty have gone through the roof and homelessness and despair are at extraordinary levels.  The EU says that, on top of this, Greece must cut pensions and under no circumstances restore jobs in the public sector.  This is appalling and has brought us to the brink.</p>  <p>  Is it not time for the Taoiseach to raise his voice against the madness of the central institutions and European leaders being singlehandedly responsible for beginning the break-up of the EU?</p><p>The other worrying feature, evident in Greece and now in Britain, is that different forms of disillusionment with and alienation from the centralised, autocratic and failed economic policies of the European Union are now leading to a very worrying rise in racism across Europe.  If in Greece the Syriza Government fails and is driven out and if there is a further economic collapse there, the beneficiary will be Golden Dawn.  That is not a pretty prospect.  In Britain, the beneficiary, to some extent at least, has been the vile UK Independence Party, UKIP.  I am glad it did not win as many seats as it had hoped.  These are people who have traded on racism and anti-immigrant sentiment.  Prime Minister Cameron, in order to try to see off the threat of UKIP, has moved in the direction of that sort of anti-immigrant rhetoric.  That is dangerous.  It is dangerously reminiscent of what happened in the 1930s and 1940s when economic crisis led to the rise of racism and xenophobia, with disastrous consequences.  Is the Taoiseach not worried that the policy failures in the European Union and the blind commitment to austerity could possibly break up the Union and lead to a worrying rise in racism?</p> <p> Mr. Ibrahim Halawa's sisters are in the Visitors Gallery.  I believe Deputy Paul Murphy has brought them in today.  As they are here, I wish to ask the Taoiseach, as I am sure will Deputy Murphy, what he is doing to secure the release of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen who is being tortured in Egyptian prisons and who has been framed, essentially in a politically trumped-up case against him, for doing nothing more than engaging in peaceful protest against what is a brutal and despotic regime, led by President el-Sisi.</p> <p> Films have been made about the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and Irish citizens who languished in prison in Britain having been framed for political purposes although they committed no crimes.  Since we are all appalled that this would have been done to our citizens in the past, why are we, including the Taoiseach, not much more vocal and robust in demanding the release of Ibrahim Halawa and the lifting of the charges, which are clearly trumped up?  Mr. Halawa, along with hundreds of ordinary Egyptians, has been framed by a despotic, nasty government that is now in power in Egypt.  What is the Taoiseach doing about this?</p></speech>

I have already said I am happy to take Priority Questions from Members if they want to submit them on a weekly basis and deal with others afterwards.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the break-up of the European Union.  Clearly, this is a matter of very serious concern to leaders.  Prime Minister Tsipras has said that Greece does not want to leave the euro group and will not default on its responsibilities.  Given his statements in this regard, it is clear that the Government of Greece is now working with the institutions - I saw Mr. Dijsselbloem's comments yesterday - to arrive at a position where Greece can continue to be a valued member of the euro group and European Union and find a way of moving out of the very severe difficulties it faces.  I have mentioned the extension of maturity dates and a variety of other developments that could make it possible for it to do that.</p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting, in the presence of the Greek Prime Minister, there was very strong support for the view that every facility should be given to Greece to allow it to make its way.  The Deputy should remember that other taxpayers would be very heavily exposed if there were to be a write-down of Greek debt, as the Deputy is very well aware.  That is very clear from comments made by other leaders.  There is exceptional exposure, and I am not talking about Germany in this case.  In that sense, given the conviction and determination by Prime Minister Tsipras for Greece to succeed and play its part, I hope, based on the discussions that took place yesterday, arising from which there was a statement from the group last evening, that progress has been made.  The position is still very fragile and I hope an accommodation can be reached whereby Greece can continue to find a way to accept its responsibilities and play its part.  Every one of the other 27 states, whether in the euro group or eurozone or not, wants this to happen.  I have no doubt about the effect of the detailed discussions taking place at the official meetings.  I note that some changes have been made by the Greek Prime Minister himself and his negotiating team.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the decision of the British people was not foreseen by political commentators, pollsters or those who know all the answers before they are decided.  The people made their decision.  For the first time in many years, they elected a Conservative Government with a majority vote.  I am sure there will be considerable analysis by pundits as to why people voted as they did.  I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron at the weekend and congratulated him on winning his election.  He had made a strong case at the European Council on many occasions regarding the unprecedented numbers of jobs created, the unprecedented scale of the opportunity for people in Britain to have a job of sustainable stature and make their way forward.  However, both the Prime Minister and I, in addition to all the other leaders, are very clear that freedom of movement is one of the central pillars or tenets of the European Union.  That has always been the way and it will continue.</p>  <p>  With regard to discussions that Prime Minister Cameron will have with President Junker, who has welcomed his re-election and who has said he will engage constructively with him, there is a very clear understanding from the European leaders of the importance of holding this Union together and reorganising it in a way that makes for efficiency of business, a true Singe Market, a single energy market and all of those other factors that have been the subject of discussion for a very long time but in respect of which a conclusion has not been reached in many cases.  Many, although not all, of the recommendations for improved efficiency, the elimination of red tape and more effective administration put forward by Prime Minister Cameron have strong support around the table.  To make this happen is the issue.  Freedom of movement is one of the central pillars and will remain so.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about progress in respect of the Halawa case.  The objectives in this case are very clear.  The first is to see Mr. Halawa released by the Egyptian authorities so he can return to his family and studies here in Ireland.  The second is to provide consular support to secure his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action undertaken consistently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and his officials in this case have been such as to further those two objectives and, more important, avoid any action that could be counter-productive or detrimental to Mr. Halawa&rsquo;s best interests.  Having spoken to the Minister on many occasions about this, I fully support that approach.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government when citizens are imprisoned abroad.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country and is imprisoned in that country, it is the foreign law that applies and the relevant foreign court that decides on matters, such as bail and release.</p><p>The decision to release Mr. Halawa either on bail or any other basis will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities.  Since he was detained originally in August 2013 he has received consular visits on 37 occasions.  I can confirm that the Government has formally supported both the application of his lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November presidential decree and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Unfortunately, the application for his release on bail was rejected at the most recent hearing of his case.  Our officials support for his release has been duly committed to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.  The Minister has had continuous personal contract with his Egyptian counterpart.  </p> <p> The trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 3 June.  All of the information we have received indicates that it is highly unlikely there will be any decision on Mr. Halawa's release until the court makes its decisions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to review the approach and actions in this case and the Government is guided, at all times, by the two central objectives set out.  Given that the trial has commenced, we have to exercise restraint in our public comment, as I do now.  This is entirely consistent with our approach to other consular cases, in line with our objective in this case and what we firmly believe to be in Mr. Halawa's best interests as a young man and what is most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him.  All actions taken in the case are considered in the light of the objectives I have mentioned.  At this stage, while there is a specific application for Mr. Halawa's release on bail being considered by the judge, any inappropriate escalation of political intervention could well be counterproductive in pursuing our objectives in the case and Mr. Halawa's best interests in the achievement of a positive outcome.  We keep matters under review at all times.  It should also be noted that in none of the other cases involving foreign nationals was any individual released either on bail or otherwise while the original trial was being conducted.  We might bear this in mind.  </p> <p> I am happy with the approach the Minister is taking and the continuous actions both he and his officials are taking in Dublin and Cairo.  I can confirm for the House that no other consular case is receiving greater attention in the Department at this time.</p></speech>

I agree with other Deputies who have poured scorn on the quality and integrity of the judicial system that it operates.  We know this from even a cursory look at what has been going on in terms of the trial of opponents of the regime and so on.  This is a young Irish man and the length of time he has been left there is intolerable.  Direct political contact in the form of a direct visit could yield some results.  I make this suggestion to be constructive.</p>  <p>  I was struck by the Taoiseach's comments on recapitalisation because one gets the sense that we were told a load of lies for quite some time, although I am not making that accusation.  I recall that in 2012 - I remember it well - we and the nation were told that there had been a major breakthrough and it was not about the separation of bank and sovereign debt alone.  It was Mario Monti, the then Italian Prime Minister, who drove the deal at the time; it had nothing to do with the Taoiseach.  In fact, the then T&aacute;naiste had left the meeting, but on hearing something had happened went on "Morning Ireland" to say breathlessly that we had achieved a great breakthrough - "a seismic shift" was the phrase used, with game changer.  The phrase "retrospective recapitalisation" was also used.  The Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin said we could expect billions in return.  They said this giddily at a press conference at the time and I think the figure of &euro;6 billion might have been mentioned.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he could not talk about how much specifically was involved and mentioned some fair he had experience of going to and that one never revealed one's hand.  It has now been truly revealed because it has been revealed that we did not ask for anything.  We never asked for retrospective recapitalisation.</p>  <p>  I will give the Government credit for spin, camouflage and rewriting the narrative as if what went before never happened and was a dream we all had.  However, the reality is that selling the banks was an option in 2012.  Selling AIB and our shares in the Bank of Ireland was always an option by definition.  The Taoiseach knew this, as did the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The Taoiseach knew this when he called the decision in 2012 by the European Council a game changer and a seismic shift.  The likelihood was that in time, as the banks recovered, these two banks would wipe their faces.  However, the Taoiseach chose to take a political route and say this was fantastic, that it was a new world and that there would be retrospective recapitalisation, but we never asked for it.  The new story of the Government is that it did recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland, but the reality is that the Government honoured up to &euro;20 billion of both unsecured and unguaranteed bonds.  There was the famous episode when Mr.Trichet said to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, that a bomb would go off, not in Brussels but in Dublin if he were to proceed to burn the bondholders.  Essentially, the Taoiseach made political claims in 2012 which were untrue, so much so that he never pursued them.  I have been asking about this for two and a half years and all I get is mumbo jumbo.  The Taoiseach confirmed in the past two to three months that he never asked for direct or retrospective recapitalisation and he is not asking for it now either.  That is the level of dishonesty and untruth at which he has come at this issue.</p>  <p>  I was struck by the Taoiseach's comment that he had spoken to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, and explained to him how we had come through our recovery.  The conversation probably went a little like this-----</p></speech>

It was said we did not bother with any of that stuff, that we had just gone ahead and did what we had to do.

They had to be protected.  That is a net figure for retail and corporate deposits out of the overall amount of &euro;373 billion that was guaranteed.</p>  <p>  The fundamentals of "no bank must fail" and "no bondholders must be burned" were European policy positions.  The Taoiseach says that sovereign and bank debt were separated in 2012 but they were not.  The ESM fund is nowhere near sufficient to deal with any similar bank crisis if it happened in the next ten years.  It is the best that could be achieved through compromise and negotiation but it is at negligible levels in terms of what would be required if there was a systemic financial and banking collapse of the kind we experienced across Europe five to six years ago.  It is not at all clear that, if in the morning a similar collapse happened at European level, the sovereign would not be called upon again, if the truth be told.  That is borne out by the disappointing figures for the funds that have been provided through the ESM and has been acknowledged by most commentators.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must acknowledge that what he and the then T&aacute;naiste said in 2012 was not the truth.  There was no game-changer or seismic shift in terms of what was to happen to Ireland's debt position and getting retrospective recapitalisation.  The IMF, a former participant in those negotiations, is now saying that the position of Europe and of the ECB with regard to Ireland was not fair and that Ireland is entitled to some recapitalisation.  A number of key individuals who were involved at that time are now making that point.  I would not take too much credit for my intervention having brought Mr. Trichet to the Irish Institute of European Affairs.  That was not the Banking Inquiry.  The idea that parliamentarians would go along, sit in the audience and ask a few questions and be nice boys and girls was farcical in many respects.  Mr. Trichet should have appeared before the inquiry.  Just because he sees the European Parliament as the body to which he is accountable is no reason for him - or even Mr. Draghi - not coming before a sworn inquiry to answer fundamental questions about the eurozone system, how it works and its future, in terms of what went wrong at a regulatory and supervisory level as well as the whole idea of banking union.  We are a long way away from any development or achievements on those issues.</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseah indicate whether the human rights situation in Egypt has been discussed at European Council since December 2014?  Have the mass trials that are ongoing been discussed?  A few weeks ago people were sentenced to death for participating in a protest and last week numerous others were sentenced to ten years in prison at mass trials.  In that context, does the Taoiseach not agree that now is the time to personally intervene?  That is what Mr. Halawa's family has been asking for.  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Egyptian Minister for the Interior last week and asked if Ibrahim could be moved to another prison, which has not happened yet.  The examples of the release of the Australian citizen, Peter Greste and the Canadian citizen Mohamed Fahmy point to the highest level of political intervention being necessary to achieve the release of citizens.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that now is the time to intervene directly with President el-Sisi and to demand the release of Ibrahim Halawa?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200028#AA00800"><p>I will try to be brief and will start by responding to the last question raised by Deputy Murphy.  Ireland has made clear on a number of occasions our continued concerns about the human rights situation in Egypt in general.  We intervened at the UN Human Rights Council to express these concerns in September 2014, indicating our continued concerns over arbitrary detention, selective justice and respect for the rule of law, impunity in cases of civilian deaths at the hands of the security forces, sexual abuse and violence against prisoners as well as proposed new measures to restrict the freedom of civil society.  Many of these issues were also raised in the separate EU statement delivered during the same debate.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has raised our concerns directly with his Egyptian counterpart Mr. Shoukry, stressing the importance that we attach to upholding basic rights like freedom of expression and the rights of a free press.  He also set out in numerous statements the Government's strong concerns in respect of the case of Ibrahim Halawa, including on Monday, 27 April 2015.  There have been calls for me to intervene in this case directly.  I keep in very close contact with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan about the matter and am very conscious of the need not to escalate this in the wrong way.  People have referred to the interventions of the Australian and Canadian Prime Ministers leading to the release of their citizens but we must be very careful about making comparisons with other cases which are based on very different facts.  Irrespective of any action taken by the Australian Prime Minister or the Canadian Government, none of the al-Jazeera journalists were released while their cases were still pending before the Egyptian courts.  They had all been sentenced before their release.  </p>  <p>  References have been made to moving Ibrahim Halawa from the current area of the prison in which he is being kept.  Ensuring Ibrahim Halawa's welfare while in detention is clearly an issue of concern to us here.  The Irish embassy in Cairo is in very regular contact with the Egyptian authorities and as I said already, there have been 37 visits to Ibrahim.  At a recent meeting between the Minister, Deputy Flanagan and Mr. Shoukry the latter emphasised that the matter was currently before the Egyptian courts.  He said that he is conscious of the Irish Government's concerns over Ibrahim Halawa's welfare and the conditions of his ongoing detention and undertook to pursue directly the Irish Government's concerns with the appropriate Egyptian authorities.  Both Ministers agreed that this should continue.  </p>  <p>  In respect of Mr. Halawa's bail application, all bail applications were refused and a decision was taken that all defendants would remain in custody until the end of the trial.  It is important for the House to know that according to information recently received by the embassy from Ibrahim Halawa's legal team, not all of the defendants are facing identical charges as was originally believed to be the case and which was a key cause of concern.  It now appears that there are different charges against different defendants within the group trial and that Ibrahim Halawa is one of a relatively large group of defendants facing more preliminary charges related to events at the al-Fatah mosque, namely, presence inside the mosque at the time of arrest; refusal to leave the mosque when requested to do so and when offered safe passage by military police; travelling from a different part of the city with the intention of getting involved in a protest; and assisting in locking and barricading the mosque from the inside, according to photograph and video evidence.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister are seeking clarification of the exact charges against Ibrahim and examining what this change may mean.  In the meantime, and on the face of it, the new information would seem to be a somewhat positive development.  This is being very carefully monitored by the Minister.</p>  <p>  I will now respond to Deputy Martin's final comments about direct recapitalisation.</p><p>Deputy Martin makes the point that one gets the sense of this being a major breakthrough.  I was at the meeting until 5 a.m. and eventually there was no objection to the decision taken by the European Council with Ireland named specifically in there.  That decision still stands and that option still remains open for the Government to pursue.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is very confident that we will get back all that was invested and more.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should believe me that I am not here to look for any credit for calling up Mr. Jean Claude Trichet.  I met the man many times at European Council meetings.  I rang Mr. Mario Draghi and told him there is a banking inquiry here in Ireland, a formal operation.  He said that their legal position was that they had to respond to the European Parliament.  He had Mr. Trichet call me.  He was very forthcoming in wanting to assist but could not do it as part of a formal engagement.  Obviously the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis made its direct contact and put together an opportunity for members of the committee to ask the very same questions they would ask in a sworn inquiry.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should believe me that I do not look for any credit in this at all.</p></speech>

It is a fantasy read and an incredible fairy-tale.  I have asked questions over a period of about two years on many aspects of it.  I have received long letters back essentially stating that 90% of this will never be implemented.  This culminated a month ago in the Taoiseach advising me during Leaders' Questions that universal health insurance legislation would never be introduced during the lifetime of this Government and that it may now be implemented at the end of the term of the next Government.  I believe he mentioned 2021 or something, which shows incredible arrogance.  People should read the document to get a sense of what was going on four and a half years ago and the things the Government was going to do.</p><p>The more serious element of it is that on the issue of patient safety not only was no effort ever made to establish a patient safety authority, but we now know courtesy of the HIQA report and e-mails I read out earlier that in December 2012 and right up to the present time there were numerous sad and serious cases across every site within our hospital network as articulated by the chair of the national incident management team and the director of care.  People at a very senior level knew this.</p><p>In 2011 when the Oireachtas committee was told that Portlaoise was to be a model 3 hospital, which has a meaning in terms of the resources that should follow that, and 24/7 cover in surgery, surgical services and all of that, a political statement was made but clearly from the HIQA report we now know that there was no follow up in that regard.</p><p>The bottom line is that the one area that seems to have been neglected over the past four years and on which there has been no development or progress is the issue of risk assessment, the issue of safety and patient safety at the core.  If it were not for parents of children who needlessly lost their lives, we would not know any of this and we would not know the conclusions HIQA reached.  We would never have had that HIQA report.</p><p>In light of the HIQA report has the Government any plans to introduce a patient safety authority of the kind that was mooted four and a half years ago in the programme for Government or is that something it has shelved for eternity and is not now disposed to introduce?</p></speech>

As I said in response to the Deputy's earlier question, disciplinary measures are available to deal with incidents involving doctors and nurses, but not in respect of management.  This is the first time that a completely independent report has laid responsibility for these failures, tragic as they were, on management.</p>  <p>  The report makes eight recommendations, four for the Department and four more for the HSE.  The report's first recommendation, as the Deputy is aware, is the establishment of an independent patient advocacy service to be truly independent of the HSE.  The Minister has accepted all these recommendations and is now setting out to provide the recommendation of the HIQA report which is for a patient advocacy service completely independent of the HSE to be in position by May 2016.  That is the recommendation of the body that is the authority here in respect of unannounced inspections and setting the standards.  I accept the report; the Government accepts the report.</p>  <p>  In respect of this service, the first recommendation is that it be completely independent of the HSE and the Minister will go with that.</p></speech>

In February the Minister for Health said he planned to introduce new legislation to give more power to HIQA and to do this by amending the Health Act 2007.</p><p>HIQA's latest report underlines the urgency of the new legislation promised by the Minister.  The report into the unnecessary death of babies in Portlaoise hospital, which the HSE strenuously sought to suppress, makes for grim and depressing reading.  It is another damning investigation of our health service which reveals repeated failures and non-compliance in national health care standards by the hospital in question and the HSE.  This represents a failure on the part of the Government.  The big responsibility may rest with the HSE but the Government failed to take account of HIQA recommendations in a series of reports, as well as in questions I put to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health regarding a letter I received from HIQA.  The Minister rightly indicated that he intends to grant additional powers to HIQA by amending the health Acts.  When will the Government publish legislation to meet the Minister's commitment to extend the remit of HIQA and when will it put in place a legislative mechanism - this is the big problem - to implement the recommendations made by HIQA in a series of reports?</p> <p> In the context of the Government's obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and its commitment in the programme for Government to fully implement that Agreement, the British Government has announced its decision to repeal the Human Rights Act and remove the European Convention on Human Rights from British law.  That would be a grievous breach of the Good Friday Agreement, which is an international treaty between Ireland and Britain lodged with the UN.  Under the Agreement the British Government has committed to completing the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into law in the North and to introducing safeguards so that the Assembly and public authorities in the North cannot infringe on the convention.  Other safeguards also apply to policing.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this issue and did he raise it with Mr. Cameron given that the proposal is clearly in breach of the Agreement and the international treaty underpinning it?  If he has not done so already, will he immediately raise the issue with the British Government and urgently initiate discussions with all of the parties to the Agreement?</p></speech>

The memo dealt with the issues that need to be considered by this country arising from the fact that a referendum will be held, probably prior to 2017, and determined by the people of Britain.  That takes into account all of the issues in respect of devolution for Scotland and Wales, the situation for English MPs and the consequences for Northern Ireland.  I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron on Saturday morning.  We both agreed that we should meet in advance of the next European Council meeting on 26 June.  I expect that will be the first of a number of meetings.  The issue that Deputy Adams raised in the context of the Good Friday Agreement is a cause of concern for us as co-guarantors of the Agreement and we will, of course, raise it.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's question on HIQA, the second recommendation in the HIQA report was that the recommendations of that and previous HIQA reports be implemented.  I cannot provide a date for publication of the Bill to which the Deputy referred but the Minister has accepted all of these recommendations, including the HIQA report on misdiagnosis of breast cancer and inadequacy of maternity services in other locations around the country.  The fifth recommendation of the HIQA report was that the HSE should appoint a director of midwifery in every maternity unit in the country.  I will revert to the Deputy with a progress report on the Bill but these eight recommendations have been accepted and are being followed through for implementation.</p></speech>

I ask the Taoiseach to be specific as to when that legislation will be introduced.  This is not just a political point scoring matter.  The Taoiseach owes it to the public to tell them when this legislation will be introduced in order to provide clarity on the matter.  People are labouring under what I suspect is a deliberate misapprehension that Irish Water will be able to take unpaid charges out of people's salaries and social welfare payments.  I understand, however, that the legislation will not provide powers to Irish Water to take any money out of anybody's pay cheque, social welfare payment or pension.  It deals with the courts and unpaid debts in general.  When will the legislation be introduced?</p>  <p>  I understand that the harbour (amendment) Bill is due to be introduced this session.  Can the Taoiseach be more specific about when it will be introduced?  Serious issues arise in regard to the governance of our harbours, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour, in respect of which there are widespread concerns about its governance and future.  This Bill will have a serious impact on the decisions that need to be taken on the future of our harbours.</p></speech>

I am aware of Deputy Boyd Barrett's views about the importance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour.  I understand the Bill to which he referred will be before the House by the end of June.</p>  <p>  In regard to water, the Government has agreed to consider the issue of civil debt in a different way.  People will not have their water supplies cut off and they will not be sent to jail.  The Bill to which the Deputy referred will be enacted before the House rises in July.  I expect that the Minister for Justice and Equality, in working through the details of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the collection of civil debt, will come back to the Government with detailed proposals in the coming weeks.  It is not appropriate to put people in jail over small amounts of money.  Attachment of earnings orders will be applied, and the details of this provision will be outlined by the Minister.</p></speech>

When will we see new legislation in this area and is it acceptable that people are left isolated in their own homes because they cannot access financial support?</p><p>When are we going to see the new legislation on that?  Is it acceptable that people are left isolated in their homes because they cannot access financial support?</p> <p> We have had a litany of serious incidents across hospitals throughout the country.  Some 14 months ago, when the Portlaoise hospital story first broke, the Minister for Health told the House we would have open disclosure here in the near future.  This provision is incorporated into the health information Bill and will mean that patients will not be the last to know, as is the case today.  They will be told if a mistake has been made, rather than have to drag clinicians and the HSE to the courts, only to get a settlement on the steps of the court and never getting the truth or answers as to what happened.  When will we see this legislation?  Will it be fast-tracked and brought to the House as soon as possible? </p></speech>

It was originally promised by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in the Chamber.  It was then promised by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly and now we seem to be seeing some sort of row-back.  Families are being dragged through the courts at enormous cost to the health service and the HSE.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health informed us that it is too costly to hold anybody to account for what happened in Portlaoise.

In regard to open disclosure of information, we now have the HIQA report, which is completely independent.  It has made eight recommendations, all of which are accepted by the Minister and the HSE and will be implemented.  The first of those recommendations is for a patient advocacy group.  That will be completely independent of the HSE and will be set up by May of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Minister will visit Portlaoise hospital tomorrow and will meet with members of the families.  This hospital has gone through a series of incidents over the past period, but it is in a critical location and has a lot to offer.  A list of improvements have been put in place over the past 12 months, as I outlined earlier.  The Minister will visit the hospital tomorrow and speak to everybody involved and he will proceed with the implementation of the recommendations made.  He will also meet with the parents of the young babies who lost their lives.</p></speech>

The board of the HSE was abolished as one of the first acts of the previous Minister for Health in April 2011 and we were informed there would be accountability, in the context that the Minister would be fully accountable to the D&aacute;il.  However, we now find there is almost no accountability anywhere, because any time I table questions to the Minister, they are referred to the HSE and I have to wait a long time for a reply.  When will we have a decision from the Government on what is to replace the HSE?  We are now four years into this Government and there is less accountability.  There seems to be nobody in charge.  Can we have some time to debate the issue of accountability within the health service, because we have a Minister who is absent when it comes to accountability?  We need this issue to be addressed in a meaningful, timely manner in advance of any general election, so that people know where they stand in terms of whether the HSE is to be abolished or retained as a castrated organisation.</p></speech>

The upgrading of our transport is key to delivering regional jobs and encouraging companies to locate west of Dublin.  When can we expect to see the Roads (Amendment) Bill?  This Bill will provide for the transfer of responsibility for certain national roads and regional roads from councils to the National Roads Authority, which seems to have a huge allocation of funding for development.  I see a lot of misuse of that funding up and down the country where, for example, signs are being taken off the roads and roads are being ripped up and replaced without any explanation.  I would like the National Roads Authority to make better use of the funding which becomes available to it.</p></speech>

We must primarily hold in our thoughts the five infants who are no longer with us as a result of incidents in the maternity unit in Portlaoise, and the devastation it has caused to their families.  I thank the families for their courage in pursuing the matter and RTE for having highlighted in on "Prime Time".  If the families had not been so strong and brave, we would not be here having this debate and HIQA would not have produced its report.  While there were faults at local and regional level, the major faults were at the level of senior management, which presided over unacceptable risks for patients.  Senior management in the HSE knew about it over years and the State Claims Agency notified them about various incidents in Portlaoise hospital.</p><p>The bottom line is that the HSE senior management was aware of the problem.  Not only did it do nothing about it, it actively covered it up.  We saw the row over the publication of the report.  I am sure some in the HSE sought to prevent it coming out.</p> <p> None of that takes from the difficulties at Portlaoise hospital.  Will the Minister ensure the recommendations are implemented in full and confidence is restored in the interests of patients and those who want to use the hospital in the future?  This afternoon the Taoiseach made an extraordinary comment when he said there are accountability and disciplinary action procedures for doctors and nurses but not for senior management.  That is where the Minister must ensure there is accountability with senior management in the HSE.  Otherwise, he cannot stand over the HSE when he comes into this Chamber.  HIQA says it cannot stand over Portlaoise hospital.  Accordingly, the Minister cannot stand over the HSE unless he can be sure he has accountability in the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200034#GG00200"><p>I concur with Deputy Sean Fleming on the tragedies that unfolded in the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital over several years.  Much of this could have been avoided if the red flags that were raised on numerous occasions had been addressed.  These were not red flags but alarm bells over governance issues ringing continually.</p><p>The executive summary of the report states:<blockquote>This current investigation found that the HSE &ndash; as the provider of healthcare services &ndash; failed to take decisive action on defining the role of Portlaoise hospital and its model of care in the context of the findings of previous investigations.  Corporately Portlaoise hospital viewed itself as a model-3 hospital and was not included in the national smaller hospitals framework.  Similar to a model-3 hospital, Portlaoise provided a full range of acute services to patients presenting with all manner of injury and illness, including life support.  However, at the time of this investigation, the HSE had failed to resource the hospital sufficiently and to ensure that the governance arrangements in place could safely deliver such a model of care to patients.  For example, up until July 2014 the emergency department at the hospital &ndash; which was open 24 hours a day seven days a week &ndash; only had a consultant in emergency medicine on site for six hours, four days a week.</blockquote>Earlier, I raised issues about accountability and who is ultimately responsible for this with the Taoiseach.  I do not want to point the finger at or cast aspersions on any one individual.  However, it seems there was an alarming problem with governance at local, regional and national level.  The issue of accountability has to be addressed.  We cannot talk consistently about systems failure.  If we do not have accountability at senior management level, then we will have systems failure consistently because there will be no sanction for people who are simply not doing their job.  I do not want to scapegoat any individual but there is an obligation on us to ensure accountability is part and parcel of the remunerative packages of people in charge and to ensure compliance with good governance.</p><p>Again, I extend my sympathies to the families who bravely challenged the HSE on this issue.  I will have much more to say about this at the health committee over the next several weeks, as well as on the inability of the HSE to support the families and to be up front with the flow of information to families in times of bereavement and tragedy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200034#GG00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  I want to begin by recognising the courage and fortitude of the patients and families who shared their stories.  I want to thank them for bringing their experiences into the public domain.  I hope the publication of this report brings them some small comfort.  They have provided us with the opportunity to learn from the past and put things right for the future.  This time I want to ensure the opportunity will not be missed.</p>  <p>  Many aspects of the HIQA report disturb me.  I am appalled that patients in the hour of their greatest need were not treated with respect, care and compassion.  Patients and families were treated dreadfully and, at times, inhumanely.  It is not all about resources.  It costs nothing to care.  Honesty costs nothing, neither does compassion.  These patients and families needed to be supported.  They needed to know that they mattered.  They needed comfort.  Instead, they got the cold shoulder.  That to me is very unacceptable.</p>  <p>  The fact that at HSE corporate level, patient safety and quality was not given the highest priority is also concerning.  Patient safety and quality must be core to all we are and all we do.  The report highlights an urgent need to embed a patient safety culture right through the health service.  I accept the HIQA report in full and thank the investigation team for its work.  The four recommendations made to my Department will be implemented.  The HSE has confirmed that it too will implement the four recommendations made to it.  I expect the HSE to implement an action plan to address the findings of the report without delay, certainly by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been and will continue to be made at the hospital.  New management and governance structures, both clinical and operational, are in place, including a new hospital manager and a director of midwifery for the first time, as well as an on-site risk manager.  Since I have come into office, my priority has been to strengthen the hospital and address ongoing patient safety issues.</p>  <p>  Appointments have been made to key posts in both the maternity and general services.  This includes additional consultants in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics and obstetrics.  Up to 16 additional midwives have been appointed and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  An ambulance bypass protocol is in place for serious paediatric cases.</p>  <p>  Structural change has begun with Portlaoise now forming part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Any change to services in the hospital will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.  This will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation within the group.  Services that are viable will be safety-assured and adequately resourced.  We will need to make sure services currently provided by the hospital that are not viable, due to insufficient case load or inability to recruit senior staff, are discontinued.  Governance of the maternity service will transfer to the Coombe in line with the memorandum of understanding agreed already.  I will also implement a national women and infants health programme modelled on the successful national cancer care programme, NCCP, to modernise our maternity services.</p>  <p>  I will do everything in my power to ensure the recommendations in this report are implemented without delay.  While we cannot undo the loss that patients and families have suffered, we can ensure lessons are learned and health services improved for all of us.</p></speech>

He will appreciate there is no issue of this being a political matter.  This is about people&rsquo;s and young children&rsquo;s lives, as well as patient safety.  That transcends everything we do in this House.</p>  <p>  One concern I have, however, is the Minister said the action plan will be implemented immediately and certainly by the end of the year.  Between now and the end of the year, there will be 1,500 to 1,700 births at Portlaoise hospital.  I do not think the Minister can say to those patients that by next year there will be a safe system in place.  We need greater urgency than talking about the end of the year.  Whoever is needed to come from the Coombe to the hospital, needs to be brought in now, not at the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Due to the culture of HSE senior management at national level, if there is ever problem, it goes out to protect the organisation.  Everything else is secondary.  When recruiting for an operations director for the region some time ago, the Public Appointments Service specifically stated the director will be fully accountable and responsible for all services.  The Taoiseach said something different here today.  The terms and conditions of senior management need to have that stitched in to them.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure that is done for all future recruitments into senior posts in the HSE, if it is not already the case.</p></speech>

A national steering group was established on 30 April 2015, I assume on foot of the draft report.  This indicates a lack of urgency in this particular area.  As we have pointed out, there will be between 1,500 and 1,800 births between now and the end of the year at Portlaoise hospital.</p><p>The report also stated:<blockquote>The pivotal appointment of a director of midwifery to a maternity department located within a general hospital is unique to Portlaoise hospital.  This role has had a very positive influence in terms of assessing and improving the standard of midwifery care.  However, at the time of writing, a senior obstetric lead had not been appointed to the maternity department to provide independent senior experienced obstetric clinical leadership.</blockquote>Even as late as the publication of the report, some matters critically important for the delivery of safe maternity services at Portlaoise hospital had not been acted on.  I would have thought at the very least an independent senior obstetric clinical leader would have been appointed forthwith.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200035#HH00100"><p>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that actions have been taken to assure the safety of maternity services in Portlaoise.  I do not think anybody waited for a report to do this.  As the Deputy will be aware, actions have been ongoing for the best part of a year.  The ones that may take a few months to complete include the establishment of an independent patient advocacy service which might have to be put out to tender.  Legal status for the hospital groups will also take a few months to achieve.</p>  <p>  We need greater personal accountability in the health service.  It is not good enough to talk about a systems failure, which is an inadequate excuse.  We need greater personal accountability.  We also need to acknowledge where there are failures in the system.  As things stand, two referrals have been made to the Medical Council concerning two doctors.  There have been two referrals to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland concerning two nurses.  There is an internal disciplinary process for HSE managers, although what is under consideration is appointing somebody from overseas to undertake disciplinary investigations of managers in the HSE because people may not have faith in an internal HSE disciplinary procedure.  The point the Taoiseach made was that there were external disciplinary procedures for nurses, midwives and doctors but only internal procedures for managers.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that it is certainly not all about resources.  Today I looked at hospital budgets.  For example, the budget for the hospital in Portlaoise is within 10% of the budget for Naas hospital which covers a much bigger catchment area.  Therefore, it is not all about budgets.  Services were understaffed in certain areas, but to make them safe and bring them up to specialist standard, often no amount of resources will be enough because an adequate case load is needed to ensure clinicians are not de-skilled.  One also needs to be able to attract specialists and senior staff, which is sometimes difficult.  Up to now, where it has not been possible to attract specialists and senior staff, we have staffed services with expensive, often transient and not always very well qualified, locums and agency staff.  That is happening all over the country.  In the coming months and years we will need to consider seriously whether services that cannot attract specialists and senior staff should continue, not just in Portlaoise but also in many other hospitals all over the country.  We need to face up to this issue.</p>  <p>  The national maternity strategy group has been asked to report by October or November this year.  One of the actions mentioned in the HIQA report is that a director of midwifery be appointed as midwifery services leader in every maternity unit.  That will be done by the HSE.  Notwithstanding the enormous financial pressure the State has been under and despite tough time, the number of midwives employed in the public health service is now 1,425.  When the Government took office, it was 1,178.  The number of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists is at a record high.  Despite the cutbacks made in recent years, therefore, we now have record numbers of midwives and consultants, even though the birth rate is falling.  This shows that the Government takes the matter much more seriously than previous Governments, but we still have a long way to go.</p></speech>

In May last year I remember asking her predecessor, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to appear before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to discuss it.  To date, 14 English language schools in Dublin alone have closed their doors, placing a huge financial burden on the students involved.  The most recent case involves the International Education Academy and it is estimated that the students will lose in the region of &euro;2,000 each.  They include 100 prospective students who have registered and paid their fees but who will not be able to start their courses as the college is set to close.</p>  <p>  The Minister has proposed a three pillar solution.  A task force was established and one of its recommendations was that an accommodatin scheme be put in place to enable students to transfer to other colleges, including private colleges, to complete their courses at a discounted rate.  This shows a lack of understanding by the Department in dealing with such students, many of whom are living in poverty and do not have the money to switch courses, even at a discounted rate.  Some students have given evidence to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The matter needs to be resolved and I will propose some solutions in my supplementary contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200035#HH00400"><p>There seems to be no end to this saga which has unfolded before our eyes.  This morning a creditors meeting was held in the case involving the National College of Business Administration, NCBA.  Astonishingly, it was revealed that the college had &euro;5,000 in assets and &euro;300,000 in debts at the time of its closure, this despite the fact that students had paid thousands of euro in fees in the days and weeks prior to its closure.</p>  <p>  The students have been the main focus in this saga, but teachers and other staff have also been left out of pocket.  Students chose and trusted the schools in question because they were included in the lists approved by the State.  They had paid their fees, travelled to Ireland and kept their part of the deal.  However, they arrived to find a sector which was entirely unregulated.  When a school goes out of business, students find that, in effect, the State washes its hands of them.   One student described the State's response in revealing terms, that it was like being surrounded by stone walls.  Will the Government pursue this matter on behalf of the students involved?  When will we see proper regulation of the sector?  What protections can we expect to see in the regulations?  What efforts will be made to recoup the moneys due to students, teachers and other creditors?  Teaching and administrative staff in many of these schools are immensely fearful that there will be more closures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200035#HH00500"><p>I thank both Deputies for raising this issue and share their concern for the students affected by the closures.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has said 14 such schools have closed, but according to my figures, there have been 16 confirmed private English language school closures since April 2014 and approximately 5,000, mainly non-EEA, students have been affected.  There was a disturbing level of immigration abuse in this sector and it is clear that a number of institutions were operating a business model that was based on little more than facilitating the economic migration of those seeking to come and work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The first priority of my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality in response was to find reasonable accommodation for genuinely affected students.  A task force was established to co-ordinate efforts to ensure the provision of alternative courses for those who wished to continue their studies.  For others, assurance of their immigration status was sufficient.</p>  <p>  On foot of the work of the task force, a number of robust regulatory reforms in the international education sector were announced jointly by me and the Minister for Justice and Equality in September 2014.  The reforms included the creation of a more restricted list of eligible programmes for immigration purposes to replace the existing internationalisation register of courses.  The new list of programmes, referred to as the interim list of eligible programmes, was due to come into force on 1 January 2015.  However, a legal challenge by two colleges to some aspects of the reforms relating to the language sector was upheld by the High Court.  As a result, while certain reforms relating to the student work concession, under which non-EEA students have access to the labour market, were introduced as planned from 1 January, implementation of the interim list was temporarily deferred pending consideration of the High Court judgment.  The two Departments have now produced a package of reforms, consistent with the High Court's judgment, under the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to the Government for its approval shortly.  That will occur in the very near future.</p>  <p>  Ireland's immigration regime for non-EEA students is a generous one.  It comprises the right to live and study in Ireland and provides access to the labour market.</p><p>While Ireland needs to compete internationally in this market and the immigration regime is an essential part of the package, in order to justify the granting of such permission, three essential conditions at a policy level must be satisfied.  First, there must be confidence that the industry is operating to an acceptable standard and that the students are immigration-compliant.  There is no room for so-called visa factories in the Irish educational sector.  Second, the programmes must be of a type that reflects Ireland's strategic priorities in international education.  Ireland's international education strategy and its marketing is founded on the quality of Irish higher education and our strong track record in delivering quality-assured English language programmes to overseas students.  Third, the immigration regime offered to students must be consistent with both immigration policy in general and good labour market management.  This package of reforms, when approved by the Government, will ensure that overarching and comprehensive immigration and quality assurance processes are in place for the delivery of international education in the State.  They will significantly contribute to maintaining and enhancing Ireland's reputation as a high-quality destination for international students.</p> <p> Deputy McDonald mentioned the Department's approval process.  We do not approve the quality of the courses but the international register is simply a list of programmes that meet relevant immigration criteria.</p></speech>

Dr. P&aacute;draig Walsh, the chief executive of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, has come out very strongly to say that many of these schools operating within the State are doing so without meeting the standards under the Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services, the ACELS process.  He has indicated that schools recruiting students from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, which were due to introduce these in January will introduce it shortly.  The Minister touched on that in her contribution.  It is clear from the contribution of Dr. Walsh and everybody else, including at the education committee and this Topical Issue matter, that those regulations must be put in place as quickly as possible.  Will the Minister outline what avenues are open to students who are unable, due to financial constraints, to move courses even at a discounted rate?  What recourse is open to them?  Will the Minister provide us with an update on creating an insurance scheme for students when this happens?</p></speech>

The people I have spoken to misunderstood or perhaps were overly impressed with that listing.  Nonetheless, in her response, the Minister outlines the need for full adherence to immigration regulations and law, and we all agree on that.  I detected a heavier emphasis on that than on the students who have been the casualty of this unmitigated mess.  One Venezuelan man, who is 23 years old, was in Leinster College and he lost &euro;1,000 when it closed.  Due to the terms of his visa, he could stay here for six months and he enrolled at the Modern Educational Centre on Harcourt Street, paid his fees at the end of February this year and attended fewer than four weeks of class before that college closed.  He has been told now that in order to stay, he must enrol again with a third college.  It is a complete mess and a catastrophe for this young man.</p>  <p>  We speak much about reputational damage when we debate other issues but this is extremely damaging not just to the sector but more generally as well.  Nobody would advocate playing fast and loose with the immigration system - far from it - but there must be some kind of response for the students like this young man from Venezuela, who came here in good faith.  He has been ripped off and let down while here.</p></speech>

That is why we announced the measures last year but, unfortunately, there was a court case taken and we had to address the issues raised by the decision of the court.  It is important to reiterate that the vast majority of private providers of English language training in the State operate to a high standard.  It is important to stress that and that we are talking about a small number.  It is no consolation to the affected students that the vast majority of colleges operate to a high standard.</p>  <p>  The organisation Marketing English in Ireland is the umbrella body that worked with the task force.  It has been assisting genuine students in completing their studies by offering alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate.  I acknowledge, as the Deputies noted, that those students very often just do not have the funds to even be able to accept those offers.  With regard to insurance and protection, schools that are part of the Marketing English in Ireland group have arrangements in place for the protection of learners.  That is something we are looking at with respect to the new provisions.</p></speech>

Along with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, I want to get proposals to the Government and implemented as soon as possible.  This is so we will not in future have people in countries like Venezuela or elsewhere being misinformed as to what is offered in Ireland.  We are moving to correct the system as quickly as possible and provide, where we can, assistance for the students who have unfortunately been caught up in this issue.</p></speech>

It has been stated that 42 public water supplies in Ireland tested in the latest Environmental Protection Agency inspections had lead levels that exceeded the safety thresholds that came into effect in December last year.  Dublin city alone is known to have several thousand homes still with internal lead pipes, and that situation is replicated across the country.  Ireland is not alone in this regard with having legacy issues of lead pipes, as the problem is also prevalent in England, Scotland and France.</p>  <p>  Public health specialist Dr. Anthony Breslin has recently stated that the full impact of lead exposure was serious and could cause neurological disease.  He urged householders with any doubts to have their pipes checked.  He also indicated that public awareness about the dangers of lead was high when it started to be removed from paint and petrol but in the 20 to 30 years since, people may have become complacent about the presence of lead.</p>  <p>  A constituent contacted me last week to express his concern and anxiety regarding what he described as a potentially lethal problem.  He has a nine-year-old daughter and he is very worried that the lead in his water supply could cause her health issues in future.  There is great concern in St. Anne's estate in Raheny in my constituency about the presence of lead pipes in the water supply network in this estate, comprising approximately 700 homes.  St. Anne's estate was built by Dublin Corporation, as it was, and completed in 1954 as an estate to house families qualifying for a local authority loan to purchase a home.  At that time, the people had to be either existing corporation tenants or corporation housing applicants to qualify for the loan.  The design of the estate is similar to other Dublin Corporation estates of the period, and that design continued up to the 1970s.  The current problem with lead water supply pipes is manifesting particularly in St. Anne's estate and it is a cause of concern to the residents.</p>  <p>  I am told representatives of Irish Water are currently liaising with the Environmental Protection Agency to finalise a national strategy to address the issue of lead water pipes.  Irish Water has also indicated that property owners are responsible for the water distribution on their own properties, including all domestic internal plumbing.  In Scotland, for example, there are grants for private householders to replace pipes with plastic or other alternatives.</p><p>There are no grant incentive schemes here at present.  A grant-aided scheme to remove harmful lead pipes from the drinking water infrastructure would provide jobs as well as eliminating a public health risk, which would be welcome.  I call on the Minister to consider this strategy.  It is now time to remove the lead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200037#KK00200"><p>I hope it is acceptable to Deputy Kenny that I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who, I have explained to him, has been called away.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline the position in regard to this matter.</p><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.  Suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which limit came into effect on 25 December 2013.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with the drinking water regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, where a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive to ensure that appropriate remedial action is taken.  A case-by-case approach will be considered by Irish Water in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA to develop local responses to issues which arise in particular locations.</p><p>Irish Water has informed the Department of the Environment <i>, </i>Community and Local Government that of its estimated 60,000 km distribution system, it has identified a very small proportion - approximately 2 km of water-mains - as possibly containing lead.  As such, Irish Water has commenced a programme of verification and removal that will be completed in 2015.  However, there are a significant number of lead service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter.  Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the metering installation programme.  It is currently identified that approximately 5% of houses are affected, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas.  Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections.  Irish Water has informed the Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections, over the next ten years.  This is probably the issue that most concerns the Deputy.  Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure they mitigate the risk in the short term.</p><p>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system.  Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the mains stopcock to a house and within the house rests, therefore, with the house owner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it was recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time.</p><p>With regard to the proposal for a grants scheme, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is developing a national strategy for lead which it is discussing with the Department of Health, Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risk posed to human health by lead in drinking water.  I understand that the Government was informed at the Cabinet meeting this morning that the strategy will be completed and published in the next month.  I hope this information is of some value to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I take some comfort from the fact that the strategy being developed will be completed in one month.  We hope there will be positive responses in that.  I note the Minister of State saying there was a 60,000 km distribution system but that only 2 km of water mains comprises of lead pipes.  She also said that backyard lead piping will be dealt with by Irish Water.  She said there were between 30,000 and 40,000 houses in that situation.  I must, however, express the concern my constituents feel on this matter.  There have been a number of media articles on this problem.  It has aroused concern in particular in regard to the effect it might have on children.  I hope that when the strategy report is published those issues will be addressed and that people's fears will be allayed.</p></speech>

When we see the strategy next month, we will have a much clearer idea of what exactly we are talking about.  The mapping process will be hugely important.  It is at that point the Government's considered response will come to light.  Where there is an immediate concern, Irish Water, the EPA and the HSE have assured us there will be localised action in relation to prioritised areas.  This is where it is being dealt with on an area-by-area, job-by-job or location-by-location basis.  In fact, the mapping exercise and the strategy being developed and published next month will be the key to how we deal with this.</p></speech>

Farmers are receiving the forms to fill in and there is huge discontent in suckler areas.  When one looks at the terms and conditions, it is clear that one has to sign up to a six-year contract.  If something goes wrong within five years, one will be in trouble and have to pay back the money.</p>  <p>  I note the 60% issue in regard to genotyping.  It is costing &euro;30 to do each one.  Most farmers in the scheme will have to have a planner to deal with carbon and the grazing season, which is causing problems.  One big thing that is emerging from both the breeders of bulls and the farmers themselves involves the four and five star ratings.  In reality, a one or two star bull may produce as good an animal and better than a four or five star one.  An animal that may have five stars after three years could be brought down to two stars by a heifer or other progeny produced out of it down the road.  We have seen this in looking at the bulls that have been produced in Ireland down through the years.</p>  <p>  There is huge concern and it is not scare-mongering.  Many farmers, especially the smaller ones, are throwing the forms in the fire they are so afraid to go into the scheme.  It needs to be addressed.  The farming organisations are holding meetings over the next week so extensive is concern on the ground.  I have had a lot of farmers into my constituency office and they have said they are walking away from the scheme.  The other issue is that if one increases or decreases from the 2014 figures, one does not comply with the terms of the scheme.  I ask the Minister to look at and change the terms and conditions.</p><p> I know that the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, has worked with the Minister on this scheme but there is a huge difference between what I am hearing on the ground and what is being pushed.  At the moment a person can bring a bull from England, but it could take two years before the person has a five star bull.  Farmers have been doing it for years and there is a course available as well.  These farmers have been involved in suckler farming for years and we need to keep them up and running.</p> <p> This funding is like an apple which is high up in the tree.  Everyone welcomes the funding which the Minister is making available and no one is taking from that fact.  However, I am expressing the genuine discontent on the ground and the genuine fear farmers have of going into the scheme.  It must be rejigged and we need to work with farmers and bull breeders to get it right.  I have seen the stark consequence, which is widespread, especially in the west where many suckler farmers are based.  Farmers are not going into the scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200038#LL00200"><p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for raising this issue.  He will get a written response which will include further details but I will try to address some of the issues he is raising now.  Some of the concerns are about something that is not proposed.  It is true that this is quite a complex scheme.  We are committing &euro;300 million to the suckler herd.  I want to give a strong statement from Government in the rural development programme that the suckler herd really matters.  Tens of thousands of farm families, in every constituency and parish in the country, are deriving an income from suckler beef and we want to keep them there.</p><p>We also want to use the supports that we will be giving through this scheme to ensure that we improve the genetics and breeding performance of the herd.  We also want to improve the quality of the herd so that animals grow faster, have better confirmation and improve their ease of calving and temperament and so on.  We will be making a positive contribution from an emissions and climate change point of view because animals will be growing faster and producing meat more efficiently.  We will also be helping farmers to become more profitable by producing better bred beef.</p><p>I am sure there are examples of a two star bull that has had a better progeny than a four star bull.  However, on average, the more stars a bull has, the better the progeny that comes from that animal.  That is the point of a star rating system.  The same applies to suckler cows.  The better the genetics, the increased likelihood of producing better animals from that herd.  This is the purpose of the scheme.  </p><p>There is a reason for asking people to sign up to a six year contract.  This is an area based scheme under the rural development programme.  Farmers are required to buy into the scheme for a certain number of years, as is the case when joining the GLAS scheme, and there are consequences if they pull out.  The reason we need a six year commitment is that if we are going to collect DNA data in the first couple of years, it will only be in the second half of the scheme that we will see the genetic improvements that come from the collected data.</p><p>This is not a scheme that is simply pumping &euro;95 per calved cow, for the first ten, and &euro;80 per animal after that to support suckler farm income.  It does that, but there are requirements and these requirements are not overly expensive.  The carbon calculator that is being asked of farmers as part of the terms and conditions and the training that farmers need to undertake to understand how they can best use the genomic information that they get back from ICBF will both be paid for separately.  The &euro;30 that it costs to take a genomic sample last year is likely to be significantly cheaper this year because the numbers involved will be significantly higher, we will benefit from economies of scale and we will have a competitive process to get the price down further from where it was last year.  </p><p>Farmers have nothing of which to be frightened in this scheme.  If something dramatic happens on the farm and a farmer is forced out of the scheme during the six year period, the rules around <i>force majeure</i>will apply.  If someone dies on the farm or something like that, we will take that into account.  However, we need this to be a six year commitment by farmers.  We are contributing more than &euro;53 million a year into the suckler beef sector.  That is &euro;300 million in total, of which more than half is being paid by the European Union.  This is being done on the basis of a climate change measure, so that we can produce suckler beef more efficiently and so that there will be a lower carbon footprint in our beef herd.  It will also mean more profitable beef production.</p><p>All of the things we have designed in this scheme are concerned with helping farmers to become more efficient and profitable and to produce better herds based on better breeding programmes.  We are training farmers to use the scientific genomic data that we will collect from their herds, matched with the performance data farmers will provide, to help them do that.  This is a win-win situation for everyone.  It is not an attempt to capture farmers or tie them into things that they do not want to do.  It is about working with farmers, getting information from them and giving it back to them in a form that with training results in better breeding programmes in our suckler beef herd.</p><p>If there is one thing I know since becoming Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine it is that the difference between the top performing suckler herds and the bottom performing suckler herds is an absolute chasm at the moment.  Deputies who understand agriculture will understand this fact.  We must help everyone move into a more efficient way of producing beef, which is more profitable for them and which is more climate efficient for us in terms of the targets we have to meet in agriculture.  This is the purpose of the scheme.  We will pay people to be part of that journey.</p></speech>

We all agree on ensuring the viability of farm families.  However, the reality is that a person could have a five star bull today, but if there is a problem at calving from an off-spring of that bull, the bull could be reduced to a two star rating.  This would be the same as an animal the person might have had the week before.  Farmers will be expected to get rid of all their bulls which are under five stars.  This means many bulls will be slaughtered.</p></speech>

It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  If a person works a year for someone, the person's wages are based on that year's work.  If farmers do it right year one, year two and year three, they should not be penalised for the back-money.  Every year should stand for itself.  If I work for someone and make a mistake in year two, I do not get paid year one wages if I have done everything right.  Will the Minister look at that aspect?  Farmers are frightened of this scheme.  We have seen problems between the Department and farmers over the past few years on eligibility and so forth.  Farmers are frightened that if something goes wrong in year five that they could be looking at having to pay a big bill.  That is a major stumbling block.  Will the Minister's Department examine this issue and look at the possibility of taking each year as it is, which will give farmers hope going into the scheme?</p></speech>

At least one stock bull on the holding on 30 June 2019, which is four years from now, must be a bull that has been geno-typed four or five star on either the terminal or replacement index or a similar four or five star bull must be retained on the holding until 30 June 2020.  In other words, the farmer can lease the bull.  We are trying to give a signal to farmers that they need to plan to improve the bulls with which they will be breeding their animals and that they have four years to do it.  That is why this is a six year commitment and not a year-on-year commitment.  If someone decides to go into this scheme next year, gets the payments and then decides to pull out, it is of no value to anyone apart from the cash value to the farmer concerned.</p><p>However, if one makes a commitment for the six years, one gets payments for the full six years and is on a journey, from contributing information at the start and taking training for which one will be paid, on top of the beef genomic payment, to using the training and scientific information one has been given to have better breeding towards the end of the six years.  This is so that, by the end of that period, we will have a better suckler herd, which is something from which everyone benefits.<br/><br/>If someone is forced out of the scheme because something dramatic happens or so on, we will consider the question of <i>force majeure</i>, as we do when farmers are forced out of other schemes.  We understand that such things happen, but we want a medium-term, six-year commitment from farmers.  This is not simply an annual cash payment for having a suckler herd.  It is a programme that has some complexity to it but that farmers understand.<br/><br/>The six-year commitment involves generous payments throughout and will achieve exciting results for the farmer.  This is why we have it.  If we just have a year-on-year payment and farmers can opt in or out, those who leave early will have given all of the information but received none of the benefits.  The Commission would not approve a programme that took five or six years to accrue benefits and for which we paid &euro;300 million without getting a commitment that farmers would see it through.  This is the issue.  I hope that farmers understand.<br/><br/>I have been open and honest with farming organisations about it during the scheme's design.  I hope that everyone will understand what we are doing, namely, ensuring it is a win-win for everyone by improving incomes for beef farmers while improving the quality of their breeding herds over a six-year period.  We will get exciting results if the partnership between the Department and farmers works as planned.</p></speech>

I would be obliged if, in accordance with Standing Order 140, the Acting Chairman would direct the Clerk to make the following minor drafting corrections to the text of the Bill, which are being done in the interests of textual clarity and correction of cross-references and do not affect any substantive amendment.</p>  <p>  Seanad amendment No. 71 relates to section 42 of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and substitutes a new subsection (b) in that section on page 39.  There should be a footnote associated with this amendment to confirm that the Schedule referred to is Schedule 6, which is being inserted by Seanad amendment No. 172, rather than the existing Schedule to the Bill.</p>  <p>  Seanad amendment No. 94 relations to section 68 of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and inserts an amended subsection (2) on page 51 between lines 11 and 15.  The text inserted by this amendment should be inserted as subsection (2) rather than subsection (1).</p>  <p>  Seanad amendment No. 230 relates to Schedule 6 of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and inserts new text on page 143 between lines 11 and 12 that relates to the reference to SI 623 of 2006, European Communities (European Public Limited - Liability Company) (Employee Involvement) Regulations 2006.  There is a typographical error in the text to be inserted in line 13 by this amendment.  There is an additional "a" in the first line of the text that appears in column 4 of this amendment that is superfluous and should be deleted.</p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to clarify the fact that section 8(5) contains a specific commencement provision.  In other words, there will be a general commencement date, but it will be subject to various repeal provisions only coming into force after the commencement of Part 4 on the adjudication process.  This amendment ensures consistency between these two provisions in the Bill.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 28 and 31 to section 8 are of a drafting and technical nature and make no substantive change to the section.  The amendments simply highlight the existing division in Schedule 2 between the provisions of the primary legislation's Part 1 that will be repealed and the provisions of the secondary legislation's Part 2 that will be revoked upon the enactment of the Bill.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 to section 8 relate to the transitional arrangements that will apply to certain complaints under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and-or under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  Subsections (3) and (4) are amended to ensure that the relevant repeals provided for in Schedule 2 of this Bill will not apply to complaints under the aforementioned legislation referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal before the commencement of Part 4 of this Bill.</p></speech>

Rights across 24 primary Acts and 34 related specified Parts would be impacted by the new provisions.  The complexity of this has required the picking up of a number of amendments.  Some are purely stylistic amendments to make the final Act easier to use on the part of practitioners by having references provided in a more standardised fashion.  I can understand the Deputy's feeling but, obviously when these amendments are brought to our attention by the draftsman's office, we feel it is important to leave the Bill as easy to use as possible for the practitioners and absolutely thorough.  There are some substantive amendments in the Bill but most of the amendments are of the nature I have described.</p></speech>

It makes it an offence to fail to pay an award of compensation in circumstances where the court has made an order so directing the person concerned.  A person guilty of an offence under section 53 shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.  This arose in order to ensure that some offences that were summary offences could still be prosecutable with a fine being imposed.  Section 53 makes it an offence to fail to comply with the order of the District Court and, as a result of such a failure, the penalty provisions in the rest of the Bill would apply.

Currently, the statutory functions and powers of Labour Court inspectors are scattered over a large number of Acts dating back to 1946.  Section 78 restates and consolidates all those functions and powers in one location having regard to current best practice and developments in case law.  These amendments place on a statutory basis the practice of the Labour Court inspectors issuing a formal caution to a person in appropriate circumstances before questioning that person in relation to compliance issues.  The use of a formal caution before questioning is consistent with the person's constitutional right not to incriminate themselves and serves as a reminder that the information that they give on being questioned may be used in any subsequent legal proceedings arising from the inspection in question.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment broadens the scope of the information that the workplace relations commission may disclose to a public contracting authority.  As previously drafted, the section restricted the disclosure of information about non-compliance with employment legislation in relation only to the main contractor engaged by the public contracting authority.  The amendment will extend the legislative basis for disclosure to include subcontractors.  The extended provision will give greater scope to public contracting authorities to make effective use of the standard provisions in public works contracts to withhold payment or part payment of moneys if there is evidence of non-compliance with employment legislation by either a primary or secondary contractor engaged on the contract in question.</p></speech>

That Act is unique in employment law in that there are three actors involved: the employee, who is the agency worker; the employer, who is the agency; and the hirer, which is the entity for whom the agency worker carries out the work.  The 2012 Act clearly distinguishes those sections of the Act where an employee can take a case against the employer from those sections of the Act where an employee can take a case against the hirer.  As the purpose of the Workplace Relations Bill is to streamline structure and processes rather than to make any substantive changes in employment rights legislation, it is important that section 42 of the Bill which deals with the presentation of complaints, clearly reflects this distinction.  The amendments being made to section 42 do not change the broad scheme of the section as it relates to the Employment of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012.  It still remains the case that those provisions of that Act which can be subject of a claim against an employer are included in Schedule 5 of the Bill.  The amendment being made to subsection (1) clarifies that the provisions listed in that schedule are those where a complaint can be made that an employee's employer has contravened any of the provisions listed in Schedule 5.  Previously, the text of paragraph (1) did not specify against whom a complaint could be made, simply stating that an employee or specified person could present a complaint to the director general that a provision of Schedule 5 had been contravened in relation to the complainant.  The ambiguity has now been clarified.</p></speech>

Section 43 provides that if a case has been dismissed by an adjudication officer on the grounds that it is frivolous or vexatious, the complainant will have the right to appeal this decision to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court, upon hearing an appeal, may affirm the decision of the adjudication officer or annul that decision and refer the complaint back to the adjudication officer concerned for a decision on the complaint or dispute.  This amendment inserts a new subsection (4) specifically to cover complaints or disputes which are referred back to the director general by the Labour Court following a successful appeal to it by a complainant whose complaint or dispute was dismissed by an adjudication officer under section 43 (1) as being vexatious.  Following the referral of the complaint back to the director general, the case will then be assigned to a different adjudication officer for the hearing.  If the first adjudication officer deemed a case to be frivolous or vexatious, when the case is referred back it will not be heard by the same officer.  This was an issue of concern raised by Deputy Wallace, who felt the procedure in the original draft of the Bill was unfair.</p></speech>

The motion calls for the appointment of an independent planning regulator.  It is important to put this into context.</p><p>We are all well aware of the background to the Mahon tribunal into planning corruption which focuses on the role of leading local authority officials, mainly in the Dublin area and also of leading politicians who were implicated in some of those irregularities.  I will not go back over all the details of that.  However, what is relevant to the motion is that one of the key recommendations of the Mahon report published in March 2012, namely to appoint a planning regulator, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>The Government recently published an outline of proposals on planning which includes provision for a planning regulator, but falls short of making such an office independent of the Minister, as recommended in the Mahon tribunal report.  Section 1.14 of the final Mahon tribunal report of recommendations arising from the inquiry refers to its concerns that, despite the investigation into planning irregularities and the systemic failures that allowed them to go unchecked that:<blockquote>[R]ecent changes in the planning system have resulted in an over-centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment which is not subject to sufficient checks and balances.  Consequently, the Tribunal is recommending that the Minister for the Environment&rsquo;s ability to give directions to Regional Authorities and Local Planning Authorities should be entrusted to a Planning Regulator.</blockquote>Section 1.15 states that planning regulator's role should be:<blockquote>[T]o investigate possible systemic problems in the planning system, including those raising corruption risks, with the aim of making recommendations to address those problems.  The Regulator should also be responsible for providing training to members of both local and regional authorities on planning and development to enable them to discharge their functions in this area more effectively.  The Regulator should have sufficient powers to carry out his or her functions effectively, including the power to question witnesses and compel the production of documents.</blockquote>That is what the Mahon tribunal report recommended.  Unfortunately the Minister, Deputy Kelly's, scheme for a regulator does not contain such provisions for the office to be established on such an independent basis.  Instead it makes clear that any review, inquiry or recommendations of the planning regulator will be subject to the approval - and in effect the veto - of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That is not an acceptable response, nor does it fulfil the Government's promise to establish an independent planning regulator.</p><p>When the then Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, published her review into the seven local authorities - subsequently changed to six - in June 2012 in response to concerns raised, she specifically stated that legislation would be brought forward to include the appointment of an independent planning regulator.  However, that is not included in the proposed Bill and I ask the Minister - and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, in his absence - why this is not the case.</p><p>In rejecting the call for an independent planning regulator in February the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, said that such an office would give an unelected official powers that would supersede &quot;the democratic oversight and accountability of the policy-making process&quot;.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe that is the case as such an office could operate in the same manner as the Office of the Ombudsman.  The transparency and accountability of the planning regulator could be guaranteed by requiring him or her to appear before the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht or whatever other committee may be deemed appropriate.  I note that the general scheme of the Bill does not provide for this.</p><p>It is only now, in the twilight of the Government that the long-promised planning legislation is being discussed.  Given the normal gap between the publication of such proposals and the legislation passing through both Houses of the Oireachtas, I will not be holding my breath that we will see this before the general election, although I hope I am proved wrong.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate when the Government hopes to introduce it.</p><p>We have tabled this motion tonight, as we believe the appointment of an independent planning regulator is a matter of urgency and can be dealt with within a short time.  A stand-alone Bill could be published to establish such an office before the summer recess.  I ask those on the Government side of the House as well as Deputies on the Opposition side to support the motion given that people on all sides of the House have spoken eloquently about this and supposedly support it.</p><p>I note that the Minister has recently established an inquiry into serious allegations of planning irregularities and other matters in County Wicklow.  I have met a number of people who have brought very serious allegations to my attention based on concrete evidence.  The Minister has been presented with a detailed list of questions and complaints regarding property developments in County Wicklow by the local auctioneer, Mr. Gabriel Dooley, and these have been reported in the media.  These centre on the acquisition of lands, rezonings and road access, for none other than Mr. Se&aacute;n Dunne and Mr. Se&aacute;n Mulryan, around the proposed development at Charlesland near Greystones.</p></speech>

The subsequent rezoning of lands in question brought huge dividends for the Ballymore property group, which at the time - this is a matter of public record - had distressed loans of &euro;2.75 billion from AIB, Anglo Irish Bank and other financial institutions.</p>  <p>  It has also been pointed out that rezoning, which it is claimed was facilitated by some of these close relationships, actually increased the price of property at Charlesland from &euro;80,000 per acre to &euro;1.2 million per acre - in total from &euro;1.6 million to &euro;24 million.  Given that and the evidence that has been put forward, which presents serious questions for some officials, some of whom are retired and some of whom are not, can the Minister state what he knows of the situation?  What is the nature of the investigations which it is said are set in train?</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to comment on claims that key documents given for his attention and the attention of his predecessor, Mr. Phil Hogan, went missing.  A substantial file was presented to the Minister and his Department.  Has there been a Garda investigation into it?  If there has not, why has there not been such an investigation?  My understanding is that the file turned up when those who supplied the file offered to supply copies of the original file.</p>  <p>  Wicklow County Council designated land for social housing worth potentially &euro;20 million.  A large section of that land, six acres, was handed over to the developer for &euro;10 and it is claimed that it was a deed of grant of easement, a most unusual legal instrument, to be used in the transfer of land from a local authority.  I have a copy of the deed of grant of easement, which makes interesting reading.  Even though it was never brought before the members of the local authority in the chamber, it has a separate folio.  It is sold as a fee simple according to this document, freehold.</p>  <p>  The most interesting thing of all is that this is not just a right of passage.  According to the agreement itself, the perpetuity period means the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the expiration of 21 years from the date of the death of the last survivor of the issue now living of the late Britannia Majesty, King George V.  So it lasts for 21 years after the last chain in the British monarchy - that is if the British decide to get rid of the monarchy and I do not see any sign of the British getting rid of the monarch just yet.</p>  <p>  There is also the question of the access route from the N11 for this development, which potentially cost &euro;30 million.</p><p>Who paid for this?  We know that &euro;12 million was paid in fees.  According to the documents I have seen, the county council committed to acquiring land to facilitate the private developer through a CPO.  This is a most serious situation.<br/><br/>There are numerous allegations of questionable practices around this State.  We must have full openness on this issue.  The former county manager, Eddie Sheehy, was <i>in situ </i>while many of these cases were ongoing.  He was so sensitive to public criticism that he had three county council members suspended from the chamber because they were questioning planning decisions.  Two of them were from the same party as the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.</p></speech>

The councillors in question had to go to the High Court in 2007 to uphold their democratic mandate.  It is clear that certain people were prepared to go to great lengths to shut up these councillors and conceal what was going on.  It is sometimes claimed that shortcuts in the planning process can bring benefits to local governance and job creation.  This is called benign corruption.  However, it is clear that the opposite occurred in the Wicklow and elsewhere.  A proposal to build a data centre in Newtownmountkennedy which would have brought a considerable number of jobs to County Wicklow was abandoned amidst questionable procedures and complications in the process.  So frustrated were the people behind this project that they subsequently built the centre in Athenry, County Galway.  Questions also arise for Wicklow County Council in regard to dumping and improper procurement processes, in respect of which the council has been fined.  It is vital that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government holds a full inquiry and makes the results public.  I would also like the Minister to outline the reasons why the former county manager was not allowed to serve a further three years in the position.  Was that due to the Minister's refusal to sanction an extension based on his knowledge of the issues arising?  A tepid review was undertaken by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, as opposed to the investigation put in train by a previous Minister, John Gormley.</p>  <p>  This Government has not done much to pursue its promised democratic revolution by introducing transparency to the planning process.  While John Gormley was still Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition, he began the process of establishing inquiries into planning in six local authorities.  However, these inquiries were abandoned by a later Minister, Phil Hogan, who established reviews rather than inquiries.  It was decided on foot of the reviews that there were insufficient grounds for a full inquiry.  This issue has been discussed on numerous occasions but we have still not heard an explanation as to why a full inquiry was not carried out.</p>  <p>  The then Minister, Phil Hogan, explained the failure to follow the approach instigated by John Gormley by claiming that it would have placed too much power into the hands of the Minister.  Ironically, the planning Bill which the Government now proposes to introduce will have precisely that effect by establishing an office of planning regulator which is subject to the overall rule and veto of a Minister.  We ask the Government to make good on its commitment by bringing forward legislation for an independent planning regulator, with similar powers to the Ombudsman.  Sometimes allegations are not true but we know there has been considerable corruption in the planning process and in the zoning of land by local authorities, including material contraventions and planning permissions granted under Part 8 and Part 10.  There may at times be good reasons for planning decisions but the documents I have seen lead me to suspect serious irregularities in the planning process in this State.  We need to put that right and stand over it.  People who are doing the right thing have nothing to fear from an open and transparent system.  We must make the planning process more accountable by instilling trust in the process of local government and in the planning system.  The Government's amendment does not provide the openness we need in this process.</p></speech>

Among his recommendations was the establishment of an independent planning regulator.  When the report was published in March 2012, the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, promised that the Government would establish a regulator but nothing has been done in the intervening years and the proposed scheme for the new planning Bill does not allow for the appointment of an independent regulator.  Saying it is so, as the Government attempts to do in the amendment to our motion, does not make it so.  We are not the only people who have recognised this deficit.</p>  <p>  We would be naive to believe that the corruption uncovered in the course of the Mahon tribunal was unique to Dublin.  None the less, we all hoped that corruption in planning would be a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, because of the failure to implement Mahon, serious irregularities continue to arise.  One of the most serious of these was brought to my attention by my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley, who met a number of people from County Wicklow who informed him of several cases, including one in which the value of a property earmarked for development was vastly increased in value through rezoning and compulsory purchase orders to facilitate the development.  The developers, Se&aacute;n Dunne and Sean Mulryan, were to be the chief beneficiaries.</p></speech>

Despite the fact that only a small number of people could have been aware of the contents of the file or had access to the Minister's office, I understand the mystery of who took this file remains unsolved.  Clearly there is something amiss in all of this.  I am not accusing the current Minister of involvement in anything underhand, but I am sure he will agree that the fact that someone with access to the highest offices of the State is in a position to remove sensitive files underscores the serious nature of this particular case.</p>  <p>  This turn of events must be properly investigated and fully explained.  I believe that a full inquiry into all matters related to the allegations surrounding planning irregularities in Wicklow should be held and these matters fully explored.  The only assurance for the future that such matters can be properly looked into is to implement in full the recommendation of the Mahon report and the proposal in our motion to establish a properly independent regulator with the necessary powers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.739" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200045#SS00400"><p>Planning is about more than policies and legislation.  Some would say it is a sacred trust placed on people to help support the way we live today while maintaining a clean, safe and healthy environment for this and future generations.</p>  <p>  I will focus on planning for infrastructural development, particularly in the context of energy.  Planning is part and parcel of developing energy policy in Ireland.  In many cases, particularly where projects are designated as critical infrastructure, there is a risk these projects will be railroaded through the planning by way of the critical infrastructure path.  This risk will be raised exponentially, for both citizens and Government agencies, if the dreaded TTIP-ISDS process is signed by US and EU bureaucrats.</p>  <p>  Nowadays, we talk about "energy citizens", but I am not sure we fully understand what these words mean, because up to now the public and its concerns have not been listened to and the public's suggestions have not influenced decisions made in regard to planning.  Therefore, the people are not "energy citizens".  Public participation at every stage of a project would foster partnership rather than opposition, but we have seen several controversies over the past decade and there has been huge opposition to projects that were designed to enhance the State's capacity.  These projects should have been good for our infrastructure, but they were mishandled.  I will mention some of these later.  Meaningful public consultation with host communities and Departments, investors and stakeholders is central to Sinn F&eacute;in's Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2014, currently awaiting Committee Stage.  This approach should be adopted for all pieces of major infrastructure development.</p>  <p>  If we want a prime example of bad planning for critical infrastructure and of how it should not be done, we need look no further than the Corrib gas project and the effect this project and how it was handled had on the community of Rossport and on Ireland's reputation at home and abroad.  This project is important because it is a dispute about the ownership and use of our natural resources and the benefits that arise for the people through the use of those resources.  The Rossport issue also illustrates the threats posed to local communities by a powerful coalition of State and capital, thereby raising questions of scalar politics and power.  The term "energy citizen" meant little to the people of Rossport.  They remain extremely fearful for their health and safety as the pressure of unprocessed gas flows through pipelines passing their homes.  What respect was shown for the people of Rossport?  The Rossport five had to do jail in order to seek respect.  Many people maintain that the Government was complicit in the failure to engage with the local community.  Local people felt they were ignored and abandoned by the Government and that private business was doing all the running, with the State doing its bidding. </p>  <p>  Public consultation is not the sole responsibility of private companies.  Governments and local authorities must also play an active role.  All of us, including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, must learn from the mistakes of the Corrib project and ensure they are never repeated.</p>  <p>  In regard to fracking, no EPA study or report can ever convince me fracking should be permitted anywhere on this island.  It is ironic the State is even considering such dangerous technology in an area where planning permission is routinely refused for individual family homes because of the risk of water contamination - "septic tank - no; poison-fracked well maybe".</p></speech>

However, it is clear from the details it has published that this proposal will not be as recommended by the Mahon tribunal.  In other words, the regulator will not be independent of the Minister, and the Minister will be under no obligation to abide by the regulator's recommendations.  It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in that holds this opinion.  The Irish Planning Institute pointed out, in response to the Government's proposals: "The final decision will rest with the Minister of the day and not the new regulator, demoting the regulator's role to that of an 'advisor'.  Advising is not regulating."</p>  <p>  On that basis, our proposal for an independent regulator answerable to the Oireachtas and appointed by an independent appointments board stands.  One of the reasons for calling for such an independent regulator relates not just to the matters investigated by Mahon, but to what has taken place under this Government's watch.  I refer specifically to the failure of the former Minister, Phil Hogan, to follow up properly on the Mahon report in terms of the transparency and accountability of the planning process.  First, the former Minister took the decision not to proceed with the full inquiry into planning irregularities that had been set in train by his predecessor, John Gormley.  He failed to take any action on issues arising from the Mahon report, or on claims that were made directly to him regarding irregularities in various local authority areas, including Wicklow.</p>  <p>  Recent evidence or public conversation regarding Denis O'Brien's acquisition of Siteserv and its subsequent winning of the water meter contract raises questions in many people's minds over O'Brien's relationship with Fine Gael, and with the former Minister, Phil Hogan, in particular.</p><p>That was not a subject of the Moriarty tribunal.  While not directly related to planning, it did arise from the general suspicions that surrounded the unhealthy relationship between certain wealthy individuals and the political process.  The failure of the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, to implement the Mahon tribunal recommendations on planning and on those connections in general prove, as does the Siteserv episode, that the unhealthy relationship still exists and that Fine Gael, in particular, does not want such matters, including recent planning issues, to be subject to scrutiny.  </p> <p> Mr. Hogan also presided over the continuing close relationship between certain people involved in the planning process and vested interests who retain the ability to have controversial proposals passed.  As Minister he appointed Mr. Conall Boland as deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. Boland had previously been a director of RPS Consultants, which had framed a number of controversial proposals that Mr. Boland, in his new role, voted to approve even against the objections of senior inspectors within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

Among the proposals was the waste incinerator at Poolbeg.  Mr. Boland was also present when An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved contested projects such as a property development in south Dublin and wind farms which the company of which he had been a director, RPS, had been central to proposing.  The former Minister, when questioned regarding his support for Mr. Boland, failed to adequately justify why someone with such conflicts of interest should have been appointed to such an important and sensitive position within the planning process.  As long as such unhealthy connections exist between those directly involved in controversial planning proposals and the planners themselves there will be a clear need for an independent regulatory system as is proposed in our motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.744" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200046#TT00400"><p>It is interesting that the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht today discussed the Government's recently published general scheme for a new planning bill that will include provision for the appointment of a planning regulator.  However, while it states that this is in response to the Mahon tribunal report's recommendation that such an office be established, it is clearly not as Mahon intended, namely, an independent entity with the power to make binding recommendations.  That point has also been raised by An Taisce and the Irish Planning Institute which support our call for an independent regulator.</p>  <p>  It is not clear from the Government's scheme whether the Minister could ignore the recommendations of the planning regulator, but the language suggests that this could be the case.  That ministerial veto and other restrictions on the power of the proposed regulator reduce it, to a large extent, to window dressing.  The regulator will not be answerable to a D&aacute;il committee.  This contradicts the assertion of the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, that the office would have to be curtailed in its powers in order to retain the primacy of the democratic process.  Surely, having the regulator appear before committee would boost its transparency and accountability.  It should also be pointed out that the Government has waited for four years to make any move towards fulfilling its promises with regard to planning.  Given the expected lifespan of the Government and the usual gap between such a scheme and actual legislation it must be asked if such legislation would be enacted before an election or will it be kicked further down the road.  </p>  <p>  The Government also claims that this is part of its much heralded boost to the construction sector in Construction 2020.  The number of local authority houses contained in the plan is totally inadequate to meet demand.  The failure to fully legislate on the basis of the Mahon tribunal report recommendations will leave us open to a repetition of irregularities that led to the Mahon tribunal itself.  Unless there is proper scrutiny and scope for independent reviews of planning procedures, there will always be the opportunity for unscrupulous developers and land owners to seek to manipulate the planning system.  The consequences are poorly thought out schemes at the expense of house owners and the community in general.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, does make a valid point in regard to the need not to override democratic procedures.  I believe they could be made compatible with an independent regulatory system.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the primacy of local development plans.  We support the full involvement of local communities in the planning procedure.  We must ensure that developments do not go ahead that will ultimately have negative consequences.  We have seen this all too often in the past and we have to ensure it does not continue into the future.  </p>  <p>  The more democratic and transparent the planning system becomes, the less need there will be for a regulator.  Such an office would play a vital role in reviewing planning decisions where issues arise.  An independent regulator would also play a key role in investigating cases, such as Deputy Stanley has referred to, where there is a clear suspicion of irregularities.  To conclude, I ask that all sides support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and revise the proposed restrictions on the planning regulator.  That would make it truly independent, as recommended by Mahon and as supported by the vast majority of Members on this side of the House and, indeed, until quite recently by both Fine Gael and Labour.</p></speech>

The Government is strongly of the view that a properly functioning, responsive, visionary, transparent and publicly accountable planning process is not only a fundamental requirement but a prerequisite for a modem successful economy like Ireland's.  We are committed to ensuring that as a country we learn from past mistakes and build on the strengths of Ireland's planning process in leading the way on further developing our planning process.  On the occasion of this debate, I wish to bring us back to what former Minister of State for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, stated in response to the publication of the final report of the tribunal:<blockquote>The evidence given during the hearings and the conclusions of the report have rightly apportioned blame to those who received corrupt payments, frustrated the work of the tribunal and undermined our planning process.  Planning corruption is not a faceless crime, it affects the welfare of families and communities for decades.</blockquote>I am determined to continue to act on the findings and recommendations of the final report and ensure that our planning system is never again deflected from serving the common good by greed and shortsightedness but instead is designed and operated with the best interests of our country and people at its heart.  For too long this was not the case.  It is important to recall, as the tribunal did, that there are fundamental differences between the current planning regime and that prevailing at the time the planning tribunal first started its work over 15 years ago, looking at the events of the mid-1990s.  Substantial reform in 2000 and again in 2010 have transformed the shape of the planning process and, particularly, the land use zoning process into the more evidence-based and plan-led system we have today.  Publication of the national spatial strategy in 2002 and regional planning guidelines in 2004 and again in 2010 have created a new hierarchy of plans that co-ordinate the planning functions of local authorities at local level.  As Minister, I have exercised my powers in regard to ensuring consistency of these plans and policies at national, regional and local levels, as indeed have my immediate predecessors, a function that was unknown of in the period which was the focus of the Mahon tribunal's work.  If past governments were as attentive as this Government in fulfilling this sort of role, a planning tribunal may never have arisen in the first place.</p><p>Nevertheless, looking more closely at the ten planning related recommendations in the tribunal's report, major progress has been made and will continue to be made in implementing them.</p> <p> Without question, the tenth and final planning recommendation of the tribunal is the most fundamental, dealing with the establishment of an independent planning regulator.  In this one recommendation the tribunal is essentially stating to legislators that, notwithstanding the progress made in recent years in tightening up a previously lax system, the planning process needs a further element of independent oversight.  Furthermore, the recommendation is calling for an oversight function with the appropriate legal mandate and resources to determine whether plans are in compliance with legal requirements and, if not, to determine what intervention may be necessary where serious policy departures have taken place or where there is strong evidence of bad practice or systemic failure.  I am committed to the publication of the second of two planning Bills during this D&aacute;il session which will deal with the establishment of an independent office of the planning regulator and other planning related recommendations of the tribunal.  I have no doubt that the Bill will be the subject of intense discussion, as it should be, as it progresses through the Oireachtas.  I look forward to this as the Bill will provide for a significant new addition to the institutional structures in Ireland's planning system.</p> <p> The regulator's primary functions will be the evaluation and assessment of plans and strategies and, ultimately, providing advice for the Minister; undertaking research and providing education and training in the planning area; and undertaking reviews of the organisation and systems and procedures applied by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of their planning functions under the Planning and Development Acts.  The core function of the new regulator will relate to the evaluation and assessment of local plans and regional strategies, including on land zoning, and making recommendations to the Minister on these matters.  Where the Minister agrees with the recommendations of the regulator, he or she will issue appropriate directions or instructions to the relevant local authority on the steps that should be taken regarding the revision of the relevant plan or strategy.  Significantly, where the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the regulator, which I envisage will be rare, he or she will be required to explain the reasons for such disagreement and lay such reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas and place them on the Department's website, all in the interests of increased transparency.</p> <p> There are those who wish to see the regulator assume the powers that I hold as Minister in relation to the power of direction over local authority development plans.  However, the Government, many other elected representatives and I believe this to be a step too far in removing democratic oversight and accountability in the policy making process.  Our proposals for independent scrutiny of plans and transparency of decision making in that context by Ministers represent a fair and balanced approach.  It is also important to note, however, that the Minister's current powers, or those of a future regulator, do not replace the appropriate role of the Garda in investigating specific allegations of corrupt payments or practices.</p> <p> The detailed drafting of the Bill's provisions regarding the establishment of the independent regulator is being progressed by my Department.  Work to address other recommendations made in the tribunal's report is also being advanced and I would like to update the House in this regard.  Recommendation No. 1 on placing the national spatial strategy on a statutory footing, recommendation No. 5 on increased transparency in the planning process, recommendation No. 6 on material contraventions and, to an extent, recommendation No. 8 on regional and local authority procedures are all being provided for in the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill which is being drafted.</p> <p> Recommendation No. 2 on regional authorities has been considered in the context of Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government and the Local Government Reform Act 2014 which brought about further local government reform, including the regional dimension.  Recommendation No. 3 on regional authorities, now the new regional assemblies, is already provided for in secondary legislation.  Recommendation No. 4 is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Recommendation No. 7 on the use of section 140 which gives elected Members power to direct the chief executive no longer applies to planning functions on foot of its amendment in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  The remaining recommendation, No. 9, on applicants for planning permission declaring political donations is being considered in the context of updating the planning application process.</p> <p> The recommendations continue to be studied closely and considered carefully by my Department in the context of the preparation and finalisation of the planning Bill.  There is a large measure of broad agreement that what is proposed involves sensible and necessary measures to improve accountability, transparency and fairness in the planning process.  I, therefore, assure the House that the tribunal's planning related recommendations are being addressed and I look forward to further debate on the matter when the relevant legislation is brought before the House in due course.</p> <p> Members of this House will be mindful of the legacy planning complaints for which former Minister John Gormley initiated a planning review which was intended to assess the application of planning legislation, policy and guidance within the development plan and development management systems at local level and to inform further policy development in these areas.  It is important to recognise that in the context of progressing this review, a number of planning authorities, representing a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas, as well as both large and small authorities, were selected to assist in the review of policies and practices and by reference to a number of cases raised with my Department.  The planning review report of June 2012 was assessed by an independent planning expert, Mr. Hank van der Kamp.  This independent evaluation was published in March 2013 and generally supported the Department's recommendations in its 2012 report and included some additional recommendations.  Notwithstanding this, it was decided, in order to ensure maximum transparency and integrity for the planning system generally, to appoint independent consultants, MacCabe Durney Barnes, on a statutory basis to conduct a review of the application of planning practices and procedures in six of the seven local authorities, namely, Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath county councils and Cork and Dublin city councils, included in the planning review report prepared in June 2012.</p> <p> The consultants are at an advanced stage of finalising their independent review which also involves consultation with each of the original complainants and all of the planning authorities concerned in preparing their report.  I expect to receive the final report by the end of June and intend to carefully consider any further recommendation that emerges from it.  After I have completed my consideration of the report, I will issue a public statement, including any appropriate action to be pursued in regard to further policy development and guidance, while also taking account of the need to develop wider proposals for improving the transparency and openness of the planning system as recommended in the tribunal's report.  Furthermore, my Department is finalising arrangements for the imminent appointment of a senior counsel, on a non-statutory basis, nominated by the Attorney General to prepare a report on planning matters in respect of Donegal County Council.  The arrangements involved will be announced shortly.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the requirement to quickly advance the recommendations of the planning tribunal, the Government is also keenly aware of the strong synergy between the need to have an effective planning system and overcoming our economic challenges as we put the country on the path to sustainable growth.  In addition to the legislation in relation to the planning tribunal, we are focused on advancing the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill which is aimed primarily at addressing the housing supply shortage that is particularly acute in the Dublin area and the conurbation around Dublin and as a visible commitment to the Government's Construction 2020 strategy published in May 2014.</p> <p> The main provisions of the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill are the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing; retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges; the introduction of a vacant site levy; and "use or lose it" provisions on planning permissions.  The new Part V proposals should assist in making new residential developments more economically viable, thereby enabling developments to be brought on stream sooner than would otherwise might be the case.  The revisions should also enable Part V to again be a significant contributor to social housing provision.  The vacant site levy will enable local authorities to better link regeneration and development objectives with more effective use of vacant land and properties and demand a more proactive, almost portfolio management, approach by local authorities to urban land.  Reductions of development contributions and enabling local authorities to introduce &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; clauses in planning permission for housing developments are designed to activate more housing developments.  We are, therefore, anxious that the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill be enacted as urgently as possible with the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill to be enacted by the end of 2015.</p> <p> Policy development by the Government regarding planning has also been addressed in addition to the legislative enhancements I have outlined.  The Government wants to ensure we enter a new era of high quality policy making allied to more co­ordinated approaches to development enabled by the highest standards of customer service and public confidence in the probity, effectiveness and citizen centred nature of the practice of planning in Ireland.</p><p>The recently published and broadly welcomed planning policy statement provides for a concise and clear statement on the purpose of planning, the values and principles we want to underpin planning and a vision for what the Government wants to deliver.</p> <p> An organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also to be advanced.  Since its establishment in 1976, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has become known, both at home and abroad, for peerless standards of fairness, probity and transparency.  At the same time, its role and remit has been growing while its external operational environment has become more litigious and complex.  The board's demanding operational context suggests a need to reflect on its internal systems, deliver enhanced ICT capability, including online appeals facilities and geographical information systems, as well as pursuing active strategies for staff training and development and exposure to their wider operational environment.  Accordingly, an organisationally focused external review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la provides a significant opportunity for this much respected State body.  I believe this was necessary and, hence, I initiated this review.  No one should have anything but an optimistic view of how or what that review might identify because the Government wants to further develop and support the crucial role the board plays in delivering fairness and certainty, especially in its timelines.</p> <p> I also intend to shortly publish arrangements for the preparation of a new national planning framework to succeed the national spatial strategy which will require considerable consultation with other Departments, State agencies and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, as well as an appropriate level of public consultation prior to the submission of the final strategy to the Oireachtas.  The national planning framework will set the strategic agenda for planning, taking account of our wider island, European and global contexts, as well as co-ordinating policies and investment decisions in areas such as regional competitiveness, urban and rural development, transport, energy and communications, natural resource development, well-being, climate change and environmental quality.  The national planning framework will represent the Government's policy on how nationally significant planning matters should be addressed by relevant Departments and Government agencies.</p> <p> The framework will also represent the spatial expression of the Government's wider economic and reform agenda as it applies to the key zones of economic activity and their urban and rural components that drive economic and social progress.  The framework will also identify national developments and other nationally strategic development opportunities, as well as an action programme for progress.</p> <p> The newly shaped regional assemblies will be preparing regional spatial and economic strategies in tandem with the preparation of the framework.  These strategies are also being provided with legal and administrative underpinning to ensure they will be effective and followed through by all relevant public sector bodies, particularly those with responsibility for economic development and enterprise promotion.  All relevant agencies will be accountable to the regional assemblies for adherence to the economic aspects of the regional spatial and economic strategies, ensuring a coherent and collaborative approach to economic development across each region rather than, for example, different areas competing for the same investment project.</p> <p> Some Deputies referred to issues concerning Wicklow County Council.  As I am considering these issues, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment until such time every issue has been considered.</p> <p> Taking account of both the tribunal's findings and recent experiences, I believe better planning will be achieved.  This will be through an evidence-based approach for future needs, whether for housing, office space, retailing or infrastructure.  These will be agreed strategically and matched by strategic planning at government level through the appropriate national strategies and sectorial investment plans.  We will refocus on revitalising our city and town centres, moving against the past tendency to envisage extensive, even sprawling extensions, of our cities and towns, drawing the lifeblood out of older, established central urban areas.  Local authorities will use the core strategy approach to tackle the legacy of historical and systemic overzoning, ensuring all zoning is based on a quantifiable need that is community-based rather than developer-led.  We will move instead towards a more co-ordinated and joined-up approach to the delivery of essential public services such as schools, public transport, water services using the local plan as the template.</p> <p> Listening to the various initiatives under way, Members will agree that after a lean period of planning and development activity, the Government is engaged across an unprecedented array of legislative, policy development and organisational reforms designed to return our planning system to its roots as a process fundamentally focused on the interests of the common good.  It will be a process in which people can be confident and depend on to deliver the sustainable communities and quality of life for which we all strive and deserve.  No longer will we have the games of the past.  We are putting in an infrastructure and planning process to build for the future.</p></speech>

For eight years, I was a member of Limerick County Council, a predominantly rural council.  Those of us from rural areas know more than better than those in urban areas about issues around planning.  We have certainly borne the brunt of many inconsistencies.</p>  <p>  The main thrust of this motion is a politicised attack on the Government for one reason or the other.  Maybe it is to deflect attention from other matters.  None of the Opposition contributors referred to some of the messes the Government has already cleared up such as pyrite and the firetrap that was Priory Hall.  Priory Hall was built by somebody with a strong connection to a political party opposite.</p></speech>

The Government was left to clear up the problem.  Deputy Stanley will have an opportunity when summing up tomorrow night to condemn the people who built Priory Hall and who put unsuspecting home owners into a firetrap which was then left to this Government to take them out of.  In his summing up, Deputy Stanley might also acknowledge some of the work the Government has done in undoing what was done by unscrupulous developers, not only connected to one Opposition party but to several.</p>  <p>  The Minister has outlined the legislative proposal for a planning regulator.  A planning regulator is important because not only will it provide a watchdog for elected members of local authorities and officials, development plans and zoning, but also for the implementation of those plans.  Nobody should be above the law, regardless of their affiliations or otherwise.  When one sees obvious planning discrepancies being left unchallenged by local authorities and reams of applications being made for retention that are put on a merry-go-round in some cases by local authorities, it begs the question as to what they are doing.  One can walk into ghost estates in some parts of this country and wonder to oneself was there any planning authority supervising what was built.  One can travel through towns where Georgian facades to buildings have been destroyed.  Again, one wonders was there any planning authority in the area.  Was it because the group of people involved in this particular element of building were above the law that they could get away with it?</p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of a planning regulator.  However, it should be open to the citizen and third parties to draw attention to failings of local authorities to implement their own planning decisions.</p><p>We know of instances concerning Part 8 where planning applications granted by local authorities were not even completed, yet they will slap enforcement orders on people for simple, innocuous things.  We have come from a difficult situation concerning a total lack of trust by citizens in the planning process and those who lived with the consequences in places such as Priory Hall.  It is important for us to move on robustly and in this respect I welcome the commitment to establish a planning regulator.</p> <p> I would like to draw attention to another group, however, and the Minister might share my view as he comes from a rural constituency.  These are third-party, prescribed organisations that are unelected and accountable to nobody.  People cannot join them even if they have a vested interest, but they seem to churn out observations to beat the band on planning applications that bear no resemblance to where they live.  They are not from the area, yet in many cases they are destroying the economic viability of many projects.</p> <p> The Minister will be well aware of a particular instance in my constituency recently.  It concerned a project that hopefully will deliver 150 jobs to the Port of Foynes.  The project went through a detailed environmental examination by the local authority and the local community broadly welcomed it.  Yet, lo and behold, after planning permission was granted, third-party objectors, none of whom was local, landed in and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> As the Minister comes from an area not too dissimilar to my own, I urge him to act in this regard.  I have put up with this sort of baloney for the last 20 years, whereby a third-party organisation can destroy a person's right to live, work and rear a family in the country.  As I also told the Minister's predecessor, the oxygen needs to be turned off for these people.  If they want to continue treating people in rural areas as pariahs, they should not do it on the backs of taxpayers.  It is about time that the revenue stream into that organisation was stopped once and for all.</p> <p> I am sick of people interfering who are not resident in my county and do not know the local people or the fabric of the local community.  The only time they were a part of rural Ireland was when they looked out the window and thought it was some sort of game reserve that should be visited at the weekend.  Those people have done untold damage to rural communities.  It is about time that someone in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government took them on.  I hope the Minister is the person to do so.</p> <p> I have no problem with sustainable development or third-party objections, but I have a major difficulty with vexatious objections.  The same people churn out this sort of palaver time after time because they want our rural communities to be maintained akin to the home counties in England, somewhere one visits at the weekend and then returns to the city on Sunday evening.</p> <p> The Northern Ireland administration went down that road once upon a time, banning one-off rural housing.  There is a group of people in Dublin 4, the leafy suburb set, who also want to do that in this jurisdiction.  Up to now, they have gone unchallenged and unchecked by any government.  It is about time somebody took them on and said, once and for all, they can put forward third-party objections, but to do so like everybody else, within the statutory time period.</p> <p> We should not have a system where a person thinks he or she has obtained planning permission, yet the next day receive a letter from the local authority stating: "Congratulations, you've won a trip to An Bord Plean&aacute;la."  A person could be stuck there for months and God only knows how long it would take to come out of it.  In addition, there is no timeframe to deal with such matters.</p> <p> We have seen objections to roads and other strategic infrastructure in the name of protecting snails, birds and others things.  It has gone on long enough.  Anybody currently looking at this country as a place to invest outside Dublin would say we have to take on the birds, bees and muesli brigade first before we will be able to create a job.  This is happening in communities that were devastated by the actions of the previous Government.  They lost their jobs and went to Australia or hung on for dear life in the hope that they might be able to sustain a future for their families.</p> <p> If there is going to be proper planning legislation in this country it needs to take account of what communities like the one I represent want, not what the people in Merrion Row or Waterloo Road think they might want.  The people who sent me, the Minister and other Deputies from rural constituencies here, expect the Government to take on unelected vested interests.  They have destroyed rural communities for long enough.  They have told us the type of house we can have, including height and location restrictions.  This sort of thing has gone on for so long that people are frustrated.  The public want accountability but they will not get it while a prescribed organisation, which is protected under the Planning Acts, can object on a wing and a prayer.  It can thus destroy a person's right to live, work and rear their family in a rural community.</p> <p> I welcome what the Minister said about vacant land.  The towns the Minister represents, including Borrisokane, Borrisoleigh and Clonmel, are similar to towns in my constituency.  There are concerns about vacant sites.  I am glad the Minister specified urban areas, but I am concerned about the population threshold of such areas, although I know he will go for the right level.</p> <p> I also welcome the steps concerning development levies.  Local authorities have been bound by ridiculous legislation whereby they cannot vary development levies.  Anything that will reduce such levies to a sustainable level, allowing jobs to be created in rural areas, is welcome.</p> <p> I welcome the amended motion as this is an opportune time to talk about planning generally.  The last national spatial strategy was a kind of "whatever you're having yourself" affair.  It was a scatter-gun approach to planning with a bit for everybody involved with Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs at the time.  This needs to be done on a proper, fair and accountable basis.  It should not exclude constituencies like my own because we do not have a seat at the Cabinet table.  I know the Minister will not do that.</p> <p> I look forward to the legislation being published.  I hope, however, that the Minister will take on the protected species who launch third-party objections because they have been around for long enough. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.752" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="21:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200049#WW00200"><p>I commend the Sinn F&eacute;in motion which Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting.  Back in 2012, we proposed a similar motion in response to the Mahon tribunal report.  If that position had been adopted then we would be a lot further on than we currently are.</p>  <p>  That said, I do acknowledge that there has been a lot of progress as outlined in the Minister's script.  I am intrigued, however, because this obviously slipped through the Labour and Fine Gael press offices.  He spoke of substantial reform in 2000 and again in 2010 which has transformed the shape of the planning process and particularly the land use re-zoning process.  That is not bad for a Government that was supposed to have wrecked the country.  Every time the Minister talks about planning he normally does not refer to that kind of work that was done, but I welcome that acknowledgement.</p>  <p>  So many issues are being reviewed in the context of the economic collapse that planning decisions around the country must be among them.  While we have a banking inquiry, some thought also needs to be given to over-planning and unsuitable planning.  In his remarks, the Minister said that work is under way with a view to appointing a regulator.  It should be done so that we do not end up in a situation again where Members of this House will in future have to deal with issues such as flooding, pyrite and lack of services.</p>  <p>  We recently dealt with a Private Members' business item concerning speeding in housing estates.  That kind of thing, however, should be the purview of a properly functioning planning process that is in tune with the needs of communities it purports to represent.</p>  <p>  I heard the end of Deputy O'Donovan's tirade and found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said.  That is not a normal condition for me and I hope there is some treatment for it.  There are serious issues concerning the Minister's role in interpreting and reviewing county development plans, particularly where the Minister issues directions to a local authority forcing it to revise the plan.  Local authority representatives are directly elected by their communities and are directly accountable to them every five years.</p><p>They must stand up and defend their position, role and decisions.  A Minister or a Minister's officials are far removed from those communities and the impact of their decision on communities.  If we are serious about reforming local government, we must give it the power to make decisions for communities.</p> <p> I make no apology for representing a rural area.  I have just come from a phone call to a community in north Mayo of approximately 1,900 people where the HSE apparently cannot get a GP.  There are 22 practices in rural communities around the country where the HSE apparently cannot get a GP.  It is not restricted to finding GPs, as there are issues with post offices, schools and a range of services leaving rural communities.  At the same time, people who are trying to develop these communities and sustain them by allowing families to live and make their homes there are being frustrated, in many cases, by restrictive development plans that arise with input from a Department that does not understand the community.</p> <p> The Minister of State is from an urban area but the need of a community is the same in an urban area as in a rural area.  He was involved with a very high-profile planning issue regarding the proposed incinerator, and he can understand what communities feel.  In rural areas, one cannot get permission for a family home but a semi-State company can land a few turbines beside a house.  A semi-State company can build forestry around communities and plough forest roads but when a family wishes to build a house, it is put through the hoops.  As a result of the new building regulations from last year, people may be forced to do archaeological reports and a range of actions before one even begins building.  By the time a family gets an agent, planning advice and all the reports, it could be spending up to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000 before a bit of concrete goes into the ground.  Nobody has that any more, and why are we looking for it?  Why are we taking the trust that we have in our local authorities away by implementing regulations and constraining our local authorities?</p> <p> I know there is a debate within certain circles about the cost of providing services to rural areas, and if permission is granted, services are required.  That is part of the issue.  We should have a system where we would not have to wait until 2020 to get broadband to the furthest reaches of the country.  I accept we were in government at the time but we should have decided ten years ago that it would have been installed.  We should decide now that new technologies that will be essential for living will be a major part of developing communities.  Technology and community do not have to be in conflict all the time, and technology can sustain and encourage communities.  Broadband Internet and 4G technology has made it possible for people to work from home while they have a job based in this city; they can work from County Mayo or any rural county.  These people are kept in the community, which benefits from the value of family, and the person's enthusiasm can be harnessed.</p> <p> There has been a tendency to forget the seriousness of the tribunal reports, including their conclusions.  The publication of those reports was a dark day for this House and appropriate action was taken.  It was a darker day for the communities and the people now living in them.  They are going without services that were never built and sub-standard housing.  I know the pyrite scheme, although linked to the building boom rather than bad planning, is an example of an attempt to deal with this issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State's Department of Social Protection could consider schemes or community support measures to help develop communities.  The residents of the estates that are away from everywhere could partake in a community audit in order to develop services, perhaps using unemployed residents within the estates who may be unemployed but who may have the requisite skills to help.  There could be a community investment fund for everybody's individual community.  There is definitely something in this, particularly with regard to services.  We are often approached to help deal with problems of unfinished lights, paths and roads.  I remember a case some years ago when we were able to get the council to return a bond to us and the people in the estate who were in various trades were able to come together on a co-operative basis and complete the services for a fraction of what it would normally have cost.  If that kind of operation could be put in place around the country, we could start bringing facilities and standards up to scratch and investing in the communities that are victims of a bad planning process.</p> <p> It is very important that we acknowledge the changes that have happened, as noted by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, earlier.  We should acknowledge that the transparency of the planning system is far more robust now than it ever has been.  We need to ensure that the recommendations of the final report of the tribunal is implemented in full.  I am intrigued by the notion that the Minister has two planning Bills for this D&aacute;il session, which has two months to go.  Let us not rush this.  We must bring in the regulator - that is important - and the Government has had four years to do it.  I get the sense that much legislation will be rushed through in the next few weeks, which will lead to mistakes being made.  We should remember that with planning legislation, a word or phrase inserted as an amendment will have a direct impact on somebody's life in a way that some other legislation we produce here does not.  When the building regulations now choking home building, and specifically single house building, around the country were discussed, some people on this side of the House tried to point out the difficulties, including the cost.  However, people did not realise the extent of what is now happening.</p> <p> Those building regulations have much to answer for, particularly if people are wondering why house building is so slow.  They are choking the process and adding enormous expense to people at the most expensive time of their lives.  Let us not rush the next phase of planning legislation.  We must ensure it can be properly debated in the House.  This time of the year is guillotine season and I worry that when we return after the by-election and referendum, legislation will appear and be guillotined.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment when wrapping up tomorrow night that given the poor record of planning, we will not guillotine planning legislation and the provisions to improve it.  We must ensure that when we proceed with an independent regulator, we should do so in the spirit proposed and with regard to what people believe.  The independent regulator must be accountable to somebody as well, and the problem is we have set up so many regulators who are accountable to nobody.  There must be accountability for this regulator in particular.</p></speech>

T&aacute; cuid de na fadhbanna seo ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh inni&uacute;.  There is absolutely no doubt there have been planning decisions in this country that have been disastrous for communities, certain areas and, at times, for the country as a whole.  There was an expectation that there would be progress and that the promises made on the reviews into planning in certain local authorities would be met.  Equally, it was expected that there would be a much better era of accountability and transparency.  Progress has been extremely slow, so it is good that Sinn F&eacute;in has brought this motion to the Chamber tonight for debate.</p>  <p>  I will consider two issues in my constituency, or three if I have time.  The most glaring matter is the current and long-standing issue of Moore Street, an area of historical and cultural significance.  It was first allowed by the local authority to fall into dereliction for many years and then it was sold, lock, stock and barrel to a private developer.  If the so-called boom had continued, we would have another massive shopping centre at Moore Street in the midst of all the others in the area.  This part of Dublin is of great historic significance and potential, as opposed to the one-sided view of culture evident in Temple Bar, has been failed by our planning system.  That system has also failed the people who gave their lives in the Easter Rising.  As a result of the planning process, today on Moore Street there are multinational supermarkets and tacky establishments that are undermining the genuine and long-standing tradition of Moore Street traders.</p>  <p>  Another scandal in Dublin Central relates to Aldborough House, which is the second-biggest private Georgian residence in Dublin.  We are standing in the largest such residence.  The property had various uses over the past 200 years before being sold to a property developer whose company went into liquidation.  I am not sure if the developer's lifestyle went into liquidation but the property is now going to rack and ruin.  I am not sure if he is getting a fine salary from the State but developers should be responsible for the properties they bought, regardless of the state of their companies.  If there is any money coming into those developers, it should be used to secure the properties so they are not left to the local authority, which in this case is Dublin City Council.</p><p>The third one is in the docklands.  The Minister of State and I both know about some of the disasters there where communities were left fighting for survival against the planners and developers.</p> <p> I listened to the Minister outline some of his plans.  The Mahon tribunal sat for ten years and cost &euro;97 million.  What did it achieve?  Some of the problems identified are still there.  Unless there is real progress on this issue, there will be another boom and bust cycle and we will see more people evading taxes and putting their money into property.  Already we can see certain sectors looking for restrictions to be lifted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-12a.757" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200051#YY00200"><p>The Mahon tribunal lasted 15 years and cost &euro;159 million in total.  It resulted in a 3,270 page report and had a history of quashed findings and reversed cost orders.  It was the longest running public inquiry in the history of the State and played a part in the public's diminished belief that accountability could be achieved.  The Government has not taken the tribunal seriously.  It has only partly incorporated some of its recommendations, while ignoring the rest.  It is a poor record for a Government that campaigned for political reform and further damages the public's belief in the accountability of those in power.</p>  <p>  Under the current planning Acts, planning has become a complex and convoluted process, leading to a lack of transparency in the sector.  There are also a number of concerns about the general scheme of the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill 2014.  I support this Private Member's motion as it brings to light many of those concerns, the most pressing of which is the establishment of a planning regulator.  While the general scheme sets out that the planning regulator shall be independent in the performance of his or her functions, in fact, he or she will not be independent.  The scheme states the planning regulator should be appointed by the Minister and states the Minister and the planning regulator shall consult together on matters pertaining to the functions of the office.  The scheme does not list the bodies that will be regulated by the proposed planning regulator.</p>  <p>  In this case, Irish Water is not listed.  There are concerns about Irish Water's role in the development and management of spatial strategies.  Given that it will have the ability to facilitate, delay or prevent development, how will its decision-making power be made accountable in the context of planning and development?  Will Irish Water be accountable to the office of the planning regulator?  Head 34 of the scheme contains a proposal to amend legislation to state Irish Water have regard to any opinion of the Minister on the national and regional order of priority to the planning and development requirements of local authority development plans.  The concern is that if the planning regulator is not entirely independent of the Government, as stated in the scheme, there is a potential conflict of interest.  Will the national spatial strategy and regional planning guidelines have regard to Irish Water and, if so, to what extent?</p>  <p>  These questions are not addressed.  As such, it is timely that the Private Members' motion forces the Government to answer them.  The level of public trust is at a new low.  The general scheme was an opportunity to reinvigorate trust in accountable and transparent institutions.  The establishment of Irish Water in the first place raised questions about its structure and execution, but the general scheme still does not address how Irish Water will be effectively regulated and incorporated into the planning system.  The question is how the public can ever trust public bodies again.  I suspect they will not be able to in light of this.  Next year's election might reflect this even more.</p></speech>
