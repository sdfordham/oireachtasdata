Their deaths illustrate the serious nature of the devastating storm and the importance of the work of first responders and the national emergency co-ordination group, chaired by Mr. Sean Hogan.  I pay tribute to them and Mr. Hogan who calmly and diligently, with all those involved, worked to protect the people and minimise the damage, above all, to them and, secondly, to property.  First responders deserve great credit - members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, fire service personnel, members of the Army and Civil Defence, as well as the ESB and, particularly, local authorities, local councils, which co-ordinated the emergency efforts at county and local level, again to minimise loss of live and damage.  The national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, with TV3, local radio stations and the media, played a very important public service role in disseminating information to the public at large.  Above all, Met &Eacute;ireann played a very important role.  It nailed it in its forecasting in advance of the storm and its work throughout to keep people briefed.  If any organisation deserves substantial resources from here on, it is Met &Eacute;ireann.  I put it to the Taoiseach that this needs to happen.</p>  <p>  In the light of this, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of our preparations for and response to Storm Ophelia will take place.  That is important when an event of this magnitude occurs.  We know that ESB crews are out bravely restoring power to people's homes.  Water supplies and so on are also being restored.  I also ask that a national audit be undertaken by the local authorities.  Will the Taoiseach initiate such an audit in the context of providing ring-fenced funding to deal with damaged and dangerous trees.  Many communities and pensioners will not be in a position to fund the cutting down of dangerous trees, of which there will be many around the country because of the impact of the storm.</p><p>It would be useful to undertake a comprehensive audit of the response and ring-fence funding, in addition to ordinary local authority funds, to undertake that comprehensive work.</p> <p> Yesterday's storm is a reminder that the Atlantic is warming and that the frequency and intensity of storms such as this will increase.  I do not wish to be political in the context of the national effort which was made, but Ireland is not meeting its climate change targets and we must step up our efforts significantly to respond to them.  </p> <p> Is the Taoiseach interested in working with other parties in this House to review legislation to make it an offence to disobey safety warnings during a major weather event such as this?  There was a lot of anger yesterday that the lives of first responders had been put at risk by needless activity.  It is important that, as the Legislature, this House show cause by protecting first responders and creating a far greater awareness of the dangers inherent in such reckless activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700004#B00200"><p>It is always possible to learn lessons and strengthen future responses in the case of a national emergency.  Today the Cabinet decided that it would undertake a full evaluation of our response once the clean-up was complete and power and water had been restored to everyone in the country.  It will take place prior to the next meeting of the Office of Emergency Planning in November.</p>  <p>  I very much agree with the Deputy's sentiments about people disobeying safety warnings.  Not only did those who disobeyed safety warnings put themselves at risk, but they also risked the lives of members of the emergency services.  There were two incidents yesterday which almost cost the lives of members of the emergency services and we were close to many more fatalities than were suffered yesterday.  It was the worst storm to hit Ireland in 50 years or more.  It was the first time there was a national alert which was declared on Sunday, 15 October at 1 p.m.  As the Deputy noted, the storm did take three lives, those of Clare O'Neill, Fintan Goss and Michael Pyke.  Everyone in the House offers his or her condolences to their families, friends, communities and all those grieving today.</p>  <p>  What I witnessed on Sunday and yesterday was public service at its very best.  We can all be very proud of the public service today.  The national emergency co-ordination centre and the national emergency co-ordination group worked very well.  I extend my particular thanks to the staff who all continue to work from Kildare Street today, the emergency services, local authority staff, the staff of Departments, Met &Eacute;ireann, the transport companies, health service staff who worked extra shifts and often covered shifts for others who were unable to get to work, the Defence Forces, volunteers, including those in Civil Defence and many others.  Decisions were made swiftly and communicated well.  As a result the loss of life and limb was minimised.  Today the clean-up is under way; roads are being made passable, while homes and businesses without power are being reconnected.  Some 170,000 homes and businesses have been reconnected since 3 p.m. yesterday.  There are 6,700 staff and contractors on the ground assisting in the clean-up and making repairs.  </p>  <p>  This morning's Cabinet meeting discussed routine business and also Storm Ophelia.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, updated the Cabinet on this morning's meeting of the national emergency co-ordination group which he had attended on the Government's behalf.  We have informed local authorities that they will receive additional resources to enable them to continue with the clean-up and that the provision of additional resources needed for road and infrastructure repairs will be considered in the normal way once they have been assessed and costed.  The Defence Forces remain available to assist and aid the civil power on request.</p>  <p>  Some 515,000 homes and businesses remain without power.  By tomorrow morning all will have an indicative date for reconnection.  Most will be reconnected within three to four days, but in some cases it may take up to ten days.  Extra crews are coming here from Britain, Northern Ireland and France.  I ask people to bear in mind that it is highly specialised work which cannot be done by anyone, only by trained staff and we must always ensure their health and safety.  </p>  <p>  Schools will reopen tomorrow when school buses will run as normal.  The national emergency co-ordination group will continue to meet.</p><p>When it comes to water supplies there are about 80,000 homes without water, but tankers are being deployed as necessary in areas where water is not available.</p></speech>

I referenced a specific project in terms of eliminating dangerous trees.  It is an important issue as traditionally there can be a patchy response and some councils are better than others.  Some households are not in a position to respond and an opportunity could be taken now to do a once-off national audit and assessment and intervention on the specific issue.</p><p>There is a good article this morning by Harry McGee in <i>The Irish Times</i>on the draft national adaptation plan and the need for the State to step up its investment in adaptation to prepare for such storms and their impact.  This will need investment.  When will the plan be finalised?  It is important in the budgetary and Estimates context that not only is it published but that work is undertaken on delivering it.  It is important in terms of preparation for future storms.</p><p>We are on target to miss our targets, if the House will excuse the pun, by 2020.  This does not reflect well on us as a country.  If anything, this storm, notwithstanding many sceptics, some in this House and elsewhere, shows there is an issue we cannot shirk any longer as a nation.</p></speech>

The national mitigation plan on climate change was published-----</p></speech>

In terms of our response to climate change, Deputies will be aware of the budget announcements yesterday, which included provision for special incentives to encourage more people to use electric vehicles, additional funding for cycling infrastructure throughout the State, funding for the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to bring in the renewable heating initiative to move towards renewable heat, and, by the end of the year, he will bring in price supports for other forms of renewable energy so we can increase the amount.  The ten year capital plan will, of course, have to take into account the need to adapt to climate change, for example, electrification of some of our railways and other such investments and further investment in flood defences and other such adaptions, recognising the fact that while we cannot put any one storm down to climate change it is a scientific fact that we will see more storms and more severe weather events in the years ahead so we need to prepare for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700005#C00600"><p>I join with the Taoiseach and all of the House in our expressions of sympathy to and solidarity with the families and loved ones of Clare O'Neill, Michael Pyke and Fintan Goss.  I also recognise the enormous efforts of our emergency services, our first responders, those organisations that deal with the homeless, ESB crews, public transport teams, people working in the health services and everybody who pulled together in the course of this weather event to keep us all safe.  I also acknowledge communities the length and breadth of the land which will never lose their capacity to care about their neighbours and to keep an eye where necessary.</p>  <p>  I want to return to the issue of the unfair changes that were made to the eligibility for the State pension.  The changes were made and the consequences were known at the time to the Government.</p><p>It was well understood that they would have a disproportionate impact on women.  Tens of thousands of women in the State are now affected and they are prevented from receiving their full entitlements.  Many are losing out to the tune of &euro;30 per week.</p> <p> The National Women's Council, Age Action Ireland and the ICA have all called for a reversal of these changes.  Indeed, the Taoiseach's own Minister for Finance described the situation as "bonkers and unbelievable" but it seems it was not bonkers enough to be addressed in his recent budget.  In our budget, Sinn F&eacute;in did provide for this reversal.  It would cost the Exchequer &euro;70 million but the Government chose to ignore this proposal.  Both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted against a Sinn F&eacute;in motion in the D&aacute;il last December that called for the 2012 changes to be reversed and for a remedy to be implemented.  The Taoiseach, therefore, has had two significant opportunities in the past ten months to demonstrate he is on the side of these women, and he has reneged on both, leaving the women high and dry.</p> <p> It seems that something happened at the weekend for the Soldiers of Destiny - not an epiphany or genuine realisation that they were wrong on this matter.  Put simply, what happened was that the issue hit the headlines.  Along came the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and, lo and behold, despite passing on every opportunity to right the wrong, Fianna F&aacute;il announced a change it its position.</p></speech>

Can we welcome Fianna F&aacute;il to the corner of these women, no matter how late, cynical or self-serving its arrival might be?  Here is the rub: the Taoiseach will lose the vote on the motion tomorrow night as I believe the D&aacute;il will vote in support of the women.  Given this reality, my questions are straightforward.  Can the Taoiseach enlighten us as to when Fianna F&aacute;il raised this issue with him in the course of the budget negotiations?  Can he tell us when the 2012 changes will be finally overturned, and if their reversal will be accommodated in the social welfare Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700006#D00800"><p>Based on a lot of the commentary I have heard and even some opinion pieces I saw in the newspapers yesterday, I believe it is not fully understood by many of those who write about it or comment on it.</p>  <p>  With regard to the comments of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, it is very important to say his term "bonkers and unbelievable" referred to the existence of the marriage bar, which has not existed since 1973 but which was certainly a bonkers and unbelievable rule.  It existed not in law but in many employments before that year.  People who understand the pensions system will know that any public servant hired before 1995 pays PRSI at a lower rate, the 0.9% rate, and that rate does not entitle any public servant hired before 1995 to the State contributory pension, whether married or single, male or female, marriage-barred or not.  It is important, therefore, not to confuse the 2012 change with the marriage bar because they are quite separate issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to the changes of 2012, they did not just affect women, they affected men as well.  Depending on whose estimates one accepts, the difference is about 60:40.  Therefore, women were disproportionately affected.  It did affect men as well as women, however, and it is important not to ignore all those men who did not deserve a mention in the Deputy's question.  They were also affected by the change.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that going back to the pre-2012 system is not necessarily fair either because it also had anomalies built into it.  The most obvious of these was that somebody who paid 20 contributions, on average, got a 98% pension whereas somebody who paid 48 contributions, on average, got a 100% pension.  Therefore, somebody who paid more than twice as many contributions got only 2% more in her or his pension.  If a change is to be made to these rules, it should not be made in isolation because all one would do is throw up new anomalies and injustices.  As a Government, we do accept there are anomalies in the system, the averaging one being the most obvious in that regard.  Again, it is separate from the 2012 issue.</p><p> The Government believes any changes need to be carefully considered.  They should not be done in isolation but comprehensively so as not to create new injustices or new anomalies.  We should understand the full costs.  We should answer the question of retrospectivity and whether it would apply to people who are already retired or just to people who are retiring now.  We would need to understand who may gain and who may lose out from any change in the rules.  Sometimes changing the rules can cause people to lose out as well as gain.  We would need to profile the individual loss and we would also have to look at the impact on poverty.  We should bear in mind that pensioner poverty among men in Ireland is higher than it is among women, which is something that often goes unreported.</p> <p> A lot of work has been done in this regard by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The first part was the publication of an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund because any money that is paid out from the State pension, contributory, has to be paid in from the fund so one would have to work out how additional money would be raised for that fund.  The actuarial review is completed and will be published quite soon.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will soon publish a detailed document on the total contributions approach for public consultation.  It is the new approach we want to move to, whereby everyone's contribution is counted and it does not matter when one makes them; what counts is the total number one makes throughout one's working career.  That would also provide a generous disregard for those who took time out to look after children or disabled people in their home.  The response should be comprehensive, not piecemeal.</p></speech>

That is why it is an issue of such concern for organisations such as the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  As complex as pensions are and the rules and regulations concerning them, it is not complicated to understand that a change was made in 2012 which is costing thousands of people, disproportionately women, up to &euro;30 a week.  Those people, and those women, have campaigned long and hard and I imagine have lobbied every Member of the D&aacute;il on this issue, and they tell me they have received assurances from every party in the D&aacute;il that the 2012 changes will be reversed.  I do not pretend for a moment that that is the beginning and end of pension reform.  Clearly, it is not, but I am saying directly to the Taoiseach that those women and men who are affected adversely by the changes now need to have their full entitlements re-established.</p>  <p>  Could I repeat my questions?  The Taoiseach might actually answer them this time around.  When did Fianna F&aacute;il raise this issue with him?  Did it form part of his pre-budget discussion?  I imagine a simple "Yes" or "No" would suffice.  I believe the Government will lose the vote tomorrow evening.

As a Government we absolutely accept that there is a need to review this whole area, to examine anomalies and to come up with changes but those changes should not be made in isolation.  If we are going to introduce pension reform we should do it comprehensively and properly.</p>  <p>  However, there is one area where I disagree with a number of the NGOs and people campaigning in this space.  I have read some of what they have said, which is that they want to move away from the contributory principle altogether.  I disagree with that.  I respect that other people may have a view.  The National Women's Council took the view in an article written yesterday that contributions should not matter and that there should just be a pension and everybody should get the same.  I do not agree with that because that would mean saying to people, men and women alike, who paid PRSI for 20, 30 or 40 years that that now counts for nothing.</p><p>It would say to people who now pay PRSI that that would count for nothing.</p></speech>

When Met &Eacute;ireann warned of a risk to life, we all hoped that it might not prove to be the case.  Unfortunately, it clearly was.  The three families most involved have our sympathy and condolences and those of everyone in the House and throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In the past 48 hours we have been served incredibly well by a wide range of public services.  Met &Eacute;ireann and the Office of Emergency Planning made sure that we were warned in a timely fashion of the imminent danger.  The call to issue a red alert for the entire country must have been a difficult one to make but it was the right one.  The calls by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to close all schools and cr&egrave;ches were also the right decisions.  The decision to stay closed for a second day was the right one as well.  It allowed school leaders to assess any damage or risk to children before they actually arrive at their school buildings.  I hope the Minister for Education and Skills will also make a sensible call not to require schools to make up these days - clearly this could not have been planned for.</p>  <p>  Countless others deserve our thanks, including the council workers in every council throughout the country, who worked through the night to clear trees and debris; the rescue services personnel, who put their lives at risk in some places where they really should not have been required to, as others have said; the public service broadcasters, public and private, at local and national level, who kept reminding people of the dangers that were evolving during the course of the day; the Garda; local authorities; ESB Networks crews; the Coast Guard; and RNLI volunteers &ndash; I saw the RNLI crew in my constituency take to the high seas when I was fearful of walking down the street yesterday.  All these deserve our great thanks, as does the Government.  The Government acted with calm throughout this particular episode.  The Taoiseach can be happy with the work of his Government during the past 48 hours.</p>  <p>  The severity of the storm certainly deserves a debate in the House as to our readiness for the overarching issue of climate change.  The House has not debated the climate mitigation plan referenced by the Taoiseach.  Such a debate would be timely, especially if it was well in advance of the publication and determination of the ten-year capital plan.</p>  <p>  In the meanwhile, I have two questions.  The first relates to how red alerts are understood.  On Sunday night, we saw many companies unsure how to deal with their employees.  Should we not have a clear understanding throughout the economy, as is the case in the education sector, of what should be done in the event of a red alert?  I came across a report last year that goes back to 2010.  The current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, was the Minister responsible at the time.  It related to establishing a national text alert system.  Public broadcasters are well and good but we could have a system, as envisaged in the 2010 report, where every individual in an affected area would have a specific warning.  Is that something the Government will now look at?</p></speech>

We will need to examine what a national red alert means.  It was the first time we have ever had a national red alert and the whole country only went red on Sunday, 15 October, at 1 p.m., when certain decisions had to be made.  One decision was to close schools and that was made within a few hours of the national red alert issuing.  A decision was made that we could not leave it up to individual school boards and so on to decide and that it had to be done on a national basis.  It caused genuine confusion for some people in the private sector because it was unclear to people as to whether or not they were to go into work.  The advice we gave people was not to do any unessential travel but going to work is essential for many people.  We will have to develop a better understanding of what a red alert means beyond the public sector and what it means in the private sector.</p> <p> I am not sure if a national text alert is still in the offing.  SMS is used much less frequently than it was in the past.  It is probably dying out as a technology.  People tend to use WhatsApp, Internet messages and so on.  Any consideration would have to give some view to that and what the correct mechanism for informing people would be.  I would like to say, as Deputy Martin said, that the media, and the national media in particular, were very helpful in getting messages out, including RTE, TV3 and others.  The front page headlines on the newspapers on Monday morning were also very helpful.  I do not think anyone who saw the front pages of the major newspapers on Monday morning could be in any doubt as to how serious the storm was.</p> <p> The national adaptation framework consultation is open until 27 October, so we are still in the consultation phase.  Once the Minister has the opportunity to consider the submissions, it will be brought to Government and published thereafter.</p></speech>

We might agree that we will do that in the next week or two and certainly well in advance of any final decisions being made with regard to the capital plan because it is important that we put money into an area that we are talking about and are now convinced about.</p>  <p>  My second question is on how we act when there is a red alert.  I had conversations with members of the Government on Sunday evening and we decided to close our own offices around the country.  I had to ring people I had arranged to meet on Monday morning, including employers, who did not know what to do.  We need to know, when events like this might occur, what specifically is expected of employers and employees in the event of a red alert affecting their area of work.  A commitment by the Taoiseach to provide such guidelines would be very welcome.</p></speech>

This is the first time we have ever had a national red alert.  We have had red alerts in individual counties or groups of counties before but not on a nationwide basis.  If guidelines do not exist already, which I do not think they do, it would be a very good idea to issue guidelines as to what alerts mean in many different circumstances, particularly for private sector employment.  We can certainly work that into the review and have it considered by the next meeting of the Office of Emergency Planning in November.</p></speech>

I also compliment the Government, local authorities and, in the county I represent, Ms Moira Murrell, who is CEO of Kerry County Council, and all the great outdoor staff for the great work that they did, not just in our county but throughout the country.  Those people worked so hard to ensure that everything was dealt with in the proper way.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the specific commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to protect our post office network.  I raised this matter many times here.</p><p>I wish to declare that I myself am a postmaster so I know the workings of exactly what is happening.<br/><br/>We, the Independent group, passed a motion in November of 2016.  I was grateful to every political group and individual here in this House who supported that motion at that time but, unfortunately, nothing has happened since.  A motion was passed here.  It gave a clear framework as to how we can protect our post offices.  It is not an exaggeration to state that 700 post offices face insolvency in the next two years.  When every postmaster who has been revised - a revision takes place every two or three years - gets back his or her figures, the postmaster is losing a lot of money, to such an extent that it questions the post office's viability completely.<br/><br/> Does the Taoiseach understand that in 2012 the social welfare contract was worth &euro;60 million to the post offices?  Today, it is worth just over &euro;50 million.  Why did that happen?  First, it is Government policy.  The Department was actively encouraging recipients to leave their post offices and use the commercial banks.  The post office customers were being driven to commercial banks.  I give the Taoiseach credit that when he was Minister at that time and I raised it with him he acted and ensured that letters being sent out to recipients encouraging them to go to the banks also pointed out that they could use the post offices.  However, we must do more.  When I saw &quot;we&quot;, I mean every one of us - every political party and every individual here.  All we need do is recognise that community banking is what saved the post office network in other parts of the world.  It happened in New Zealand.  It did not happen in England and Scotland.  That is why they lost 10,000 post offices.<br/><br/>Anything we lose, as the Taoiseach well knows, we can never get back.  If a post office closes in a community it is like taking the heart and soul out of that community.  We have to recognise that the network is worth saving.  It can be saved but we need the Taoiseach and the Government to provide policies and direction that will direct more business and more activity to the post offices.</p></speech>

I read an interesting analysis not too long ago of politics in France.  In France, those who are most likely to vote for the Front National, for extreme right or even extremely left parties, are those who live furthest away from the post office, a Garda station or a train station.</p></speech>

It has gone from 15% to 6%, and that will keep going downwards.  There will be fewer people going into the post office to collect social welfare.</p>  <p>  On pensioners, as the Deputy stated, I reversed the policy of encouraging recipients to use electronic transfer, but we do give pensioners the right to choose whether they want to go electronic or go to the post office.  The reality is almost all of the modern-day pensioners turning 66 today want to get paid into their bank accounts-----</p></speech>

The number of pensioners going to the post office to collect their pension is only going to continue to fall as well.  There will be fewer people going to the post office to collect pensions and social welfare.  There are also fewer people using mail.</p><p>If post offices are to survive, they will need to change their business.  This is very much the kind of solution the Minister is examining.  Things such as community banking services are in the mix, as are things like digital assist.  Particularly as Government services go online only, the aim is to use the post office as the portal for those who do not want to use computers or who, for some reason, are unable to do so.  They will be able to go to the post office to access the services provided online.  The revised business plan is still being worked on.</p></speech>

What I am asking him to do is to study the motion brought before the House in November 2016 and implement it.  I have 100% confidence in the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  His heart is in the right place and I know that he would want to keep every post office open if it was humanly possible to do so.  Again, this will require direction and leadership from the Taoiseach, but boasting about how few post offices have closed since Fine Gael came to power is not very helpful.  We must ensure more custom is generated for post offices.  The Taoiseach spoke about the number of people claiming unemployment benefit, but there are many other services which postmasters are equipped to provide in post offices if only the Government would agree to their doing so.  I am pleading with the Taoiseach not to let the opportunity pass.  He has a chance to really prove the point that the Government is committed to rural Ireland.  He has an opportunity to show that they are not just words, that there is going to be substance behind the talk.</p></speech>

It is not a coincidence that things have changed so much under this compared to previous Governments.  I am committed to this, too, and it is something on which I will engage with the Minister in more detail in the weeks ahead to try to come up with a plan that will bring new business and modern services to post offices in order that they will be able to stay open.  The only way to make them sustainable is to introduce new and modern services to replace those that are inevitably going to continue to decline.</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Thursday's business agreed to?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  We have five minutes left for questions on promised legislation.  I will take questions from the leaders.  I should put it on the record that there have been indications from Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Collins, O'Rourke, Byrne, Brady, Michael Healy-Rae, Stanley, Brassil, Ryan, Rabbitte, Nolan, Kenny and Ellis.  They will get the first opportunity to speak tomorrow, after the leaders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700014#O00200"><p>Before I commence, I want to correct the record of the House on the pensions issue and the anomaly of 2012, and the comments of Deputy McDonald in particular.  Many groups and parties have consistently raised this issue, not least the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Chairman, Deputy Curran, met the Minister at the committee on 28 September, and the very first question  Deputy Curran put to her was about the anomaly.  The report of the committee suggested the suspension of 2012, pending the review the Taoiseach alluded to.  The motion was, of course, about more than just pensions.  It was a much larger and much longer motion.  To suggest we voted against the specific issue of pensions is distorting the truth.  I have to put that on the record.  That is not what happened.</p>  <p>  On promised legislation, the programme for Government states that climate change is the global challenge of our generation and requires radical and ambitious thinking.  I said earlier that we lack ambition and do not have a radical approach to meeting our climate change targets.  In that context, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, responded to a question about a national flood forecasting service.  We are all very strong in our commendation of Met &Eacute;ireann in terms of its role in predicting and updating the country on storm Ophelia, but it has been looking for such national floods forecasting service for a long time.  A steering group was established and met on 11 occasions.  There has been an initial set-up phase.  It is estimated that it could take five years for such a service to be established.  Given the length of time that Met &Eacute;ireann has been looking for such a facility and the emphasis we put on climate change, it is regrettable that we do not have this in place.</p><p>Perhaps the Taoiseach, or the relevant Minister, will indicate the measures that will undertaken to accelerate the programme for Government provision and to make sure we have that forecasting service far earlier than the five years indicated, and that full resources will be provided for the recruitment of the 15 full-time staff who will be required.</p></speech>

Ongoing negotiations are currently taking place and we are not going to undermine Ireland's position in regard to them while we are in the middle of them.  Specifically, in regard to the flood forecasting, this is something about which we are all very anxious.  We are looking at ways in which this can be expedited.  Met &Eacute;ireann has been given the capacity, resources and funding that is needed in regard to that.  My understanding is that some trials are already ongoing in regard to the predictability of forecasting.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said that the consultation on the national adaptation framework will conclude on 27 October.  Will the framework and the proposals be available by 10 December, which I understand is the target date?  Is the Taoiseach on track for that?  Thereafter, how long will it take Ministers and Departments to produce their own sectoral plans?</p></speech>

I have been given no indication as to why that will not happen.  It is our intention to do that.  It would then be a matter for each of the State agencies and local authorities to put their own adaptation plans in place.  We, along with the Government, will be assisting them in doing that.</p></speech>

This is an important development, another move to codify social rights at the heart of the European project.  I am concerned at some of what I have been hearing regarding Ireland's role in this process.  I have been told from European contacts that Ireland appears to have taken the role normally performed by the United Kingdom seeking to obstruct social rights.  In doing so, I believe we have aligned ourselves with countries such as Hungary.  I believe we have been demanding changes to the preamble to the declaration to water down the obligation of states to give meaning to the social pillar.  Can the Taoiseach state clearly his support for the proclamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights?  Can he tell us what, if any, amendments his Government has sought in the preamble and can he explain why he would seek such an amendment?</p></speech>

I am not dealing with it personally.  Perhaps a parliamentary question tabled to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, or the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, might clarify that.  I can confirm that I will be attending the EU Social Summit in Gothenburg where I expect we will endorse and adopt the EU social pillar.  I look forward to having that opportunity but I am not across the detail.</p></speech>

It is important that this House has some input into Ireland's position.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach simply to say that he does not know and he will not tell me what our position is.  Can he ask the Minister with responsibility for social protection, if she is the lead person negotiating this, to discuss what Ireland's position is before the decisions are finally made?</p></speech>

He acknowledged that a long time ago, at least a year to a year to a half ago, in engagements that took place in this House involving Members from both sides of this House.  How come it has taken him this long to act on this and when will he do something about it?  By the way, in our budget submission, we allocated several hundred million euro for expanding the homemaker's scheme, so we did include it in our budget submission.  The Taoiseach said he read them all, so he should know it was in our budget submission at least.  He has given no clear commitment as to when he will deal with this discrimination against more than 30,000 pensioners, many of whom are women, although not all, as he said.  It is a discrimination and unfairness, nonetheless, which he has acknowledged.  He said then that he was going to do something about it but he has still done nothing about it.  When is he going to do something about it?</p></speech>

There is a problem with averaging and there is a problem with the homemaker's scheme, but the solution is not to go back to where we were before 2012 because there is a problem with that as well.  The proposal that the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has developed what is called the total contributions approach.  That will get rid of averaging, it will take into account the total number of contributions a person made over the course of their career - there will be no averaging any more - and it will make provision for a period of homemaking.</p></speech>

That is how the benefits are paid for.  That was the first thing that had to be done.  That has been done and it went to Cabinet a few weeks ago.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will be in a position to publish, for public consultation, the new system, which will be the total contributions approach, and she anticipates being able to do that before the end of the year.  As I mentioned earlier, none of these changes is straightforward.  One needs to understand the costs involved, how they will be funded, how they will impact on different individuals, different groups of people and all those other matters.  That is why it is not straightforward.  The fact that there are no computerised records prior to 1985 makes it even more difficult because individual records - paper records - will have to be gone through.</p></speech>

Surely in light of yesterday's storm that commitment should also be extended and the Government and the Department with responsibility for the environment, in conjunction with our excellent local authorities, should organise that trees growing on the sides of roads which are in a dangerous condition and could endanger the lives of people passing by should be removed.  We have excellent people working in our local authorities and excellent subcontractors who could be engaged in this job of work.  The same principle applies to the cutting of hedges.  All that maintenance work should be seriously examined.  In the interests of road safety, such work should be part of road maintenance-----</p></speech>

On a number of occasions in the last two weeks, the Taoiseach has said that the Government is not contemplating or preparing for anything other than a close customs union between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  In one of the scripted off-the-cuff replies which the Taoiseach supposedly hates so much, the Taoiseach said that the call for this contingency planning was tantamount to calling for Border dogs to be trained.  That was an intemperate response last Wednesday.  Yet, in Derry on Friday night, the Taoiseach said something completely different.  On that occasion he said that we were planning for different contingencies and "we will seek a unique solution for Northern Ireland".  Will he explain why he said one thing in the House last week and then something completely different in Derry?  Will he confirm that he is preparing proposals for a situation where the United Kingdom does not have barrier-free access to the European Union?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has repeatedly spoken of his being open to full briefings for pro-European parties regarding the Brexit talks.  We have sought such briefings but from what the Taoiseach said in Derry, it is becoming clear that there is nothing open or candid about these briefings.  Is it the position that the Taoiseach has given instructions that certain matters are not to be admitted in briefings if they are not in tandem with what he says in public?</p></speech>

I understood that international affairs also featured in that sub-committee.  Will the Taoiseach clarify this point?</p>  <p>  Brexit issues require a singular focus and effort.  When we last spoke on these on 3 October, the Taoiseach told us that the previous sub-committee meeting had taken place on 11 September, that is some three and a half weeks.  The idea that any sub-committee that engaged in a serious piece of work, and especially Brexit, would meet almost monthly is ludicrous and irresponsible.  </p>  <p>  I disagree with how Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin has dealt with the threat of a Border on the island of Ireland.  The Taoiseach is correct to hold firm on the line and the understanding that there can be, and will be, no Border on the island.  The efforts to secure what Sinn F&eacute;in has described as special designated status - it does not matter what it is called, it only matters what it does - in order to ensure that Ireland in its totality remains within the Single Market and the customs union is what is important.  I do not believe that it is beneficial or appropriate to debate what the electronic Border might look like.</p><p>The idea of mimicking toll free traffic on the M50 which I think is Fianna F&aacute;il's brainwave-----</p></speech>

If there was any criticism of them, it was probably that there were too many people attending each of them, but that was a general complaint.  The problem with reducing the number and broadening the scope of each of the reduced committees is that we will have an extraordinarily large number attending.  That waters down their effectiveness.</p>  <p>  I would like the Taoiseach to answer on two specific issues, one of which is climate action.  Should there be a stand-alone committee dealing with the issue if we are to give it the sense of priority to which the House referred during Leaders' Questions?  Justice reform was a major part of the reform agenda and most people in the country would still regard it as critical.  Where in the six committees the Taoiseach has set out is it housed and how often does the reform committee meet?</p>  <p>  On the questions put by the two previous questioners, all of the meetings I have attended on the island of Ireland and in Britain have had far too many generalisms about what we are facing.  Bluntly, I would like to have a real debate about the options we have to face because we are galloping towards the edge of a cliff and talking in generalisms and making assertions that something will not happen.  It will be too late if we actually reach the edge of the cliff and there is no solution.</p></speech>

Does that not prompt the Taoiseach to think we need a far more seriously focused approach to dealing with climate change, rather than what we are doing, which is engaged in special pleading as to why we should be allowed to continue with increased CO2 emissions and not meet targets and run the risk of fines?  The Citizens' Assembly stated we should be global leaders.  That is what it recommended to the Government and we are the opposite.  The fact that the Taoiseach does not have a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee suggests he is not taking the issue seriously.  Should he reconsider after the weekend?</p>  <p>  The next issue I want to raise which is of critical importance and requires the emergency response we saw at the weekend from the Government is housing and the need for a special committee to deal with what continues to be a crisis that is out of control.  We need an emergency focused, dedicated, all-Government response to the housing and homelessness crisis.  It justifies having a special Cabinet sub-committee which the Taoiseach would chair.</p></speech>

In that regard, I understand the Taoiseach has abdicated responsibility for implementing the sustainable development goals to the line Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, but I do not see how that can work.  I am interested in this issue as it affects the committees.  It is the type of issue that comes in under every committee, in education and justice, as well as dealing with environmental issues.  Will the Taoiseach outline what role, if any, his Department has in overseeing implementation of the sustainable development goals?  How does it fit across the five Cabinet sub-committees?  Does the Taoiseach agree that if, as he stated in the <i>Time</i>magazine article, we have to, as a country, be at the centred of the world, in other words, be open to what is going on in it, the biggest hope for it is that this manifesto for the north, as well as the south, the sustainable development goals, which were negotiated by an Irish civil servant shows us the path?  That being the case, why is it that I see them nowhere in his or his Department's agenda?  Why is it that he is not taking responsibility?  Where do they sit within the Cabinet sub-committee system?</p></speech>

It is fair to say Brexit took up the majority of the day's deliberations.  I did this because it was important to include the Cabinet in the discussion on Brexit, particularly with the European Council meeting coming up this week, rather than just a Cabinet sub-committee.  We will have another full Cabinet meeting tomorrow to deal with the Finance Bill.  As Deputies will probably see, between last Friday and Wednesday of this week, we will have had three Cabinet meetings, which is reflective of the different approach I am taking as Taoiseach, which is to have the full Cabinet meet more frequently and for longer periods of time in order that we can have genuine collective responsibility, whereby all Cabinet members will be across the big decisions being made.  It will be the total reverse of what happened during a previous Government, of which I was a member, when a sub-committee called the Economic Management Council made lots of decisions and informed the rest of the Cabinet of them.  That is something I never favoured and was never part of.  It is not the way I propose to lead a Government.</p>  <p>  Separate to the Cabinet committee on Brexit, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I also meet regularly to discuss European affairs and European policy.  Actually holding a Cabinet sub-committee which we can all attend is very difficult.  For example, today the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, are at the General Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council; therefore, it would be impossible for us to have a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.  On Thursday and Friday the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I will be at the European Council and it would not be possible for us to attend a meeting.  Whereas Deputy Mary Lou McDonald may suggest Cabinet committees should meet all the time, in practical reality that is not achievable because we are all coming and going all of the time because of the nature of our jobs.  That is why I want to centre more things around the Cabinet and the bilateral and trilateral meetings involving the key Ministers.</p>  <p>  On contingency planning, it is appropriate for any Government in office to plan for worst-case scenarios.  Some years ago we had a plan for what we would do if the euro fell apart; of course, therefore, Governments have to engage in contingency planning.  Doing a desktop exercise and engaging in due diligence on worst-case scenarios are very different from what seems to be Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  Perhaps RT&Eacute; misreported what had happened at the Ard-Fheis, but I distinctly read an article about a motion being passed calling for an electronic border with gantries and M50 style tolls.  I think that is to what Deputy Mary Lou McDonald was referring.  It seems that it is Fianna F&aacute;il's policy-----</p></speech>

If Deputy Stephen Donnelly, as Minister of Foreign Affairs or European Affairs, was to go to London to negotiate with the British authorities the details of how an electronic border might work, he might find soon enough that it would actually become a solution.  That is why it would be very unwise to have a Fianna F&aacute;il Government in London discussing with British officials what an electronic border might look like, how big the toll gantries might be and where they should be placed.  That would be a very unwise political strategy and it is something I absolutely would not support.</p>  <p>  Briefings are absolutely open to party leaders.</p><p>I have given no instruction other than to give people full information.</p> <p> Climate action is an important issue.  I totally acknowledge that but there are any number of issues on which one could have a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee.  We could have one for every single issue for which there is a Department, and then some more, but then we would be back to where we were before, with 15, 20 or 30 Cabinet committees.  It is just too many and it becomes unwieldy.  Justice reform is dealt with by Cabinet committee B but the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and I also meet bilaterally.  I disagree with the view, often expressed to me on Taoiseach's questions, that if an issue is important, one must have a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee do deal with it.  I am not sure that is true.  I have seen Governments from ten or 20 years ago, and maybe more recently, for which setting up a committee was a way not to deal with something.  It was just a consultation exercise or talk-shop exercise.  The way one tends to get things done in government is either at Cabinet, where Ministers are all present so one can actually make decisions, or in much smaller groups.</p></speech>

He was present when I gave my speech at the All-Island Civil Dialogue.  I spoke at Cambridge at the British-Irish Association meeting in the presence of the Taoiseach's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I have been very serious and constructive about Brexit.  The Taoiseach should ask his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, how constructive I have been on Brexit since it was voted for.  I have been serious about wearing the green jersey for Ireland.  Our clear position has always been to have a special economic zone on the island of Ireland to ensure full trade and no border.  Treating Question Time like some smart-ass university debate is not doing justice to the seriousness of the issue.  The Taoiseach said at the outset in answering me that we should engage in contingency planning and that everybody should prepare for worst-case scenarios.  The Revenue Commissioners did their work.  I was not raising the Revenue Commissioners today.  They did serious work.  In my humble opinion, it was work that should have been shared with people.  I see no rationale as to why it would not have been shared with people.  It could have informed public debate, not to become a self-fulfilling prophesy but to warn those affected, including those in SMEs in Ireland and Britain, about the horrendous impact of what Brexit will mean for them in their daily lives, economically and in terms of jobs, for example.  It would have been advantageous to public debate.  Lest there be any doubt - it is one thing for Sinn F&eacute;in to try to distort the truth but I suggest it is something different for the Taoiseach to try to do so - our position has been very consistent, from the referendum onwards, in terms of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.  That is why we are putting forward the propositions in all seriousness.  I ask the Taoiseach to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

It is a very significant challenge to ensure that not only the economic life of the island but also the political life and the Good Friday Agreement infrastructure are not completely undermined.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the report from the Revenue Commissioners, I see no reason it would not be shared.  I suggest, however, that there is a deep understanding among SMEs, businesspeople, the agrifood industry and farmers of the massive disruption Brexit potentially represents.</p></speech>

Given this, he needs to ask himself the purpose of the sub-committee and the effectiveness of its work.</p>  <p>  May I ask the Taoiseach about the briefing of other political parties and leaders on these matters?  Whatever our differences, I believe we can all work together constructively.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach should not imagine for a second that light debates about what a border might or might not look like would be lost on the Government in London and by others.  It would be absolutely detrimental to send out a signal other than the fact that, politically, socially and economically, we cannot and will not entertain any border on the island.  That needs to be said explicitly.  Nonsensical positions on M50-style toll-free traffic certainly do not assist in that regard.</p></speech>

All of us in this House have to face up to this.  In the words of Mr. Michel Barnier, the clock is ticking.  If we continue as we are, with Britain saying there will be a soft or seamless border and us saying there will be no border, what will happen when, suddenly in March 2019, we will be in different customs unions?  What will physically happen then?  Rather than talking around the issue, we need to have concrete proposals.  The only solution that works for us is the maintenance of a single customs union on the island of Ireland.  I hope that, between Britain and Ireland, that is achievable, but we need to explain the consequences of it not happening.</p></speech>

As is the case with all Departments, mine has oversight of its work.</p>  <p>  On the solution to the Brexit conundrum, I am in broad agreement with what has been said by others.  I believe the only solution that is workable for Britain and Ireland is that the United Kingdom as a whole should remain in some form of customs union.  One could call it a customs partnership if one wanted.  It should be some form of customs union involving the United Kingdom and the European Union.  It is not just about the North and South.  The east-west trade is really important also.  If one talks to anyone involved with an SME, or an exporter involved in agrifood, one will realise the trade between Britain and Ireland is much greater than the trade between the North and South.  We need to bear that in mind.  In my conversations with my colleagues across Europe and on the telephone yesterday with Ms Theresa May, to whom I spoke for 40 minutes, I emphasised my view that the United Kingdom should remain in a customs union with the European Union.  If it wishes to call it something different, because the term "union" has particular connotations, it would be the best solution.  It could call it a customs partnership; I do not mind.  If it cannot be achieved, we then need to consider a secondary, less-favourable solution, but that is one that would involve special arrangements for Northern Ireland.  That is what I said to Ms May when we spoke yesterday and what I have said before on many occasions.</p>  <p>  Using the term "special status" is not helpful.  It is seen by the DUP and other unionist parties as an attempt to diminish the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.  Therefore, using the term actually makes the objective harder to achieve.  This is because of the sensitivities around language.  Deputy Martin, as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, will know how unbelievably sensitive people in Northern Ireland can be about language, even in regard to whether a word is spelled with a capital letter.  It is not helpful, therefore, to use the term "special status".  Unless one is deliberately trying to undermine and to annoy unionists, I ask that one not use it.</p></speech>

It did not help.  It was not helpful in trying to achieve a good outcome for the Irish people that the term was adopted by the "Oireachtas".  The Deputy will know that it is not helpful at a European level more widely.  The European Parliament motion using the same language, backed by Sinn F&eacute;in MPs, was voted down at European level because other countries saw it as potentially giving rise to regionalism and nationalism within their regions.  That is another example of where people pushing agendas for political gain from Brexit did harm to our national interest.</p><p>It is something I asked Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs to reflect on.  There is no point in putting a motion to the European Parliament demanding special status for Northern Ireland only to have it voted down.  That undermines our case in negotiations.</p></speech>

That report was published in 2015 and it is available on my Department's website.  One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the report.</p>  <p>  As my predecessor previously said in this House, he agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Martin that this group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.  He wrote to party leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate.  I have reviewed matters in this regard and am keen to progress them.  I will contact leaders shortly with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Last September 12 months we had a commitment to set up this group on Seanad reform.  The Taoiseach's own Department's statement of strategy says there is a commitment "to fully implement the Manning report on the Seanad".  Given his comments on the Manning report I am surprised that statement is still on the statement of strategy.  The Taoiseach might review that and consider deleting it because I am not so sure it is such a commitment now as it may have been.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's statement that he intends to be in contact with us has a familiar ring to it.  The previous Taoiseach said on numerous occasions over a three-year period that he would shortly be in contact with us in terms of setting up the group.  I ask that the group would be set up as a matter of urgency and a chair appointed.</p>  <p>  There is a further matter in regard to the referendum on the Seanad that was held many years ago, namely, the issue of amending legislation in terms of extending its franchise.  Is that plan now completely on the back-burner?</p>  <p>  On the question of referenda, the Taoiseach said on the previous occasion we asked that, given that the holding of referenda is a matter for the Oireachtas there would be consultations with party leaders on the range of referenda the Government felt might take place next year.  Could he indicate when that consultation with other party leaders will take place?</p></speech>

I do not detect any great political appetite or urgency for dealing with the issue.  My questions, much like the previous speaker, are around when all of this will be actioned and who will chair the implementation group.  There have been 12 separate reports proposing Seanad reform and yet here we are pondering this issue again.  If this is something that is going to happen - I believe it should - then we need to see evidence of action and we need to see it very soon.</p></speech>

I know the programme for Government and I have the reply to a question by me on 4 October, which I expect is exactly what the Taoiseach has just told the House now, namely, that the programme for Government is committed to implement the Manning report.  I am looking at the executive summary and recommendations of the Manning report.  Does the Taoiseach support them?  In his view is this the blueprint or is it the basis for a further discussion on what the Second Chamber in this Oireachtas should look like?  I am interested in hearing his own view.  Will the report be implemented?  I was not convinced, once the proposal to abolish the Seanad was defeated by the people, that there was really a firm political commitment to have a reformed Second Chamber and what that reformed Second Chamber would look like.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has a reputation for speaking directly.  Perhaps he would very directly say what in his view the Second Chamber should look like and if the Manning report is the blueprint he would like to follow.</p></speech>

For us to ignore that, in particular at a time when we are looking at a range of other referenda that we are considering putting forward, would be a mistake.  We should have this on our agenda and in the timeline for future referenda in the next two years.  I am very keen to hear the Taoiseach very broadly outline what is his position; whether it is abolition, reform or the <i>status quo</i>?  If it is reform then we can get down to the details of it but if it is one of the other two then at least we will know where we stand.  I am keen to hear an answer to Deputy Howlin's question.</p></speech>

It does need a chairperson who would have broad respect and be broadly accepted across the Oireachtas.  I have not yet had an opportunity to approach anyone but I intend to do so once I get a moment if I can to do something that is not already top of the agenda in the next couple of days or in the next week or two.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to reforming the Seanad in line with the Manning report and I will honour that commitment.  I am bound by the programme for Government, just as all my Ministers are and everyone who is on the Fine Gael and Independent Alliance benches and some Independents as well.  That is why it is included in the strategy statement.</p>  <p>  I will not lie to the Deputy.  I will not lie to anyone in this House.  Frankly, I do have reservations about the Manning report.  The Manning report proposes that there would not be a referendum on the Seanad and that it would be reformed within the confines of the existing constitutional provisions.  That requires retaining the panels, which date back to the 1930s, and which to me are archaic.  I cannot remember all of them but they cover administrative, industrial and commercial areas.</p></speech>

They are corporatist and date from the 1930s.  They date from a particular model of Catholic democracy that to me is out of date.  What it proposes is re-registering the entire country to vote again because everyone would have to nominate which of those five panels they want to be an elector on, or whether they would prefer to be an elector on one of the two university panels.  The first thing we would have to do is re-register the entire country to vote and hold a major educational exercise explaining to people whether they should ask to be on the administrative panel, the education panel or the industrial and commercial panel.  Frankly, I am not sure that is the best solution we can come up.</p></speech>

He previously made a claim that the strategic communications unit was cost-neutral.  As we know, in the budget the Taoiseach allocated &euro;5 million to that unit.  That is hardly cost-neutral.  Can the Taoiseach explain that contradiction?</p>  <p>  I know the former Senator, Mr. D'Arcy, is the Taoiseach's advisor on the North, the Border and Brexit.  Of course it is very good that the Taoiseach has specialist advice on that area.  I understand that in a "Spotlight" programme due to broadcast tonight the Taoiseach raises an issue and an objection to the 50% plus one basis for a Border poll or a referendum on Irish unity.  I wish to advise the Taoiseach that, although all of us would wish to see such a proposition built consensually and democratically to far exceed a 50% plus one threshold, such is the provision in what is an international legally-binding agreement.</p></speech>

This was the practice followed in the past by all Ministers and taoisigh.  It is a practice I followed myself.  Can the Taoiseach explain why the top two positions in the strategic communications unit were not appointed in the accepted manner?  The Taoiseach conceded to the House last week that he went to the head of the strategic communications unit in advance to check his availability and that then, technically, the Secretary General of the Department appointed him.  In my view, in the real world, the Taoiseach decided to appoint him.  It is a worrying trend that the rules do not apply to the Taoiseach in respect of the appointment to such key positions.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate clarification on the case of the deputy head of unit.  I stand to be corrected but our information is that the person was appointed originally from outside the civil and public service to the Department of the Taoiseach by the Taoiseach's predecessor as part of the European Council Presidency.  Then, subsequently, he was appointed to promote the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Taoiseach might clarify whether that person has ever undertaken a competitive interview to be appointed.  Is that person still deemed to be a political appointment?  Is the person now an established civil servant, as the Taoiseach has claimed?  Can the Taoiseach explain how that progression occurred and how that happened?  Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable to politicise Civil Service positions in this manner?  I believe that is the core issue.  What we have been witnessing in recent times is a blurring of the divide between civil servants who, since the foundation of the State, have always had a non-political role, with the political objectives of the lead party in government.</p></speech>

First, it has absolutely no role whatsoever in producing or issuing statistics.  Statistics on waiting lists are released by the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Central Statistics Office releases other statistics.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government releases other statistics.  These bodies have been releasing other statistics long before the SCU was ever created.  My Department has no role in telling these bodies when they should or should not produce their numbers.</p>  <p>  The top two positions are not political appointees.  They are not special advisers.  That is why they did not follow the special adviser process.  That process is only for special advisers.  The head of the SCU was seconded by the Secretary General of my Department.

In recent years, I have secured significant additional investment in the early years sector, focusing investment on different but critical elements of early years care and education.  The new measures announced in budget 2018 form part of a trend in continued growth and investment.  In budget 2017, I secured a 35% increase in child care funding, following a similar 35% increase in budget 2016.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase of 87% in early years funding since 2015.  Despite this, Ireland will require many years of significant investment in child care to catch up with our OECD counterparts.  The increase in targeted subsidies introduced last month does, however, represent a major step towards accessible, affordable, quality child care.  These increases reflect my ambition to support the provision of quality child care services with appropriately supported and qualified staff.</p>  <p>  The increases in the targeted schemes introduced last month are considerable, up to 50%.  This will significantly decrease the amount of co-payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.  Some families will benefit from as much as &euro;7,500 per child per year.  I also introduced a universal subsidy worth up to &euro;1,040 per year.  This subsidy is aimed at children not yet in the free preschool programme.</p>  <p>  I have used budget 2018 to deliver fully on the commitment in the programme for Government regarding early childhood care and education, ECCE, and to increase investment to support the quality of services.</p>  <p>  All of these changes are points towards our goal to deliver affordable, accessible, quality child care.</p></reply>

Focusing on the affordable childcare scheme, will the Minister confirm what she has started with regard to the affordable childcare scheme, and that our ICT system will be in place for September 2018?  I am seeking a commitment from the Minister to have a pathway for that to ensure it will be there.  How is the legislative framework proceeding to make sure that the Revenue and social protection pieces of the jigsaw related to the affordable childcare scheme will also be in place for September 2018?  While I compliment the fact that some families will be in receipt of &euro;7,500, some are missing out and will not even get as much as &euro;12 per week.  There are as many as 9,000 not included because of the threshold of &euro;47,500.  Was there much uptake of the GP cards or have any of the Minister's staff a reflection on that?  That was an avenue to bring more people into the affordable subsidy level in the affordable childcare scheme.</p></speech>

On subsidies provided for families to ensure that the cost of child care is more affordable, the Deputy's first question asked if we are on track to ensure that the affordable childcare scheme will be able to be delivered in 2018 in light of the ICT issues.  As I understand it, that process is continuing within the context of an overall group that is outside of my control and needs to ensure that proper quality and systems are put in place over a period.  That is an oversight group, as the Deputy is aware.  As I have said before, it is much better to get this right, because it is going to be in place for generations, than to get it wrong.  I hope it will be able to be delivered but I cannot absolutely guarantee that now.</p>  <p>  I understand that the legislation, asked about in the Deputy's second question, is on track.  On the threshold for families, some may have missed out because we do not have the affordable childcare scheme fully developed to be delivered in the way that was originally intended, although we will deliver it.  That issue was behind my judgment to ensure that every child is entitled to two full free years of preschool.  That will add to the affordability issue for families.</p></speech>

She has said she hopes that it will be there.  Is funding the issue?  Is it very complex?  Is it difficult for one Department to work with three others?  Is it that we are introducing a new system that has never been brought in before?  Is the Minister looking at the model with regard to the student universal support Ireland, SUSI, system?  I am trying to understand where we are going with this ICT because it all hinges on the ICT.  Child care costs cripple parents.  None of us will deny that.  If this is holding up progress in delivering the affordable childcare scheme, I hope to understand what the hold-up is.</p></speech>

There is a significant sign-up rate for those various schemes, including the universal scheme for under threes, which was the first time that the Government has put in place subsidies for families for children under three.  As the Deputy is aware, a significant additional investment is being made in targeted funding.  That is just beginning to roll out.  Families are beginning to feel that and there has been a significant sign-up rate for those schemes.  It is important to place that on the record of the House.</p>  <p>  The Deputy identified the issue of the ICT system.</p><p>The development of the ICT system is progressing in an oversight group process.  This involves a special office of people with expertise in information systems to ensure that what is ultimately delivered will be correct, and will last.  That is outside my control.  It is a process that involves other systems that are being developed from scratch, as significant as this one in terms of, as the Deputy rightly points out, the sharing of Revenue and social protection data that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments have identified needs to be done in order that we get that right.  I hope that we can deliver but it is outside of my control.  It is in the context of that process that we will deliver the best system for children and families.</p></speech>

In 2017, I provided current funding of &euro;57.4 million to support the provision of youth services.</p>  <p>  Recently my Department operated a youth employability initiative funded under the dormant accounts funding scheme.  The programmes assisted over 1,000 young people, aged 15 to 24 years, to build skills that enhanced their employability.  A review of the initiative to inform any future linked development is taking place.</p>  <p>  During 2016 and 2017, I also gave approval for funding of 14 new youth projects and the expansion of seven others.  These sample projects will provide youth services, including those related to homelessness, in areas of need as identified by the local education and training boards across the country.</p>  <p>  There are 109 family resource centres currently in receipt of funding from Tusla and I have provided Tusla with resources for an additional 11 centres to be opened.  I have also provided extra supports for family resource centres and will be making a significant announcement on this later this week.</p>  <p>  In relation to housing, we are working closely with Tusla to provide supports for families in emergency accommodation in order to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation.  I have introduced free child care for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  Regarding school attendance, Tusla's educational welfare service offers a number of supports to children and families experiencing homelessness and works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies in this regard.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a homelessness liaison officer.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, in terms of the Government as a whole, it is fair to say that the number of children in emergency accommodation, at almost 3,000, is at quite a shocking level at this stage.  The related welfare issues are quite serious.  There is the issue of food poverty and its implications for them.  Generally speaking, there is the question about how suitable some of the emergency accommodation is.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, I want ask the Minister whether she would support, in regard to the homelessness issue, some form of further independent inspection regime for emergency accommodation, in particular for families, and whether there has been any progress in Tusla's engagement with the existing forms of emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

I indicated in my speech in response to the budget that the Government could be doing more, particularly in regard to preventative measures, in order to prevent as many people and families as possible moving into the emergency accommodation.  One of the difficulties is that many children and families are moving out but, as the Deputy identified, the numbers continue to increase.  Many children and families have received some form of a home but the fact that the numbers are continuing to go up is the difficulty.  I agree there needs to be, as I said, further preventative measures.  The Deputy will be aware that Tusla has worked with others to develop standards on ensuring the safety and protection of children while they are in emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

The Minister also mentioned the family resource centres, which I would be a strong advocate of.  What is the Minister's vision for the area-based projects over the next few years because there are some projects which are the remnants of Atlantic Philanthropies' investments and others that are probably more directly coming from the Department.  All of these do good work.  Some may have slightly different models of practice.  I very much believe that this area-based approach is crucial in tackling poverty as well as some of the Barnardos centres, but I am unclear as to where the Government sees the future of all these centres and projects and what the strategy and roadmap for these projects is.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, I was able to secure funding in budget 2018 in order to ensure the continuation of the area-based programmes that are going on in different places throughout the country.  As the Deputy indicated, there are different models being employed in that regard, but they certainly are all focused on prevention and early intervention, and the provision of services in the context of the communities where they are located.</p>  <p>  The overall programme is currently being evaluated and reviewed by the Centre for Effective Services.  The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the impact of the programme nationally.  Work on the evaluation is ongoing but initial indications are positive for improving outcomes for children in 13 areas of disadvantage.  Of course, I will await that report, but I have some views on ways in which we can continue to ensure communities, in the context of encouraging them to participate with children and families, between State and NGO and voluntary bodies, do the best they can to ensure that the children who are able to access those initiatives' services receive the best health, educational and care outcomes possible.</p></speech>

Children First mandatory reporting, for example, could benefit from social workers who are dealing in part with other aspects of Tusla's work and also from elements of staff training and IT costs.  Exact funding requirements will become clearer as Tusla develops its business plan for 2018.  However, I have emphasised to Tusla that mandatory reporting is a critical requirement for 2018 and the agency has committed to taking all actions necessary to achieve effective implementation.</p>  <p>  I will shortly be issuing Tusla with its 2018 performance statement in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.</p><p>Tusla will, in response to the performance statement, prepare a business plan for 2018 which will be submitted to me for consideration.  The precise level of funding to be allocated for the roll-out of mandatory reporting will be considered by Tusla in preparing its business plan, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2018.</p> <p> I am pleased to make additional resources of &euro;40.6 million available to Tusla in budget 2018.  It will bring Tusla's financial allocation to just over &euro;753 million in 2018.  This level of funding will allow it to recruit additional staff, respond to identified risks and meet increased demands for services, including those arising from mandatory reporting.  In particular, the financial allocation will allow Tusla to meet a number of key priorities in line with its obligations under the Children First legislation.  It will include ensuring the appropriate internal systems are in place to deal with the intake of mandatory reports by Tusla and that a suite of resources will be available to support and assist all sectors in implementing the legislation.</p></speech>

My real concern centres on the fact that the CEO of Tusla, Mr. Fred McBride, said recently at a committee that evidence from other jurisdictions suggested mandatory reporting could increase the number of referrals to Tusla by 150%.  He had sought an additional &euro;38 million to support the roll-out of mandatory reporting.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, welcomed the Minister's announcement of mandatory reporting and while I wholeheartedly support her initiative, I believe there is not enough funding in place to support it.  I would like to hear her views on Mr. McBride's remarks and his business plan.</p></speech>

I understood it to be a 50% increase, as distinct from 150%, but we can take another look at that matter.  It is Mr. McBride's job to identify where there is the potential for an increase, but at the same time, he is aware - we have had such discussions subsequent to this kind of exchange - that nobody knows exactly what the increase in the number of reports will be or what percentage of them will be substantiated.  While potentially the increase could be as high as 150%, I do not expect it to be so, particularly because the Act identifies that, in the context of mandatory reporting, those reporting must have concerns that there is "significant harm" to a child, as distinct from the lower threshold that currently applies in the context of voluntary reporting.  Given the raising of the threshold to a concern about "significant harm" to a child, it is my expectation that we are covering many children in the context of the voluntary reporting.  There may be some increase, but it is my belief the additional resources I have secured for Tusla are sufficient.  I further add that it is not just about resources; it is also about the processes by which Tusla takes in referrals.</p></speech>

It is my biggest concern.  The Minister's predecessor, former Deputy James Reilly, announced the recruitment of an additional 247 staff in 2015, but if one looks at the figures for the past 18 months, one will see that we are struggling to recruit the necessary staff.  While it is levelling out a little, the introduction of mandatory reporting will bring about additional pressure.  Will we be able to recruit and retain the staff needed to bring forward this very positive change?  Tusla has had a very difficult 18 months, with one negative report after another.  Mandatory reporting will now be on its table too.  While the Minister may have provided enough funding for staffing in Tusla, what does she think about the wider recruitment issue?</p></speech>

In announcing the resources I shared a platform with Mr. McBride and we had a lot of discussions in that regard.  He has identified that there are 305 people at various stages of recruitment; that Tusla is in the process of recruiting and ultimately employing the people concerned.  In that context, there has been a lot of positive action in the context of Tusla's overall three-year plan to get the numbers it needs.  It has been proactive and working extremely hard to recruit the necessary mix of team members and professionals.  Of the aforementioned 305 people, 185 are social workers.  A lot of work has been done to achieve that number of new recruits.  In addition, the resources I am putting in place will ensure Tusla will be able to continue that recruitment to add an additional 300 workers.</p></speech>

It relates to Tusla and the initiatives being undertaken to ensure, in particular, the retention of social workers, as well as the resources required to recruit more social workers.  This is obviously a very important issue.  I welcome the additional moneys for Tusla which was one of the priorities identified in Sinn F&eacute;in's pre-budget submission.  I am glad that the Minister has secured additional funding for Tusla.  The question is focused on staff retention but also on the recruitment of staff.</p></reply>

Working in child protection is one of the most difficult tasks and I welcome the dedication of all professionals in Tusla who undertake this extremely important task.  Tusla has worked hard to retain staff by developing a supportive working environment.  Its overall turnover rate for social workers is about 7%, compared to 15% in the equivalent system in England.  As part of its retention strategy, it has implemented an extensive continuous professional development strategy during 2016 and 2017.  During 2016 social workers had more than 3,700 training course attendances as part of the strategy which commits to all social workers having a minimum of 21 hours for personal development plans and ten hours for engaging in continuous profession development. </p><p>Tusla has also introduced a national transfer policy to facilitate staff who wish to relocate to another part of the country within its services, while ensuring the agency retains their valuable expertise.  Tusla's<i></i>health, well-being and employee assistance programme has a range of services available to staff, including a critical incident stress management team to support teams and individuals in the event of an traumatic event.  The programme has just completed a staff retention survey and the findings will inform part of the new retention strategy for Tusla.</p><p>Other supports for Tusla staff include rehabilitation services to support staff who are out of work owning to injury or illness.  In addition to its retention measures, Tusla is putting a huge emphasis on recruitment.  This includes an intensive graduate recruitment programme and a rolling programme to attract existing social workers.  Budget 2018 provides for a significant increase in the funding allocation for Tusla.  In 2018 there will be &euro;753 million in funding available to Tusla, representing an increase of &euro;40.6 million or 5.7% on the allocation in 2017.  Since the establishment of the agency in 2014, its funding will have increased by &euro;144 million or 23.6% in 2018.</p></speech>

This is not the first time a response from the Government has compared our system favourably with that in place in Britain or, specifically, England, but I do not think we should compare Ireland with England.  The English social care system is in crisis and almost anything could be compared favourably with it.</p><p>So many of the issues, controversies and reports in recent years have been related to resourcing, while some have been related to social workers being overburdened with work and having unmanageable case loads.  The issues surrounding child protection social workers seem to be particularly acute.  The number of child protection social workers leaving the system was quite considerable when we discussed this issue about 12 months ago.  What is the current retention rate in that specific category?</p></speech>

Picking up on his point about the system in place in England, I will also be happy to compare this jurisdiction with others, although I do not necessarily agree with him on the matter.  The fact is that Tusla has been able to retain social workers.  The current turnover rate is approximately 7%, which is very good, although we would obviously prefer it to be lower.  Tusla is working on this, with particular reference to the retention programmes I have mentioned.</p>  <p>  I understand the reason the Deputy is raising the issue of people working in the area of child protection.  I have been encouraging Tusla to show leadership.  Yes, we need social workers and to make their working environment more conducive.  I have tried to identify some of the ways in which the organisation is supporting its staff in tha regard.  At the same time, however, we need to move forward plans to ensure the mix of staff working in the area of child protection is the right one in order that social workers, social care workers, administrators and front-line staff are doing the jobs they have been trained to do.  That will make the system more efficient.</p></speech>

When we dealt with this issue 12 months ago, we were talking about losing 150 social workers a year, which was very significant.  I would like to pass on some observations made to me by social workers on matters I have previously raised with Mr. Fred McBride at committee level.  One was that there previously was a grade of advanced social work practitioner.  This issue might perhaps be worth exploring.  Another observation is on the centralised manner in which recruitment is carried out.  There is a desire that this function be devolved to more local social work operations, with a desire to have more administrative staff.  Given that the work involved in child protection is so intense, it might be worthy of its own grade.  This issue might be examined in the context of employment conditions and pay.  I do not necessarily have a settled view on it, but I am curious to hear the Minister's view.</p></speech>

The Deputy has clearly already raised the matter with the CEO, Mr. Fred McBride.  His focus is on considering additional ways by which staff working on the front line with children who have experienced significant harm can be supported, which is good.  Some of the questions have focused on how we can attract and retain staff.  It concerns the ways in which social workers can see they will be supported and that their status will be accorded.  It also concerns their conditions and pay, of course.  I am well aware of these issues, as is senior management in Tusla which is looking for ways to continually improve in that regard.  I think the Deputy's suggestions are worthy of consideration.</p></speech>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have allocated an extra &euro;40.6 million to Tusla for next year.  This will bring its allocation to more than &euro;753 million in 2018.  It is higher than the extra &euro;37 million allocated in 2017.  I will shortly issue Tusla with its 2018 performance statement in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and it will then prepare a business plan for 2018, setting out its proposed main areas of spending.  I have already indicated to it that among my priorities for 2018 will be: actions to support mandatory reporting under Children First from 11 December this year; addressing the gaps in out-of-hours services; and further investment in family resource centres in local communities that deliver services to families, especially in disadvantaged areas across the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the extra funding secured will also allow Tusla to recruit over 300 staff, reduce the number of unallocated cases, improve ICT and advance developments in areas such as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, adoption, aftercare, and homelessness supports.  I am pleased to be able to support Tusla in this way in a major programme of service development and reform.  </p>  <p>  A more specific breakdown of funding happens in the process of preparing a business plan.  More generally, however, I can say approximately &euro;15 million will support existing services which also concerns recruitment.  A further &euro;10 million will be used to build up front-line service capacity and recruit 140 staff in critical areas, including the management of unallocated cases; aftercare and special care services.  These are just some of the breakdowns I could offer to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister gave the figure of 185 social workers going through the recruitment process.  I know that last year the goal of achieving a 60% reduction in cases to 2,700 by the end of 2016 was not, in fact, reached.  Perhaps the Minister might give us an indication as to where we are in that regard.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if my next question falls under the heading of Tusla or whether it comes directly under the auspices of the Minister's Department, in which case she may not be able to answer it today.  Last year the Department had to step in to assist with ABC programmes because of funding difficulties.  The Minister will be familiar with this issue from her constituency.  I am very concerned to ensure the programmes will be able to continue because of the work done in disadvantaged communities, in particular.  Will funding be allocated to support children who are homeless?  Again, as I am not sure if this comes within the remit of Tusla, I may be straying from the question.</p></speech>

Tusla does have some responsibilities in that regard.  There has been a lot of investment in family resource centres throughout the country.  Existing centres will be able to apply for up to &euro;10,000 in additional funding for their work in 2018 and we will also initiate 11 new centres.</p><p>Part of their focus will be on linking in with family hubs in their areas to ensure there are ongoing ways of supporting children in accommodation in that context, for example by bringing their prevention and early intervention services to them.</p></speech>

As I indicated in response to another Deputy, I have secured funding for 2018.  The programme is under evaluation by the centre for effective services.  I would expect a report to be delivered to me in the near future so I can review the evaluation of the impact of this provision.  So far, the signs are positive.  If the evaluation is positive, we will review the overall approach to see whether it is something we wish to continue.  For example, we will look at the exact locations.  We will consider whether we want to open it up and, if so, whether sufficient resources are available to facilitate this.  We will think about other ways in which we can support the overall ultimate aim of reducing children's poverty in disadvantaged communities.</p></speech>

In April 2017, more than 120,000 children participated in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme at peak demand.  While pressure on places was high in some areas, the system successfully accommodated all children for whom a place was sought.  From September 2018, the structure and entry points of ECCE will change as a result of the additional investment that has been made available to fund a full two programme years.  It is estimated that 114,000 children will register for ECCE for the full programme year at that point.  As the system was able to accommodate 120,000 children in 2017, I am confident that there should be no problem accommodating 114,000 children in 2018.  The one entry point will reduce the overall pressures on the system and make it simpler for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs, through the city and county child care committees and Pobal, will continue to monitor issues of capacity and need.  The Department is continuing to work with the Department of Education and Skills and the Central Statistics Office to identify the number of children who are eligible for the free preschool years.  As it did on previous occasions, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will make information available to each of the 30 city and county child care committees on the number of children in each electoral division who are eligible for the ECCE scheme.  This will enable the committees to support providers and parents in their local areas to ensure sufficient capacity exists.  If any future capacity issues are identified, the Department will consider any intervention necessary, such as the provision of capital funding.  I am pleased that the funding I have received in budget 2018 means we can provide for a full second year of the ECCE scheme.  I believe this will be to the considerable benefit of children and their families.  I look forward to working with providers to ensure we have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of all families.</p></speech>

We have previously discussed issues like capacity and the sustainability of the sector.  Does the Minister believe the additional funding that is being provided will lead to improved pay?  How does she intend to ensure the many lower-paid people working in this sector, who are overwhelmingly female, will see their pay increase on foot of this additional funding?  I have previously raised the sustainability of community child care facilities, many of which might now begin to focus largely on the ECCE programme because of the more comprehensive nature of the funding available for it.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure such providers will be able to provide other services?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, &euro;1 million was provided in budget 2017 to ensure the sustainability of certain services.  The Department has worked very hard to assist those who have come forward to work with us in this regard.  I have secured an additional &euro;700,000 in budget 2018 to continue this work.  This will continue to be an important aspect of our efforts to build capacity in these contexts.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, additional quality measures to support the workforce are part of the building of capacity.  I have a number of things to say in that regard.  Specifically, I would like to answer the Deputy's question about additional moneys by saying I intend that some of the key measures I have identified for increased funding in budget 2018 will lead to service providers having more pay to offer to dedicated child care professionals.</p></speech>

While that makes sense in the context of this sector as it currently exists, do the Minister or the Department have any sense that we should be moving towards an early childhood care sector that is more substantially publicly provided?</p></speech>

I know this is part of his vision.  Speaking personally, I think much of that vision would make sense in some ways if it were possible.  It would take a long period of time to translate or transfer the early child care and education sector into something that is a public service in the same way that our schools are public services, if that is what the Deputy is speaking about.  A considerable rethink would be needed to move in that direction.  I guess I am trying to tackle some of the reasons such a change might be good in the context of the system we currently have.  I am providing public moneys to ensure the best possible early years education and care is delivered for our children and the best outcomes are achieved.  In many cases, these services are provided by private providers.  In other cases, they are provided by community providers.  The ultimate aim is to ensure the best outcomes for our children.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.302.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700025#Z01500"><p>The Minister told me in September that at the end of June, 572 retrospective abuse cases were awaiting allocation.  Actions had been taken in respect of just 4% of those cases at that time.  At that stage, 70% of cases had been live for at least two months.  Does Tusla have any plans for a system-wide approach to change that?  What is the status of it now?  Are any efforts being made to clear the backlog?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700025#Z01600"><p>Tusla has advised me that 1,949 historical or retrospective cases were on hand at the end of July 2017.  This represented an increase of 51 on the number for June.  Of the cases on hand, 1,370 were allocated to a social worker and 579 were awaiting allocation.  The number of unallocated cases has increased by seven since June.  All of these referrals have been reviewed by a social worker.  As the Deputy is aware, an historical or retrospective disclosure is one in which an adult discloses abuse experienced in childhood.  I understand the overwhelming majority of such disclosures are about sexual abuse.  This is a very complex and worrying situation.  The safety of children today is my top priority.</p><p> It is important to point out that all child protection referrals which allege current or past criminal activity are referred to An Garda&iacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Tusla&rsquo;s focus is to screen historical or retrospective disclosures for any indication of current risk to children.  In cases of urgent risk to a child, the disclosure is acted on immediately.  Tusla is dependent on the person making an allegation engaging directly with it and being prepared for his or her identity to be shared with the alleged abuser.</p> <p> Tusla has a limited role where there is no evidence of a current risk to children.  In respect of an adult making a disclosure, Tusla may assist him or her in accessing HSE counselling services.  I have asked Tusla to report to me monthly on the progress it is making.</p></speech>

We know One In Four recently criticised Tusla's handling of cases sent to it and what it sees as a failure to investigate properly.  The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs discussed the matter, in particular Tusla senior management in Laois-Offaly in 2015.  Given that many serious issues were flagged around 2015, it is concerning that the number of unallocated cases is similar to what it was at that stage.</p>  <p>  In September I asked the Minister about a particular report on child protection issues in the Laois-Offaly area which concluded 15 months ago.  Tusla said it cannot publish the report, which could contain very valuable lessons in terms of dealing with these issues in the future.  I am concerned about the reply on that basis.  Does the Minister think senior management is on top of this issue?</p></speech>

She referred to the Laois-Offaly report.  As the Deputy is aware, these are very complicated matters.  I would be happy to share a table which identifies the number of open, unallocated and high priority retrospective cases for 2017.  The number of unallocated retrospective cases is decreasing, although the number increased between June and July.  In addition, the figure for another category, the referrals which are being received each month, has increased significantly.  The figure was 93 in January, 122 in February and 139 in March.  Referrals are increasing.</p>  <p>  The number of unallocated retrospective cases decreased, although referrals are continuing to come in.  It is important to note that while the number of referrals is increasing there are many months in which the number of unallocated cases is decreasing.  Cases are being assigned.</p>  <p>  The most important point to note in the table is that cases which were initially assessed as high priority, that is, where there is a suspicion of risk to a child, comprised 177 in January, 160 in February and 120 in March.  From that point on, there were none.  Tusla is addressing cases and allocating them where a high priority has been assessed.</p></speech>

From our dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we saw that there was a tendency in some instances to recategorise crimes in order to make them seem less serious than they were.  From the point of view of cases classified as high priority, what investigations, if any, have been carried out?  I am aware of anecdotal evidence in one or two areas where there was a belief that rather than cases being dealt with, recategorisation took place in order to tidy up records and make things seem less bad.  One aspect of this is the management of cases.</p>  <p>  Another aspect is the deficit in terms of a legislative framework to deal with these issues.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, for example, has talked about the lack of clarity in the current legislative framework in terms of dealing with abuse outside the family and has, for example, called for the amendment of section 3 of the Child Care Act so that these issues could be addressed comprehensively.</p>  <p>  In responding to the Ombudsman's Taking Stock report, Tusla has referred to a legislative lack of clarity.  Are any changes proposed to address the oversight of cases being potentially reclassified and the legislative deficit?</p></speech>

I have had many conversations with Tusla on the issue of the designation of a case as being unallocated and cases which are of high, medium and low priority.  As the Deputy is aware, even though cases are unallocated assessments have been carried out by social workers.  It is determined whether a child is at immediate risk and if he or she is a social worker is assigned to him or her.  If there is a suspicion of criminal activity the case is sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If there is no immediate risk a duty social work team is assigned to the case and monitors it in different ways over a period of time until a social worker can be found.</p>  <p>  Even though we are using the word "unallocated" that is not to say that there is no social work oversight.  It is erring on the conservative side in terms of ensuring the protection of children.  I am as concerned as the Deputy is about the numbers.  At the same time, I am somewhat consoled by the fact that there is ongoing monitoring in that regard.  In respect of the prioritisation of cases of high, medium and low priority, I am absolutely assured that the system is working and no children are currently at risk in light of retrospective cases which have been declared.</p></speech>

Many deal with Tusla, which underlines its important role and how important it is that we provide it with the necessary resources.  I want to acknowledge that the Minister secured extra funding in the budget.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister about the resources which are in place to deal with allegations of abuse of children and make a statement on the matter, in particular in light of the One In Four report.</p></reply>

It is a primary focus and I feel very confident that we are moving in the right direction.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy I have secured an additional &euro;40 million for Tusla.  This is the third year in succession that Tusla has received an increase in its funding, which now amounts to over &euro;753 million.  It has embarked on a significant recruitment programme to deliver the necessary assessments, family supports and care to all children being referred for welfare or child protection reasons.  </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that with the current available staff all urgent and emergency cases are dealt with immediately.  These include situations of abandonment or parental ill-health and the need to find an immediate placement or a threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the need for Tusla to recruit more social workers, social care workers and family support workers to deal with the number of cases which cannot currently be allocated.  The additional investment of &euro;40 million in 2018 will allow Tusla to recruit a mix of staff to respond to areas of identified risk and to meet increased demand for services.  This includes resources for responding to expected increases in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting, as well as the management of unallocated cases and the further development of aftercare services.</p>  <p>  Tusla will also recruit administrative staff to support social workers in their child protection duties.  The extra funding will also be used to establish a single national out-of-hours social work service, providing enhanced joint working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, additional on-call social work capacity and a new out-of-hours service for foster carers.</p>  <p>  I strongly support the work of Tusla.  I am committed to providing resources to meet the growing needs of children and families.  The higher increase I have secured for Tusla in budget 2018 means that resources are available to meet the priorities in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I know that Tusla operates in an uncertain environment and that its personnel can be uncertain about what has happened previously to children and the impact of further trauma on them.  It is sometimes difficult to get a child to speak to a social worker.  I acknowledge the great work being done by social workers around the country.  The One in Four report referred to particular cases in 2016 where clients chose not to meet social workers.  It is very difficult, however, to carry out a full investigation without statements.  This support for young people must be absolutely and readily available.  I have spoken to a number of abuse survivors who often tell about how difficult it is to make a complaint and continue through the process.  Many of them regretted it, which is very much borne out by the figures given to us by One in Four.  It is very important, therefore, that extra support be given to the social workers in place.  Will the Minister confirm that Tusla will thoroughly investigate all 47,399 referrals received in 2016?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700027#BB00200"><p>I will address the One in Four report to which a couple of Deputies have referred.  There is a key aspect that was most controversial.  It is that the report makes it clear that Tusla could not proceed with 79 of 91 cases brought because the victim declined to meet a Tusla social worker.  That is implicit in some of the Deputy's comments.  Legally and in keeping with fair procedures, Tusla social workers are obliged to meet directly with a victim to validate a statement and they must then provide the alleged abuser with the allegation and the identity of the victim and invite the alleged abuser to meet them.  One in Four reported that 12 of its clients had made a statement to a Tusla social worker.  As the Deputy states, I acknowledge that this is not easy to do.  In three of the cases Tusla was assessing whether the alleged abuser posed a current risk to children.  One case was founded, while five were unfounded.  The remaining three were closed without an assessment of risk.  This can occur where a person cannot be located or has died.  This provides a view of the very complicated process that is followed when a referral takes place and the focus of Tusla in the assessment of the current risk to children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700027#BB00300"><p>I accept that the process can be very difficult for everybody involved.  The Minister mentioned the report.  Eight of the 12 allegations made were not investigated or were deemed to be unfounded.  There were 91 cases originally.  Only one case came back having been found to be founded.  That means that in only one case is the sex offender being monitored from the time of referral.  That is a concern because Tusla has a legal responsibility to assess the likelihood of a current or potential risk to children.  We all need to be sure the resources are in place to ensure safety will be absolutely paramount.  I appreciate that things may be better, but will there be a unit in place to examine historical cases?  It is very important that there be capacity to allow a bond to be built between a child and a social worker.  This is very important in all of the work done by Tusla.  It would allow for better co-operation when proceeding with a full investigation.</p></speech>

In following the law it must be fair to all parties.  That is why we saw such a result.  It followed proper procedures according to law.</p>  <p>  Much of the Deputy's questioning concerns how Tusla responds to allegations of abuse.  In the first quarter of 2017 it received 13,629 referrals.  The duty social worker carries out preliminary inquiries on all referrals.  This involves checking to see if a child already receives a service or is known to child protection services.  It also involves clarifying the nature of the concern, contacting key professionals such as public health nurses or teachers for an input and opening a case record.  Over half of the cases that are subject to a preliminary inquiry do not proceed to a child protection initial assessment as the threshold is not met.  A really thorough initial piece of work is done.  Although there are concerns and there are many ways to seek prevention and intervention, Tusla believes the work is carried out in that context.</p></speech>

I ask against the backdrop of child care providers being expected to complete an ever-increasing amount of paperwork in a continually changing sector.  The 7% increase in the budget is welcome, but I ask if it will be sufficient.</p></reply>

That is why I increased the capitation rate for the first time since the ECCE programme was introduced in 2010.  I have provided for a 7% increase from September next.  The independent review of costs I have commissioned will provide critical information to guide decision-making on further investment in future budgets.  I am pleased to report that my officials met personnel from Crowe Horwath again last week to advance this important work.</p>  <p>  The new early years care and education measures announced in budget 2018 form part of continued growth in early years education investment by my Department.  In budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in child care funding, which followed from a similar increase in budget 2016.  These increases reflect the emphasis we are placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  Having said this, I will repeat that it will take significant investment over many budgets to enable Ireland to catch up with its OECD counterparts and enable us to value our early years workforce fully.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is not the employer of child care workers.  I have suggested to the sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a sectoral employment order, asking the court to make a recommendation on pay for the whole early years sector.  I should also remind Deputies that in addition to the 7% increase achieved in capitation payments, I have also provided &euro;3.5 million towards "non-contact time" for all child care providers who register for the enhanced child care measures introduced last month.  This, in addition to the &euro;14.5 million paid to child care services so far in 2017, recognises the administration associated with the ECCE programme and other schemes.  I am pleased to confirm that a full &euro;18 million will be paid in programme support payments in 2018.  I am committed to doing everything I can to help to address the pay and sustainability issues in the early years sector.</p></speech>

The 7% increase which is well intentioned is very welcome and should be passed on to workers.  It is a step in the right direction.  I am concerned as there are many managers of cr&egrave;ches who, in some cases, may not have taken salaries for a number of weeks.  They need to look after themselves.  Is this one of the other ways to address the fact that community employment scheme workers were a crutch in the community sector?  Is this a way to appease community sector cr&egrave;ches as it might afford them the opportunity to take on the additional staff members required?  There has been a major burden on the community sector since last December, close to Christmas, when the changes came about.  Is the 7% increase a step towards further announcements in the budgets ahead?</p></speech>

The measures that I introduced in budget 2018 were very strategic and came after much reflection on how, having introduced many measures in budget 2017 which are now beginning to kick in for families, we could focus particularly on quality issues in 2018, as well as looking at ways in which our quality focus can continue to ensure that the cost for families can be more affordable.  The increase in the capitation rate, for the first time ever, is clearly income that will go to child care providers.  It is there for staff and for other costs, but as the Deputy well knows, the primary cost in the provision of child care is staffing.  The Department have made a significant contribution, in the context of the concerns around pay.  In addition, the extension by up to four months of the free pre-school for many children also increases the income of the provider.  Those are two examples, not to mention the &euro;18 million for programme support, of ways in which I am continuing to invest in the services in order to support the increased pay and conditions.</p></speech>

Did the Minister see this as an opportunity for the community creches to take on the additional staff that they may have lost?  I do not want to be disingenuous but I did the sums on it myself and if one was to break it down, the 7% would not bring their wages up to minimum wage.  Does the Minister have plans going into the future as to how we can help and support the community sector after the loss of the CE worker?  I still regularly hear about that loss and how expensive it is for creches to recruit staff.  Not only is it hard to recruit, but it is expensive because they are continuously competing.  Now they will be competing all the more because they may not be able to afford to take on the extra staff.</p></speech>

In response to another question, I indicated that there will be an additional &euro;700,000 available to the community sector to help with sustainability and viability issues.  I am doing a considerable amount with the resources that I achieved in the budget.  In the context of the wider budget and indeed the overall decisions that were being made I believe that I achieved a significant amount for the Department and for the providers.  The focus was on quality.  I want to say again that I am absolutely determined to support these measures.  There was not much movement for sectoral employment orders.  I wish there was, but in the absence of those, this is what I am doing.</p></speech>

My Department acknowledges that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector and can lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. </p>  <p>  My Department is somewhat constrained in what it can do in this regard as it is not an employer of child care workers.  However it is of course a major funder of the child care sector.  It is important to note that the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector are recognised employers and employee groups. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that trade unions are active in seeking to achieve a critical mass of representation on the employee side, and I welcome this move.  My Department would also be supportive of any move on the employer side to establish a recognised representative body. </p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that it might apply to the Labour Court for a sectoral employment order, SEO, asking the court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector.  Under an SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  While my Department would have no direct role in relation to the SEO process, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, it would be well placed to make a submission to the court once it publishes its notice in relation to the application for a SEO for the sector.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the last three budgets have increased investment in early years by some 87%.  This has helped us to address affordability, access and quality, although I recognise that there is more to be done.  This year's announcement of a 7% increase in ECCE capitation is intended to support the workforce.  The &euro;18 million in 2017 to support "non-contact time" or the administration burden associated with the scheme, is also intended to support providers and their employees.</p></reply>

I am sure that she is aware, from being out and about in various constituencies, that the bottom line is that child care workers find themselves in untenable positions due to the issue of income versus expenditure and the administrative costs and burdens incurred as part of delivering the affordable child care scheme.  We recognise the immense contribution that child care workers are making within Irish society in caring for children.  However, we need to invest more heavily in the child care sector.  We need more investment for the child care workers and for parents who are under immense strain.  child care can cost families anything up to &euro;1,000 a month.  It is a huge extra burden on parents.  We are not in a position to deliver on the affordable child care scheme, as we had hoped.  ICT seems to be a huge burden on the child care workers and those who administer it.  We have 9,000 families who are going to miss out on that scheme as a result of subsidies not being made available.  Can the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-17a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101700028#CC01200"><p>Of course I agree with the Deputy's initial points.  I have done a huge amount in terms of trying to identify, with the limited resources available to me, and I got more than others in this budget, where the resources should be applied.  I have also indicated that investment into the early years sector in general has increased over the years.  I am not disagreeing with the Deputy's point that more investment is required.  I understand that.  The two main measures that I put forward this year focussed on quality, hoping that the investment will get to the workers.  In terms of ECCE capitation rates, we used some case studies.  A small service with 11 children with a level 6 practitioner will see its income rise from &euro;26,961 to &euro;28,942.  That is an increase of &euro;1,881 into that service.  An average service with 25 ECCE children with graduate room leaders will see its income rise from &euro;71,250 to &euro;76,237.  That is an increase of &euro;4,987.  Those are just a couple of examples.  I could provide other case studies.  We carried out these scenario analyses to see how much more money could get into these different types of providers and services by increasing the capitation rate by 7%.  It was directly intended to support the providers and, ultimately, hopefully, the child care workers and professionals.</p></speech>

Their experience has been one of hardship in the sense there are such high expectations of them from the Department, and while there is no harm in having high expectations, they are being pulled from Billy to Jack with the huge administrative burden in the sector.  There is also the issue of the low salary which workers in the sector earn, the issue of continuous professional development for child care workers, the expectation they would have a level 8 qualification only to be paid the minimum wage and the issue of what career opportunities they will have in the years to come.  There is no encouragement for young people coming through third level to go into this profession even though child care workers are badly needed.  Access to child care facilities is a major issue for women wishing to return to work and it is important that they would have such a facility on their doorstep.</p></speech>

The measures I identified are trying to address those issues.  I gave the Deputy a couple of case studies in terms of the increase in capitation.  As she is aware, I have also provided for a measure of ensuring two full years of entitlement to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and she might ask how will that help.  When the ECCE scheme was originally extended from 38 weeks to 61 weeks, it gave the ECCE scheme providers the option of increasing their income by 60% if they had the space and capacity to expand.  That is guaranteed State income, paid at intervals by Pobal.  In terms of moving it to one entry level and increasing and extending the time of the entitlement of all children to a full two years, that increased income and profit margin also goes to the providers.  There is more money going to the providers with that measure, as well it being one that hopefully provides more affordable child care for families.</p></speech>

How much additional funding in reality will be made available to improve the fulfilment of Tusla's child protection policy?

Tusla will have available to it some &euro;753 million in funding next year.  The additional funding will allow for the recruitment of over 300 new staff during 2018.</p>  <p>  With regard to child protection, Tusla is being provided with additional resources to support the roll out of the remaining provisions of the Children First Act 2015, which will commence on 11 December this year.  Under the legislation mandated reporters will be required by law to report serious concerns about child abuse and neglect to Tusla.  Tusla also intends to implement its new child welfare and protection strategy in 2018, which is designed to ensure timely responses to children at risk.</p>  <p>  The additional funding provided will also allow for the expansion of Tusla&rsquo;s out of hours social work service in 2018.  The three existing services will be integrated into one national service with a national contact number and access to a social work service on a 24-7 service basis.  This development is most welcome.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased to announce that additional funding in 2018 will allow for 11 new family resource centres to be included in the family resource programme in 2018.  Additional funding will also be provided to existing family resource centres following the submission of plans for services, and their approval by Tusla.  The primary role of family resource centres, as the Deputy is aware, is prevention and early intervention, and I very much value their role in supporting local communities.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to be in a position to support Tusla in its work through the targeting of additional resources to services that will impact positively on vulnerable children and families.</p></speech>

I hope it turns out as well as the Minister would hope.  As she is aware, Professor Geoffrey Shannon was very critical of the lack of serious out of hours services.  He pointed out that because of the lack of facilities available to Tusla, the private sector was being relied upon, especially during the out of hours period.  He pointed out that, especially with respect to children with serious behavioural problems, that the private sector was picking and choosing the children it would take.  This is something a State body would not do.  One cannot tell a private body that it is obliged to take all children.  Private sector providers have not done that by all accounts.  There are no mandatory rules in place to make them take every child who needs their help.  Will there continue to be a dependence on the private sector, given that Professor Geoffrey Shannon pointed out that it is not to be depended on and that the State sector is a more reliable source for these children?</p></speech>

In terms of the Shannon report and Tusla's response to it, the focus is on the extension of out of hours services, particularly in the critical phase of ensuring social workers are available to work with the garda&iacute; in order to ensure that the situation of difficulty or trauma is responded to in the best possible way.  There is a number of measures that Tusla has identified that it will put in place to ensure a better way of garda&iacute; working with Tusla in order for that to happen.  From my perspective, I would like to see more social workers working with garda&iacute; and available to the wider public beyond just the garda&iacute; to indicate their concerns in regard to children.  I will stop on that note as I know the Deputy has a further supplementary question.</p></speech>

They are all located in areas where there is significant need.  I have been told there is talk of them each getting an extra &euro;10,000.  They have said the extra &euro;10,000 would certainly be welcome but it would merely alleviate the pressure the centres are already under in terms of their deficits and running costs.  For example, the centre in Taghmon is seeking to set up a Traveller boys group.  There is a large Traveller population in the area.  It also seeks to set up a youth club and a parent and toddler group.  The &euro;10,000 additional funding will not allow it to do that.  It is already under serious pressure in meeting the demand for child counselling and is relying on voluntary help in order to make that happen.  The additional funding of &euro;10,000 will not be enough.  It would be money very well spent by the State to give funding to centres such as the Taghmon centre to do what it would love to do because it would make such a difference to the area.</p></speech>

The centres will have to go through an application process and I hope to outline the detail of that by the end of this week.  It is the first time in a long time there has been such a significant increase in funding for family resource centres across the board.</p><p> I am fully aware that does not cover everything family resource centres intend or desire but the moneys available are also to increase the numbers of family centres.  Deputy Wallace said there are five in Wexford and there are three in Kildare, and I could speak about other areas where there are a significant number and others where there are hardly any.  It is the first time in several years that we are adding to the number of family resource centres.  Some of the funds will go there, and there will be up to &euro;10,000 extra for existing family resource centres, which represents a great start.</p></speech>

The further expansion of ECCE in budget 2018 is expected to see 114,000 children attend for a full two programme years.  The fact that 120,000 have already been accommodated in April 2017 suggests that capacity should not be an issue.</p>  <p>  My Department, with the support of the local city and county child care committees and Pobal, actively monitors issues affecting child care provision, including capacity.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills and the Central Statistics Office to identify the number of children eligible for free pre-school years.  As it did before, my Department will make information available in the coming weeks to each of the 30 county child care committees on the number of children eligible for ECCE per electoral division.  This will enable the CCCs support providers and parents in the local area to ensure sufficient capacity exists.  If any future capacity issues are identified my Department will consider any intervention necessary, such as, for example, the provision of capital funding.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has any specific concerns with regard to a specific area, this area should be brought to the attention of my Department or the local city and county child care committee.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am keenly aware of the pressures on the sector with regard to maintaining and expanding capacity.  My Department provided &euro;8.4 million for its 2017 early years capital funding programme, doubling the &euro;4 million provided under the 2016 early years capital funding programme.  This funding has been made available to early years providers under three strands, the largest of which went towards enabling early years services to provide additional child care places.</p></reply>

My understanding from speaking with child care workers is that there is a problem with capacity because there is such demand for places, which is welcome.  Many child care providers do not have the capacity or the wherewithal to supply the demand so I look forward to any announcements that the Minister might make on capital funding or infrastructure that might be put in place for these child care providers who cannot provide the places so that parents can access the free preschool year.  The Minister's response today is welcome and I thank her for it.</p></speech>

The issues with capacity that I would have brought to the Minister's attention in recent days related to a cr&egrave;che in Mountbellew in my constituency, and there is another one in Deputy Michael Moynihan's constituency.  These cr&egrave;ches are seeking to expand and are looking to see if a capital programme will be put forward to deal with the problem of capacity they face, where they can cater for the first year but the second year and extension of the scheme will put them under pressure.  They need to provide an extra room or portacabin.  The money allocated last year was very welcome but there are several cr&egrave;ches, which have been in existence since 2007, that are looking to expand and want to know if there will be funding in the future.</p></speech>

For many years, I have been concerned at Fingal County Council's lack of action in regard to Dunsink Lane and have raised it consistently.  There are approximately 1,000 acres of land in this environ, 300 acres of which is owned by Fingal County Council, 200 acres is part of the old tip head and 150 acres takes in Dunsink Observatory and surrounding lands.  The rest is privately owned.</p>  <p>  Fingal County Council is currently conducting an overall study of this area which is included in its development plan.  There is potential to build between 4,500 and 12,000 social and affordable housing units on these lands, depending on density.  One benefit of developing this area is that it is virtually a greenfield site, of which we do not have many, with a number of Traveller-specific accommodation units contained within it which can also be enhanced, delivering a decent quality of life to all in an inclusive way.</p>  <p>  The city centre is only 4 km away.  Dunsink Lane also contains vital road links between Finglas and Castleknock.  The new Luas is located nearby at Broombridge.  Dunsink Observatory and Elmfield golf course are currently not accessible from Finglas as a massive concrete block has been placed across the road, something that should never have happened.  This ought to be removed immediately, with a new road built and a new bridge to accommodate it.</p>  <p>  Other local amenities and advantages include its proximity to the M50 and to the Royal Canal, allowing the extension of the cycling area.  It would also provide access to the Phoenix Park and the Tolka Valley Park, a beautiful new park, which runs alongside the River Tolka on the other side of where this proposed development would be located.  Blanchardstown shopping centre and industrial parks also border on this area.</p>  <p>  It is an area that has been neglected for many years.  It unquestionably has great potential and would make a considerable dent in resolving the housing crisis.  It would also help to alleviate the considerable traffic congestion between Finglas and Cabra and between Castleknock and Finglas.  The blocking-off of that road has been an ongoing problem for many years, and has proved disastrous for the whole area.  Traffic lines up from Broombridge right into Finglas and a similar problem arises on the other side, at the Cabra end.</p>  <p>  This proposed project needs resources and a will to deliver them.  There are considerable advantages in doing this.  The land belongs to the local authority, Fingal, and if we ever needed a project capable of delivering large numbers of social and affordable housing units, this is it and this is the place where it can be delivered.  For many of my childhood years, I lived in this lane and played in these fields.</p><p>It is a massive place with beautiful surroundings.  It has huge potential and I ask the Minister of State to talk to Fingal County Council to see whether we can get a project and money and see whether it is deliverable.</p></speech>

I am not as familiar as he is with the land around Dunsink, but I know it slightly.  The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country.  It is for this reason that the overarching objective of Rebuilding Ireland is to increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020.  In particular, the aim is to increase the supply of high quality social and affordable homes from State and privately held lands to buy or rent as quickly as possible in areas where demand is greatest.</p>  <p>  Critically, &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer investment has been secured to deliver 47,000 social housing homes through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing over the period to 2021.  This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities to advance their housing delivery.  This year, 4,500 new social housing homes will be delivered through new builds, acquisitions and refurbishments, and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction.  Taking the Fingal area alone, there are 912 new homes at various stages of the approval process.</p>  <p>  With regard to active land management, the Department, working with local authorities and the Housing Agency, has collated details of local authority lands acquired for housing purposes.  To this end, details of 1,700 ha of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published in April on the Rebuilding Ireland housing land map, with the aggregate potential to deliver 42,500 homes nationally.  All local authorities, including Fingal County Council, are preparing strategic development and management plans for their housing lands, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the most potential to deliver housing at scale in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  I understand that the site in question at Dunsink Lane is not currently part of the housing land map as it includes the former landfill site, and as such was not acquired by the council for housing purposes.  However, as part of the active land management process, local authorities have been asked to confirm that the data published on the housing land map is fully up to date, and to ensure that any additional sites suitable for housing are included.  This should be an iterative and live process, and as other lands are identified and become available they should be added to the map.</p>  <p>  In its county development plan 2017-2023, adopted in March 2017, Fingal County Council recognises the strategic location and development potential of the lands at Dunsink.  However, it also notes significant road, wastewater and other infrastructural constraints that require further detailed investigation so as to inform any future decision to zone the overall Dunsink area for a mixed-use urban area.  The council has committed to carrying out a feasibility study to identify the necessary physical infrastructure required to realise the full development potential of the wider Dunsink lands and the Department will, of course, be happy to engage with the council as it progresses this work.</p>  <p>  Last week the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced a second round of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, a number of years ago.  Looking at this for the first time in the past day or so, I see the Dunsink area might be a suitable location for some of this infrastructural funding to be spent.  I also note that Fingal County Council has not yet brought forward additional sites for development of social housing at scale.  However, there is a site at Wellview in Mulhuddart, which is considered to be the most advanced site of scale in Fingal County Council's housing land portfolio as things stand.  The council has flagged that Dunsink is an area of strategic importance for its new development plan, and it is drawing up the strategic plan I mentioned.  The Department is engaging with it in this process.  In fairness to the point made by the Deputy, it is just over four miles from the city centre.  It sounds like an area very suitable for development, but there are a couple of hurdles that the local authority and the Department must overcome first before those decisions can be made.</p></speech>

What we are looking at is a new study to see what is suitable.  The Minister of State mentioned Dunsink tip head, but that is 200 acres on the opposite side of the road to where we are speaking about, which is 300 acres.  This is bigger than the Mulhuddart site.  This is a massive amount of land and it is a greenfield area.  It is an area where we would not run into the same problems with lot of residents in terms of trying to get planning.  For many years we have ignored it.  We also have the potential of putting in a lot of projects there, including in the Dunsink tip head area.  We have a horse and pony project.  We have also spoken about having a track for bikes on it.  A raft of amenities can be put in the general area.  The fact this land is available is constantly ignored.  It was acquired a number of years ago through a compulsory purchase order as a result of people settling on the land.  It is there and ready for people to take advantage of it.  We should be saying the infrastructure fund is there and asking the council what it can do and whether it can deliver on this.  Can we speed-up the process and look at these lands?  In one fell swoop we could clear an awful lot of the problems in terms of housing.  The delivery of housing on that site alone would be massive.  We would have, hopefully, social and affordable housing and affordable rents on the site because it is ideal.  They are prime lands with amenities left, right and centre around the area.  There is also access to a lot of facilities.  It makes it an ideal site.</p></speech>

I was there a couple of weeks ago in Swords with the manager and senior officials.  I will certainly contact them.  I was not aware of the full extent of the landholding until this was brought up.  There is also, in terms of the planning laws, the necessity for a local area plan to be adopted before the houses can be constructed but that could happen pretty quickly.  It is an absolute requirement that local people have a right to have an input into zoning issues in lands in their own area, but that process can happen also.  I will speak to the officials in Fingal about where they stand at present with the commitment they have given to the Department to carry out the feasibility study to which I referred earlier, and I will get back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I discussed a similar issue with her last week.  It is important that we make progress on these issues.  The length of time that patients wait for adult spinal surgery and orthopaedic surgery is unacceptable.  Each time we raise this issue in the Chamber we are given a commitment that it will be dealt with comprehensively and that waiting lists will be reduced, but since I raised this issue previously the waiting lists have gone in the other direction.  The issues I will deal with specifically relate to Tallaght hospital and the statistics refer to one particular senior surgeon.  The figures are not for a multiple of surgeons, and if they were they would be dramatically worse.  These are accurate statistics for the outpatient list of one particular surgeon working directly with Tallaght hospital.  At present, he has 500 patients on an outpatient list at Tallaght hospital.  Of these, 170 need surgery.  In addition to this, he deals with referrals from a hospital in my constituency, Naas General Hospital, which deals with north Kildare in particular.  He also deals with referrals coming from other hospitals in Dublin and the midlands.  If we were to combine all of these other referrals and the other surgeons, we can appreciate the extent of the list, how long it is and the length of time people wait, which is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  When I raised this in October last year and again in May this year, and looked for the required and requested investment, I was given a somewhat positive response that it would happen but, unfortunately, I am raising the matter again this evening because no progress is being made.</p><p>We want to acknowledge the management, surgeons and front-line staff in Tallaght hospital, who are working tirelessly with restricted and limited resources to try to deal with this issue.  Its impact on people's lives is very significant, in a negative way.  It is affecting their well-being and mental health.  The pain and suffering they are experiencing is quite extensive, as the Minister of State can appreciate.  It is affecting their ability to deal with everyday life.  It is clearly very difficult and it is impinging on them in a very negative way.  When people are suffering like this, it results not only in trauma for them and their families but it also has a negative effect on their contribution to society generally.  Owing to waiting, they can do only what they are able to do rather than what they want to do.</p> <p> Currently, the routine waiting time is 38 months.  If one is on a routine waiting list seeking to go to Tallaght hospital to have adult spinal surgery, the waiting time is 38 months.  The target is from three to six months.  If one's case is urgent, the waiting period is 23 months, and the target is one to two months.  At present, Tallaght hospital is hiring or renting theatre space from the Beacon Clinic for one day per week.  That confirms the lack of resources, theatre space and infrastructure required in Tallaght hospital.  It is an admission that it is not geared up to do what is required.  It does not have the theatre space or necessary infrastructure.  The crux of the problem is that the required facilities are not in place.  I have been asking the Minister for some time to invest in this theatre to deal with the waiting lists and get them under control.  There is a lack of central funding.  This funding is urgently needed in Tallaght Hospital so these waiting lists can be got under control and so people can have control and regain quality of life, which they certainly do not have at present.</p></speech>

Unfortunately the Minister, Deputy Harris, cannot be present so he has asked me to reply.  I will refer to one of the issues he raised in a little while.</p>  <p>  Tallaght hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, and the hospital is the principal provider of elective orthopaedics in the group.  The hospital's spinal orthopaedic service provides emergency and elective access for a varying degree of acute and degenerative spinal conditions with a tertiary referral base.  No spinal surgery is performed at Naas General Hospital.</p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledges that waiting times are often unacceptably long and is conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.  Reducing waiting times for the longest-waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, budget 2018 announced a total allocation of &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for 2018.  This allocation more than doubles the 2017 total allocation, which was &euro;20 million.</p>  <p>  Early planning for tackling waiting lists in 2018 is key.  This funding will enable the provision of treatment for 18,000 inpatient/day case patients across a range of specialties, including spinal surgery, and procedures.  The NTPF will work with both public and private hospitals in order to acquire treatment for these patients.  Additional funding of &euro;10 million in 2018 will be dedicated to addressing other waiting lists, including for children in need of scoliosis procedures.</p>  <p>  Building on the momentum achieved in 2017, planning for 2018 is ongoing by the HSE and the NTPF.  The organisations will work together to develop a coherent 2018 waiting list action plan.  This approach is to ensure a seamless continuation of this year's work on addressing waiting lists into next year.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that 2017 has seen the HSE and NTPF make inroads into the inpatient-day case waiting lists and they are well on target to have removed 29,000 patients from our waiting lists by the end of October.  To ensure the continuation of this strong focus, additional funding in the region of &euro;10 million has been allocated for the remainder of 2017.  This will fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures, such as those for hips, knees and cataracts, and also for ear, nose and throat and others.</p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting lists remain a challenge, however.  Over 92,000 patients have come off the waiting list so far this year but there remain almost 500,000 patients on the OPD waiting list nationally as of the end of last week.  Outpatient waiting lists do not lend themselves to outsourcing initiatives because the full episode of care would have to be outsourced.  The NTPF has advised, however, that it will seek to commission treatment on a see-and-treat basis, which could be used to assist with the management of OPD waiting times.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the significant increase in funding to the NTPF reflects the ongoing commitment of this Government to reducing waiting times for the longest-waiting patients.  Next year will see a continued focus on our longest-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers, including access to spinal surgery at Tallaght Hospital.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question on the number of people being referred by the surgeon in Tallaght Hospital, I do not have any information but I will certainly revert to the Deputy.  I will ask the Minister whether he will consider specifically the case of the 500 on the surgeon's list, 170 of whom need surgery.  I have no specifics on this for the Deputy at present.</p></speech>

I met the Minister in June or July of this year and raised this issue, among others.  It is disappointing that we are not able to have a full debate on it here.  It is not a matter of having the post mortem but agreeing on a strategy to deliver and make progress.  With respect, the answer given covered the proposals dealing with outpatients, surgeries and procedures in general but it was not specific to adult spinal surgery or orthopaedics, which represent a massive issue.  I am focusing on this issue because it is so urgent and important.</p>  <p>  What is required is a &euro;4 million investment.  When I spoke with the senior surgeon, I noted this was costed.  What the hospital is seeking is a &euro;4 million investment in providing the theatres, the necessary facilities and infrastructure in Tallaght hospital to allow it deal properly, strategically and in an orderly manner with reducing the waiting lists once and for all.  That is what I sought 12 months ago and in May and July.  That is what I am seeking today.  We need a commitment on that because the lack of funding is the problem.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State talked about the NTPF.  We acknowledge that because putting funding into it in 2017 and increased funding 2018 was part of the confidence and supply agreement.  The reality is that, based on how it is being managed or channelled, it is having zero impact on the waiting lists.  Figures show that people on the routine list must wait 38 months, yet the aspiration is three to six months.  An urgent case - it could be a family member or someone who comes to the Minister of State's own constituency office - must wait 23 months although the target is from one to two months.  This is the crux of the matter.  It needs to be addressed and we need to bring forward proposals to deliver solutions and results so the people who are suffering can receive the treatment they need and get their lives back on track and so they do not have to wait 36 or 38 months for routine surgeries to make them mobile again and let them have some quality of life.</p></speech>

Maybe my reply was not specifically dealing with some of the issues the Deputy raised.  A permanent spinal consultant took a post on 17 September 2017.  Some 50% of the consultant's capacity is already dealing with immediate, emergency and urgent spinal cases.  Tallaght Hospital is in the process of completing its theatre reconfiguration to facilitate a dedicated spinal theatre and address the question of the future appointment of a spinal consultant in 2018.  I will certainly raise the specific issue concerning the surgeon.  If the Deputy gives me his or her details, I will certainly pass them on to the Minister and bring to his attention again the urgent needs of 179 patients on the surgeon's list and the fact that they need to be seen to urgently.</p></speech>

Just after noon on Friday, the liquidators were appointed to Charleville credit union.  That was a huge shock to the people of Charleville and its hinterland.  We should consider a number of issues in terms of how the liquidator was appointed.  The timing is one such issue.  The notification came in the early afternoon on Friday when many people would have their wages paid into their accounts on Thursday night and pensioners would have had their pensions paid in on Friday.  An entire cohort of people has not been able to access their weekly wages or other funds on the Friday.  The powers that be, in this case the Central Bank, should examine the situation and how the liquidation process was executed.</p>  <p>  Charleville credit union had been working extremely hard in recent times to try to get out of a very difficult situation.  The board of the now former credit union was working extremely hard with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank said Charleville credit union was not insolvent.  The situation is very difficult for people in Charleville to swallow given that the credit union was founded many years ago and provided an extensive service to people within the community.  Many business people told me over the weekend how their funds in the credit union have been frozen.  Reference has been made to guaranteed funds but many businesses had to resort to their own resources to keep them going and to provide cash to pay their employees last Friday afternoon.  People were told it would take 21 working days before any moneys would be paid out which means people would be starved of access to money for the next three weeks to a month.  That is simply not acceptable.</p>  <p>  We could have a lengthy debate on how we came to the pass that was reached last Friday afternoon and how Charleville credit union was prevented from expanding or trading itself out of the difficulties in which it found itself.  The board and staff of the credit union made significant sacrifices to try to put it in a good place.  The question is where we go from here.  We have no credit union services within the town and hinterland of Charleville.  The credit union had 12,000 members.  Today is 17 October.  What plan is in place?  Are the liquidators now going to wait for 21 days before giving money back to people?  That would starve the community of resources in the shape of their own funds.  As Councillor Ian Doyle said this morning on the radio many small and medium businesses and small traders will be adversely affected and the town of Charleville will be devastated.  Will the Minister of State outline the plans of the Department and the Central Bank to make sure there is a functioning credit union in Charleville in the short term?  I am not talking about the long-term future.</p>  <p>  I am a major supporter of the credit union movement and the work it has done in every community, urban and rural, especially in Charleville.  In the run up to the very busy Christmas period if we leave a void in terms of the credit union in Charleville we will force people to resort to moneylenders and all of the negativity that surrounds them.  What are the plans of the Department and the Central Bank to deal with the situation?</p>  <p>  There is a meeting in Charleville this evening to allow local people to air their concerns.  People are right to be worried.  If the Minister of State will pardon the pun, we need to see the colour of his money at this stage.  We want to see what is envisaged for Charleville and its environs.</p></speech>

This is primarily a matter for the Central Bank but the Minister is fully aware of the strength of feeling locally about the situation in Charleville credit union and the restoration of credit union services.  In relation to credit unions, the role of the Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.</p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  Where issues arise within individual credit unions the Central Bank gives them time to implement remedial actions, including potential mergers.  In the case of Charleville credit union the Central Bank has been engaging with it over a number of years seeking remediation of the weaknesses in its financial position.  As the Deputy is aware, Charleville credit union had been exploring a number of different options in recent years and has explored merger discussions which have not been successful.</p><p>The view of the Central Bank is that the inability of the credit union to address its reserve position, despite previous receipt of external funding, has resulted in it being necessary to apply for the winding up of the credit union.  As the Central Bank, acting as independent regulator, is closest to the detail of this case it would be difficult for the Minister for Finance to second guess its expert opinion.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland made an <i>ex parte</i>application to the High Court on 13 October 2017.  The High Court approved the appointment of joint provisional liquidators, David O'Connor and Jim Hamilton of BDO, to Charleville credit union.  The Central Bank took this action in order to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; funds.  In presenting its assessment to the court, the Central Bank outlined that it believes all feasible options available to Charleville credit union to raise and maintain its reserves at the levels required by law have been exhausted.  The joint provisional liquidators will oversee the closure and wind-down of the credit union pending a final decision of the court.  The credit union will not reopen and all issues relating to the wind-down of services will be managed by the joint liquidators.</p><p>The Minister for Finance can advise the Deputy that the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, has been invoked and that members' savings are covered by the scheme up to &euro;100,000 per member.  Compensation payments will automatically issue by cheque to all duly verified depositors.  The payments will be made as early as possible within the statutory deadline of 20 working days.</p><p>The Minister for Finance can further advise that the Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place to provide specific credit union services in the Charleville community in the future.  The Central Bank is keen that credit union services are available to the people of Charleville.  In some cases members may currently be able to avail of services in another credit union in the area as the common bond may extend into their locality or through their place of work.</p><p>The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in the country and while the roles of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank in relation to the credit union sector are distinct, they are both working to protect members' savings and maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.  The Government is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement into the future.  I will try to ascertain from the Central Bank what specific proposals it has and a timeframe for them in relation to the establishment of new credit union facilities in Charleville.</p></speech>

We could debate for the entire night why we have come to this position and whether the approach taken was heavy handed, but at this point what people are discussing tonight in Charleville is what is the future of a credit union service in Charleville.  Saying the Government supports the credit union movement will not cut it.  I seek a meeting with the Department of Finance tomorrow and I will also seek a meeting with the Central Bank to discuss how we will fill the void in Charleville, and how we will have a functioning credit union service available to the people there who have supported the credit union since the very start.  Could the Minister of State go back to the Department and the Central Bank?  He accepted that there is a demand for a the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place.  I would have thought the Central Bank would have examined what arrangements could be put in place to provide credit union services prior to putting the credit union into liquidation.  I accept that there is a commitment that something will be done but that should have been done prior to last Friday.  We need to have a functioning credit union within the Charleville area.</p><p>A period of 21 days is not acceptable.  I cannot see why this cannot be done in two, three or four days.  Everything is computerised to the absolute limit and all the facts are available.  People's cash &ndash; their hard-earned money &ndash; is tied up.  People need money to survive in their day-to-day lives.  It is not acceptable to have pensions, salaries or anything else, whether belonging to individuals or small traders, tied up within the liquidators.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give the matter the serious consideration it needs.  To be honest, the people of Charleville and its surrounds deserve better.  They deserve to have their money and to have a functioning credit union.</p> <p> I appeal to the Minister of State not to leave a void in respect of other lending services having to come in and deal with the aftermath of this in three, four, five or six months' time.  When will there be a service in place?  When will the cash be delivered back to its rightful owners?  I am seeking a full meeting with the Department of Finance tomorrow or Thursday morning to ascertain what is happening.  This is far too serious.</p></speech>

I will endeavour to get answers to those questions, which are reasonable enough.  However, I would point out that, in the first instance, it is the responsibility of the board of the credit union to operate its activities and to operate within the law.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank took a decision on this question after several years of engagement.  I do not believe it was a decision that was taken lightly.  However, I understand Deputy Moynihan's point.  I have had no direct contact with the Central Bank on this issue in respect of whether it made definitive plans on what credit union facilities would be available in Charleville.  The first responsibility of the Central Bank is to protect deposit holders and the actions on Friday were on foot of that.  However, I will do my best to ensure that we get a response to the questions Deputy Moynihan has put before we leave on Thursday.</p></speech>

I attended the briefing.  I understand that up to 2,500 workers and pensioners are entitled to a share of the &euro;106 million pension fund, known as Pot B or the Second Scheme, that is currently being wound up.</p>  <p>  Members of the scheme raised concerns when they began receiving letters detailing their allocations.  They soon realised that there did not appear to be any rhyme or reason to the method of distribution of funds.  The distribution had been decided without consultation by the trustees, Irish Pensions Trust.</p>  <p>  The second Aer Lingus supplementary scheme was in operation from 2007 to 2014.  Aer Lingus paid 4% of pensionable salary on behalf of employees and employees paid 2% in all.  Additionally, the Government provided &euro;34 million from the sale of Aer Lingus.  It is striking to note the decline in the value of the fund by &euro;2 million to 31 March 2016 and the fact that administrative expenses increased by over 100% between 2015 and the wind-up.  When the wind-up was mooted, members believed they would receive their allocated contributions and a fixed percentage of the performance of the scheme, but that has not happened.  There has been a total lack of consultation with members.  The proposed distribution seems erratic, inconsistent with the principles of the scheme and totally unfair on many members.  Deputy Daly gave several examples when she raised the matter with the Taoiseach some days ago.</p>  <p>  On behalf of constituents I am calling on the trustees and the regulatory authorities, the Pensions Authority and the Pensions Ombudsman, to investigate the distribution of the second scheme and to explain why no other options were afforded to members, as is usual in many other schemes.  Moreover, I want them to explain the accounting and actuarial basis on which the distribution calculation is based.  I call on the Minster to ensure such an investigation takes place.</p></speech>

They would be singing very much from the same hymn sheet as us on this matter.</p>  <p>  This is urgent because the wind-up of the financial interest of the scheme is under way.  The scheme was in existence for eight years.  As Deputy Broughan has said, workers paid in an average 6% per head, including the employer contribution.  A further &euro;34 million was put into the kitty beforehand.  The benefits objective was discretionary and there is no requirement for the method that is being used by the trustees now to be implemented.  Moreover, there is no impediment to the trustees changing their minds.</p>  <p>  What has really aggrieved people is the unilateral decision making.  It means every group of people involved in the scheme is being affected.  For example, for 394 current pensioners of the scheme, the average weekly benefit comes to 45 cent per week.  The trustees propose to buy annuities for this group of pensioners out of their interests.  However, annuities are exceptionally pricy at the moment.  It would be far better for them to have the purchase of approved retirement funds.</p>  <p>  In the case of deferred members, the trustees want to buy pre-retirement bonds, most likely, with one of the big insurance companies.  The trustees have advised that if a member wants to transfer out of the pre-retirement bonds that the trustee has chosen, there will be a fee to opt out.  There has been no discussions whatsoever.</p>  <p>  As we discussed last week, there has been incredibly unfair distribution of the financial interest.  People of a similar age who have made similar financial contributions will be subject to major differences in returns.  As I said last week, one class can put in &euro;10,000 and get back &euro;12,000, while another can put in &euro;22,000 and get back &euro;84,000.  There is a method in place, but it is an unfair method.  We urge and hope the Minister and the Department can intervene with the Pensions Authority in respect of these matters.</p></speech>

I know it is a particularly rife issue in the environs of Aer Lingus and the constituencies that touch it.</p>  <p>  I wish to outline that the trustees of any scheme have duties and responsibilities under trust law, other relevant legislation and the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed.  Consequently, any decisions made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation.</p>  <p>  Trustees have a basic obligation to carry out their duties in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  Most important, they are obliged to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries, whether deferred, active or those receiving a pension - this is probably what is most relevant to this case.</p>  <p>  An active member who is elected as a trustee has to act in the best interests of all members.  If there is a conflict of interest, then the person's duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests.  If it is considered that benefits due are not being paid in accordance with the rules of a pension scheme, the member concerned can invoke the dispute resolution process and procedures that the scheme is obliged to operate.  If the member is still dissatisfied, she can bring the complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman or the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  I trust Deputies appreciate that, in my position, I cannot comment or intervene directly in the pension arrangements applying to a particular scheme.  However, where issues that cause concern relating to a particular scheme are raised with me, as in this case, I can notify the Pensions Authority and ask those responsible to intercede.  I wish to confirm for the Deputies present and absent that the matter relating to this particular scheme has been raised with my Department.  In turn, we have raised it with the Pensions Authority, which has agreed to examine it and come back to us with a report.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a legal breach of obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach has been found.</p>  <p>  Although the Pensions Authority is under the aegis of my Department, it regulates pension schemes entirely independently of the Department.  Therefore, I am not in a position to influence or comment on the matter, the process or the length of time it will take.  I can say that when this concern was brought to authority officials last week they were happy to intervene and address the concerns to the trustees.  We await a response.  I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></speech>
