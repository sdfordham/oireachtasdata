We have not heard much since then so I am asking for an update on where we are.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600003#A00600"><p>The mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct was an unprecedented step by this Government to bring independence and objectivity to bear on the examination of those allegations, some of which go back to 1969 and many of which pre-date 2000.  A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for this purpose with all members selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  They have been asked to examine the papers in each case with a view to determining whether further action is warranted and practical.</p>  <p>  A total of 319 complaints were referred to the panel of counsel.  Obviously, the volume and complexity of cases has changed the timeframe and has led to the review taking longer than originally anticipated.  We wanted counsel to take time to examine all of the cases fully and carefully.  Indeed, the number and variety of cases make the work of counsel all the more important.  There are many cases which have already been through some form of process, whether that involves the courts, GSOC or some other body.  </p><p>The issues involved in the cases also range considerably, from tragic deaths to property disputes.  </p> <p> While the review of all of the allegations is not yet complete, my Department has received the recommendations of counsel in a significant number of cases.  I have received the first batch of submissions on these cases and clearly, as I said previously, I want to start the process of writing to everyone concerned as soon as possible.  I will consider the recommendations of counsel extremely seriously and cannot easily imagine circumstances in which I would not follow such recommendations.  In communicating with individuals I am also anxious not only to set out the recommendation of counsel and my decision on it but also to outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation subject to any legal constraint there may be.   </p> <p> The legal advice of counsel contains, in many instances, comments on third parties and great care will have to be taken in setting out the main points.  Therefore, I have decided to appoint a former judicial figure to advise on the preparation of the letter and the communications to the complainants.  It is better to take that time now so as to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of the entire process from start to finish.  That is the best way to communicate the decisions of counsel.  </p> <p> While it would not be appropriate to publish individual recommendations, I have considered how best information on the outcome of this process could be made public.  In this regard, I have asked counsel, in addition to making recommendations in individual cases, to produce a general overview of the issues and trends which featured in this process.  That may lead to the identification of issues and recommendation for change across a number of areas which I hope will enable us to address some of the general and thematic concerns raised by those persons whose cases were examined by counsel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600004#B00200"><p>The Minister will appreciate that this process has been dragging on for a considerable period.  In the past 24 hours I have received communications from two of the 319 people affected, one of whom came to my clinic in Limerick yesterday, while I received an e-mail this morning from another individual whose case was subject to review.  At a minimum, the fact that the Minister has now engaged a former member of the Judiciary to help draft a reply should be communicated to each of the 319 people involved.  They are concerned because they believe the process is drifting.  Prior to this they had lost confidence in the processes of State and now this process seems to be dragging on.  That is what they are saying to me.  Obviously, I have reassured and relayed to them what I have heard from the Minister on the issue.  I have spoken to them about her positive disposition to arrive at the truth for them.  Will she consider giving them, when they receive their formal reply, an opportunity to interact and engage with somebody on the review panel?  The opportunity to have face-to-face contact or engage in direct correspondence has been absent from the process.  People made their submissions and their cases are being judged on them, without any follow-up or further interaction.  That is a bone of contention for some and it must be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600004#B00300"><p>I welcome the Deputy's comments on wanting to get at the truth for the people concerned and to have the best process in place to examine their complaints.  The complaints, in many instances, are about cases that have been in a variety of places, including before the Director of Public Prosecutions, through the courts systems or GSOC.  The cases that have been referred to the process are complex.  There were very wide criteria and it involved all of the cases that appeared to be relevant, although some that have been referred fall outside the terms of reference.  It was never intended that the process would include face-to-face meetings.  It was always to involve a review of all of the work that had been done and all of the papers relating to the cases involved to ascertain whether, on the basis of an objective, independent legal review, recommendations should be made in terms of a follow-up.  I will take up the Deputy's point about communicating with complainants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600004#B00400"><p>The Minister should not close the door on the option for her, her Department or members of the review panel to engage with people face-to-face afterwards.</p><p>That should not be ruled out at this point.  The Minister is right in saying that many of them pertain to people who have been through some of the legal processes.  Without getting into detail I can tell the Minister of one complaint brought to my attention.  A person has sworn an affidavit that no court registrar was in court on the day that person was in court, but the Courts Service is disputing it.  So there are cases where the system or the State claims one thing and yet a person is willing to swear and can bring witnesses to back up their position.  At this point I urge the Minister to reconsider.</p> <p> I mention one case in particular, the Sarah Bland case.  I ask the Minister or one of her departmental officials to make contact with Ms Bland.  She has been back on a number of occasions and I know the Minister has had extensive correspondence with me and others on her case.  She is seeking a face-to-face meeting with the Minister and I ask her to take that on board.</p></speech>

I am making arrangements for all submissions to be published in the next couple of days.  I will put all the relevant material - there is a lot of it - on the Department's website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>.  They were taken into account in the preparation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, which I published last week.  The new Bill provides for the establishment of the independent policing authority to oversee the performance of the policing functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is at the core of our reforms in the justice area.  It is a fundamental reform of policing oversight in Ireland.  It is the most far-reaching reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.</p><p>As we will be discussing in the House, it allows a new independent forum for the public oversight of policing services in Ireland.  In particular, under the new arrangements senior garda&iacute; will report to the authority on the performance of policing services, including by way of public meetings.  The authority can provide a key role in being an engine to drive reforms of the policing system and practices to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fit to meet the demands of 21st century policing.</p><p>The new Bill is awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad and I look forward to its passage through the Houses.  Approximately  30 submissions were received from a wide range of groups, including the Deputy's party.  They will all be on the website in the next few days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600005#C00700"><p>I welcome the Minister's confirmation.  I express concern over a few areas.  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na officers, to whom I have spoken over recent years, have told me there is an issue in terms of a meritocracy over recruitment.  This applies not just to senior officers but goes through the ranks.  We need better oversight not just of the appointment of assistant commissioners up to the Commissioner but also to include promotions to the level of sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent - from the very bottom to the very top.</p>  <p>  While the police board in the North of Ireland appoints senior officers in the North, it also has oversight of the recruitment and promotion process throughout the ranks.  I seek reassurance on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600005#C00800"><p>Even at present there is misunderstanding about some of the appointments.  The most senior appointments are subject to an independent process at present, with a lay chairperson and two lay members of the panel.  Clearly what we are doing with the new policing authority represents a sea-change on appointments.  The authority will now have responsibility for overseeing the process of those senior appointments.</p><p>That is quite a change.  The authority will be responsible for selecting the process to be used.  It is expected that, in some instances, it will use the public appointments service and, in others, the body which oversees public appointments generally.  It now has the authority to make the decision on how the process will be conducted.  There have been suggestions of politicisation in Garda appointments, but I certainly have no experience of this, nor did my predecessor.  To ensure the transparency people now demand, the police authority clearly will have a critical role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600006#D00200"><p>The difficulty is that the legislation does not address the appointment of sergeants to the position of superintendent and, possibly, chief superintendent.  That is where there is a big issue.  I submitted ten questions to the Minister six months ago.  Her response at the time was that she would refer them to the Garda Commissioner, but I have yet to receive responses to them.  My concerns are around the level of oversight by the Department and, soon I hope, the police authority of the entire promotions process in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the context of the debate on reform, this needs to happen from the bottom up, including how people are promoted, with independent oversight.  I have concerns about this issue, as reflected in my questions.  I ask that they be responded to as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  My second concern relates to the independent adjudicator, an issue we dealt with in the context of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill.  If the police authority asks questions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it responds that it cannot provide information for security reasons, an independent adjudicator, namely, a judge, rather than the Minister, should oversee the process so as to remove any accusation of a Minister being too close to the Garda and so on.  </p>  <p>  These are the two issues I want to flag as of being concern to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600006#D00300"><p>The Deputy is getting into the detail of the Bill.  No doubt, we will have a robust discussion on these issues when the Bill is brought before the House.  It is extremely important that the Garda Commissioner has operational responsibility and is independent in dealing with operational issues.  Obviously, a particular number of appointments come within the internal process within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is envisaged that this will continue up to a certain point.  We can have further discussions on this issue during the course of the passage of the Bill. </p>  <p>  This is the first time a definition of "security" has been set out in legislation.  There is, for example, clarity and a clear exemption for advocacy in order that people will not think we are using the definition of security, for example, to say peaceful protest would not be allowed.  This is very important and will help in appropriately deciding what comes within the remit of policing because uniquely in this country An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with policing and security issues.</p></speech>

The confidential recipient was then required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>Only where a confidential report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner was it transmitted to the Minister.  In transmitting a report, the confidential recipient had to be aware of the obligation to protect the identity of the whistleblower, and any communication between the confidential recipient and the whistleblower was confidential and was not conveyed to the Minister.  The regulations provided that any harassment or intimidation of a member who had made a confidential report would be dealt with in accordance with the law.  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation in July 2014 as part of the Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures.  </p> <p> With regard to the two cases referred to by the Deputy, I first make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  The Protected Disclosures Act prioritises the confidentiality of the process, a confidentiality which is not always easily reconciled with some discussions in the House.  However, I am advised by the Garda authorities that reports in both of the cases referred to by the Deputy were originally received under the confidential recipient regulations.  One of the cases is the subject of a comprehensive criminal investigation and upon completion may be the subject of a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

There are independent processes available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Deputy is aware the Government has introduced new legislation under the Protected Disclosures Act.  I have told the Deputy there is a criminal investigation under way.  If there is information available, such as the Deputy has put forward in the House today, that obviously needs to be part and parcel of the criminal investigation that is going on.  For the Deputy to make the suggestions he has made in regard to proactive leaking on this case is a serious allegation.</p>  <p>  Obviously, every criminal investigation is serious and there is a criminal investigation going on in one case.  In the other case, there is a GSOC investigation.</p><p>Surely those cases should be allowed to be dealt with via the process of the criminal investigation and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, report on those that is currently taking place.

They have suffered terrible intimidation.  They are stressed.  Garda Keogh has been sent to the surgeon in the Phoenix Park headquarters as an intermediary measure.  It is crazy to say there is a process in place that works for these people.  They are not getting any feedback.  There is no communication with them.  The only communication they are getting is bullying and intimidation.  I am not saying it is the Minister's fault.  I am saying the system is not working.  I am sorry but it appears to me that the Minister is not being kept accurately informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These people are in a bad place, and they need help and protection.</p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to that and has informed all members of the force of it.  In another question I am asked if members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the changes.  They have been made aware of them.  The legislation we have brought in, which is the framework under which these complaints are being dealt with, reflects best international practice on dealing with whistleblower protections, which I agree with the Deputy are a very serious issue.  Both garda&iacute; can make their points within the force in regard to their current experience.  I am informed that all of the actions that need to be taken to investigate their complaints are being taken.</p></speech>

Given the highly confidential nature of the programme and the need to maintain the protection of persons who receive support, it has been the policy of successive Ministers for Justice, for obvious reasons, not to set out the procedures of its operation in detail and certainly not to go into the details of specific cases.  I can say that the programme has been and is used in a significant number of cases and has proven its value in helping to secure the conviction of very serious criminals while at the same time protecting individuals who have assisted in securing those convictions.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, admission to the programme is considered by a high level group that comprises senior garda&iacute; and a representative from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and it assesses the range of legal, security and other issues.  The operation of the programme is kept under constant review.</p><p>In particular, the question of how to provide a statutory framework of guidelines for the programme is under consideration by my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that trying to strike an effective balance between an appropriate legislative framework while maintaining the necessary confidentiality and flexibility in the operation of the programme is a complex matter.  Some issues relating to persons who have received support under the programme are among those being considered under the mechanism for the independent review which we discussed earlier.  I should make it clear, however, that persons who have concerns about their personal safety should bring those concerns directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the security measures that should be put in place for an individual is an ongoing operational decision for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Both of them have told me they do not have criminal backgrounds or history and participated in the scheme for the right reasons, to give evidence to convict people who were involved in criminality.  Their central argument is that what they say was agreed with the witness protection programme but the support offered to them after they had fulfilled their side of the agreement was not upheld by the State.  Unfortunately, they have had to engage with GSOC and their solicitor, Kieran Kelly, and I find much of what they told me disturbing.</p>  <p>  Joey O'Callaghan sought a meeting with the Minister and it is a matter for her whether she can meet him.  At the very least, would the Minister consider asking the Garda Inspectorate to carry out a review of the witness protection programme to see how it is operating?  In the Minister's reply, she has told us it was operating at a high level within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me the witness protection programme costs approximately &euro;700,000 per annum.  Could the Comptroller and Auditor General undertake a value for money review to see where the spend is going?  Some of what these people have told me about how moneys have been spent should ring alarm bells within the Minister's Department.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate for me to go into the details of individual situations in the D&aacute;il.  Any intimidation of witnesses is an offence under section 41 of the Act, which specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  It is punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years.</p>  <p>  As I said, it is a very sensitive area and is under review by my Department and, in the first instance, this is how it should be handled.  Given the small size of the State and the population and the closeness of communities here, the operation of the witness protection arrangements presents particular challenges.  Striking the right balance between the appropriate legislative framework and maintaining the absolute confidentiality and flexibility in its operation is a key concern.  In the first instance, it is most appropriate to continue the review within the Department and then, perhaps, other possibilities such as the Deputy suggested could continue at that point.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to take seriously my suggestion about the Garda Inspectorate and the two individuals to whom I referred.

In particular, we are concerned to ensure the right to life, as stated in Article 2, when read in conjunction with Article 1, is respected and vindicated.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am conscious of the responsibility which this brings, in particular because of my functions as they relate to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  There is an obligation on the State to thoroughly investigate deaths which result from the use of force by State agents or in circumstances in which individuals die while in the custody or care of the State.  The mechanisms whereby the death of an individual in such circumstances is investigated have changed in recent years.  These changes have ensured Ireland is in a position to meet all of its obligations under the convention.  Our commitment to complying with the convention was made explicit with the introduction of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.</p>  <p>  Under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is required to refer to GSOC any matter that indicates to him or her that the conduct of a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have resulted in the death of or serious injury to a person.  GSOC which is fully independent and has extensive powers of investigation is obliged to directly investigate such fatalities.  This process is compliant with Article 2 of the convention.  Since 1 January 2012 the death of any prisoner in custody is the subject of an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act 2007.  The inspector's investigation and reports are part of a three pronged process, the other elements being investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and investigations and inquests conducted by coroners.  The inspector is satisfied that the combination of these processes meets the requirements under Article 2.</p></speech>

I will use as an example the case of Mr. Seamus Doherty who was murdered in Donegal in 2012.  I have raised this case previously with the Minister at Question Time.  In recent days Mr. Doherty's daughter, Caitriona, was in contact with me.  She is on the verge of taking legal action against a range of bodies.  She cannot have the coroner's hearing dealt with or apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal because the investigation is still live.  She made a complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission about the conduct of the investigation and the serious questions that arose in respect of it.  However, the ombudsman can only refer cases to the Garda Commissioner with an opinion on whether disciplinary action is required.  She cannot get answers two years after the murder because of the way the system has been designed.  Many coroners are critical about the need to update the Coroners Act 1962.  The bereaved next of kin of victims are suffering indignities for several years as they try to get answers and, in some cases, challenging the State agencies tasked with carrying out investigations.  Radical reform is required.  I ask the Minister and her departmental officials to pay heed to the hearings of the Oireachtas committees and examine the issues brought to our attention.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the 1962 Act needs to be revisited and that that process commenced seven years ago under a previous Government.</p><p>I have had a number of meetings about that piece of work.</p> <p> The Coroners Bill 2007, to which I referred, proposes to extend the matters which can be investigated by the coroner, from investigating the approximate cause of death to establishing in what circumstances the deceased met his or her death.  I take the Deputy's point that when an investigation is ongoing it can be difficult to get answers from other bodies.  While the investigation is current there is a real difficulty and it is not easy in any circumstances to see how that can be dealt with.  If the Deputy can give me the individual details, I will see what policies issues arise concerning the points he has made.</p></speech>

His family have been pursuing the issue of whether medication could have had an impact on his mental health that led to that scenario.  It is devastating for this family, too, who are locked in a process through the coroner's system.  The coroner's oversight is very limited when people question how the HSE or doctors dealt with their deceased family members.  This poses a big challenge and, in fairness, it will take some time to address.  I ask the Minister to be aware of the fact that many families have suffered a double bereavement of loss and then feel they are not getting justice for their loved ones.

I also held a meeting of criminal justice agencies to discuss the implications of the victims' directive, which has to be legislated for later this year.  The implementation of that legislation will have a strong impact on some of the points the Deputy has raised, including the relationship between victims and various elements of the criminal justice system.  In addition, it will give better information to victims and keep them informed.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy's point about the use of medication, there are real concerns that this is not sufficiently incorporated by some of the bodies examining deaths.  However, as the legislation on the victims' directive is introduced and begins to be implemented, it will have serious implications for behaviour in all of these bodies, whether it is the coroner's court or elsewhere within the courts system.  Responses to victims will need to be much more robust and, in addition, victims will need to be told what their rights are.  Representatives of the criminal justice agencies will be expected to have much better contact with victims.</p></speech>

We are concerned because it would appear that since the departure of Mr. Simon O'Brien things have become even more difficult and disappointing.  Can the Minister explain why it is taking so long to replace Mr. O'Brien?  I understand that under section 65 of the relevant legislation, a political appointment of the GSOC commissioners is permitted.  Has the Minister considered changing that operation to make it an independent one?</p></reply>

The advertisement can be viewed on the Department's website and the website of the Public Appointments Service.  The closing date for the receipt of expressions of interest is 29 May.  Selection for consideration will be based on an examination of expressions of interest received.  I will establish an independent panel to advise me on which applicants are best qualified, following which I will present suitable names for consideration by Government.</p><p>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Government must be satisfied that a person nominated for this position has the appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise for appointment, having regard to the functions of GSOC.  As the Deputy is be aware, under the Act the nomination is also subject to the passage of resolutions by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointment.  The appointment is then made by the President.</p> <p> I should point out that the Act provides for a situation where a member of GSOC has resigned his or her position and permits GSOC to act notwithstanding the vacancy, as the Deputy knows.  The person who will be appointed as chairperson of GSOC will, under the Act, serve out Mr. O'Brien's term of office, which will expire on 12 December 2016.  More generally, it is vital that the public has confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the system of oversight, as I have often said.  We are implementing a comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice.  As part of the programme of change, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015, which is fully in force, strengthens and clarifies the remit and capacity of GSOC, and I will keep under review the case for further change.</p></speech>

If a Garda makes a complaint in November and has not even got a reply by May the following year, there is a problem.  GSOC is still not fit for purpose and it is not doing the job it is supposed to; it is not able to do it.  It is going to require more funding.  I know there were some improvements in the Minister's Bill but that probably represented approximately 10% of what international experts had advised us to put in our police Bill last year.  Sadly, GSOC is still not in a place really to hold An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account.  There are Garda whistleblowers waiting six and eight months for cases to be dealt with while the same junior garda&iacute; are at the mercy of senior garda&iacute; who did not like the fact that nasty evidence was being brought to the table.  Those junior garda&iacute; are being badly treated.  Will the Minister have another look at GSOC's powers and its resources?</p></speech>

It has now taken on extra staff and a small number of vacancies are currently being filled.  The annual report was published fairly recently and it is clearly dealing with a large volume of work.  I am in regular contact with GSOC personnel and I have meetings with the commissioners.  They are getting on with the work.  If the Deputy has details of particular cases that he would like to forward to me, although I do not get involved in individual details, I can examine the reason for delays.</p></speech>

She could ask them if they are adequately resourced and if there is enough power to deal with the challenges faced by GSOC.  One of the whistleblowers I mentioned since making his complaint over a year ago has had five internal investigations against him.  The person he complained about has not even been suspended.  One could not make this up.  There is something seriously amiss in this regard.</p>  <p>  As I have previously said, I honestly believe the Minister is not being kept properly informed.  She would deal positively with such issues if kept informed.  She should bring in GSOC personnel and ask them if there are enough financial resources to deal with all these problems.  She should ask if they would like more power to carry out this very challenging task.</p></speech>

Clearly, hardly a body in the country would not say "Yes" when asked if it needed more resources.  I have to be satisfied that GSOC, with the resources and staff that it has, can do the work being referred to it.</p><p>As I have said, I have met with GSOC a number of times since I became Minister and have been discussing the work with its representatives on an ongoing basis, as I have with the Garda Commissioner.  I have been looking at the relationship between the two bodies and the need to put robust mechanisms in place.  One of the issues I would like to see resolved and which would make quite a difference to the volume of work would be to agree a mechanism for the resolution of more informal complaints.  If I call them "lesser complaints", it is not to say that not every complaint should be dealt with seriously.  It would be helpful if everybody involved could agree to a mechanism for some of the complaints which could be dealt with more informally.  That does not exist which means everyone is involved in a great deal of investigation which takes up a great deal of time.  It is not to say that proper complaints should not be investigated fully to note that there is scope in this area.  I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner, GSOC and the representative bodies on this and we are looking at a number of initiatives which could deal with the matter and be helpful in terms of the resource issues mentioned.</p></speech>

Approximately eight weeks ago, the Minister told the House the review was at a very advanced stage in the vast majority of cases and that the process of notifying people of outcomes would begin after Easter.  We had a similar response today to the first question, but there are subtle differences.  I wonder what the story is.  Why has no one been contacted in the intervening eight weeks and where are we at?  The consistent thing has been the lack of engagement and dialogue with those who went to the panel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-26a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600013#L00300"><p>The Government agreed to establish the independent review mechanism to deal with a variety of cases of complaints, not all of which, it turns out, relate to the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, though a substantial number do.  A number are about other bodies and experiences in court.  Some of the complaints relate to property issues.  There is a range of issues within the complaints which have been made.  This is an independent process and I have been very keen and committed to ensure that from beginning to end it is seen as independent and robust.  The Department has received a significant number of the recommendations at this point so the process should be completing over the next couple of months.  Obviously, the legal advice has been made available to the Department in certain of the cases.  The question now is to communicate that.  As it is legal advice to the Department and as quite a number of parts of the advice refer to third parties, I must now find the best way to communicate as robustly and fully as possible the outcome of the process and the recommendations.  In order to ensure that it fulfils those criteria and that we can communicate in the most effective way possible with the complainants, I have decided, having received the first cases just a couple of weeks ago and considered the recommendations, that the best way to proceed in keeping with it being a fully independent process from beginning to end is to ask a judicial figure to oversee the process of communication to complainants in each and every instance.</p></speech>

A problem is that nobody who has participated in the process so far sees it as independent and robust.  When it was initiated, they were told it would take eight weeks.  Let us be clear that it is a paper review and eight weeks was more than ample time for the Minister to decide that some issues related to the Judiciary or land law and could be parked.  Those issues are not contributing to any delay in this scenario whatsoever.  Two months ago, the Minister told us here that she had these outcomes and would communicate with people.  Now, we are told that people may hear back over the next couple of months.  There are going to be a great many very distressed people when they hear this.</p><p>I have made the point previously that we know that, of some of the cases that have been referred to the panel, not even preliminary inquiries were made by it into some of the information contained in the reports.  Therefore, it could not in any way have constituted a robust inquiry; it was a paper review.  In some ways, this will create a bigger problem than in solving one, if they are to receive an answer perhaps some time before Christmas.  The Minister has not explained where the shift has occurred.</p></speech>

In any circumstance where under the review mechanism extra written information is needed, for example, from GSOC or An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, it has been possible to get that information.  It is an analysis of all of the data available.  I do not agree with the Deputy's description of the ease with which it could be decided that certain cases were part of the process, while others were not.  In fact, it has been quite time consuming.  It is clear that the original six to eight week timeframe was a miscalculation in terms of the number of cases involved.  The process is very detailed and robust.  This is the first time any Government has taken these complaints - more than 300 -  and set up an independent process with senior and junior counsel who are completely independent in reviewing the material and have come back to the Department and in various cases recommended further action.  When I said "a couple of months", I obviously meant by the summer.  I do not expect it to go on any further.  I am at the point where I have made the decision that we will bring in the judicial figure and the notifications will start once that person is in place.  I expect things to move ahead quickly from that point onwards.  I started to receive the recommendations in the past few weeks.  That is when I started to examine the individual cases and I decided that in order to continue the independence in the process, this was the way forward.</p></speech>

I do not mean this in a derogatory way, but it is absolutely not the case that people were asked for more information.  There has been no communication with the people who gave information to the panel.  Therefore, how could it have looked for more information?  What we do know is that many people who volunteered new information were told by the panel and the Minister that this was not an investigative body, that it did not want to see new material and that its only job was to decide what to do, not to come up with an outcome.  It is not an independent panel.  The Minister did not advertise for people who would engage.  It did not meet people.  It is not the case that it was delayed because of the provision of new information.</p></speech>

I also said quite a lot of information had come in on an ongoing basis from members of the public - the complainants in the cases - and that information, even where a recommendation had already been made, had been sent back to the panel to be analysed and taken into account by it when making decisions.  The Deputy is extremely dismissive of a process that has been put in place for the first time to analyse these cases.  In respect of individual responses, there are recommendations that further action be taken in a number of the cases.  As I said, I cannot envisage circumstances in which I would not accept the recommendations of counsel.  The Deputy is very dismissive of a process that is objective, independent and involves a legal examination of information-----</p></speech>

A total of 996 protective certificates have been granted and 821 arrangements have been put in place.  In terms of the ISI's indirect impact it is worth remembering that prior to its establishment insolvent debtors were not obtaining informal debt agreements with creditors but the situation is rather different now.  I believe the establishment of the ISI has been a significant catalyst for this change and, generally, I believe people familiar with this issue would agree with that.  As the Deputy will be aware, under a major reform of the insolvency framework announced recently the courts will be given the power to approve insolvency deals rejected by banks where the proposal relates to mortgages or mortgage arrears on the borrower's home and certain criteria are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The quarter 1 statistics of the ISI show that creditors are already voting in favour of personal insolvency arrangements in three out of four cases.  I believe that by giving the courts the power to review cases in which creditors initially reject personal insolvency arrangements, including power to overturn that rejection, and where certain criteria are met, acceptance rates will increase and more debtors will avail of the debt solutions offered by the ISI.  I expect that this development, along with the rest of the measures announced by Government - the Deputy will be familiar with the other initiatives - will strengthen the framework to support mortgage holders in arrears and will encourage more debtors to seek the assistance they need to get back on track financially.</p>  <p>  There is a major public information aspect to this as well in terms of encouraging people to use the services available, including the ISI, MABS and other organisations which can give support.</p></speech>

The last point that the Minister made in terms of public awareness cannot be emphasised enough.  My colleague, Deputy O'Dea, and I attended the sitting of the Circuit Court in Limerick recently, where there were 219 cases heard by the County Registrar on the day.  Every person involved was asked by the registrar whether they had engaged with the ISI.  Inasmuch as I could ascertain having sat through most of it I do not believe there was one person there that day who said that he had interacted with it.  That is an indictment of the ISI and the fact that it is not marketing its service.  It also shows a disconnect between the banks, which are pursuing these people relentlessly into court, and the insolvency service in that there is no loop between the two in terms of banks pointing and pushing people towards the insolvency service and showing them that this is a channel through which they should engage.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister again to outline when she intends to remove the bank veto.  Can the Minister give us a timescale in this regard?  As we know, certain people are watching this day by day.  Can the Minister also offer a comment on the Government's proposals around the bankruptcy term?  At present it is three years at a minimum.  Deputy Willie Penrose from the Labour Party has produced a Bill on the matter.  Where is the Government in terms of reducing the three-year term?  Can we have the Minister's view on the matter?</p></speech>

Those responsible for dealing with these issues in some modern economies believe that a three-year bankruptcy term is the appropriate one and that is what they have.</p><p>Others have shorter terms.  I have asked both the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, on which the Deputy serves, and the Joint Committee on Finance to examine the proposals and revert to me, by July I hope, with their views on the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the terms.  Obviously, arguments are made both ways.  The debate will benefit from the committees' examination of the bankruptcy terms and the possible implications of changes to them.</p> <p> The legislation, based on the examinership model, is being worked on and will be brought before the House before the end of this term.  Yesterday I met a number of people who were working together, including staff from the Insolvency Service of Ireland, to ensure there was very clear communication with the public on the range of initiatives taken by the Government, including particularly the use of MABS.  To take up the Deputy's point, we are also in discussions with the Courts Service to determine whether initiatives can be streamlined to ensure more cases will be referred to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p></speech>

We are all very conscious of the huge humanitarian crisis owing to people attempting to cross over from Libya and Syria.  I had discussions on this issue yesterday with the Secretary General of the United Nations who praised Irish initiatives on resettlement.  I announced recently that Ireland would take 300 additional refugees this year as a response to the European package of measures announced.  Strictly on the basis of the quota, the number would have been fewer than 300, but, in fact, we had already agreed to take 150.  That brings the total number of refugees who will be resettled by the end of the year and into next year to 450.  Obviously, we are very conscious of the tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean, including, in April the loss of an estimated 800 lives in one incident.  By taking the measures about which I have just informed the House, we are responding to what has been requested of us.  We have dispatched the Irish naval vessel to assist in the humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean.</p>  <p>  I have attended the various meetings of EU Justice and Home affairs Ministers.  A broad range of conclusions has been arrived at and broad priorities have been laid out.  They focus on a number of initiatives, including strengthening the European Union's presence at sea and interrupting and fighting traffickers in accordance with international law.  Fighting traffickers is an essential part of our response.  Another focus is preventing illegal migration flows.  From the discussions yesterday with the Secretary General, it was very clear that, at European level, we needed to initiate more legal ways for people in need to gain access to all of our countries, whether it was through the use of more legal routes to enter countries, the granting of visas in particular circumstances or educational opportunities.</p></speech>

Will this be a key focus of her partners?</p><p>While I acknowledge that development aid is not within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, will there be a focus on those areas where development aid is needed, particularly those countries in which economic conditions result in people seeking to risk their lives to have a better life in Europe?</p></speech>

There are ongoing discussions at European level about the legal mechanisms and the legal authority under which this work will be done but it is certainly a priority.  It is very important because there is no question that people are being abused by unscrupulous traffickers and this has led to the deaths about which we have spoken.  Clearly, the larger issue is what is happening in conflict areas and the need for those countries to be helped in conflict resolution.  This is a significant international challenge. not just a European challenge.</p></speech>

It is a completely objective and operational decision.  For the first time since 2009, new recruits are entering the Garda College in Templemore.  As part of budget 2015, a further intake of 200 recruits in two batches was announced.  On 15 December 2014, the first 100 of these batches commenced their training.  The remaining 100 entered the college in early February.  This has brought to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College with a further intake later this year.  In addition, I have received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for two further intakes of 125 Garda recruits later this year.  New garda&iacute; will be assigned by the Garda Commissioner to Garda stations throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  It is the Government's intention that there will be ongoing seamless recruitment to the force because it is essential.  However, it is not just a question of Garda numbers. The Government is also committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has appropriate technical and other resources.  The Deputy will be aware that for the first time, I have initiated a review of the ICT needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A committee is close to producing its final report on identifying the ICT needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This will also lead to a more efficient and effective force.  We are committed to meeting the ICT requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is the first comprehensive examination.

Is duine d&iacute;lis &eacute; Bobby Aylward, at&aacute; fr&eacute;amhaithe ina dh&uacute;iche f&eacute;in agus ina phobal f&eacute;in.  Oibr&iacute;onn s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach, Domhnach is d&aacute;lach.  T&aacute; m&eacute; an-s&aacute;sta go mbeidh s&eacute; ar a chumas an-chuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh ar son a mhuintir f&eacute;in sa Teach seo sna m&iacute;onna at&aacute; le teacht agus go h&aacute;irithe roimh an olltoghch&aacute;n at&aacute; le teacht.</p>  <p>  It is my great privilege to warmly welcome Bobby Aylward to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to congratulate him on his success and to say in my capacity as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that this is an occasion to celebrate, given that it has been 19 years since the party won a by-election and for the electoral nerds among you, about 45 years since we won a by-election from the Opposition benches.  On this occasion we have taken the seat of the European Commissioner, former Deputy Phil Hogan, who I know is loved by many across the country and particularly by our Labour Party colleagues.  We wish Phil every success and thank the people of Carlow-Kilkenny for exercising their democratic mandate.  </p>  <p>  The Aylwards have made a distinguished contribution to public service.  Bobby's late father, Bob, served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and his brother Liam served as a Member of the D&aacute;il, a Minister of State and Member of the European Parliament.  Bobby himself served as a county councillor and was a Member of this House previously.  He is a very committed community person, rooted in his local community.  He comes from a distinguished republican tradition as well as a very distinguished hurling tradition.  This has been a very exciting few months for the Aylward family because two of Bobby's sons, Bobby and Mark, played a fantastic role in Ballyhale Shamrocks' victory in the All-Ireland club hurling championship last March.  The Aylwards have been on a bit of a roll lately.  As a humble Cork man traversing the plains of Kilkenny, I had to eat a lot of humble pie along the way while meeting one hurling giant after another, all of whom feigned concern about the state of Cork hurling.  They need not worry because the mushroom may fade, but Cork hurling never will.  </p>  <p>  We listened on the doorsteps and it was clear that there were a number of key issues about which people were concerned, including regional disparity and the lack of regional economic development, the plight of the self employed, homelessness and a range of other issues.  I have no doubt that Bobby Aylward will do his very best to represent those issues and the needs of his people over the remainder of this D&aacute;il term.  He will also contribute to creating the right policy platform for contesting the next general election in a constituency which will be particularly competitive.  I want to thank all of those involved in securing his success, particularly his colleague Deputy John McGuinness, who worked extremely hard on his behalf.</p></speech>

Credit is due to all of the candidates in the by-election who put their names on the ballot paper, canvassed in the constituency and asked for support.  I was particularly pleased with the showing of our own candidate, David Fitzgerald, throughout the constituency.  Deputy Aylward is welcome back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In his own way, he will continue the long line of representation from his family and will articulate the concerns, anxieties and issues of his constituents in his own inimitable fashion.

This is not our first time serving together and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was a poorer place without him.  I am standing today to try to inject a little bit of gender balance into the proceedings.  Congratulations to Deputy Aylward.  I join the Taoiseach in congratulating all who stood for election.  It is never an easy experience and particularly so in the case of a by-election.  I won a by-election myself and I know what it is like to have the spotlight on one area with an intensity that only a by-election can bring.  It is quite difficult.  That said, walking in here is a great leveller.  Everyone who wins a by-election walks in here and because of the constant media attention, believes that he or she will be Taoiseach the next day.  However, as Deputy Aylward and I both know, that is not going to happen today or tomorrow.  I commend all who stood in the by-election, including Willie Quinn, the Labour Party candidate.  All candidates put up a magnificent show, not just on behalf of the people they were hoping to represent but also on behalf of their parties.  We owe a debt of gratitude to them all for supporting the democratic process.  Once again, I congratulate Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Aylward.  Well done.</p></speech>

It is our hope that if she goes forward again she will be in here very soon - as soon as the Taoiseach has the gumption to call a general election and give the people the chance.  I also commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and its leader - more power to your elbow, Miche&aacute;l, and fair play to you on the day that is in it.

I have no doubt that in the coming months - whatever time is left in this Government - he will have heard enough during the course of the campaign about the promises that were not fulfilled and about the issues facing rural areas, and he will have the opportunity to raise those issues here.  No one is better placed to do that than Deputy Bobby Aylward, knowing the constituency and rural Ireland as he does.</p>  <p>  I am delighted he is joined here by his family.  I have no doubt that his late parents, Bob and Kitty Aylward, are looking down on his family today with great pride in Deputy Bobby Aylward's achievement in that by-election.</p>  <p>  I served with Mr. Liam Aylward.  We fought hard fights in the constituency.  However, it is my strong belief, if all Members told the truth, that they fight the same fight with their colleagues every day of the week.  It is the constituency and the people we represent that actually benefit from that competition.  That is how I see it.  I also served with Bobby, another honourable member of the Aylward family, and he contributed a lot in the course of his time here.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to all the candidates who fought the by-election, a number of whom went out knowing that they would not end up in this House, I am sure, but they wanted to do their best in terms of the agendas they served and to highlight the issues they believed needed to be highlighted.  Each and every one of them is to be complimented.</p>  <p>  Regarding the political parties and those who fought the conventions, came out and were supported, I say to Deputy Deering that the same thing happens in Fine Gael as happens in Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties.  I doubt if I will see him walking the streets holding hands with Mr. John Bryan.  I doubt if Deputy John Paul Phelan will hold hands with him either.  I am sure the Taoiseach is not too impressed with how they dealt with Mr. John Bryan at the convention.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here today to say that because as Members can see demonstrated by the other Deputies, we are one big happy family across Carlow-Kilkenny.  I soldiered previously with Bobby.  I know that we can certainly do business together.  It is a wonderful day for his family.  I would not like to take away from that in any way.  I wish him the very best of luck; well done.</p></speech>

In particular I congratulate his family and supporters who are present today.  The Aylward family have been involved in politics in County Kilkenny for generations at this stage and they have a formidable political operation as was shown in recent months.</p>  <p>  I am a bit of a political nerd and I know the Leader of the Opposition mentioned statistics earlier.  I believe this is the highest turnout in any by-election I can remember in my lifetime.  It represents a huge endorsement for all 13 candidates who put their names on the ballot paper.  I sincerely congratulate Bobby and his wife Helena, and their children and grandchildren on their election campaign.  From looking across, I note that Bobby got a tan on the highways and byways of Carlow-Kilkenny.  There are others sitting close to him who got their tan elsewhere during the course of the by-election campaign.</p></speech>

My father was on the Kilkenny GAA county board for 20 years and sat beside Bob Aylward for most of those years.  We are neighbours and friends.  I wish Bobby the very best of luck for the ten months or however long is left in this D&aacute;il term.</p></speech>

It is nice to see Deputy Aylward back here.  He was always a thorough gentleman when he was here the last time.  I have no doubt he will continue in that vein for whatever period he remains here in the future.  I wish him every success.</p></speech>

I just want to thank the Taoiseach, my party leader and all the other leaders involved for the warm welcome.  I have got a mandate from the people of Carlow-Kilkenny.  It was a hard fought mandate.  I have been out on the doorsteps for the past eight to ten weeks and have met thousands of people.  I have a message to bring back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I hope that over the next eight or nine months I will be able to articulate that message and fight my corner for the people of Carlow-Kilkenny.</p></speech>

So extensive has the briefing been that one would be forgiven for believing the Government is teeing up the situation for a decision eventually to sell the airline.  I understand it was discussed at Cabinet today and that there will be a further meeting later this evening - the Taoiseach may clarify that.  He might indicate whether he has addressed the concerns of the Labour seven who he may remember at the time objected to the sale of the remaining 25.1% share in Aer Lingus.  I believe at the time Labour's Deputy Costello described the offer as bargain basement and that the five-year guarantee was wholly inadequate.  He made other very strong objections to the sale at the time.</p>  <p>  We are opposed to the sale of Aer Lingus.  We believe there are fundamental issues pertaining to connectivity and reduced competition if it goes ahead.  Aer Lingus does not necessarily need to move into a larger company or to consolidate just to grow.</p><p>We know from Ryanair and EasyJet that small airlines can grow to extraordinary levels, with passenger numbers in Ryanair having grown from 11 million to 100 million in 14 plus years and in EasyJet to 60 million.  There are options.  The fundamental issue is connectivity with the regions, including Shannon and Cork airports, and the guaranteeing of slots which ultimately is the guarantor of connectivity.  We know that if these airports lose connectivity, they will, essentially, be dealt a fatal blow.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might tell the House if the Government has made a decision on the sale of its 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus; if he favours the sale of that shareholding to IAG and what guarantees he can give to the regions in terms of Heathrow Airport slots and ongoing long-term connectivity with the regions, particularly Shannon and Cork airports?</p></speech>

The Deputy will recall that some time ago, when an approach was made in respect of the possibility of the State selling its 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus, this was a matter that was not acceptable to the Government and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I made the point at the time that this matter could not be considered unless cast iron guarantees were given.  The Minister has spoken publicly on many occasions about the issues involved, including regional connectivity, employment, the airports involved, both transatlantic and European routes, slot disposal, brand image and name of the airline, the potential for growth and so on.  All of these major issues were raised by him.  The Government heard a presentation from him this morning.  We have not yet concluded our deliberations on the matter, but we expect to do so this evening.  As I said, we expect any decision made to be made in the interests of the country.</p></speech>

The unions have also been briefed, as has the Labour Party.  Deputy Michael McNamara has said he has ongoing concerns.  It seems the last to be briefed is D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I asked the Taoiseach a simple question.  Is he in favour of the sale of the 25.1% shareholding?  The answer I have received is that the Government will make a decision tonight in the best interests of the people, but that is no answer.</p></speech>

Barrett articulate very strong views on some of the key issues involved, including connectivity, consolidation and so on.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has said he does not go around making comments when the Government has yet to make up its mind, but this is Leaders' Questions and he is being asked what his view is on this issue.  A decision may be taken later this evening, which means that the D&aacute;il will hear of the decision made through the media.  What we have been hearing all day, in what are clearly orchestrated Government leaks, is the new commitments from IAG.  It is obviously going out of its way to try to get the Government to sell off the State's stake and share in Aer Lingus.  As far as I am aware, having listened to the media, the only concession - if one could call it such - available involves a stay of execution for the Heathrow Airport slots.  Any assurance on this issue in terms of Irish access to routes from Heathrow Airport will only delay the inevitable loss of the slots.  The company, if the Government sells off its stake in Aer Lingus, will sell off the slots some time in the future in favour of more profitable routes.  That is the fig leaf the Government has been dangling in front of the people.  The Taoiseach then comes into the House and refuses to give the D&aacute;il his opinion on this issue.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been very consistent on the Aer Lingus issue.  We opposed the original sell-off of this key strategic asset by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and will oppose any move by the Government to sell off the State's remaining 25.1% stakeholding.  I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  Was the issue of compulsory redundancies or outsourcing discussed at the Cabinet meeting this morning?  The Taoiseach has said the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport brought a report to the Cabinet.  Will he tell us what is the Minister's recommendation on this issue and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

This matter was discussed in the House on many occasions in the past few months.  The issues raised are of great importance, including connectivity, growth, employment, REAs, the structure that will apply if a decision is made to dispose of the State's shareholding, slot disposal, the brand of Aer Lingus, the opportunities for further growth, both to Britain and beyond, including the United States, the importance of Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports in terms of their being the central airports in Ireland, the implications for Knock airport, from which Aer Lingus operates services, and services to Gatwick Airport.  Account must also be taken of the potential for growth should such a sale take place.  As I said previously, the Government will not tolerate any consideration of the disposal of the shareholding without particular and strong guarantees being secured in regard to the matters referred to.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport briefed the Cabinet this morning on a number of changes that had been presented since the matter was first discussed.  The reason the decision has not yet been made is that the Cabinet has not yet concluded its deliberations.</p><p>I expect that will happen this evening.  If that is so, I assume a statement will follow and that the matter will be discussed in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, that is if the Government decides to conclude its deliberations on it this evening.</p></speech>

He comes out with the mantra that whatever decision the Government takes, it will be in the best interests of the country.  That is the same excuse he used for giving billions of taxpayers' money to the bankers, for running down the health services and for all of the other terrible decisions he has taken.</p>  <p>  We are a small island nation and our economy needs consistent and secure air access.  The Government cannot jeopardise that by throwing away the links that Aer Lingus provides.  Aer Lingus is vital to the economic future of Limerick, Belfast and Cork, as well as Dublin.  The IAG proposes to do nothing to prevent the loss of an estimated 1,200 jobs, following any sell-up.  I remind the Taoiseach that Iberia Airline shed 4,500 jobs after being taken over by IAG.  I ask this question without any great hope of an answer, but will the Taoiseach confirm that any offers from the airline cannot guarantee long-term, into perpetuity, access for Irish routes from Heathrow?  Does he accept therefore that the inevitable loss of connectivity will have severe social and economic repercussions?  We should not have to read this in a press statement, so will he publish the full details of any proposals from IAG and will he commit to a D&aacute;il debate on any Cabinet decision taken in respect of the future of Aer Lingus?  </p>  <p>  Please answer the question I asked about compulsory redundancies or outsourcing.</p></speech>

I pointed out that when the Cabinet was briefed this morning by the Minister, he referred to employment, to the REAs, to the question of compulsory redundancies and to all of the issues, such as employment, protection and growth of jobs, potential for employment of pilots, engineering and airline staff, connectivity, the issues raised by Deputy Martin, connectivity from Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Britain and Heathrow and to Gatwick in the case of Knock, connectivity to the United States and Europe, the opportunity that presents itself for serious growth and the changes that are being discussed in regard to the slots, their legality, their disposal, the brand image of the airline and the name of the airline.  All of these matters were part of the briefing the Minister gave.</p>  <p>  I have told Deputy Adams already that if the Government signs off on this evening on this decision, whatever decision it makes, all the details will be made public and we will have a normal full-scale debate in the House.  This is a matter that should be discussed and the House should be able to comment on the decision made by the Government and the details of that.  This is in everybody's interest.  However, let me be clear on this.  As I said to Deputy Martin, the Government will make its decision in the best interest of the people.  That means analysing thoroughly all of the relevant issues.  This is an important issue for Ireland as an island nation.  We need greater connectivity to keep up our exports, our businesses and to support the huge numbers of people who will come to this country from many parts of the world in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  When this process began, I made it perfectly clear on behalf of the Government that we could only consider it in the context of guarantees being given in respect of fundamentally important matters.</p></speech>

His observation that "rights are won only by those who make their voices heard" was borne out with the count on Saturday, because it was those who made their voices heard who won the referendum.  It was those LGBTQ campaigners who have fought and campaigned for equal rights over decades.  It was those who spoke to friends and family and who spoke out publicly.  It was those who wore badges to make their voices heard.  It was those who campaigned door-to-door in the streets and on social media.  It was the tens of thousands who came home to vote to demand a break from the oppression of the past.  Together, these people made up a powerful social movement that has changed this country.  At the forefront of that movement were young people and working class communities who turned out massively to vote "Yes".</p>  <p>  The result is a massive step forward towards equality.  The movement for change that has been unleashed will not stop now, but will continue.  People will demand an end to all discrimination, to all homophobia and will call for full equality.  They will demand that Ireland becomes a modern, progressive and secular society, where people's religious beliefs are respected, but where no church has control over the laws of the State or the provision of education, health care or social services.  </p>  <p>  The choice now for all political parties is how to react to the change that is happening.  Will they be carried along with it or will they try to stand against and resist it?  The traditional hiding place of the establishment, behind a supposedly conservative silent majority no longer exists.  The choice now is clear and the Taoiseach has a choice to make about what the Government will do.  Will he go along with the change?  Will he remove the clause in the Employment Equality Act which allows schools or hospitals run by religious orders to discriminate against LGBTQ or atheist people?  Will he end the ban on gay and bisexual men giving blood?  Will he take on board all of the criticisms from the trans-community of the Gender Recognition Bill and ensure it is passed by both Houses before the summer break?</p>  <p>  Finally, will the Taoiseach now hold a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, to end the barbaric situation where a woman who has chosen to terminate a crisis pregnancy - even in the tragic eventuality of fatal foetal abnormality - or a doctor or anybody else who helped her could be jailed for 14 years?</p></speech>

I was very happy to see the extent of the result of the referendum on Friday in respect of the equality of marriage.  This was an extraordinary result, driven by the conviction, belief and enjoyment of so many new people involved in politics.  It demonstrates the importance of politics, the power of the vote and the influence of people driven by a sense of belief and conviction for change.  This is heartening and encouraging for the thousands of people of the gay community who now stand with equal status in terms of civil marriage with all other people in the country.  This big message from a small country has now gone out worldwide.</p>  <p>  There are changes being examined and considered in respect of the equality legislation in regard to the issues mentioned.  With regard to the repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, I do not believe this House should be rushed into a situation that is as sensitive and personal as elements of fatal foetal abnormalities and other issues.  I know an Oireachtas committee is considering hearings in the late autumn in respect of this matter.  The difference between this and the referendum is that in respect of the referendum on the equality of marriage, people were able to point out exactly what the consequences would be - that if the referendum was passed, this would be the situation that would apply in law.  Believe me, from experience over many years, it is not possible to be as clear in respect of a concept of changing the eighth amendment of the Constitution.</p><p>For that reason, the excitement of change created by the vote of the people, and it was the Government that decided to put the referendum to the people by popular vote, is an entirely different matter.  We are talking about an issue that is not as clear or as simple as it might sound.  The referendum on marriage equality and rights for gay and lesbian people was about living, love, commitment and dedication.  A repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, empathising with the very many tragic stories I have heard, deals with other elements that are not clear at all.  I will not be rushed into considering these matters because we had a referendum last weekend that was very positive.  This requires the most careful consideration by whoever is elected to the House here in the next Administration.</p></speech>

It was a cry for a different type of society.  There is a sense that society has changed fundamentally and that social change has taken place.  It was reflected in the referendum, and the referendum result is now an active factor in giving people confidence that more change can be won and that if people continue to mobilise we can create a very different type of society, and central to that is the question of the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  It is incredible for a Government that has been in power four years to say that repeal of that amendment would represent a rushing of the process.  Twenty thousand women have travelled for abortions in the course of this Government's term.</p></speech>

We know about the horrific case of Miss Y.  It is quite simple.  Repeal of the eighth amendment would remove a constitutional ban on abortion and allow a Government to legislate for abortion in whatever circumstances that Government considered.  I am in favour of the full right of women to access abortion but, at the very least, the Government should commit to repeal the eighth amendment.  It should not hide behind the need to have another election or use it to try to get votes in an election.  The Government should commit now to having a referendum in the course of this D&aacute;il term.  We should have it.  We will campaign and win a "Yes" vote, and we should then legislate for abortion rights in this country.</p></speech>

That wording was interpreted by the Supreme Court many years ago, and no Government in the intervening period did anything about that.  This Government legislated for the protection of life during pregnancy in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of what the people wanted inserted in the Constitution following the referendum.  Believe me, Deputy Murphy, it is not a case of saying we should have another referendum next week.  I will not do that, and there will not be a referendum on this issue in the lifetime of this Government.  I am saying to the Deputy that this issue deserves the most serious consideration.

I understand the Cabinet sub-committee covers a wide range of issues including general expenditure, the Health Service Executive, HSE, implementation plan, the development of primary care and community systems, mental health provision and pay and agency costs, in addition to other matters.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach is forbidden to report on conversations had by the Cabinet sub-committee on health but in January, the Minister for Health brought forward his 25 health priorities.  Given that the last meeting of the health committee was in May, will the Taoiseach indicate if those priorities were discussed?  </p>  <p>  I recall the Taoiseach telling me previously that the big challenge for the Minister for Health is to stabilise the health system in order that it can deliver the results we expect.  Given what is happening within our health system across a range of disciplines, does the Taoiseach accept that the Government's general health policy is failing and that this committee is failing also because the difficulties within the health service are increasing, not decreasing?  We have the difficulties around persuading doctors to buy into the proposal for cover for children under the age of six, which the Government promised to have in place in July.  Today, there are 395 citizens on hospital trolleys.  In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, in my constituency, there are 37 citizens on trolleys, which is the second highest number in the State.  Those are the type of figures one would usually associate with the winter months.  The Government has failed entirely to end that scandal.  I was in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital last week and it is obvious that the staff and everyone else involved are doing their best but there is not the capacity, given the number of nursing places and the number of beds the Government has scrapped.</p>  <p>  At the end of April, 412,422 citizens were on the outpatient waiting list, and 72,000 of them have been waiting for more than a year.  Those figures are unacceptable.  We have asked here on a number of occasions if there will be a supplementary budget for health.  We did not get an answer, but it is expected that the HSE will be over budget by at least &euro;100 million for the first three months of this year.</p>  <p>  I will conclude on this crucially important point about the lack of mental health services.  This month sees the Green Ribbon campaign to get people talking about mental health.  I do not believe there is a family across this island who does not have a story to tell but austerity, the economic crisis and Government policy have had negative impacts on these services, including mental health and well-being.  </p>  <p>  Big gaps have been created by dint of Government policy.  The recent report from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the safety of services in the Midland Regional Hospital found that the hospital was not governed, resourced or equipped to provide the 24 hours, seven days acute surgery, accident and emergency, and maternity services that are required.  The Minister, on behalf of all of us, has extended solidarity to the families who were bereaved, and I do so again now.</p><p>I commend them for persevering to get to the truth about what happened in Portlaoise.  HIQA stated patient safety was not a priority and that there were similar sad and serious cases on all HSE sites.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might give us some indication of what the Government is doing and how the health committee is responding to what is a crisis in the health service.</p></speech>

The opportunity presents itself during the course of Cabinet sub-committee meetings to receive updates and progress reports from the Ministers involved and request details on an issue from the HSE person involved.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked a number of relevant questions.  In dealing with beds, a new modular ward is to come on stream this summer in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital which will have 20 beds.  GP care services for those aged under six years and over 70 will be introduced this summer, as planned, and people are signing up.  Fair deal scheme waiting times are down to four weeks and will be maintained at this level for the rest of the year.  As the Deputy is aware, they have been reduced from 18 weeks, which was unacceptable.  The numbers of patients on trolleys are still high.  It is a problem, but it is easing.  Although the position is much better than it was, it is not yet acceptable to us.</p>  <p>  The private sector is being employed, where possible, to reduce the very long waiting lists.  I can give some details of the emergency department action plan which was published in April.  It details a range of time-defined actions to make the best use of existing hospital and community service capacity; to develop internal capability and seek process improvement; and to improve oversight, planning, governance and leadership.  In view of the experience to date, it was decided to allocate &euro;74 million for the action plan on a strictly ring-fenced basis.  I have referred to this previously.  Some &euro;44 million is being allocated for the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, in providing an additional 1,600 places and reducing waiting times from 11 weeks to four.  Coupled with the normal weekly release, this funding allocation has seen the number on the national placement list fall to 476 as of 15 May, with waiting times reduced to three or four weeks from that date.  Since 2 April, more than 1,800 people have been approved for funding under the NHSS.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;13 million was provided to cover the cost of additional transitional care beds and home supports, both of which can provide people with viable alternatives to acute hospital care.  The temporary transitional beds in use to address emergency department overcrowding will be replaced with sustainable, more effective beds under the fair deal scheme.  A further 173 community care beds will be made available around the country, which can be opened on a short or longer term basis and as part of a mix of short-stay rehab or long-term care beds.  Of these, 110 have been opened in district hospitals, with a further 24 opened at Moorhall, County Louth.  Some 65 beds are being opened in Mount Carmel Hospital, of which 15 are available, while the remainder will become available on a phased basis from now until the end of June.  This will provide more flexibility and improve the flow of patients out of hospital at an earlier point.</p>  <p>  The additional funding comes on top of measures already taken in last year's budget, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provided alternatives to and relieved pressure on acute hospitals.  This will enable the HSE to deliver on the Minister's stated objective of reducing the number of patients subject to delayed discharges by one third to less than 500 and the number of patients on trolleys in emergency departments awaiting admission for over nine hours to fewer than 70.  The benefits should have an impact within a relatively short space of time across acute hospitals and social care services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE commenced work immediately on these objectives.  On the direction of the Minister, it has the capacity to recruit, where necessary to deliver front-line services.  Arrangements are in place to allow the recruitment of such staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  Figures show that on 19 May there were 668 delayed discharges nationally, a fall of 100 since March.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, I will outline a number of additional measures.  All hospitals open overflow areas on an ongoing basis, with up to 300 additional beds open, and such areas include day surgery cases, with a curtailment of day surgery activity levels as a consequence.  Patients with private insurance are being diverted to private hospitals where consultants have admitting rights.  Weekend discharges are being optimised, while level two hospitals are being optimised to decongest emergency departments.  This was particularly effective in the Louth-Meath hospital group.  Non-urgent elective cases have been curtailed, where necessary.  The community intervention team services in Naas and at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital have been expanded.  These escalation measures will remain in place and the daily oversight arrangements in national hospital groups and individual hospitals will continue.</p>  <p>  The Minister has given the HSE a very clear understanding of the necessity to control costs and have management exert its responsibility in managing these costs in hospitals.  It is not always possible to do so.  It is an opportunity for the Cabinet sub-committee on health to receive reports and updates on the progress being made in all of the different areas.  There is good news to report in some cases, although not in all.  The Department, the HSE and Ministers are working very hard in that regard.</p></speech>

One of the most famous promises he made before the last general election concerned his declaration that he would end the scandal of patients on trolleys.  He did not do it.  Before Christmas we had the largest number of patients on trolleys in the history of the system.  The promise of universal health insurance is nowhere on the horizon.  We are now talking about it happening in 2025, the general election after next, not that I believe it.  Approximately a year and a half ago the Taoiseach said he was taking charge of health policy.  The then hapless Minister, Deputy James Reilly, was going through a very difficult patch at the time and the Taoiseach declared that he was taking control.  He said the Cabinet sub-committee was "not the Government", that it only provided updates.  I got the impression that it was a decision maker, that it would recommend key decisions to the Government.  The Minister has acknowledged that he was warned in briefing papers from officials about the trolley crisis six months before it happened.  We also know this through freedom of information requests.  I presume the sub-committee would also have been informed about this and that it took the decision, in the budget that followed, to ignore the warnings and allow the crisis to develop.  Some 400,000 people are on long-term outpatient waiting lists, while inpatient waiting lists are going through the roof.</p><p>Even in respect of diagnostic tests 27,000 people are waiting for MRI scans, with one quarter waiting for longer than one year, and 17,300 are waiting for CT scans.  The Taoiseach spoke about the issue of contracting with private hospitals.  That was always available under the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The Government mothballed and undermined the NTPF, with the result that the targets which had been reached of six months for adults and three months for children went through the roof.</p></speech>

The Minister should speak to those involved with the NTPF.  It was a success but the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, created a different agency and he employed people who had contracts overseas.  They did not even pay tax in this country.  The exercise went nowhere.  Essentially, the Government undermined the NTPF at a time when it was making inroads.  The idea of purchasing treatment was long with us but the parties opposite stopped doing it, with negative results for a range of patients.  For example, the situation with paediatric scoliosis is a scandal that has gone on too long.  There was warning after warning about this.</p>  <p>  The health committee should be meeting much more frequently than is currently the case in order to deal with these issues.  Last year it took a full 12 months to decide to provide &euro;500 million to the health service.  The Taoiseach knew at the beginning of the year that the health budget was a fraud, just as he knew it was a fraud at the beginning of the previous year.  It was deliberately underestimated to enable the Government to budget for other areas.  The Government is not being fair to the health service or the people who work in it.  This is why morale is at an all time low in all health sectors.</p>  <p>  We know from last year's health budget that the Minister for Health has spent an additional &euro;70 million.  While I was in Carlow-Kilkenny in the last several weeks, I was amazed by the number of owners of nursing homes who told me they were waiting 12 weeks or longer for fair deal scheme applications to be granted.  Last month the Taoiseach indicated that the waiting time was four weeks.  I learned from the nursing homes I visited that the waiting time in the south east is 12 weeks.  That is an appalling scandal.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that the health committee should be meeting more frequently given that waiting lists are out of control, the trolley issue has not been addressed and that we have no information on the Taoiseach's favoured Dutch model of universal health insurance?  The Dutch model was Fine Gael's great promise at the time of the general election.  The Dutch Prime Minister was forced to miss an EU summit in order to deal with a crisis in the funding of that country's health insurance system.  The White Paper appears to have been sidelined and we have not seen any costings for this model.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when he intends to publish the costings and can he confirm that the health committee will be meeting more often?  Will he be in a position to publish the costings before the end of this session and, in particular, the fees that people will incur in purchasing insurance?  Universal health insurance will entail significant taxes for a large proportion of the population.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the numbers who will be paying for health insurance and how much they will be paying.</p></speech>

It met on 19 January, 23 February, 30 March, 27 April and 25 May.  While they were Cabinet sub-committee meetings, we seem to speak about every matter under the sun that is relevant to the general area of health.  Those Cabinet sub-committee meetings receive reports from the HSE and the Department of Health, and recommendations are made where they are necessary for decisions to be taken by the Cabinet.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the Department of Health and the HSE is divided between the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State at the Department of Health.  We examined issues pertaining to the budget last year.  There are now 900 more staff in the health service compared to this time last year.  An additional allocation of &euro;500 million was provided to the Department of Health for this year.  The budget of &euro;993 million for the fair deal scheme is an increase of more than &euro;50 million on the 2014 budget and it provides for more than 22,000 people on the scheme who contribute a further &euro;290 million towards the cost of their care.  No plans are in place to make changes in that regard.  Between now and 2024 the number of people aged over 65 years is projected to increase by 200,000.  This is a serious issue which has to be taken into account and on that basis the Government provided an increased allocation this year.  I understand that the waiting period has decreased from 18 weeks to four weeks.  I am not sure of the nursing home to which Deputy Martin was referring.</p>  <p>  The HSE has carried out a staff morale survey for the first time and it is developing a people and manpower strategy on foot of that survey.</p></speech>

I referred to the legislation providing free GP care to all children aged five years and under and those aged over 70 years.  That has been enacted, an agreement has been reached and doctors are signing up.  From this summer, up to 300,000 children and senior citizens who currently have to pay to see their GPs will no longer have to do so.  This represents the first step in the phased introduction of universal GP care without fees and it is a major milestone on the road to universal health care.</p><p>In addition to specific projects to upgrade existing facilities, substantial work is progressing on a number of key infrastructure projects.  That includes work on the planning application for the national children's hospital, which will be a truly iconic building catering for the children of the entire island.  That application is well advanced and is expected to be submitted before the summer.  In parallel, the children's hospital group board is overseeing the integration of the three children's hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital.</p> <p> Construction on the relocated national maternity hospital from Holles Street is expected to commence in early 2016.  These are all major pieces of health infrastructure which will stand all our people in good stead for many years to come.</p> <p> The Deputy is aware that seven hospital groups have been established as the first step towards independent hospital trusts.  Each committee will develop a strategic plan by early 2016 setting out how they would consider reorganising hospital services and integrate with all other health services to provide best care for the populations they serve.  Significant work is also underway in delivering community health care organisations and the implementation of activity-based funding across the public hospital system.</p> <p> The work of the Cabinet sub-committee on health will continue to monitor and assess progress on key reforms to be delivered as part of the future care programme and, where necessary, will revert to the Government for decisions.</p> <p> I was talking to somebody yesterday whose elderly parent was given a home care package just the other day, which came from the extra allocation made.  They were so happy with the extent of the service being provided under that home care package.  I know it is only one case, but it means so much in terms of assistance, support and comfort both to the family and the individual involved.  These are all part of what we would like to be able to do on an overall basis, but it is not possible to deal with that in every situation.</p> <p> The work of Ministers in directing where the health system wants to be in the time ahead is making substantial progress.  What I have referred to is all part of the pathway to having a single-tier system that is appropriate for our needs in Ireland.</p></speech>

One of the central planks of his party's pre-election manifesto was the great promise of universal health insurance.  He says he is still committed to that, but it is absolutely clear that it has been put so far back as to be a really meaningless objective now.</p>  <p>  Is it not the case that in recent weeks the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has essentially been acting as an advertising agent for private health insurance?  He has been scaring people over 35 into taking out private health insurance before a deadline, or to endure penal premiums that will increase over the years.  That indicated a fundamental abandonment of the idea of a single-tier system, with the Minister actively championing the two-tier system.</p>  <p>  Why would anybody take out private health insurance?  The only reason people would do so is because they believe they will get premium care over and above what people get in the public system.  People are being encouraged to do that due to fear of the situation in the public health system.  They look at the public health system with its longer waiting lists, trolley crisis and massive cutbacks, and say: "Oh my God, maybe I need to take out private health insurance in order that I will not have to suffer that."</p>  <p>  The Minister is reinforcing the notion of a two-tier system by saying: "Get your private health insurance now or we'll penalise you."  Is it not the case that the Taoiseach has fundamentally backtracked on the principle of universality?  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar's, deadline essentially means that this Government is reverting to championing actively a two-tier health system.</p>  <p>  My second point, which is connected, concerns the mess in the public health system.  Whatever the Taoiseach may say, evidence is piling up that the situation in the public health system is getting worse.  Last week, statistics revealed that 71,000 people have been waiting longer than a year for an out-patient referral.  That is a huge figure.  The Minister admitted that in the case of St. Vincent's Hospital and Loughlinstown Hospital, the reconfiguration process had actually worsened the situation.  Last week, the Minister said it cannot be dealt with without extra resources going in.  Are those resources going to go in or will the crisis continue to get worse?</p>  <p>  Last week, doctors in Beaumont Hospital described the situation for those waiting in the accident and emergency unit as "institutional abuse".  It is a pretty serious allegation for doctors to write to Tony O'Brien in the HSE and say that the hospital was guilty of institutional abuse against patients.  Patients were afraid to leave the plastic chairs they were sitting on in case somebody would take them when they were awaiting admission to a bed.  That is an outrageous situation.</p>  <p>  There were record numbers on trolleys in February.  Meanwhile today, psychiatric nurses in Galway are taking industrial action again after they were forced to walk out a couple of weeks ago due to assaults on staff.  They believe that is the result of a lack of resources, including inadequate staffing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding promises made by the Minister when the walk-out occurred, that negotiations would take place and the issue would be addressed, it has clearly not been addressed.  Otherwise they would not be taking industrial action again today.</p>  <p>  While it is implicit in the Galway case, in Cork a psychiatric nurse was suspended for blowing the whistle on patient safety issues.  In the Portlaoise case we know that frontline staff were making reports to senior management about a lack of resources and dangers to patient safety, yet they were ignored.  From how many other places are we getting reports of this kind by frontline staff that are either being ignored or silenced by senior management?  Is there a policy to hush up the dangers to patient health and safety issues, instead of addressing them through the necessary resources and staffing?</p>  <p>  All these issues point to a serious and worsening situation across our public health service.</p></speech>

The Minister and the Government have pointed out that the original target for the introduction of universal health insurance cannot and will not be met.</p><p>It is important for Deputy Boyd Barrett to understand that health insurance must be affordable before it can become universal.  The Government has put in place quite a number of the steps that lead to universal health insurance and a single-tier system.  The Deputy is aware that long-term community rating was brought in to encourage younger people in particular to take out health insurance so as to reduce and contain the cost for everyone, as well as putting an end to double-digit increases every year, which we have had for so many years.  It was an important step forward in everybody's interests that the significant increases in costs every year would be reduced for everybody.  There are a number of other measures that the Minister will bring forward in due course to make health insurance affordable for more people in future.</p> <p> The steps in respect of those under six and over 70 are two important elements of the process leading to free access to GP services as part of the universal health insurance concept.  The Deputy is aware that the primary care centres are being built and opened on a continuous basis and the reforms I referred to.  These include the national children's hospital and the national maternity hospital, and all of these are very major pieces of health infrastructure.  Changes have been introduced and money has been allocated for very specific purposes.  As everybody has pointed out, it is not always about the extent of resources that apply.  Many years ago, there were massive amounts of money being ploughed into the health system and it was inferior to what we have now.  The management has a responsibility here, as well as the application of resources.  One is not separate entirely from the other but the concept of having a well-managed and well-resourced health system should lead to a competent, professional managerial capacity in hospitals.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned Portlaoise and the tragic cases that occurred there.  The Minister for Health went there and met the families and parents who lost their babies for many hours, empathising and understanding the difficulties that they had, and he has taken appropriate action since.  The report produced by HIQA and its recommendations have been accepted in full.  I outlined the details of some of the changes that have already taken place here in answer to questions recently.  The fact that the Minister for Health took the time to go to Portlaoise and meet the parents was important in him being informed as Minister of the necessity to have a comprehensive response to the HIQA report.  The Minister wrote to the director general of the HSE on 15 May, directing that a swift and targeted response be put in place by the HSE to the immediate needs of those parents and families, including, in particular, counselling and support, a case review and other facilities as would be appropriate.  He has obviously requested a response from the director general confirming that those services would be operational by this week, 22 May, at the latest.  He has asked for weekly updates from the HSE on progress on the provision of those particular services.  The HIQA report, which is very extensive and independent, set out the eight recommendations and the Minister has responded by committing the Department and the HSE to their full implementation.  The Deputy knows those recommendations.</p> <p> With regard to a broader patient safety response, high-quality health care means care that is evidence-based, appropriate, timely, effective, efficient, equitable and patient-centred.  All of these factors did not apply in many cases, as the Deputy is aware.  Patient safety is fundamental to quality health care and the health system must be enabled to deliver safe care while at the same time balancing competing pressures in what is an ever-changing, dynamic and complex environment, as Deputy Boyd Barrett is well aware.</p> <p> It needs to be acknowledged, however, that the delivery of health care can always carry inherent risks, as we are all aware, and the scale and complexity is without parallel in other sectors of business, as it is always difficult to determine what might or might not happen.  It is clear from recent incidents and events that the capability of the Irish health system to prevent issues and manage patient safety is being challenged and has been found wanting.  That is why the Department and the Minister accepted the recommendations from HIQA in full and will get on to implement them.  Clearly, the movement of setting up the hospital groups, with committees to make recommendations, is another part of that.  The overall level of services and what might be provided best in any hospital in any group or locality is a matter of a considerable importance.  It has taken up a great deal of time over the years.</p> <p> These are all part of what the Minister and the HSE are now driving to bring about structural changes that will allow for the very best level of care and attention to be given, with a patient-centred system.  I do not accept the Deputy's premise at all of the abandonment of the issue of insurance.  I have pointed out the reason young people have been encouraged to take out insurance, so that it should be affordable and it can reduce costs for everybody else.  That leads, in part, to the introduction of the universal and one-tier health system, where a patient is central and treated on his or her needs, as distinct from resources.</p></speech>

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has revealed that between January and April, there were 35,135 occurrences of people on trolleys, an increase of 26% on the same period last year.  It is the worst figure since the INMO started to keep these records.  We could deal with the huge scandals, patient safety issues and the lack of resources but I want to deal with an issue that affects the "small" people.  On 18 May, around the time the Taoiseach's sub-committee was meeting, there were 65 patients in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital who were deemed to be ready for discharge but they could not be discharged.  There are 310 beds in the hospital, so 65 of those beds could not be used by the people requiring procedures and who ended up on trolleys or having surgery put off.</p>  <p>  The trauma for people on trolleys is that they are sick and many are elderly etc.  How could we expect anything different if the Government cuts home help services, care in the community, close public nursing beds and strip away protections for people in their family home?  They will end up in hospital.  Today, there are 37 people on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is the second-highest number in the State.  That is a direct result of Government policy.  It has closed 2,000 beds.  This Government and its predecessor stripped services from the Louth county hospital at Dundalk.</p><p>Yes, the modular unit at Our Lady of Lourdes in Dundalk is welcome.  I lobbied the last Minister as well as the Taoiseach for it as, I am sure, did other representatives.  My point is that it is a huge injustice that, on the one hand, people are on trolleys and, on the other, that as many as 65 people were told they could be discharged but they had nowhere to go.  That is a mark of the Government's poor stewardship of health.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach replied in relation to Portlaoise.  The health committee of the Cabinet met in May.  The Taoiseach said it meets monthly and gave out the dates of the previous five meetings.  Repeated warnings were given in relation to safety in the maternity unit at Portlaoise in particular as well as to other obstetric units.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children was informed by the then Minister during a particular crisis that Portlaoise was a band 3 hospital and there was no change to its status.  The director of the HSE, the inquiry and HIQA are saying that the funding was never provided to match the grade the Government gave the hospital.  In other words, the Government made a statement saying Portlaoise was at a certain level.  HIQA says that despite that statement to the joint committee, the money was never provided.  Does the Government feel any sense of responsibility?  Can the Taoiseach confirm or clarify if there was any intervention by the health committee or Ministers in terms of the statement that was made to the joint committee?  Was this a political announcement and statement but the money was never provided subsequently to match the grading?</p></speech>

We have a similar case with the psychiatric nurse suspended on foot of going to the media about the situation in Cork.  My question is more general as to whether the Taoiseach is responsive and whether it is the policy of the Government to be responsive when health professionals blow the whistle about patient safety issues or are they to be censored and silenced?  Is the Taoiseach cognisant of that?</p>  <p>  I asked about the longer waiting lists and more people waiting for over a year for out-patient services.  A number of areas were specifically highlighted as being particularly bad.  There was an acknowledgement by the Minister that the hospital group, including St. Columcille's in Loughlinstown and St. Vincent's, had an issue.  The Minister has said this resulted from reconfiguration which was supposed to improve the situation.  Some of us warned it would worsen it.  The Minister further said the problems which had arisen could not be dealt with without additional resources.  If that is what the Minister is saying, will the additional resources be provided?  Will there be upgrades of Loughlinstown or St. Michael's as necessary to deal with problems that have emerged from a botched reconfiguration?</p></speech>

That is partly due to the collapse of the construction industry a number of years ago because of the economic situation.  The new unit I have referred to at Moorehall is now open and there is a number of planning applications in for further developments.  I might add that the home help and home care package budget has not been cut.  That is an issue of importance.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams mentioned trolleys.  Yesterday, Monday, 25 May at 8 a.m., there were 292 patients waiting on trolleys.  At 8 p.m. that was down to 175.  Today at 8 a.m., there were 259 patients waiting on trolleys and at 2 p.m. there were 243.</p></speech>

As of 19 May, there were 668 delayed discharges nationally of whom 381 were in the Dublin academic teaching hospitals.  That compares to a high of 830 in December last year.  I note that &euro;25 million was provided for support services to provide alternatives to relieve pressure on acute hospitals.  Of that &euro;25 million, &euro;10 million was used to provide an additional 300 places under the nursing home support scheme, reducing the waiting time from a period of 17 weeks.  Some &euro;8 million was allocated to provide access to an additional 115 short stay beds in the Dublin area and &euro;5 million was used to provide 400 additional home care packages which will benefit 600 people.  A further &euro;2 million was used to expand the community intervention team services in primary care across Dublin and the surrounding regions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin referred to moneys for Portlaoise.  The budget there is approximately &euro;50 million for this year which is similar to other hospitals which were formerly called model 3 hospitals.</p></speech>

I make the point again that this is not just about funding or a lack thereof: it is also about management, professionalism and competence in doing a job effectively in the interests of the patient.  If one looks at Wexford, Portiuncula or Clonmel, there are similar sized hospitals to Portlaoise.  It is not just a matter for financial resources, it is a case of management responsibility working with the resources they have to provide an effective, patient-centred solution.</p>  <p>  I went through the beds being identified as open in other places and gave Deputy Adams the trolley count.  I do not have the details of the reconfiguration to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred but if he puts down a Topical Issue or raises the matter by way of a question to the Minister directly, he will get the detail of that.</p></speech>

The number of children being taught through the medium of Irish is declining.  The previous Irish language commissioner, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, criticised the Government strongly over this and resigned in protest.  In January, his successor R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill made practical recommendations to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht published its report on the general scheme of the official languages (amendment) Bill.  I do not have time to deal with this in detail, but the joint committee put forward a range of recommendations that would enable the language to remain as a living vibrant language if it was fostered and nurtured by the State and its institutions.  It has been in the public arena for some time that the heads of the Bill will not reflect the recommendations of the joint committee.</p><p>It is ridiculous that the Government is not keeping to its strategy and commitments.  The commissioner also reported the Department of Education and Skills to the Houses of the Oireachtas because it has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Education Act 1998.  Other bodies that were in breach in respect of the use of Irish included the Railway Procurement Agency, Dublin Bus and the HSE.  </p> <p> Does the Taoiseach accept that the report by the Comisin&eacute;ir Teanga is evidence that the State is not doing enough to protect and encourage the Irish language and go bhfuil s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir nach bhfuil ag &eacute;ir&iacute; leis an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.

Papers were published, there were detailed documents and visits to Holland and the country was led to believe for a full year that this was the Holy Grail of health solutions and health policies.  I was astonished earlier to hear the Taoiseach say that the Dutch model was not going to be implemented and that there would now be a different model and system.  It is an extraordinary and breathtaking breach of a promise the Taoiseach made to the people.  It transcends even Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn's promise about third level fees.  The former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said that is what tends to happen during election campaigns but I find this extraordinary.  This is one of the Government's pillar policies.  A white paper on UHI was published last year.  The Taoiseach said that there would be a statement on what the cost of compulsory insurance will be.  We are still waiting for the publication of the costings.  When can we expect the publication of the costings which have been promised previously during Leaders' Questions?  Will the Taoiseach be upfront with the people about the cost of this policy and what they will end up having to pay?</p>  <p>  I am aware that the general scheme of the marriage Bill 2015 was published last March.  Following the success of the marriage referendum, will the Taoiseach confirm when the Bill to allow same sex marriages to take place will be scheduled before the House?  Will he confirm when the administrative details to allow marriages between gay couples to take places will be finalised?</p></speech>

Universal health insurance is the objective of the Government but the original target is delayed.</p></speech>
