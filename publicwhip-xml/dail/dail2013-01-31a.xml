    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100003#A00200"><p>Yesterday a Redemptorist priest, Fr. Michael Cusack, had some things to say about the Government's policy on rural policing.  He "urged fresh thinking on policing resources so that people in rural communities do not sleep in their beds in fear, and evil does not triumph over virtue."  He went on to describe how, after a garda had been removed from his local parish in County Galway, a particularly horrific crime occurred.  Is the Minister aware that Fr. Cusack is merely reflecting concerns expressed by the Opposition for many months and, more important, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, elected members of political parties, not least the main Government party, independent commentators who have written on and spoken about the subject, Muintir na T&iacute;re, the IFA, rural communities, community leaders and every group which represents anyone in rural Ireland?  Is the Minister further aware that there are more reports today of a businessman in County Galway who has been robbed four times in the past six months and a woman in County Kildare who has been robbed twice in recent months by people who travelled from the city by bus to commit the robberies?  Is the Government going to ignore and dismiss all the concerns of communities throughout the country by proceeding to allow 95 rural Garda stations to close as and from today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100003#A00300"><p>I listened carefully to what Fr. Cusack had to say yesterday in the Redemptorist Church in Dundalk.  He spoke very movingly about the trauma experienced by anyone, whether they lived in a rural area or a city centre, who had ever been subjected to a robbery or an invasion of his or her home space, particularly robbery with violence.  Fr. Cusack spoke movingly about that experience.  In the latter part of his comments Deputy Willie O'Dea addressed what was happening in terms of the changes in crime patterns because of the development of the road network.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100003#A00400"><p>I did not ask that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100003#A00500"><p>The Deputy brought it up.  Everyone on all sides of the House is aware that it is possible for individuals or groups involved in crime to move rapidly from one part of the country to another.  For this reason, the Garda has undertaken a special operation to target those involved in such crimes which, I suggest to the Deputy, not only affect the rural areas about which he speaks but all suburban areas in towns and cities also.  This is one of the changes in how criminals operate.  I note the significant success of the Garda operation, Operation Fiacla, as a consequence of which between April and December 2012 a total of 3,538 people were arrested and 1,925 people were charged.  As part of this debate there is a real issue in terms of how our police force operates.  Yesterday we saw at the funeral of Detective Garda Donohoe a magnificent and moving demonstration of how the community, the country and the State stand by garda&iacute; as garda&iacute; have stood by their country.  Operation Fiacla probably represents one of the best developments in Garda management and the fight against crime.  It shows, in terms of results and the number of arrests, the numbers being brought before the courts and the decline in the number of burglaries.</p></speech>

That is what modern, effective policing is about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100003#A00800"><p>I asked the Minister a simple direct question and she answered everything but the question I asked.  She quoted various data.  The number of burglaries is up by 10%, but I suppose if one tortures data sufficiently, one can get them to confess to anything.  That is the bottom line.  I am amazed to hear the development of the road network is now responsible for much rural crime.  I am putting a direct question to the Minister.  Does she consider a society in which people, old people in particular and persons living in isolated rural areas, go to bed at night in fear represents the vision for change the people voted for only two years ago?  As I want to be clear, I am asking the Minister a direct question.  Will she confirm to the House and, through it, the country that in spite of all the anxiety, fear, terror and protests from thousands of people who have turned out to protest at the closures throughout the country, the Government's answer is, "No change; we are going to proceed regardless"?  A simple "Yes" or "No" would suffice.</p></speech>

People use vans and other forms of transport.  The response of the Garda, in particular Garda management, has been to develop targeted policing methods to actually deal with the problem.</p><p>Deputy Willie O'Dea may scoff but the fact is that anybody, whether living in an urban or rural area, will suffer if his or her home is invaded by someone bent on robbery.  That is what Fr. Michael Cusack was talking about yesterday.  I was in the church listening extremely carefully.  He referred to the enormous trauma suffered by victims of robbery.  He told the stories of two victims of violent robbery in particular.</p></speech>

These are the very communities which have already suffered under the cuts regime of this and the previous Government.  We have seen in recent weeks and months a spate of burglaries targeting vulnerable and elderly people.  For many communities, the local Garda station provides peace of mind and allows people to sleep soundly in their beds.  The Government has decided, however, to continue with the implementation of Fianna F&aacute;il's so-called national recovery plan from 2010 by making further Garda cuts.</p></speech>

The Minister knows this because she represents an urban constituency not a million miles away from my own.  She knows that the most common and sometimes the only complaint citizens have regarding the garda&iacute; is the lengthy response time.  They call the Garda but they are not in a position to respond promptly.  It is the biggest frustration one comes across.  That is in an urban setting.  Let us transport ourselves to rural Ireland where we know there has been a spate of very high-profile and vicious attacks, particularly on elderly people.  People living in remote areas are quite correctly ill at ease because they do not believe the service they require will get to them quickly enough to keep them safe.</p><p>  Will the Minister at least acknowledge that the closure of almost 100 stations is a matter of grave public concern.  Could she go beyond the generalised rhetoric she has offered and be far more specific about what the compensatory measures for those communities will be.  Will there be additional garda&iacute;?  I support civilianisation as I believe it is the right thing to do.  Will that be accelerated?  How many garda&iacute; will be freed up?  Will the people in rural Ireland who are losing their stations at least know that there will be a Garda on the beat?</p></speech>

I will return to the issue of the North because comparative policing and its success in different countries and regions both in the EU and in different parts of this island is an important factor in this debate.  What is important in modern policing is that garda&iacute; are involved in front-line duties.  The PSNI inherited 140 stations but by 2015, just 49 stations will remain.  This is in the context of Deputy McDonald's party being in government in the North.  The Deputy should ask herself why her colleagues in the North agree to have a 40% reduction in the number of police stations.  I assume they did so in order to allow for more effective use of policing resources by putting PSNI members out on the front line.</p></speech>

All the wisdom relating to modern policing both in the US and Europe is that it is critical to get police officers out on the front line and Operation Fiacla is a very good example of that.  Where it has been operating around the country, it is taking into account changes in crime patterns brought about by additional mobility due in many cases to the upgrade in the roads network.  That is something with which we must deal.  The Garda Commissioner and management are working on a programme and plan to make for more efficient policing for the 21st century.  That seems to be what Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting the PSNI to do in the North but it always seems to have a two-faced response in respect of this - one that looks North and the other that looks South.  I am asking Deputy McDonald to compare and contrast what happens in both areas.</p></speech>

Last year, there was an outcry from families of children with special needs about the dramatic increase in the refusal of the domiciliary care allowance, a consequent alarming increase in the number of appeals and the waiting times for those appeals, which often went up to a year.  In a parliamentary question I put to the Minister last week to which I received an answer, the same shocking pattern revealed itself when it came to applications for invalidity pensions.  In 2009, 39% of applications were refused.  In 2011 when the Government took office, the figure jumped to 69% while the figure in 2012 was 64%.  As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of appeals so that in 2012, there was a 700% increase in the number of appeals through which people had to go as opposed to 2009.  That has led to the appeals office being completely overrun and unable to cope.  Only one quarter of the 4,356 appeals lodged in 2012 were decided.  This means that thousands of people with chronic illnesses and injuries have to wait up to and over a year to have their appeals heard for invalidity pension.  There is widespread anecdotal evidence of similar patterns when it comes to applications for carer's allowance and disability allowance.</p><p>  Why are the Minister's Department and medical assessors second-guessing consultants and GPs who are testifying to the fact that people are physically or mentally unable to work?  Is she deliberately denying some of the most vulnerable people - ill people with chronic illnesses - their just entitlements?  Where does this leave her constant protestations that she will defend the vulnerable, including people with special needs, when there is clear evidence of a systematic pattern on the part of her Government of denying vulnerable people their rightful entitlements and forcing them into situations of anxiety, desperation and suffering as a result of cuts she is imposing but which she dresses up as reform?  </p></speech>

To begin with his first point about domiciliary care allowance, I answered a question about this a few days' ago, as the Deputy noted.  I am happy to repeat to the House that the waiting period for domiciliary care allowance - the Deputy has the statistics in the answer to his question - has been reduced to six weeks following the reforms of the IT platform.  That is a very significant development and I compliment the staff of the Department of Social Protection working in the context of significant changes introduced in the Department as a consequence of the Croke Park agreement.  They have reformed the IT system.  In the context of more applications for domiciliary care allowance and a change to what is called a new IT structure, the waiting period has been reduced to six weeks and the backlog has largely been addressed.  I am delighted to tell the Deputy that current applications for domiciliary care allowance should now take about six weeks.</p><p>  I previously explained to the Deputy that while the volumes, funding and the numbers being awarded domiciliary care allowance are increasing, certain applications are not complete when presented.  Deputies know this in respect of different cases.  The Deputy referred to people's medical experts.  It is for people's family doctors and consultants if they are involved to make a case in clear medical terms and in line with the legislation as to why somebody qualifies for the allowance so that the medical assessors, who are medically qualified people working in my Department, can take account of the advice and opinion of the person's own medical advisers.  </p><p>If the information is not forthcoming at the time of application, we allow fresh evidence to be submitted and if that is not satisfactory, people have a right of appeal.  The improvements in information technology brought about by the staff in my Department have resulted in a six week waiting time.  The backlog of family income supplement applications has been almost totally eliminated.  We have made major improvements and, in a time of unprecedented economic difficulty, protected core rates of weekly social welfare payments and are providing additional funding under all of these headings.</p><p> Another factor affecting the number of applications is that in 2010 the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government reduced the payment period of illness benefit from an indefinite period to two years.  Deputies who deal with these cases will be aware that a consequence of this decision was an increase in the number of people coming forward because their two year period had expired and they were seeking to migrate to another payment.  They also had a right, by and large, to return to jobseeker's allowance.</p></speech>

I give most credit to the families who came out on the streets last year and embarrassed the Government into acknowledging the disgraceful mistreatment of families with special needs.  They forced the Minister to address the problem, but it is now being moved to another area.  She has completely failed to address the fact that since the Government took office the number of refusals of invalidity pension has dramatically increased by 64%, from 39% in 2011 to 69% in 2012.  Two thirds of applicants may be receiving an answer within a few weeks, but they are being refused.</p><p>  I will give an example of the people who are being refused.  In most cases, they had an entitlement to illness benefit.  In other words, the Department accepted that they were not fit for work and paid them illness benefit.  When people applied for invalidity pension after two years, they were denied it in two thirds of cases.  I know of one individual who had worked for 40 years as a bin man before developing rheumatoid arthritis and problems with his heart, knee and back.  He was denied, despite being completely unable to work.  I can provide a litany of similar examples of individuals who are made to suffer for months as they beg and appeal for their entitlements.</p><p>  Is there not a systematic policy of first stop refusal if the Department can find any excuse whatsoever, even when medical assistance has been provided by GPs and consultants?  When people appeal, they often have to pay &euro;200 for a consultant's letter stating the Department should not have refused them in the first place.  That is another cost for those who are ill and vulnerable.  It is disgraceful.  Stop treating people in this bureaucratic way and give them their entitlements.</p></speech>

That system was changed in 2010.  This has resulted in a large increase in the numbers applying for payments under other medical related schemes.  I am delighted Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has conceded that the civil servants in the Department have worked hard to improve the system.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware of the importance to the economy of our reputation as an excellent food producer.

In the context of the recent beefburger controversy, that would enhance our reputation as a producer of excellent food.</p><p>  The judicial council Bill is promised in the legislative programme.

The fact that these discoveries were made in Ireland is testament to how rigorous and scientific our examination is of food.  The reputation of Irish food is of tremendous importance and value to the country and the farmers who produce it.  This is part of the reason Ireland has such a strong international reputation.  With regard to the recent controversy, there are strong indications that all of the companies which have changed suppliers have indicated they will consider sourcing meat and products from other Irish suppliers.  This is testament to the strength of scientific food research in Ireland.</p></speech>

They also set out the figures with regard to disability benefit.  I will supply that information to the Deputy.  I am happy to say the new IT structures, although it is taking time to put them in place, are capable of dealing with the increased volume of applications under all scheme headings.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to see waiting times reduced and have complimented staff in the Department on reducing domiciliary care allowance application times to approximately six weeks and family income supplement application times to a similar timespan.</p></speech>

The Government is talking about job creation.  However, the only job creation I see is the expansion of receivership companies.  During the week money was paid to KPMG and other lucrative receivership businesses for advice.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 is being used as a cloak.  Neighbours of the Chief Whip in County Wexford are being terrorised by security companies which are on private property, even though they have no business being there.  They are acting on behalf of Mr. Kieran Wallace.</p></speech>

N&iacute; dh&eacute;anann siad athbhreithni&uacute; mar at&aacute; d&eacute;anta anseo le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.</p><p><br /> Luaigh m&eacute; an <i>Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise</i>n&iacute;os luaithe.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l riarach&aacute;in acu i dtaobh na Fraincise.  D&eacute;anann siad cinnte de go bhfuil na caighde&aacute;in gramada&iacute; agus focl&oacute;ireachta i gceart, go bhfuil an teanga ag athr&uacute; de r&eacute;ir an nua-aois agus go bhfuil an Fraincis suas chun d&aacute;ta.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, d&eacute;anann an <i>Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise</i>iarracht an Fraincis a chosaint &oacute;n mB&eacute;arlachas, at&aacute; ag sleamhn&uacute; isteach in a l&aacute;n teangacha timpeall an domhain.  T&aacute; s&eacute; le tabhairt faoi deara sa Ghaeilge go f&oacute;ill.  Buna&iacute;odh an <i>Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise</i>sa bhliain 1635.  D&eacute;anann s&eacute; &quot;caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il&quot; na Fraincise a leagan amach i bhfoirm focl&oacute;ir.  Foils&iacute;odh an ch&eacute;ad eagr&aacute;n d'fhocl&oacute;ir an <i>Acad&eacute;mie</i>sa bhliain 1694 agus an eagr&aacute;n is d&eacute;ana&iacute; sa bhliain 1935.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag obair ar eagr&aacute;n nua faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; imleabhar curtha amach aige go dt&iacute; seo - &oacute;n litir A go dt&iacute; an litir E sa bhliain 1992 agus &oacute;n litir E go dt&iacute; an litir M sa bhliain 2000.  N&iacute;l focl&oacute;ir ioml&aacute;n an lae inniu aige.  Nuair at&aacute; s&eacute; sin cr&iacute;ochnaithe aige, is l&eacute;ir nach mbeidh s&eacute; ag eisi&uacute;nt focl&oacute;ir eile seacht mbliana ina dhiadh.  T&aacute; breis is 20 bliain caite aige ag teacht chomh fada leis an litir M.  T&aacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r agam leis an cur chuige at&aacute; molta sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  D'fh&eacute;ach m&eacute; freisin ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acu sa Ghearm&aacute;in.  In ainneoin go bhfuil fadhbanna acu i dtaobh caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il na Gearm&aacute;inise, n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; in ann teacht ar aon s&oacute;rt athbhreithni&uacute; a tharla&iacute;onn gach seacht mbliana.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna f&iacute;or maidir leis an Iod&aacute;ilis.  N&iacute;l a fhios ag muintir na hIod&aacute;ile cad go d&iacute;reach is caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il ann.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; caighde&aacute;n teangan amh&aacute;in i roinnt t&iacute;ortha.  Den chuid is m&oacute;, is ionann an caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il agus an teanga reachta&iacute;ochta.</p><p><br /> T&aacute; gach &eacute;inne anseo tar &eacute;is admh&aacute;il nach bhfuil Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in in ann an bundualgas at&aacute; aici faoi l&aacute;thair - reachta&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge - a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Anois t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag iarraidh cur ina lu&iacute; ar an rann&oacute;g freagracht eile a ghlacadh anuas ar sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag caint faoi ionstraim&iacute; reacht&uacute;la agus a leith&eacute;id de reachta&iacute;ocht th&aacute;naisteach a chur amach ar chonradh ionas go mbeidh said aistrithe lasmuigh.  Mar a sheasann c&uacute;rsa&iacute; anois, n&iacute;l s&eacute; ar chumas Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in iad ar fad a aistri&uacute;.  C&eacute; nach bhfuil an rann&oacute;g in ann an bundualgas at&aacute; aici a chomhl&iacute;onadh, t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag iarraidh go mbeidh s&eacute; mar dhualgas aici athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh gach seacht mbliana.  T&oacute;gann s&eacute; cuid mhaith ama jab mar sin a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; le d&eacute;anamh i gceart, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh tr&eacute;imhse m&oacute;r comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in gafa leis.  Ba cheart go mbeadh na heagrais at&aacute; luaite i leas&uacute; a phl&eacute;fimid ar ball gafa leis chomh maith.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir aon athbhreithni&uacute; ceart a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gCaighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il i dtr&eacute;imhse gairid.  T&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; breis is bliain, b'fh&eacute;idir.  An bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it go gcaillfidh Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in bliain ioml&aacute;n gach seacht mbliana agus an obair seo ar bun aici?  De r&eacute;ir na reachta&iacute;ochta, beidh s&eacute; de dhualgas ar an rann&oacute;g d&eacute;ile&aacute;il go huile is go hioml&aacute;n leis an athbhreithni&uacute;.  Beidh uirthi d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar gach uile ghn&eacute; de ghramadach na teanga, fi&uacute; muna n-athra&iacute;tear na rialacha sa deireadh thiar thall.  B'fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;arfaidh s&iacute; tar &eacute;is an athbhreithni&uacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; foirfe.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil seacht mbliana r&oacute;-ghairid mar thr&eacute;imhse.</p><p><br /> N&iacute;l m&eacute; buartha faoi Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.  Sa deireadh thiar, is f&eacute;idir l&eacute;i breis oifigigh a earc&uacute;.  T&aacute; m&eacute; buartha faoin tionchar a bheidh ag an bhfor&aacute;il seo ar scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ollscoile, m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; scoile, foilsitheoir&iacute;, iriseoir&iacute;, abhc&oacute;id&iacute; dl&iacute;, srl.  Is cuma sa sioc le ghn&aacute;thphobal na Gaeilge faoin gcaighd&eacute;an, ar go leor beala&iacute;, mar labhr&oacute;idh siad an Ghaeilge de r&eacute;ir an chan&uacute;int n&oacute; an chleachtas at&aacute; acu.  Is mar sin at&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; i ngach t&iacute;r.  Maireann an caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il taobh le taobh le can&uacute;int&iacute;, ar n&oacute;s can&uacute;int Th&iacute;r Chonaill sa t&iacute;r seo.  Caithfear iad a cheangailt le ch&eacute;ile chomh maith agus is f&eacute;idir.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir bunathruithe &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar rialacha gramada&iacute; r&oacute;-rialta, &aacute;fach.  Os rud &eacute; go gcaithfidh daoine dul i dtaith&iacute; leis na rialacha &eacute;ags&uacute;la, ba cheart go mbeid&iacute;s chomh seasmhach agus is f&eacute;idir.  M&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn athbhreithni&uacute; chomh minic agus at&aacute; luaite sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo, t&aacute; dains&eacute;ar ann nach mbeidh comhsheasmhacht i gceist.  M&aacute; t&aacute; dabht ann, beidh s&eacute; deacair an teanga a mh&uacute;ineadh i gceart.  B&iacute;onn an Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh sna scoileanna.  T&aacute; seans go nd&eacute;anfaidh daoine bot&uacute;in ina gcuid scr&uacute;daithe, m&aacute; thosaigh siad ag foghlaim na Gaeilge faoi chaighde&aacute;n amh&aacute;in ach th&aacute;inig caighde&aacute;n eile i bhfeidhm nuair a bh&iacute;odar f&oacute;s ar scoil.  Tosna&iacute;tear sa bhunscoil ag ceithre bliana d'aois agus caitear 14 bliana sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais.  D&aacute; mbeadh tr&iacute; chaighde&aacute;in i gceist sa tr&eacute;imhse sin, bheadh s&eacute; an-deacair ar an scol&aacute;ire agus ar an m&uacute;inteoir.  M&aacute; leanaimid ar aghaidh leis an bplean seo, b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh orainn c&uacute;rsa nua Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do ghach mh&uacute;inteoir.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur g&aacute; &eacute; sin a eagr&uacute; p&eacute; sc&eacute;al &eacute;.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh gramadach nua le foghlaim n&oacute; le m&uacute;ineadh tar &eacute;is gach athbhreithni&uacute;.</p><p><br /> Measaim go bhfuil moladh praitici&uacute;il &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agam sa leas&uacute; seo.  Ba cheart go sheasfadh an Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il ar feadh tr&eacute;imhse de 20 bliain, ar a laghad, sula mbeadh aon athbhreithni&uacute; i gceist.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh an tr&eacute;imshe &uacute;d bheith 30 bliain, n&oacute; 40 bliain.  Molaim n&aacute;r cheart athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go dt&iacute; go bhfuil 20 bliain imithe.  M&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute;onn ceisteanna gramada&iacute; idir an d&aacute; linn, ba cheart d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo de r&eacute;ir mar a mhol m&eacute; sa leas&uacute; roimhe seo.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh an rann&oacute;g soil&eacute;iri&uacute; de l&iacute;ne n&oacute; dh&oacute; a eisi&uacute;nt &oacute; am go ch&eacute;ile, agus iad go l&eacute;ir a tharraingt le ch&eacute;ile nuair at&aacute; athbhreithni&uacute; ioml&aacute;n &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh tar &eacute;is 20 bliain n&oacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute;.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; Gaeilge caighde&aacute;nach ann &oacute; thuaisceart na hAlban go deisceart na h&Eacute;ireann suas go dt&iacute; Cath Chionn tS&aacute;ile sa s&eacute;&uacute; aois d&eacute;ag.  Mar sin, bh&iacute; muid ar aghaidh go m&oacute;r mar Ghaeil &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; caighde&aacute;in de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n eolas ar na can&uacute;int&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann ag an am sin mar bh&iacute; an scr&iacute;obhneoireacht ar fad de&aacute;nta de r&eacute;ir caighde&aacute;in.  Ba cheart go dtuigfeadh an tAire St&aacute;it &eacute; sin.  Mar is eol d&oacute;, bh&iacute; na rialacha leagtha s&iacute;os ag na daoine a bh&iacute; an dualgas sin orthu.  Maidir leis an gcaighde&aacute;n nua, c&eacute;n f&aacute;th an bhfuil "f&eacute;adfaidh" seachas "d&eacute;anfaidh" sa bhfor&aacute;il maidir le coiste a bhun&uacute;?  Beidh an doras oscailte don rann&oacute;g breathn&uacute; ar an gcaighde&aacute;n, uisce coisricthe a chaitheamh air agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; thar cinn.  Nuair at&aacute; an t-athbhreithni&uacute; d&eacute;anta sa chaoi sin, n&iacute; bheidh ar an rann&oacute;g dul i gcomhairle le &eacute;inne n&oacute; aon choiste a bhun&uacute; - beidh athbhreithni&uacute; d&eacute;anta ar an gcaighde&aacute;n.  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, n&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; aon difr&iacute;ocht an seacht mbliana, tr&iacute; bliana n&oacute; 20 bliain a bheidh i gceist, mar go mbeidh s&eacute; go hioml&aacute;n faoi Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in a r&aacute; an nd&eacute;anfaidh siad f&iacute;or-athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gcaighde&aacute;n tr&iacute; choiste a bhun&uacute;, dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal agus cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an gc&oacute;ras ioml&aacute;n a chur i bhfeidhm.  D&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&iacute;or-athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gcaighde&aacute;n ar an mbealach ceart at&aacute; leagtha amach - tr&iacute; coiste a bhun&uacute; agus tr&iacute; dul i gcomhairle le gach c&eacute;im den phr&oacute;iseas - chuirfinn comhairle air gan &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh gach seacht mbliana mar bheadh an t-uaf&aacute;s oibre ag baint leis.  Bheadh s&eacute; ag baint foirne &oacute;n mbunobair at&aacute; ar bun ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in; s&eacute; sin, aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is cuid den cur i gc&eacute;ill &eacute; seo - t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it s&aacute;sta ligean leis go mbeidh athbhreithni&uacute; ar bun, ach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re t&aacute; s&eacute; ag baint strucht&uacute;r ar bith don athbhreithni&uacute; tr&iacute;d an focal "f&eacute;adfaidh" a choinne&aacute;il sa reachta&iacute;ocht seachas an focal "d&eacute;anfaidh".

N&iacute; fheicim go mbeidh an oiread sin athruithe, ach b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh.

D'iarr m&eacute; ar an Aire St&aacute;it sampla&iacute; den dea-chleachtas i dt&iacute;ortha eile ar a bhfuil s&eacute; seo bunaithe a thabhairt dom.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tar &eacute;is a admh&aacute;il nach bhfuil a leith&eacute;id ann.  Ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste, n&iacute;or tugadh sonra&iacute; d&uacute;inn i dtaobh treoir na dteangeolaithe a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn go bhfuil s&eacute; go maith do teanga go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; athbhreithni&uacute; bun&uacute;sach, seachas an sracfh&eacute;achaint at&aacute; luaite ag an Aire St&aacute;it, ar rialacha gramada&iacute; chuile seacht mbliana.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm m&aacute; t&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint faoin bhFraincis i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Is teanga difri&uacute;l &iacute; an Fraincis ar go leor slite.

Is fadhb m&oacute;r &eacute; sin d&uacute;inn at&aacute; ag labhairt na Gaeilge go f&oacute;ill agus d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a labhr&oacute;idh an teanga amach anseo.  Ba cheart go mbeadh bunchoincheapa agus bungramadach na Gaeilge soil&eacute;ir.  N&iacute;l gramadach maith agam in aon teanga.  N&iacute; duine m&oacute;r rialacha gramada&iacute; m&eacute;.

Is &eacute; sin an bunphrionsabal at&aacute; ag an <i>acad&eacute;mie</i>.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; leagtha s&iacute;os sa Fhrainc go bhfuil ar an <i>acad&eacute;mie</i> &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh gach seacht mbliana.

Nuair at&aacute; athbhreithni&uacute; ar si&uacute;l, d&eacute;antar scr&uacute;d&uacute; den ts&oacute;rt sin ar gach gn&eacute; de ghramadach na Gaeilge.  Sa ch&aacute;s seo, bheadh s&eacute; i gceist dul tr&iacute;d an leabhar &oacute; bun go barr agus, m&aacute; t&aacute; fadhb ann, f&eacute;achaint an bhfuil beala&iacute; le leigheas a chur ar an sc&eacute;al.  Go minic, n&iacute; leigheas at&aacute; i gceist seachas st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il a thabhairt do ruda&iacute; at&aacute; anois mar ph&aacute;irt de ghn&aacute;thchleachtas na teangan.

Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th nach bhfuil m&eacute; ag r&aacute; n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gcaighde&aacute;n riamh.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeimid in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh go rialta.  Is d&oacute;igh liom agus leis an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v go bhfuil c&uacute;pla bealach ar f&eacute;idir &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh.

There was no need to make any promises before the last election but he made so many that he has been in a tailspin ever since trying not to fulfil them.</p><p>  We know the way the governance in the HSE was set up.  There are nothing but problems in it.  It is top-heavy with administration.  There are many good people trying to work on the front line and in administration, but there is a lot of dead weight, inertia, unhappiness and unease.  If anyone knew the HSE inside out it was the Minister because of his profession and his skills in negotiating with it in the past on behalf of his profession.</p><p>  This short Bill is a cop-out.  There is no intention to tackle the HSE or disband it.  With righteous indignation the Minister and many others in opposition were tabling parliamentary questions and getting back replies from the HSE that the matter was not one for the Minister.  That is a cop-out and an abdication of powers.  That is probably the reason the HSE was set up, but the Minister promised to banish all of that.  He said he would deal with it, cut out the dead weight, get answers and be accountable, but what happened?  We know the way he handled the board and what happened with the chief executive officer.  Last week we found out, thanks to an RTE freedom of information request, how projects in my region, the south east, were fast-tracked at the expense of others because, as the Minister proclaims, the money follows the patient, but the money here is following the Ministers.  They were trying to save their seats by ensuring that money was spent in their constituencies, and the CEO of the HSE, Cathal Magee, and Brian Gilroy, who was always a very good public servant, did not know anything about it.  They heard this had been done before the board even met.  What we are doing in this Bill is tinkering with the system, but it will not make any tangible difference.</p><p>  The Bill is intended to provide for a transitional measure, but that is the problem.  There has been too much transition and not enough action in the HSE since 2004.  The former health boards were accountable.  I would love to know who drafted the Bill because it is couched in language that will continue to confuse.  We will continue to have inertia and a lack of accountability in the HSE, and it will continue to be a monstrosity that is not serving the well-being of the people.</p><p>  Accountability is referred to in the Bill, as are new posts.  Separate from the Bill, but in support of the new directorate and administrative structure, the HSE has already initiated the process of putting in place the new HSE directorate management and leadership team.  &quot;Management team&quot; and &quot;leadership team&quot; have become buzzwords, certainly in the past ten years, and these people are leading like sheep out of a gap.  There is no vision or proper thinking on their part.  We have reports from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  As I said last night, I was very disappointed with my local hospital, which was criticised because of the levels of dirt.  There is no excuse for this.  They can have all the leadership and management teams they want - bed managers, ward managers and floor managers, which they never had in the past - but there is no excuse for dirt in a hospital.  When matrons were in charge of our hospitals, that did not happen.  I am glad HIQA found that problem because it is not fair to patients or the public.</p><p>  There is another issue in the hospital with patients on trolleys, the pressure of intake on the wards and the pressure the staff work under day in, day out.  Front-line nursing staff, junior doctors and consultants are treating patients on beds in corridors.  They  should not be expected to work in those conditions.  The European working time directive is being flouted in this case, yet in other areas EU directives are being implemented to the letter of the law.  The staff in South Tipperary General Hospital are under too much pressure.  They cannot cope with beds in corridors.  They do a tremendous job for which they are constantly praised, but I blame that part of the HIQA report on a lack of resources, funding and support from the HSE nationally and regionally.</p><p>  What happened last week undermined the basis of what we are doing in the south east region - that is, working towards a centre of excellence in Waterford Regional Hospital.  The Minister of State has one in his region, and there are eight in the country.  Many of us bought into that process reluctantly, but we sat down with the consultants, the nursing staff, the domestic staff, all the clinicians and the senior officials in Health Service Executive South, with whom I have had major issues and many of whom I distrust.  I hate saying that, but they will tell one something in a meeting only for one to find out later that something different was done a week beforehand.  That is the kind of spin that is going on.  We bought into that project only to have a bombshell dropped before Christmas when Kilkenny tried to align itself with Dublin.  That would undermine the basis for our centre of excellence in Waterford Regional Hospital, because we would not have the numbers.</p><p>  The Taoiseach, in reply to my questions the other day, stated that conditions in St. Luke's General Hospital, with portakabins and so on, were appalling and that people were practically working in tin huts.  That is not true.  Issues arise in every hospital where portakabins and prefabs are used, but to demonise the situation in Kilkenny and Wexford - I have never been in Wexford General Hospital - is wrong.  It is simple spin because the Minister was caught napping.  He was caught engaging in cronyism of the worst kind, when we are dealing with people's lives.  I will say no more on that, but we are awaiting a report from Professor Higgins, whom I was accused recently of maligning.  I did no such thing.  I merely stated that he is working out of Cork and, naturally, the more throughput he can get for that area, the better.  I am sure he will do an independent report but the games being played and the brinkmanship being engaged in by the HSE are wrong.  We have too many layers of management and, sadly, many of them have nothing to do but make work for pen-pushers and everyone else.  We do not have the front-line staff where we need them, and this Bill will not change this.</p><p>  I refer to the new posts.  The five new national directors will be responsible at national level for the delivery of services in each service domain - that is, hospitals, primary care, mental health, social care, and health and well-being.  It should be all about health and well-being; we can forget about the first four.  They know what they have to do.  We must get value for money from the hospitals and faster throughput.  If the consultants want to use the public hospitals for their private practices they should be charged for that.  When I was only a ladeen I recall Barry Desmond saying he could not understand why the consultants - and many of them were eminent people - should be allowed use public hospitals and charge enormous rates while veterinarians set up their own practices, bought their own equipment and so on.  That is farcical, and the Minister is one of the people who subsequently negotiated some of those packages.  It was from that time that the rot set in.  Public hospitals should be for public patients, and if the consultants want to operate in private hospitals, let them do so, and they should give value for money.</p><p>  The cost of health insurance is a rip-off.  This morning we heard that VHI intends to increase premiums by 6% on top of what it got earlier.  People cannot keep paying those premiums, and that will put more pressure on public hospitals.  The charges VHI applies are immoral.  I refer to ambulance services alone.  I had need of one 20 years ago when I travelled the same distance as from here to Grafton Street.  I could have walked it but I did not; I needed an ambulance, for which I was charged &pound;500.  It was daylight robbery.  A case was recounted to me last week in which an ambulance that arrived to take a patient from Clonmel to Waterford came from Sligo.  What is going on?  That is mismanagement and bungling, because it is an eight-hour journey from Clonmel to Sligo, and that ambulance may have been needed elsewhere.</p><p>  We are told that all of the new positions will be above board because the Public Appointments Commission will choose the candidates.  I will tell the Minister about the Public Appointments Commission.  He might be aware that in the previous Government the then Minister, John Gormley, in his wisdom, set up the Inland Fisheries Board and decided that the commission would choose the candidates.  There was an advertisement process and I was chair of the interview board.  We arrived into the Public Appointments Commission to interview the candidates who had been short-listed.  I met a lady from the commission who told us the way the process would run for the day.  There were three Oireachtas Members on the board: the then Deputy Peter Kelly, the then Senator Noel Coonan and me.</p><p>She went on to inform us that she had short-listed the candidates because it would be too hard for us.  First, I wanted to have the interviews take place here on a sitting day, but they had to be held on a Monday at the Public Appointments Commission.  I got an insight into what went on at these interviews.  The number of former county managers and retired officials on the list was sickening.  Every one of the first 20 was either a retired chief superintendent, a retired chief medical officer or another official who already had a big pension.  I turned the list upside down and said we would start from the bottom up.  I was looking for the candidates involved in fisheries and there were many such eminent people.  We picked the three candidates and the lady involved in organising the interviews did not get her way, a point about which she was not too happy.</p><p> This is the charade that takes place across the country, which is why the country is the way it is.  It is being plundered by officialdom; there are jobs for the boys and there is cronyism.  I am not referring to political cronyism but inside cronyism, with no command over officials.  No Minister will take on the officials because Ministers are afraid of them.  I saw it happen with the late Brian Lenihan and see it going on in the Department of Finance.  The officials who got us into the mess are still there, except those who were promoted to position in the European Union.  They would not even see a hole in a wall and because they are so long in the system they are suffering from fatigue.  I have no faith in the Public Appointments Commission because of its shenanigans.  Those involved look after themselves and their friends in high places.</p><p> In the case I described the candidate list was filled with the names of this and that retired chief.  It was as if they did not have enough in their pensions and pay-outs, while ordinary people who had applied were kept off the list.  The same has happened in the case of the NewERA project in which people who applied for advertised positions did not even get a response.  They are waiting for the Minister to choose, but we have seen what happened with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Their own cronies will be chosen again.  If we do not break that system, we will not fix the country or sort out the mess that is the health system.</p><p> To whoever drafted this legislation, it is a pious and useless document.  It is only a stop-gap measure and just playing the game.  It is said it is a great game played slowly, but it is too late for that.  The Minister for Health promised change, but he has no intention of sorting out the health service.  This holding Bill to buy more time is a farce.</p></speech>

Like other Deputies, I questioned previous health Ministers on the management and delivery of health services in my constituency.  Of course, I got the usual reply that the Minister was not responsible but the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004.  That Act imposed structures on the HSE which have not worked, while allowing previous health Ministers to hide behind it.  There was no integration, no clarity, no direct accountability between the HSE and the Minister.  It important that the HSE is accountable to the Minister, as well as the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  The Bill is an interim measure.  In the long term the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, is proposing to abolish the HSE in favour of a new system of directorates headed by a director general.  This is a brave step by the Minister and will bring accountability and transparency to the sector.</p><p>  As part of the reform of the health service, the reconfiguration of acute hospitals in the mid-west region is under way.  The role of Ennis General Hospital has changed substantially.  We are fortunate that a good manager took over in 2010 and under his stewardship, with a dedicated and loyal staff, the hospital has been given a new lease of life.  Up to &euro;2.5 million has been invested in the endoscopy unit.  The hospital won first place in the national health care innovation awards for the provision of radiology services last year, boosting confidence in the hospital and eliminating X-ray waiting lists.  A new &euro;15 million state-of-the-art 50 bed wing has opened and it is the first health facility in the country that is SARI - strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland - compliant.  I look forward to the Minister officially opening the facility in the near future.  As the hospital manager has moved on, I hope the range of services he introduced will be maintained.  The framework for the development of smaller hospitals will be published shortly.  It will help to define the role of hospitals, including Ennis General Hospital, in the mid-west regional hospital group.  I understand it will focus on enhancing and growing services rather than downgrading them.  </p><p>  In the past the Opposition sought to question the role of the local emergency centre at Ennis General Hospital, which is glaring hypocrisy in view of the track record of the previous Government.  I remind the Opposition that the outgoing manager of the hospital said 90% of accident and emergency cases could still report to Ennis General Hospital, even when the new system was put in place.  Every patient wants and deserves the best treatment and he or she must have confidence that if he or she needs to access this service, it will be available.</p><p>  Since taking office the Minister has worked hard to improve patient outcomes.  He has set up the special delivery unit, made significant progress in reducing waiting times and set clear targets which the HSE has to meet.  This year the HSE service plan aims to have 95% of all attendees at accident and emergency departments discharged or admitted within six hours of registration.</p><p>  According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, there are 22 patients on trolleys at the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  As the number of attendees at accident and emergency departments fluctuates at this time of year owing to flu etc., the current delay at the hospital is causing upset for patients, their families, as well as the nursing and medical staff.  I hope the matter can be resolved as soon as possible.</p><p>  Ireland has the 36th highest suicide rate in the world.  Suicide prevention is an issue which the Government has prioritised.  Today new guidelines were issued for schools in an effort to stem the problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is committed to transforming mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and many positive steps will be taken to improve the quality of mental health care.  I concur with other Members that unused moneys allocated for health services should be diverted to plug the hole in mental health services.</p><p>  The Minister is driving reform which is necessary and will lead to better patient outcomes.  I compliment him on his work in this regard.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, did not have great clarity of purpose as to what she wanted the HSE to achieve.  The HSE ran into several problems in subsequent years which the then Minister was able to deal with by increasing the budget by &euro;1 billion a year.  However, she never dealt with the basic problems.</p><p>  As a general practitioner and having worked with people in the HSE, I know there is no lack of commitment and drive at every level.  This legislation will be the start of the changes we have proposed to make in the HSE.  However, I am under no illusion as to what could go wrong with this and that there will be people who will try to obstruct what we are trying to do in the health service.</p><p>This legislation adds to the picture by making the health services responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas again, which is important.</p><p> Another important aspect of the legislation is the statutory audit committee.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recently, we wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, with regard to ensuring that the way we in the Houses of the Oireachtas legislated for spending was realised.  All too often we make a reduction to a Vote or we direct that certain services should be reduced in health or education, but the directions are not carried out and cuts are made to some other service without the approval of the Minister or these Houses.  This ends up with the public believing we are heartless and uncaring because of the cuts made by the HSE.  There is a need for strengthening to an even greater extent what is planned under this legislation and the way in which the money the House has voted for is spent to ensure that if reductions are to be made in administrative sections of the HSE, then that is where the reductions will be made, rather than cuts to home help or carers.</p><p> The Minister has acknowledged that this is the first step in a range of changes that will take place within the HSE.  It is important that this debate is widened as much as possible because there is an absolute need for clarity with regard to what we do with the HSE.  Thus far, it is crystal clear that the HSE is an organisation for the delivery of health services.  If we are to change the overall mission statement of the HSE, it is important that we clearly outline what those changes will be.  At issue is the administration of &euro;15 billion which we spend on health services.</p><p> Often we hear from contributors who are keen to get a soundbite.  It is easy to demonise the HSE as a faceless organisation, but there are many aspects of the organisation that work well and many aspects that do not work well.  For the ordinary man or woman on the street the major issues include what will happen to small hospitals, hospital groups and primary care, how to integrate the HSE with the work of general practitioners, how to genuinely look after patients in the community, how to deal with chronic care and how to set up all the associated structures.  All of these questions are vital.  These are the tangible questions that patients in the community understand.  How to pull all of this together is relevant for the administration of the health service and how we deal with it in future.</p><p> It is not possible within ten minutes to go through everything, because we must untangle some of the remarkably inefficient reforms made during the history of the HSE.  The HSE is not all bad.  In the beginning, because of the way the organisation was thrown together, staff did not really understand their function, and there was poor leadership coming through many levels of the organisation.  This gave the sense that the whole organisation was chaotic.  However, I have found that a corporate structure has begun to evolve within the HSE such as one would expect of any organisation.  It is important that we keep the best parts of what has been evolving and get rid of the worst parts.  There is still too much management.  Many management structures were created not only within the HSE as an administrative organisation but also within hospitals and at primary care level.  Many management structures were set up almost to provide a career pathway, mar dhea, for people involved in the services rather than actually providing efficient management of our health services.  It will be difficult to unpick many of these superfluous layers of administration and management during the coming years without affecting front-line services, and it will require remarkable clarity of purpose not only from the Minister but from everyone who provides health services or who is involved in or has an interest in health services in the country.  No one is under any illusion about how difficult this will be.</p><p> I call on the Minister to clearly state, as far as he can, what is going on.  A constantly changing structure without any clear plan relating to what is going on will increase the confusion and fear and this does not get people to buy into what is going on.  That is what happened during the establishment of the HSE.  Communication will remain vital.  We must clearly outline to people what changes are coming about in the health services.  Given the reductions in pay for those who work in the health services, the expected efficiencies and the reduction in staff numbers, there is, no doubt, reduced morale within the health services.  There is a need to communicate at every level with people in the health services to keep people on board and working with us for the betterment of the patients we are looking after.</p><p> It is important that not only those who are delivering health services but those who will benefit from any changes to health services are fully aware of the changes we are bringing about, and we must communicate fully with them.  This will be a difficult task in the coming years.  The HSE, as it was first established, went through a remarkable number of rapid changes.  I recall when Professor Drumm was in charge.  At the time the HSE published changes to the management structures and the various pillars it used to deliver health services in the country.  The executive changed the structure so often that when we sought information from staff in Professor Drumm's office in Naas, they often provided us with an old structure which was out of date.  The people there were so confused about what was taking place that they gave out-of-date information about their own organisation.  Such rapid change and messing around with the system reached the point at which I could see the stagnation present at the lower, county level.  People were becoming afraid to make decisions and were unsure about the type of decision they could make, which had a negative impact on health services at the time.</p><p> This legislation will make the HSE accountable to the people again, which is important.  The changes include the setting up of a statutory audit committee, which must be robust to keep the checks and balances in place with regard to how taxpayers' money is spent in the health services.  We need to communicate in a crystal clear way to everyone who requires health services and everyone who works in health services about the next steps we must take with the HSE, not only with regard to the gross administration but also with regard to everything else, including small hospitals, hospital groups and primary care.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in this regard because it is a remarkably difficult task.</p></speech>

I, too, was a Member of the Oireachtas when the HSE was established.  At the time of its establishment there was considerable belief among the public as well as among Members and those who worked in the health services that there was a need to overhaul the structure of governance that existed in our health system.  There was a belief that the HSE would deliver successfully on the need to overhaul these services.  It is fair to say, from my perspective and from that of customers or consumers of the HSE - the people and citizens who use the service - that much of the governance structure established by the HSE has not been an improvement on what went before under the old health board system.  Deputy Liam Twomey referred to the old system and how, under the health boards, people were more empowered to make decisions locally.  They had perhaps a better knowledge of the individual circumstances in which individual users of the health service found themselves.</p><p>On the establishment of the HSE, that power was removed.  There was also a removal not just of oversight by the Oireachtas, but of the ability of Members to obtain information for people.  The fact that public representatives deal with individual queries of constituents is much maligned but it is a reality that we are an interface between all aspects of the public service and the public.  I have found the HSE structure to be most difficult to get information from for ordinary users of the health service.  In fact, it is perhaps the single most positive step in the Bill that it makes the HSE accountable through the Secretary General of the Department of Health to the Minister for Health.  It is a step which was committed to in advance of the last election and subsequently in the programme for Government.  It is now being delivered in the legislation.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Liam Twomey about the continuous change which occurred in the early years of the HSE.  Quite often, users of the service as well as staff on the front line felt that the management structures and systems which were put in place were unclear.  I welcome the initiative in the legislation establishing directorates under clear headings and the creation of a direct chain of command, for want of a better term, regarding their operation.  The HSE is a mammoth organisation in which approximately 100,000 people still work and has been a by-word for bad governance, politically and administratively, since its establishment.  I welcome the provision in the Bill for an audit committee.  It is imperative that public funds are fully accounted for when used.  It is one of the great failures of the HSE as established by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister that many promised savings and efficiencies were not delivered.  There was quite often duplication of services across the country.  Much of what was promised did not happen because of the system that was put in place in the transition between the health boards and the HSE.</p><p> I want to make particular reference to funding for mental health, a subject to which Deputy Pat Breen referred at the conclusion of his comments.  The Government has, correctly, committed to ring-fencing funding to make extra provision for mental health services.  Notwithstanding the current straitened and difficult economic circumstances and the fact that his hands are tied in many respects, in particular in terms of the budget at his disposaI, I urge the Minister to ensure the funding is not only protected but actually spent on mental health services.</p><p> I welcome the legislation.  It may be an interim measure, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-01-31a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1178" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013013100030#CC00200"><p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the legislation.  One must ask what the purpose of the Bill is because it is not clear.  While there has been a lot of talk about different aspects of the health service in press statements and in some of the contributions to the debate in the House last night and today, it has not specifically been about the Bill.  It is important to ask why the Bill is before us today.</p><p>  There has been a lot of talk about the manner in which the HSE organises its services.  I certainly do not carry a flame for the HSE and am very conscious of its shortcomings as an organisation and the flawed structure it has been.  From the very start, it was clear that the body was established by people with very little understanding of how the health service worked and what its needs were.  We have a huge, amorphous body with no clear lines of responsibility, no clear demarcation between service areas and a lack of transparency in its functions and as to how funding is handled.  One often gets the impression that the HSE is a kind of black hole into which money disappears.</p><p>  It is very difficult to get hard information on the numbers of staff employed in different parts of the service and where exactly the funding is going.  There is no doubt about the need to reform the administration of the HSE and to put in place separate directorates.  While there are flaws and dangers in creating the directorates, they are necessary.  There is also a need for greater clarity as to the different aspects of the HSE.  Like most Members, I am concerned about that issue.</p><p>  Legislation is not necessary to improve the organisation of the HSE.  Deputy Liam Twomey made very sound points which displayed a very good understanding of the health service.  All of the things he referred to could have been done by now and can be done at any stage without legislation.  They concern good administration and the operational and service structures within the HSE.  We should be doing those things to make the HSE much more responsive to the needs of citizens and patients.</p><p>  As an organisation, the HSE has two elements.  It has an operational structure and a governance structure.  The governance structure is the legal basis on which the organisation spends money, employs people and provides services.  It is of critical importance that the HSE's governance structure is soundly based.  It must be borne in mind that the HSE is the premier public body in the State.  It is responsible for a budget which is larger than the combined budgets of several other Departments.  It employs approximately 100,000 people and has a budget of &euro;13 billion.  It is the major public body which is why it is critical that its corporate governance structure is a proper one which adopts good practice and, from a legal perspective, is soundly based.</p><p>  It is normally the case that a public body has a chief executive and senior management team and, separately, to ensure the proper checks and balances are in place, an independent board which oversees its operations.  This is the general corporate governance structure to which we are used and which is in place in most public bodies.  This structure keeps the operation of a public body at arm's length from the political system which is very important to ensure we do not have political interference.  It provides an assurance that there is a certain level of accountability and transparency in an organisation.</p><p>  There is a serious corporate governance problem in the HSE as it is.  The problem has arisen owing to the actions of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, at an early stage in his ministerial career.</p><p>We remember what happened on 28 April 2011.  Where there are serious problems in the health service, a Minister will naturally look to blame somebody for those shortcomings.  The difficulties in the HSE make it very easy to blame it for everything and use it as some kind of whipping boy.  We remember the spectacle of the Minister marching down to the HSE in April 2011 and demanding the resignation of the board.  He sacked the board, an act that could be regarded as a media stunt.  He never explained why he sacked the board, which was made up of very public and well-known people who were of good standing.  We are still waiting for an explanation as to why he sacked the board.  That then caused the problem whereby we had a major public body with no board.  The Minister had to appoint an interim board, which was a very strange board made up of seven senior people from the Department and four senior managers from the HSE.  The HSE needs a proper governance structure but it was denied this because of the actions of the Minister.  The HSE needs an independent board but to turn around and appoint one now would be an admission of the folly in which the Minister engaged in April 2011.  In many respects, this legislation is a face-saving exercise for the Minister.  This gets to the heart of what this legislation is about.  It is not about reorganising the HSE or making it more responsive.  It is about putting in place a corporate governance structure which the HSE does not have as a result of the Minister's action.</p><p> What is being proposed in this legislation is that instead of a board, which most public bodies would have, the HSE is to have a directorate.  This directorate will be made up of the director general and between two and six directors who will be appointed by the Minister.  The director general is to be recruited in accordance with the Public Service Management Act, which is standard.  It is also important to highlight the fact that the first director general can be appointed by the Minister and, of course, that is what has happened.  The Minister has appointed a director general designate in advance of this legislation.  I want to be clear that the point I will make in respect of that is no reflection on the present incumbent but relates to the procedures followed in this regard and the procedures provided for in this legislation.  </p><p> It is important to cast our minds back to how this situation arose and recall that on 18 July 2012 the Minister published this legislation.  Section 7 proposes to insert Part 3A into the Health Act 2004.  Section 16C(4) of Part 3A allows the Minister to appoint the first director general without regard to the normal recruitment procedures.  There was understandable criticism of this provision when the Minister published the legislation in July.  What has been given far less attention is the fact that the Minister, in seeking the approval of his Cabinet colleagues on 17 July 2012, sought and received approval for this power while withholding from them the fact that the incumbent chief executive of the HSE, Cathal Magee, had already tendered his resignation.  Allowing a Minister to appoint his own man to one of the most senior public offices in the country is wrong to begin with.  Allowing the Minister to provide for this in law when he failed to reveal news that was material to the content of the Bill he was presenting to his Cabinet colleagues is highly questionable.  It should never have been allowed to happen and sets a very dangerous precedent.  Of course, a pattern has been developing.  Many of the senior people appointed by the Minister have been appointed without open competition.  That applies to very senior people who were brought in under quite unorthodox employment arrangements to take up very highly paid posts and indeed other posts were created.  Three new posts are provided for in this legislation where there is no clarity about the recruitment process.  Again, this is a very dangerous and unhealthy system to allow from a corporate governance perspective.  It is simply not following proper procedures.  </p><p> The new governance raises significant concerns.  We have a director general and directors and the number of directors depends on the whim of the Minister who can appoint between two and six directors.  In respect of the corporate governance structure of our premier public body, we do not know how many directors will be appointed.  The legislation provides for two, three, four, five or six in addition to the director general.  All of those people are appointed by the Minister.  The only real stipulation in this legislation regarding the appointment of the directors is that they will be drawn from the pool of national directors within the HSE.  These are the people who are responsible as national directors for service provision.  Those five posts have yet to be filled.  Obviously, that provision has implications for the existing national directors with which I will deal.  </p><p> Under this legislation, the Minister will appoint the directors.  Therefore, we will have a new governance structure within the HSE and the composition of that directorate will be a director general and directors, all of whom are appointed by the Minister.  I have a serious concern about this structure in respect of the circularity of the corporate governance involved, which is highly questionable.  With a normal governance structure, the management team reports to the CEO and the CEO reports to the board. In the very unusual arrangement regarding the governance of the HSE, the director general is answerable to the directors in the boardroom of the HSE but when they go outside the board room, the accountability is reversed because the appointed directors are part of a management team and are answerable to their director general.  It is absolutely unworkable because it is one way inside the boardroom and the reverse outside it.  It is not only unworkable but unacceptable and highly unorthodox.  We are told that this is only a temporary arrangement.  We are talking about a significant upheaval in the governance structure and what has been said about reorganising the way in which the services are operated.  Deputy Liam Twomey outlined very clearly the significant problems caused in the transition from the old health boards to the new HSE.  In any major change like that in an organisation, one is talking about a four to five-year period before the thing is bedded down.  The Minister is proposing to introduce major change and upheaval in the HSE and for what?  For one year?  When he published the Bill, he also published a number of diagrams, including this extraordinary diagram which is the timeline for the abolition of the HSE.  It shows this arrow jumping from the end of 2012 to 2014 when the HSE will be abolished.  Over next year the Minister is proposing to have all of this significant change take place within the HSE in order for it to be abolished at the end of that process. </p><p>Does anybody in the Cabinet or on the Government backbenches know what will happen to the health service in 2014?  What will be the delivery structure if the HSE is being abolished?  It is easy to say the HSE should be abolished; we all know serious problems have arisen with it, but it is difficult to build a meaningful structure to replace it.</p><p> A pattern is developing whereby in the absence of a clear vision for the health service or the structures that could deliver a responsive and fairer health system, there is scapegoating of the people working in the service.  The Minister decided to abolish the board and replace it with this strange directorate.  Then he sacked the CEO and put his own man in the post.  Now he is proposing to abolish the HSE next year, followed by what?  My real fear is that the experimentation in which the Minister is engaging in the absence of a clear roadmap for the coming few years will, in effect, dismantle the health service as we know it without providing clarity on what is to replace it.  I am concerned that he is engaging in an exercise which will completely dismantle the public health service and send it into free fall.</p><p> How are primary care and hospital services to be delivered?  How are the hospital groups to be constituted?  Will a paid board be appointed for each of them?  How will we deliver primary care services if the HSE is abolished?  How are public health nurses going to function?  They are the mainstay of the health service, performing the critical functions of looking after older people, supporting families and providing vaccination services.  They are on the front line of the health service.  Who is going to employ public health nurses or the 100,000 health workers in 2014 after the Minister abolishes the HSE?  We do not have the answer to any of these questions and I firmly believe the Minister does not have the answers either.</p><p> The second purpose of the legislation is to give the Minister direct control over the operations of the health service.  His role will no longer be specifically confined to policy direction but will include operational matters.  This might be acceptable if the Minister's directions were to relate to principles such as setting out citizens' rights to health services or criteria for prioritising the provision of health services.  We know from bitter experience, however, that neither the Minister nor his Cabinet colleagues operate on the basis of transparency and prioritisation when it comes to health spending.  From a funding point of view, the &euro;13 billion Vote for the HSE will transfer to the Department of Health next year and the HSE will no longer be answerable for that money.  The Minister will have complete control over the health service and its &euro;13 billion budget.  There will be no checks and balances in ensuring proper procedures and good governance arrangements.</p><p> I oppose the Bill because, whatever about transferring powers when the Minister and the Cabinet display sound judgment and prioritise the patient in health spending, in current circumstances it would be the height of folly and highly irresponsible for the House to give these wide-ranging and unfettered powers to a Minister whose track record already concerns many of us.</p></speech>

The answer is bit by bit.  I am not saying the HSE is an elephant.  It consists of many good people who are doing their best in an unworkable system which was handed to them on a plate several years ago.  The HSE structure welded together 11 health boards which, while not without their own challenges, were working at a local level.</p><p>  It is important to remind the House of who presided over the change in structure.  The HSE was set up by the current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, while he was Minister for Health and Children.  He spent &euro;16.8 million on reports during his four years in that office.  These reports included a value for money audit which was produced in 2000 and, ironically, cost taxpayers &euro;616,000.  The absence of a real attempt to save money gave rise to the ridiculous situation where councillors from County Donegal had to attend meetings in Galway.  They were eager to reflect the concerns of people in their jurisdiction, whether at primary health care level or in Letterkenny General Hospital, but became frustrated at the lack of opportunities to do so.  I recall the cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway which presented a serious health concern for the people of that city.  Councillors told me that they had attended meeting after meeting in Galway at which the issue was discussed.  It was an important issue, but others also needed to be addressed.  In stretching from Malin Head to north Tipperary, the HSE became unworkable.  As all politics is local, people want to know what is happening in their own area and representatives need to reflect the issues on the ground.</p><p>  It is welcome that the Bill sets out new arrangements for the delegation of functions by the new director general.  A key principle of the new structure will be that the authority will make operational decisions delegated as closely as possible to the point of service delivery.  That is a welcome development.  We have a plethora of people engaged in positive and proactive work, from carers to home help organisations.  They need an integrated plan at a local level, with greater communication and interconnectivity among them.  I welcome the sharp focus on how services can be managed and delivered at a local level.</p><p>  When I was on the hustings and doorsteps during the election campaign, people asked me why the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wanted to take responsibility for health services, given that the job was a crown of thorns or a poisoned chalice.  Difficulties will arise and people will get upset in bringing about change.  When the Minister attempts to restructure areas of the health service, there will be turf wars and personality clashes.  The reality is that human beings do not like change and change comes slowly.  Two years into his term of office he has brought about change that is not really reflected in the public domain.  There are positive news stories that do not get mentioned such as the reduction by 24% in the number of patients on trolleys nationally - there were 20,352 fewer patients on trolleys in 2012; a reduction of 98% in the number of adults waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case surgery; a 95% reduction in the number of children waiting more than 20 weeks for inpatient or day case surgery; and a 99% reduction in the number waiting more than 13 weeks for routine endoscopy, to name but a few.  However, that does not get mentioned because it is not good enough fodder for the media as it comes in a positive framework.</p><p> I want to make reference to the work the Minister is doing on a cross-Border basis.  He has built up a strong working relationship with Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, his health colleague across the Border.  I would like to compliment Mr. Poots, who - along with many of this colleagues, even in his own party, the DUP, such as Mr. Jim Wells, MLA - has a pragmatic approach to cross-Border shared services.  At a time when efficiencies and cost-saving measures are introduced in the health services in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, there is a pragmatic approach to joined-up thinking in shared services.</p><p><br /> If we are looking at the community trust hospital model - I know the Minister is looking at different possible permutations, such as which hospitals naturally cluster together - I ask him to keep thinking on the same road in regard to reaching out across the Border.  There is a natural alliance between regions such as Sligo and Letterkenny, where there are two hospitals that will form a natural cluster, but we should also be looking at <i>ad hoc</i>cross-Border relationships between Sligo, Letterkenny and Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry.  There is already sharing of resources between Derry and Letterkenny, and the Irish Government has contributed &#8364;19 million to the development of a radiotherapy centre with three linear accelerators at Altnagelvin.  That is an example of how we can work together mutually for the benefit of people in their respective regions.  Another example of how synergies can lead to win-win situations is in regard to ambulance services.  There is no reason we cannot have a shared air ambulance shared service encompassing Enniskillen, Letterkenny, Altnagelvin and Sligo.</p><p><br /> For counties such as Donegal and Sligo, the temptation is always to do a mapping exercise in which we look at Ireland on the basis of the Twenty-six Counties.  While it is a 26-county jurisdiction from a Republic of Ireland point of view, the Minister has to continue on the road he is travelling with respect to shared services.  He is already doing so in his positive and proactive engagement in regard to the children's hospital, for which I compliment him.  However, he should not go down the road of being tempted by lines on a map and the way counties happen to be situated in the Twenty-six Counties.</p><p><br /> While I have the opportunity, I will reference the Higher Education Authority, which is looking at third level colleges, including institutes of technology.  However, it is looking at them on a 26-county basis, which is wrong.  Underpinning every policy decision we make, be it for the north-west or on a cross-Border basis, is the Good Friday Agreement, to which we all signed up nearly 15 years ago.  Within that was the north-west gateway initiative, which was signed up to by both the British and Irish Governments in order to work on synergies and close co-operation between the two.</p></speech>

This important Bill seeks to abolish the board structure of the HSE and provide for a directorate to be the new governing body of the HSE in place of the board, headed by a director general; it provides for further accountability arrangements for the HSE; and it provides for related matters, including a number of technical amendments to take account of the replacement of the board structure by the directorate structure.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  After 14 years of seeing money thrown at a problem without addressing it, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has taken the bull by the horns and is effecting change, with a much lower budget, in the way we deliver health services in this country.</p><p>  I come from County Roscommon.  I have had to deal with the ups and downs of innuendo, of lies and of people coming out with completely mad suggestions.  I will say this: shame on RTE, shame on TV3, shame on most of the radio stations and shame on the people who constantly carry on with lies in regard to what is happening in Roscommon Hospital.  I want to put on the record that Roscommon town has a population of 5,000 people and County Roscommon has a population of 50,000.  Where I live, in Boyle, and throughout north Roscommon, the people have always gone to the accident and emergency department in Sligo.  In south Roscommon, the people have always gone to the accident and emergency department in Ballinasloe.  Roscommon town has 5,000 people and a consultant at the hospital wrote to state that it could not oversee a safe accident and emergency department because the throughput was not available.  We were told 14 days before a vote here a year and a half ago, by none other than Dr. Tracey Cooper of HIQA, that she could not allow an accident and emergency department in Roscommon Hospital because there was not sufficient throughput.  Fewer than 30 people a day used it.  They called it an accident and emergency department but it had no cardiac surgeon, nobody to incubate, no paediatric surgeon and no anaesthetic cover overnight.  It is not the accident and emergency department I would expect if I were in difficulty.  If a person has a serious heart attack or is in a car accident, that person will be brought to an accident and emergency department.  We have now put in place an air ambulance service, based in Athlone, which is saving people's lives and which has carried out over 120 missions since it was put in place as a pilot scheme.  I hope that service will be continued because it is saving lives.  We also have paramedics driving about.  Whereas at one time, following an accident, patients were brought to an accident and emergency department such as that at Roscommon to be stabilised and then brought somewhere else, now they are stabilised at home or at the side of the road following an accident, and are then brought to a real accident and emergency department.  Lives have been saved and I want to put on record that no lives have been lost despite the innuendo and the untruths that have gone out.</p><p>  What really gets me is that on Tuesday night I saw a constituency colleague of mine on &quot;The Vincent Browne Show&quot; on TV3.  Seven times he mentioned my name and said I did not do anything.  I tell him to get down off his high horse.  He should go in and see what is happening in Roscommon County Hospital and what is happening under the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.  What is happening is that we are allocating resources and ensuring people's lives are saved.  It is happening on the ground.  Even if the newspapers and media outlets do not want to know, it behoves them to call in and see what is happening.</p><p>  Outpatient attendances for Roscommon County Hospital in 2012 were 14,855, some 2,000 more than in 2011.  The number of day cases was 5,127, which was 1,400 more than in 2011.  The number of inpatient discharges was 1,889, whereas the target for 2012 was 1,620.  The number of urgent care centre attendances, including the minor injury care unit, was 5,940.  Roscommon hospital is leading the way as an example of the role a small hospital will play.  The smaller hospitals framework will set out the range of services that can be performed in smaller hospitals.  If I might tell my colleague what has happened in this regard, examples of service development in the hospital this year include plastic and reconstructive surgery, led by Dr. Deirdre Jones, which commenced at the end of 2011 and is now extended to two days a week.  This service is growing, with 50 patients booked for each day of the clinic - 100 patients per week - and access is significantly improving, with decreasing waiting times.  Sleep studies, led by Dr. Imran Saleem, commenced in Roscommon hospital in March last year and 132 patients have already been assessed.  Urology services commenced at the hospital in May.  The radiology project, upgrading the X-ray system to allow doctors to view electronically and share X-rays quickly and easily, went live in August.</p><p>This means that Roscommon Hospital can offer increased diagnostic services to patients from Roscommon who attend consultants based in Galway.  In addition it means that Roscommon now provides CT scans for suitable patients on the waiting list for scans at Galway University Hospital.  It is another example of how all the resources of the group are used to facilitate best patient care.  An application has been made for planning permission for the endoscopy suite.  This will be a &euro;3 million development construction of which will commence in the last quarter of 2013.  The unit will have JAG accreditation.  Roscommon Hospital will become a centre for colorectal screening under the governance of the National Cancer Screening Service in mid-2013.  It will provide a new dental service for patients with special needs while under general anaesthetic commencing in September.  The nursing initiatives include nurses prescribing, x-ray prescribing, nurse-led clinics, colorectal clinical nurse specialists, Bord Altranais assessment and productive ward initiatives.  The group inpatient list target has been exceeded in Roscommon Hospital.</p><p> A few nights ago someone on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; asked &quot;who is Frank Feighan?&quot;.  Frank Feighan attends a meeting in Roscommon Hospital and in the Department of Health every week to ensure that I deliver for the people of County Roscommon but most important, to ensure that the people of Roscommon are safe.  We do not have innuendo.  The consultants in Roscommon Hospital wrote a letter before that famous decision to say that they could not stand over a safe service.  The consultant in the hospital stated to me that the accident and emergency department was safe only if an accident occurred within a mile and a half of the hospital.  In that case lives may be saved.  Otherwise it was unsafe.  Virtually all the doctors in Roscommon and other places sent their patients to Sligo, Galway, Dublin or Athlone.  Only 9% of the people who went to hospital from Roscommon, which has a population of fewer than 50,000, went to Roscommon Hospital.</p><p> The people and the doctors of the county drove at speed to get away from the accident and emergency department in Roscommon.  Now they are shedding crocodile tears, coming out with lies and innuendo stating that it is safe and they want it. They will have a hospital of which they can be proud.  It will be five times busier and twice as big but there will be no accident and emergency department because it is unsafe, not through lack of money or political will but because it cannot comply with the HIQA standard.  The Opposition have talked about the money that went to hospitals in Kilkenny and Wexford.  The same amount of money effectively went to Roscommon in 2004.  Fianna F&aacute;il spent &euro;7 million on building an accident and emergency department, then set up HIQA with terms of reference that closed it down.</p></speech>

Deputy Smith and I have raised the conflict in Syria on numerous occasions.  I sometimes think I am wasting my breath but at least all I can be accused of in that regard is being consistent in trying to keep the matter on the agenda.</p><p>  Earlier this week a further 65 to 70 people were slaughtered in Aleppo.  This is just another grisly detail on a long list of horrific examples of the genocide being carried out there.  Among those slaughtered in Aleppo were teenage boys.  This seems to be a theme in Syria at present.  It appears that children are being used as weapons of war in a conflict that is occurring in what was once a very highly developed society.  Not only are brutal killings taking place but there appears to be a kind of perversion involved whereby the Syrian authorities seek to demonstrate, to both the outside world and their own people, just how cruel they can really be.</p><p>  We have all heard the reports from the UN with regard to the horrors to which children have been subjected.  I will not go into the details here but suffice it to say that all of the mechanisms of a normal society are being eroded on a daily basis in Syria.  To date, almost 1,500 children have been killed in the conflict there.  If action is not taken, there will be nothing left to fight for and the entire country will have been destroyed.  What makes this matter more infuriating is that the world powers seem to have washed their hands of this conflict and are paying mere lip service in respect of the massacres which are taking place.</p><p>  The UN-Arab League mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi, has outlined the crisis in no uncertain terms to the United Nations Security Council.  The latter must take responsibility for its part in this crisis.  It is the Security Council's intransigence on the question of taking action in respect of the conflict that has exacerbated matters.  Mr. Brahimi stated in recent days that &quot;unprecedented levels of horror&quot; have been perpetrated by both sides in the conflict and that &quot;atrocious crimes&quot; have been committed.  He has been highly critical of the Security Council and has told it to get its house in order.  In addition, he has stated that only the international community can now help.  Was it not for the purpose of dealing with crises of this precise type that the United Nations was established in the first instance?  Mr. Brahimi has urged those at the UN to set aside their differences, break the deadlock and take action to prevent the meltdown of Syrian society.  The situation in Syria at present is quite similar to that which obtained in the Balkans in the 1990s.</p><p>  There is now a real danger that surrounding nations will use Syria as a battlefield.  Earlier today, there were reports of Israeli attacks on a Syrian truck convoy.  Mr. Brahimi has stated that it will take real leadership on the part of world powers to broker a solution.  He has warned that there will be dire consequences, not just for Syria but also for the entire Middle East region, if such a solution is not found.</p></speech>

The escalating conflict in Syria has cost more than 60,000 lives, has driven hundreds of thousands of people out of both their homes and their country and has destroyed the livelihoods of innumerable citizens.  I understand that 2 million Syrians have been displaced internally and a further 2 million require urgent humanitarian assistance.  These figures alone attest to the awfulness of this situation.</p><p>  The appalling human cost of the conflict has horrified Irish people in recent months.  We have witnessed barbaric scenes of bombings and executions on our television screens.  It is all too clear that the regime of President Assad has lost its legitimacy and is utterly bankrupt.  The exploitation of the conflict as a proxy war by Saudi Arabia and Iran in their efforts to control the Middle East, and, at a higher level, the utter intransigence of certain UN Security Council powers - namely, Russia and China - in the context of ensuring that this problem will be addressed present a serious diplomatic difficulty.</p><p>  There are three issues that need to be addressed from an Irish perspective.  The first of these is the provision of immediate aid to address the humanitarian and refugee crisis in surrounding countries.  I warmly welcome the Government's pledge of almost &euro;5 million, in addition to the provision of humanitarian aid, to address the deepening crisis.  It is vital that we continue to ensure our aid is targeted at those areas where it is most needed.  The second issue that must be addressed relates to the need to identify the support we can provide to the rebel groups.  This should be done at EU level.  I appreciate that we must tread carefully in pledging support to unknown rebel groups.  The Arab Spring has riled the Middle East and we have witnessed the whiplash of armed extremism in Libya.  The third issue relates to the diplomatic efforts at UN level to arrive at a feasible plan to bring the civil war in Syria to a close and ensure the transition of power to democratic institutions.  The European Union should use its clout to pressurise Russia and China to abandon their zero-sum approach to the awful conflict.  There is too much at stake in respect of this extremely serious issue for anyone to be allowed to play politics with it.</p></speech>

I agree that this is one of the most serious issues facing the entire world at present.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the T&aacute;naiste and I have all been trying to engage in respect of it as much as possible.  I am pleased to be able to respond to this debate, having only just returned to Ireland a few hours ago following my attendance at the major UN pledging conference on Syria which took place in Kuwait yesterday.</p><p>  The human cost of the brutal civil war now being waged in Syria has reached truly alarming proportions.  More than 60,000 have been killed in 22 months, 2 million people have been internally displaced, a further 2 million are in need of urgent assistance and more than 700,000 refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.  Given that 200,000 of the latter fled in the past two months, there is no doubt that there has been a rapid escalation in the number of people fleeing the country.</p><p>The sheer savagery and inhumanity of the conflict has been well underlined in recent days, with the latest reported massacre in Aleppo.</p><p> Against this background, it is at least encouraging to note the generosity and also what Secretary General Ban Ki-moon described as the global solidarity, which was evident at yesterday's meeting where more than $1.5 billion, in excess of what the UN requested, was pledged to meet the urgent humanitarian requirements over the next six months.  Ireland was pleased to join in this effort with the Government pledging an additional &euro;4.7 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries.  This brings our total contribution of humanitarian aid to Syria over the past year to more than &euro;7.1 million.  Ireland and its EU partners have been to the forefront in responding to the humanitarian crisis.  Additional assistance announced yesterday by the European Commission and EU member states combined came to $370 million, bringing total EU assistance to date to some $830 million.</p><p> There is no doubt that the overall situation on the ground is deteriorating and the dangers which the conflict in Syria poses to the wider region are becoming greater.  The UN and Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, was characteristically candid when briefing the UN Security Council on Tuesday.  He underlined the clear threat of Syria being progressively destroyed bit by bit unless the violence ends and some form of political process is initiated.  The T&aacute;naiste is attending the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels today.  It will also address the situation and consider what further steps the EU can take to promote a political settlement.</p><p> The reality remains, however, that the only viable prospect of achieving a ceasefire and initiating some form of political process leading to transition, lies in the efforts of the special representative Mr. Brahimi.  It remains incumbent on all sides within Syria and indeed all countries concerned with this conflict to extend the fullest co-operation and support to Mr. Brahimi's efforts.  Any other option, including further militarisation or external intervention, will simply spell total disaster for the country, at a human cost which cannot be contemplated.</p><p> The brutal violence and repression which the Syrian regime has inflicted upon its own people must end.  We must also continue to encourage the Syrian National Coalition to develop its structures and to co-operate fully with Mr. Brahimi's efforts.  The T&aacute;naiste has already extended an invitation to the leader of the SNC, Dr. al-Khatib, to visit Dublin for discussions and to hear their plans for promoting a political settlement within Syria.</p><p> The conflict in Syria undoubtedly represents the most serious crisis confronting the international community at present.  Ireland will continue to work with EU and international partners.  We will use our influence during our current EU Presidency to ensure efforts to end the violence and to promote a political settlement receive all possible support.</p></speech>

Ireland is dealing with the humanitarian issue for which I congratulate the Minister of State.  I thank him for the increased aid to Syria.  The second issue is the lack of action by the international powers.

I trust the T&aacute;naiste will ensure at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting today that the EU sanctions will at least be extended beyond the end of March.  It is hoped that additional sanctions will be applied.  The EU high representative, Baroness Ashton, chairs the Council of Foreign Ministers.  It is very important that the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State and the Government ensure that some better effort is made at UN level to bring about the necessary political support.  It is not acceptable that the two major powers can be so intransigent when faced with the appalling loss of human life in Syria.  I hope the Government will use every available forum during the Irish Presidency to ensure that this issue is given the attention it deserves in an effort to prevent the wholesale loss of life.</p></speech>

Yesterday I also met with the director general of UNICEF, the director general of the UN World Food Programme and with Commissioner Georgieva, to discuss how aid can be delivered and the role of non-governmental organisations.  It is now easier to get essential aid into Syria.  I also met Dr. al-Khatib at the Friends of Syria conference in December.  He is the leader of the Syrian National Coalition.  The T&aacute;naiste and I invited him to Dublin to discuss these issues during the Irish Presidency.  We hope to receive a positive response in this regard.  As the Deputies said, the UN Security Council resolution is extremely important.  That is the context in which the Arab League and the United Nations are moving forward with Mr. Brahimi.  It is imperative for the members of the Security Council to recognise the seriousness of the situation and to cease the stand-off.  I have no doubt that the sanctions will remain while the current situation continues.</p></speech>

I have no argument with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, but there are enough Ministers of State in the Department of Health to allow one of them to deal with the response to my matter which is particularly important.</p><p>I refer to the provision of psychological services across the country, in particular, the hiring practices used by the HSE for the recruitment of psychologists.  The Minister of State may have to correct me but since 2009 the HSE has imposed a block on the hiring of counselling and educational psychologists to fill positions which are filled only by clinical psychologists.  This is despite the fact that the same primary degree qualification applies to all and despite the fact that everywhere in the western world both counselling and educational psychologists are hired to fill vacancies in health services.  The policy of the HSE is strange given that so many psychology posts remain unfilled across the country, not least in my own part of the world.  Approximately 20 posts remain unfilled.  This means that the HSE is recruiting specifically clinical psychologists from other jurisdictions - from the UK in particular - while qualified psychologists with an educational or counselling background have to leave here and are hired by the NHS to do the same job in the health service of our nearest neighbour.  In earlier business today the House discussed reform of the health service and new governance for the HSE.  This very strange practice of recruitment is like no other in any country that I know of, and should be discontinued.</p><p> Sixty counselling psychologists passed a HSE interview between 2009 and 2012 and have been placed on a panel for employment, yet because of the bar that exists, they cannot be hired.  Crazily, despite the fact that students on placement from college who are not fully qualified either as educational or counselling psychologists can work alongside students of clinical psychology, only clinical psychologists can be hired by the HSE because of the existing practice in the Republic.  Effectively, all counselling psychologists must travel to other jurisdictions to get work.  Many are working in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and in Australia, Canada and other countries.  While this is happening, we are advertising overseas.  We cannot get enough graduates from overseas to fill the vacancies that exist here.</p><p> Only approximately 70 clinical psychologists qualify annually in Ireland.  Last year, there were more than 90 vacancies to be filled.  As a consequence, approximately 20 vacancies remain unfilled despite the fact that the HSE held a further recruitment drive in the United Kingdom in November.  We have been unable to get more than two suitably qualified people to fill the vacancies.  I ask that the Department and HSE change the recruitment policy with regard to psychologists.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Minister, who cannot be present.</p><p><br />  Psychologists perform a wide variety of roles across the health and social care services and provide a very important service to service users across a wide spectrum of need.  A working group was, therefore, established within the HSE to agree appropriate eligibility criteria for the recruitment of both staff and senior psychologists to best meet the needs of service users across all areas of the public health and social care services.  This working group involved principal psychologists from all parts of the HSE together with service managers and it was supported by human resource professionals.  The group examined the broad spectrum of clients that the HSE serves and made a determination on which type of qualification would be appropriate for different service areas.</p><p><br />  The working group decided that educational psychologists would be appropriate to work only in disability services for children.  Their qualifications equip them to deal with a broad spectrum of clients within that group.  They are qualified to provide services to children of all ages with an intellectual, physical or sensory disability.  The HSE has established on the basis of the service requirements of different client groups and areas across the health service that the qualification of counselling psychologist equips the holder with the necessary skills to provide services to adults in the primary care and community care settings.  The working group determined that clinical psychologists were eligible to work with all client groups across the health service.</p><p><br />  There has been recruitment for clinical psychology posts in the mental health service recently.  These posts are restricted to clinical psychologists in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change<i>. </i> A Vision for Change sets out in great detail the role of clinical psychologist within the community mental health teams which deal with a wide range of mental health problems among adults, children and adolescents.  They also form an integral part of specialist mental health teams.  Since the publication of A Vision for Change<i></i>in 2006, the mental health service has invested an additional &#8364;1 million per annum and dedicated 50 whole-time equivalent<i></i>posts to clinical psychology training at four third-level colleges, namely, TCD, UCD, NUIG and the University of Limerick.</p><p><br />  Thirty-four clinical psychologists graduated in 2011.  The graduates are being employed to complete the community mental health teams as set out in the HSE's national service plan.  In 2012, the &#8364;35 million dedicated from within the programme for Government commitment has been allocated to employ 72 clinical psychologists for general adult mental health teams, with a further 23 clinical psychologists for child and adolescent teams.  Detailed plans are currently being prepared to determine how the additional &#8364;35 million for community-based mental health services will be utilised in 2013.  It is expected that further clinical psychology posts will be required in 2013, as indicated in the policy in A Vision for Change.</p><p><br />  The Minister is committed to the ongoing development, subject to overall resource constraints, of mental health services and to the recruitment of the most appropriate mix of health professionals to meet the varied needs of service users across the health and personal social services.</p></speech>

Perhaps I would be able to get more information on the decision of the working group if a Minister from the Department of Health were present.  Why has the HSE working group on the hiring of psychologists adopted a completely different policy from the one that exists in health services everywhere else in Europe and farther afield?  There are 20 psychologist vacancies, although the 60 counselling psychologists on a panel will never be allowed to fill them as a result of the criteria drawn up by the HSE working group.  No similar criteria exist anywhere else.  The Minister of State's answer is wholly inadequate from that perspective.</p><p>  I have dealt with an individual who was hired by the HSE as a counselling psychologist in the area of child protection prior to 2009.  Now he can never even apply for vacancies that arise in that area because of the mistaken guidelines published by the HSE's working group.  Vacancies remain around the country and much-needed psychological services are not provided, yet qualified psychologists must travel around the world to get work.  We must advertise positions in other jurisdictions because we maintain a strict interpretation resulting in the decision that only clinical psychologists can be hired.  I really do not understand how we can justify this position.</p></speech>

The HSE working group comprises principal psychologists, service managers and human resource professionals.  They concluded that educational psychologists would be able to operate solely in the area in which they have expertise.  They agreed the same for counselling psychologists but stated clinical psychologists could work with client groups across the health service.  Since the publication of the report, the Department has put in place the necessary training and educational measures for clinical psychologists to implement the policy in A Vision for Change.  All the decisions that have been taken were in the context of the implementation of the current programme for Government.</p></speech>

The industry is worth &euro;2.2 billion per year.  It was worth &euro;286 million per year in exports in 2011 and it employs 12,000 people.  Despite its being an Irish success story, there appears to be a drive and determination to sell off a vital public resource that is generating income for the State.</p><p> Has an economic impact assessment been done of the sell-off of Coillte trees?  If not, why not?  The international experience is that where privatisation has occurred in countries like New Zealand and states in Australia the impact has been very negative for the public and has resulted in more private ownership, less focus on public interest and a lack of accountability in developing their public forestry.</p><p> It is a disaster, not just for this generation of Irish citizens but for future generations, that we would sell off the harvesting rights of our trees.  It makes us an outlier in Europe.  Not even in the darkest days of Thatcher's Britain was she able to sell off that country's forests yet the Government proposal is to accept the troika agreement and not challenge it.  There is no legal obligation on this country to sell off the harvesting rights of our forests.  What economic assessment has been done on jobs, the economy and tourism?  I urge the Minister to take this opportunity to say he will reconsider and reject this ludicrous proposal.</p></speech>

Public ownership of the forests and the trees that stand on them is the birthright of Irish citizens.</p><p>  I do not know if the word &quot;treason&quot; has its roots in the word &quot;trees&quot; but to sell off the State forestry is an act of treason.  What the Minister is planning to do has been done by no other country in Europe.  Only one country, Sweden, sold off some of its state forestry but a few years later quickly took it back into 100% public ownership.  When it was proposed they would sell off the state forests in Cameron's Britain there was a public outcry and following widespread public consultation the plans were abandoned.  </p><p>  There has been no public consultation here.  That is not surprising because if there was a public consultation with the stakeholders and the people who care about our forests they would tell the Minister that privatisation puts at risk thousands of jobs, both direct and indirect, in the forestry sector, that all the valuations done so far for the State forestry lands are gross undervaluations, which suggest we will be selling off the harvesting rights for approximately &euro;500 or less per acre when agricultural land here sells for approximately &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 per acre, and that even under Coillte forest assets are being sold to prop up the hole in the pension fund.  How much more of our national forests assets will we see stripped if private for profit and commercial interests take over the State forestry?</p><p>  Consultation would also tell the Minister that because forests take 30 to 40 years to rotate inter-generational stable stewardship is needed of the sort that we cannot have when we are talking about speculators and profiteers running the forests.  They will tell him that in New Zealand, where privatisation has taken place, there have been major problems with public access, job losses and outflow of profits from the country.  </p><p>  There is simply no justification to sell our forests, and the Minister should abandon this plan immediately.  At the very least he should have a public consultation where the facts of Irish forestry and what the impact of its sale would mean for this country could be discussed.</p></speech>

He is involved in European Union commitments.</p><p><br />  The examination of the sale of Coillte does not have anything to do with a drive for privatisation, the influence of Margaret Thatcher or anything to do with ideology.  The assets disposal programme is a requirement of the troika which is funding the State and the Government decided that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests would be examined.  Further to that Government decision the National Treasury Management Agency, through its NewERA Unit, has been actively engaged with Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recent months to examine the financial and other implications of a potential transaction.</p><p><br />  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  Some of the issues identified to date include public access to recreational land, the possible impact on the timber industry, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company and levels of employment.  These issues, and the measures, if necessary, to address them, require detailed consideration.</p><p><br />  The Government is aware of the concerns expressed by a number of bodies and individuals regarding the proposed sale.  Such bodies include the Timber Council of Ireland, the Coillte trade unions and environmental, sporting and recreational bodies.  These concerns focus on the possible impact on the timber industry, employment levels, access to Coillte recreational forests and long-term consequences for the management of the forests, all of which form part of the ongoing consideration.</p><p><br />  The Government is very much aware of the important contribution Coillte makes in regard to the supply of timber to the sawmills, in the provision of forest recreational activities and valuable tourism attractions and in the maintenance of the State's forest estate.</p><p><br />  The comprehensive examination process carried out to date has included engagement with potential acquirers of harvesting rights when requested by them in accordance with the published Government protocol.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and NewERA have also met with interested stakeholders to discuss their position on the sale of the harvesting rights.</p><p><br />  As part of that, representatives of the two Departments and NewERA met with the Coillte group of unions last Friday where they outlined the process involved and received the view of those unions and copies of the report commissioned on the unions' behalf by Peter Bacon.  It was agreed that the Bacon report titled Assessment of the Consequences of the proposed Sale of Coillte's Timber Harvesting Rights - 10 January 2013 would be analysed and a further meeting would be held.  NewERA also met with representatives of the Irish Timber Council on 4 July last year to discuss the implications of any sale of Coillte felling rights on the Irish saw-milling sector.</p><p><br />  The input of the various bodies such as the joint press statement of the environmental and sporting bodies, the document by the Irish Timber Council outlining its views on the proposal, the Save our Forests<i></i>document published by IMPACT'S Coillte branch in November, and the Bacon report commissioned by IMPACT is appreciated as they make a valuable contribution to the consideration process.</p></speech>

The Deputies will be aware that this entire process is a very complex one and it is not possible at this stage to pre-empt the outcome of the analysis and its possible consequences for the future of Coillte.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has stressed in his replies to parliamentary questions, the Government will proceed with caution in regard to this matter and no final decision has been taken as yet.</p></speech>

Coillte is a profitable, successful company.  If the decision to sell off a company that is an Irish success story which is integral to this island's economic development is not an ideological decision, I do not what is because if we were serious we would develop Coillte as a publicly owned company relying on its successful past and the resources available to us as a country.  It is untrue to say that this country is required to sell off the public harvesting rights on our forests.</p><p>That is not a truthful statement.  It is a public policy choice.  Like me, the Minister knows this is the wrong move for this country.</p></speech>

That we might sell off our State forestry - our national heritage - to pay off the debts of gamblers is nothing short of obscene.  The Government is not specifically required to sell off Coillte.  It could find this money elsewhere by taxing the wealthy or those earning over &euro;100,000.  There are many other options but selling off the State forestry is an outrage.</p><p>  Instead, this is an area in which we should be investing, expanding and developing to create employment.  The Minister knows, as well as anyone who knows about forestry, jobs can be created just by planting more trees.  Doing so would also create a sink for carbon which helps tackle climate change.  It would also have a knock-on effect for other industries, services and rural areas.  It is absolute madness to divest ourselves of State forestry to speculators such as Helvetica Wealth.  They see our public forestry as nothing more than an opportunity to turn a quick buck, not giving a damn about public access, future investment, employment and the State's best interests.</p><p>  The Minister must abandon these plans and we must have a serious discussion with all stakeholders about how we can develop our forestry to the benefit of all citizens and create much badly needed jobs.</p></speech>

I am interested in exploring the possibilities of synergies between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in creating a bioenergy company, for example.  It has nothing to do, however, with the fact that Coillte is profitable.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's energy division is profitable and will be put on the market as a result of the requirements of the programme with the troika which are very explicit that there must be an asset disposal programme.  If the Deputies want to exclude the harvesting rights in Coillte, perhaps then they will list for me which companies they would like to see included in the asset disposal programme.</p><p>  It is a fact that such a programme is required by the only lender that the State has.  It is not a question of ideology, privatisation or lust on someone's part in government to want to sell the harvesting rights.  It is an attempt to comply with strictures laid down by the troika.  We have made some progress in respect of these because 50% of the proceeds of whatever is sold will be made available for re-investment and job creation.</p></speech>

Accordingly, operational matters are a matter for the board and management.  These are areas in which I have no statutory function.  As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern about the ongoing commercial position of the company and I regularly liaise with the company in this regard.</p><p><br />  The reality is the core mail business of An Post has suffered a major fall which has impacted seriously on the company&#8217;s revenue flow.  In response, it is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business.  Control of costs must, in particular, be rigorously pursued by the company in light of the continuing drain on revenue arising from the core mail business decline.</p><p><br />  None the less, it is my strong objective that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices.  This objective is shared on all sides of the House.  I must stress, however, that the company requires be in a sustainable and viable financial position to ensure this.  An Post is a commercial State company and its strategy and decision making must be formulated in this context.</p><p><br />  However, I firmly believe An Post has many strengths.  It is a trusted brand and it also has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the company the need to exploit further its unique position in this regard.  I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p><p><br />  I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification, including the announcement that following the decision of AIB to close several branches, an extended range of AIB services is available through post offices in the locality of the closures.  This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities.</p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Furthermore, in May last year I welcomed the arrangement between An Post One Direct and Aviva which saw 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct outlets.  This not only secured some of the jobs that were at risk due to Aviva's restructuring but it further broadened An Post's portfolio of financial services offering to customers.</p><p><br />  In the context of the public sector reform and service delivery agenda, I continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and other Ministers in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Departments and Government agencies.  I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.  I and my Department will maintain ongoing contact with the board and management of the company to work with them on our shared objectives in light of the challenging environment which they face.</p></reply>

It is tied in with other issues such as rural isolation.  We may have ghost estates but we also have ghost villages.  Communities are losing their post offices not just in rural areas but in urban areas as was seen in Blackpool in Cork city recently.  Since I was elected, every communications Minister has said they want to provide a network of commercially viable post offices.  In his reply, the Minister stated An Post should seek further contracts.  However, we do not see any urgency in this regard.  We have heard at public meetings and so forth that An Post should go into providing different services such as county council bills, but there never seems to be an urgency for it to go after these contracts.  There must be a drive to ensure the post office network becomes a provider of other services.</p><p>There must be an urgency because many of the smaller post offices rely almost exclusively on social welfare business at this stage and they need to become more than simply a traditional post office.  Perhaps in his negotiations the Minister could encourage An Post to have a sense of urgency.</p></speech>

In fairness to An Post, it has been going about its business quietly and in a commercial manner and it continues to do so.  For example, there is an arrangement between An Post, One Direct and Aviva, which has seen 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct outlets for An Post.  This is the type of venture that could be built on because An Post has a unique retail infrastructure.</p><p>  Deputy Moynihan offered an exhortation to urgency but even if An Post was unsuccessful in all other cases, it has been chasing contracts and opportunities, including motor tax renewals, driving license renewals, HSE patient charges, household charge payments, second home payments, water charge payments, Courts Service fines, the registration and payment for septic tanks, Irish Rail ticket sales and electrical rural production.  An Post chases all of this business and it wins more than its fair share.  These are the types of contracts that represent the future of part of the business of An Post.</p></speech>

We should show good faith and show that we are all serious about the provision and maintenance of the post offices.  There is a fear in rural communities in particular and in urban communities that they are awaiting the retirement of the postmaster or postmistress.  Something should be included in the legislation to the effect that the first port of call for the payment of bills that accrue from the Water Services Bill should be the post office.  The same should apply to any other legislation coming through to ensure that An Post and the post office network is highlighted as the first port of call and the point of interaction between the citizen and the State.</p></speech>

It is also a commercial State company, though, and must compete commercially and it is focused on doing precisely that.

Extensive public consultation rights are enshrined and protected under Irish planning law.  These apply not only to wind energy developments but to all forms of development that require planning permission.</p><p>  The Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and other Energy Infrastructure, published in July last year, recognises the need for and urgency of new energy infrastructure.  It notes that the planning process provides the necessary framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that consultation is built into the process.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued guidelines on wind energy development in 2006 and these are available on that Department's website.</p><p>  When carrying out forward planning and development management functions, planning authorities are required to have regard to guidelines issued by the Department.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for wind energy developments.  This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process, which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation.  In addition, the guidelines also provide advice on best practice with regard to public consultation in advance of the lodgement of a planning application for a wind energy development.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department, is undertaking a technical update of the guidance on certain aspects of the wind energy development guidelines and the advertisement on the consultation was in the newspapers yesterday.  The update is intended to ensure that the wind energy guidelines are supported by a robust and up-to-date evidence base on these issues and to support wind energy development in a manner that safeguards residential amenity, consistent with EU and national policy.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued a press notice in this regard yesterday.</p></reply>

I have spoken with people who live adjacent to turbines and I believe they cause many problems for the people concerned.  By its nature, a memorandum of understanding is a high-level document and does not go into detail.  People are keen to see an overall strategy in place and that detailed economic, social and job creation assessments are done with reference to the people living in the vicinity.  I read an article in which someone was quoted as referring to 400 workers.  Thee may indeed be 400 workers but it is possible that not one of those will come from the jobless list.  We need some social dividend clause in whatever is eventually agreed.</p><p>  Will we be doing more than simply an environmental impact assessment?  Will we do an economic assessment, a social assessment and an assessment of the impact on people living in the vicinity?   Will any of these assessments come to the Oireachtas committee before a final contract is signed?</p></speech>

Deputy Colreavy's concluding point specifically referred to the memorandum of understanding I signed last week with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.  I would be more than pleased to appear before the Oireachtas committee whenever the members wish to arrange it.</p><p>  I have stayed away from the jobs potential, but it is significant.  Some of the developers who are preparing projects and involved in the planning arrangements and the acquisition of land and so on have put figures on the jobs potential, but I am not keen to be dragged down that road nor do I wish to be dragged down the road of being partisan in terms of any particular developer.  Anyway, there is significant potential for jobs not least in the construction area and that is potentially significant.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy made a point about the economics of wind energy.  The answer cannot omit to take into account that as part of the thrust of the policy, which is to de-carbonise our energy systems, the build up of our renewable capacity is essential. If we are to meet our mandatory and ambitious targets for renewable energy, which aim for 40% generation by renewable energy sources by 2020, as agreed with EU member states, then we must build out our renewable capacity.  We are fortunate to have particularly propitious wind resources.  It is the exploitation of an indigenous resource that will create jobs on the island and create wealth and that is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

While we want, of course, to reduce the impact by increasing the use of renewable energy, we must ensure we get the best possible deal when we export energy to another nation.  It is in that context that the economic impact assessment comes in.  The economic impact of taking people off the unemployment queues must also be taken into account.  If that work is done with the greater involvement of the joint committee, decisions will be better informed.  It is also the case that if there is proper public consultation, particularly with people living in the vicinity of any installations, better planning and construction decisions will be made.</p></speech>

I have read some incredible nonsense since the memorandum of understanding was agreed.  Some of the commentary has been trite and uninformed.  Some of the commentary from outside the State has been very odd.  In fact, the deal has the potential to be a win-win for Britain and Ireland.  I am interested in what Ireland Inc. gets from the deal, whose potential in terms of jobs, exploitation of unique indigenous resources and wealth creation is significant.</p><p>  I cannot understand the commentary that the terms favour Britain.  There are no terms in the memorandum of understanding, which is facilitative of the significant projects that private developers have assembled.  They cannot trade with the neighbouring island unless that trade is facilitated by an intergovernmental agreement.  I do not know how people can purport to make the kinds of comment I have read on the economic terms when they are not there yet.  It is simply untrue to state that we will have wind turbines at every crossroads in Ireland.  That is not happening and will not happen.  I regret greatly that these things are being misrepresented.</p></speech>

I have no role or function in that regard.  EirGrid is the independent statutory body responsible for the development and maintenance of the national electricity transmission system.  As with any major complex project using purpose-built technology, the east-west interconnector requires comprehensive testing. <i></i>Tests during autumn 2012 highlighted certain issues relating to localised incidents of noise interference with telephone lines.  I understand from EirGrid that the company and its contractor co-operated with telecommunications network providers to address the reported telephone noise interference.  The commencement of commercial trading over the interconnector was deferred until such time as the localised issues were resolved.  I emphasise that the issue relates to noise on some telephone lines in the vicinity of the interconnector and is not a health concern.  Testing has confirmed that the interconnector is operating well within international standards on electric and magnetic fields.</p><p><br />  EirGrid has confirmed that the interconnector has been running continuously since 1 December 2012 following testing in an interim mode during November 2012.  Commercial trading and energy flows have been taking place since 21 December 2012 at a capacity of approximately 250 megawatts.  The development of a permanent solution by the contractor to allow the interconnector to operate at full capacity in its intended mode is under way and is expected to be implemented shortly.<font color="#004080"> </font> An outage may be required to implement the permanent solution.</p><p><br />  The east-west interconnector is a strategically vital energy project for the island of Ireland and is financially supported under the European Energy Programme for Recovery.  The interconnector has enhanced the security of the national energy supply and will increase energy market competition and facilitate the progressive development of renewable energy.</p></reply>

He then goes on to minimise the scale of the problems as they exist.  Contrary to the assertions in the Minister's answer, the east-west interconnector was commercially inoperable for three months after its official launch.  Since December, it has operated at approximately half its capacity.  In one of many similar instances, it fluctuated last night for approximately nine hours.  For a significant period of that nine hours, it was not operating at all.</p><p>  The primary cause of these issues is magnetic field emissions from the interconnector, which are causing harmonic interactions with local telecommunications.  I have still not got an answer to the question I am asking the Minister.  EirGrid made a submission in its environmental report in which it claimed that high-voltage direct current convertors create harmonics which can cause disruptions in telecommunications systems.  We know such disruptions have occurred.  EirGrid stated that specially designed DC filters are used to reduce and prevent disturbances.  I understand that a decision was made to omit these specially designed harmonic filters from the interconnector and that this is the cause of the problem.  I ask the Minister to confirm that and to tell the House who made the decision to omit the filters and when they did so.</p><p>  It is not the case that there may be outages.  EirGrid has advertised that between February and March the operation will be shut down for six weeks for works.  Can the Minister confirm that the works are to install the harmonic filters?</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that I was not trying to say anything.  Whatever I wanted to say, I said.  I am not trying to say anything and I am not trying to conceal anything.  There is nothing unusual about a complex technical project such as this requiring occasional maintenance for as long as it is operational.  The company responsible for entering into the contract with the companies that installed the system is engaged in discussions with them.  It is a contractual matter for EirGrid.  EirGrid has worked very well and co-operatively with Eircom on the localised interference with a small number of telephones.  It is a purely technical issue.  Whether it is a question of the installation of filters or something else, work has already been done to allow the interconnector to function at 250 megawatts.  The remaining remedial work will be done during the two- to three-week closure I have referred to.  After that, it will be a matter for EirGrid to rely on its contractual rights in raising the issues referred to by Deputy Clare Daly with the company or companies that actually did the installation work.</p></speech>

We are discussing a situation in which the interconnector will be shut down for four to six weeks.  It is wrong to claim that this is a question of a few technical matters.  We are discussing the fact that a multi-million-euro project has been delayed for six months to date, yet the Minister expects us to believe it is a only a matter of the usual technical issues.</p><p>  Works on the interconnector are not complete.  Compensation and bonuses were supposed to be paid.  Can the Minister confirm whether that has happened?  Can he answer the question I asked?  If EirGrid, for which the Minister is responsible, carried out the construction in the manner for which it sought permission and installed harmonic filters to minimise disruption, why do we have a disruption to telecommunications?  Is this the subject of the works that are being carried out?</p><p>If the Minister does not know the answer, does he not think he might want to find out given the very valid health concerns raised by residents along the way?</p></speech>

This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  I understand that as of the end of 2012, over 105,000 pay-as-you-go gas and electricity meters have been installed.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement. </p><p><br />  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised and only occur as a very last resort.

The energy regulator increased the prices even though it would have had evidence that disconnections were being doubled.  We need to look at its <i>modus operandi</i>.  Gas installation is another issue facing us.  Due to the economic downturn, people are unable to employ certified fitters and gas installers and are instead employing people with very little competence in the area.  We have had numerous discussions with the Commission for Energy Regulation which has not appreciated the urgency of the issue at hand.  Cowboys are doing work on gas installation, there seems to be a breakdown between the body regulating gas installers and the commission and nobody seems to be taking a hands-on approach regarding shoddy work being done.  We have seen the doubling of disconnections, and the decision by the energy regulator to award price increases must be questioned.  I do not think there is a genuine acceptance of the fuel poverty and the number of people who are not using their energy sources because of fuel poverty.</p></speech>

The problem is in the gas area.  The latest figures I have suggest that the increase is 64% year on year.  It is very difficult to get figures that strip out vacant houses and seasonal lets.  There is also an apparent tendency in some summer months to switch off gas.  None of these factors denies the Deputy's point about the fact that fuel poverty exists and that there are households under pressure.  This is why even though the number of pay-as-you-go meters has climbed, I would like to see them rise further.</p><p>  The protocol we have put in place requires that where a pay-as-you-go meter is installed or where a payment plan is entered into, there can be no disconnection.  Perhaps it ought to be better promoted.  Some people have not got the message.  A resort to the protocol would mean that any of the companies cannot wantonly disconnect gas supply and I hope to see more meters.</p></speech>

Every public representative has people coming into their offices who cannot pay their bills and are in negotiations with charity organisations to see if there is any help they can give them.  However, this only carries the issue on for another month or six weeks and the underlaying issue is not addressed.  Companies must step up to the mark and acknowledge that there is a serious problem with a certain group of people that they must tackle.  Rather than sending out aggressive people looking for money, they should send people who will negotiate on the behalf of the company and outline the plans.  Putting a protocol up on a website and national media does not really reach the targeted people.</p></speech>

These organisations include the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and State organisations like the money advice and budgeting service.

The company operates in accordance with the safety framework established by the CER, which has statutory responsibility for gas safety.  In addition, in accordance with section 39A of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, the CER has responsibility for the assessment of applications to construct transmission pipelines.  I have no function in these operational matters.  BGE owns and operates the national transmission and distribution gas network.  BGE and the CER have advised that all transmission pipelines, including those in residential areas, are designed, constructed, tested, operated and maintained in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003, the code of practice for gas transmission pipelines and pipeline installations.</p><p>  I understand that pipelines in suburban and urban areas are constructed using high grade steel pipe and are laid with a minimum depth of cover of 1.2 m throughout.  In some circumstances and over short sections, where existing major services are located and cannot be moved, it may not be possible to meet this depth of cover.  In these cases, additional pipeline protection measures, such as concrete impact protection, are put in place in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003.  Once commissioned, a scheduled routine maintenance and inspection programme is applied to all pipelines.  Urban streets often contain numerous different utilities in close proximity to each other, including gas, electricity, telecommunications, drainage and water.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 place the responsibility for identification and avoidance of existing infrastructure on the party carrying out the works.  BGE, in carrying out pipeline projects, always seeks to minimise the impact of the construction works on the existing infrastructure along the route.</p><p>  I understand the Deputy is referring to the Santry to East Wall gas pipeline.  In regard to that pipeline, the consent of the CER to BGE&rsquo;s undertaking of these works was informed by the advice of consultants engaged by the CER.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council would have expected it to be laid at a depth of 2 m.  Laying it at a depth of 1 m is detrimental to anyone coming afterwards to install infrastructure for water, drainage, telecommunications or electricity.  We are looking for trouble by putting this pipe at a depth of 1 m.  The city council is well aware of that but when the contractor for Bord G&aacute;is was asked why best practice was not being followed, the response was that there was insufficient money and "It's the economy, stupid".  The guidelines are not strict enough because everybody knows that where a spaghetti junction of services already exists, the new pipe has to be laid at a depth of 2 m so as to go under the existing infrastructure.  Rather than observing the industry's best practice, the work is being determined by costs.  This is going to put the safety of those who live near the pipe in danger.  It is all very well to speak about putting the pipe in place and covering it with whatever safety structures one likes, but it is nonsense to put a pipe of this size and pressure so close to the surface.</p></speech>

I am told by my technical people that the Deputy has experience of this area but the clear advice is that the project is being done to standard.  I cited the relevant standard and the code of practice for gas transmission pipelines and pipeline installation.  The standard requires infrastructure to be laid at a depth of 1.2 m and, where there are other utilities, additional reinforcing measures must also be installed.  This is the first time I have heard the phrase "It's the economy, stupid" in this regard.  As much of the work was completed during the boom, I cannot see how the economy would have been an issue.  I am not aware that Dublin City Council has challenged what I have said.  I would be happy to ask Bord G&aacute;is to meet the Deputy to discuss the matter.  It is not a matter of opinion.  If a standard has been established and is being complied with, that is the professional assessment.  Deputy Wallace may have a different assessment.  Let us hope it is never tested because neither of us want an accident to occur.  The advice I have received suggests that the work is done to the highest standard.</p></speech>

This second action plan reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This is equivalent to 31,925 GWh or a reduction in annual CO2  emissions of 7.7 Mt.  The actions outlined in the plan are projected to realise 34,060 GWh of energy savings in 2020, which is equivalent to a 21.1% saving on the baseline period and an overachievement of 1.1%.</p><p>  Energy efficiency is internationally recognised as one of the most cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This was confirmed in the National Economic and Social Council secretariat interim report, Towards a New National Climate Policy, which identified energy efficiency as a key route to carbon efficiency and a spur to economic growth.  Energy efficiency thus forms an integral element of the national climate change adaptation framework published in December 2012 and specifically the transition to a competitive low carbon economy which is being led by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The soon to be published heads of a climate Bill will direct the preparation of a national low carbon roadmap and sectoral roadmaps, as well as climate adaptation planning.</p><p>  The forthcoming national energy efficiency action plan will contain 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target.  We will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use.  We will institute a national energy performance contracting process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  This will be underpinned by an energy efficiency fund to which the Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 budget as seed capital.  We will introduce an appropriate pay-as-you-save model for Ireland to replace existing Exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures.  The better energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  A cross-departmental implementation group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this plan are delivered.  Should all the measures set out in the plan reach their full potential by 2020, it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion, at 2011 prices, will be realised.  A significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.</p><p>  The new energy efficiency directive sets out the policy roadmap for the period to 2020.  We face significant challenges in meeting our efficiency targets, not least of which is the finance necessary to underwrite the scale of retrofit required in our building stock.</p><p>My Department is prioritising work on the transposition of the new obligations in our national law so we can all reap the benefits of sustainable employment, growth and future investment.</p><p> The action plan and the programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a pay-as-you-save, PAYS, energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The PAYS scheme proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a comprehensive national energy efficiency scheme open to households and commercial operators.  This scheme will allow consumers to secure up-front financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.</p><p> I am pleased to report that my Department, with the assistance of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, has put a project team in place, staffed with a wide range of industry experts, to deliver a project design to Government in 2013 which will include technical, legislative and financial aspects of the design of a PAYS model in the Irish context.  The project team will be engaging widely with stakeholders as part of this development work, after which I will bring forward proposals to Government later this year.</p><p> In the interim, the Government has committed in excess of &euro;50 million in capital funding for the Better Energy programme in 2013, which will principally involve expenditure across the better energy homes, better energy warmer homes and better energy communities schemes.  These schemes are administered by the SEAI and further details are available on its website.  It is also my intention to establish urgently the energy efficiency fund, based on the &euro;35 million seed capital to which I referred earlier.  This funding, to be augmented by significant private sector financing, has the potential to finance significant additional retrofit works in both the public and the private sectors.  Urgent work is being progressed in consultation with other Departments and NewERA to progress this initiative.</p></reply>

Obviously, the plan must be very practical if it is going to deliver the savings.  The Minister is correct that a huge amount of money could be saved in terms of energy efficiency, including in the public service.</p><p>  Is the public sector energy efficiency working group meeting regularly and has it been delivering on the previous action plan?  I know there are some very good examples of best practice in place as a prototype in several different sections of the public service.  It is important there is more than a silo-based approach and that there is a cross-sectoral approach within the public service.</p><p>  The Minister said the retrofitting of buildings is limited by the amount of money that will underpin it.  While I accept this, is there any prospect of leveraging funds beyond national funds for such a scheme?  We have not only an obligation to meet targets at EU level because, if we do not achieve those targets, we will probably have a big demand on the Exchequer by virtue of the fact we will have to buy carbon credits.  With an eye to 2050, we need to be looking way beyond 2020 if we are going to meet the targets.</p></speech>

In fairness, the SEAI has essentially had that function and has been carrying it out very effectively.  The unit in my Department, to which I referred, has for some months been involved in intensive preparations in regard to transitioning from a grants-based scheme to this pay-as-you-save model.</p><p>  It is remarkable that the applications have fallen off, as I told the House on Question Time recently.  I presume it is a function of the recession to some extent as, even if people are getting a grant, they still have to put their hand in their pocket and put up some money.  Perhaps it is also that the people who are convinced of the energy efficiency measure have gone ahead and done the work.  While I cannot recall off the top of my head, I understand close to 100,000 homes have been upgraded, but getting the message through to the next sliver of the population is more difficult.</p><p>  Certainly, there is a necessity to be more energy efficient, to get down our imports and to improve the quality of our housing stock, as well as public buildings, and there is a lot of work in that.  Moreover, it is not just a question of the imperative of the energy efficiency argument but the job creation that is associated with it.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether we can raise money outside the State.  The idea behind the &euro;35 million which I secured in the last budget is that we will be able to get matching funding domestically from the private sector, bringing the fund to in excess of &euro;70 million.  We are in discussions with Europe, and the Commission and the Commissioner are interested in this issue.  A big limb of energy policy is energy efficiency, and the Commission is, of course, interested in looking at this across other member states, not just Ireland.  Therefore, the question Deputy Murphy raises is very much a current one in the sense that if we can get over domestic difficulties in respect of the GGB-GGD argument, which limits our spend because of the constraints and straitjacket we are now operating in, then it should be possible to leverage money in Europe, whether from the European Investment Bank or otherwise.</p></speech>

He did not give any indication as to timescale.  Is he referring to the &euro;35 million plus &euro;35 million and could he explain the timescale?  Has the Department or the SEAI quantified the overall level of work that is needed to maximise efficiency in both domestic and commercial buildings in this country?</p></speech>

Therefore, the scheme will have to be promulgated long in advance of that.  The significance of the figures of &euro;35 million and &euro;70 million the Deputy mentions is that we need to construct the funds so that more than 50% is from the private sector.  If we can, we have to contrive to keep the fund off the State's books because there are constraints on us in terms of the spending ceilings.  I understand the indications from the private sector are that there is a lot of work and many contracts in this and, therefore, it would be a productive investment by that sector.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy's question goes further and concerns whether we can go outside the State to augment that fund, and I believe there are definite possibilities in that regard.</p><p>The SEAI attic insulation grant has been very successful for senior citizens but it is flawed in that private home owners can get it but not council tenants.  Fuel poverty is a major concern for everybody here and pay-as-you-save is an excellent scheme but the local authority tenant should be able to access that scheme.  Has the Minister considered a way to allow these tenants access it?  Is there a target date for the implementation of pay-as-you-save?</p></speech>

Is there a problem in the way the scheme is designed?  Is it all or nothing?  Does this put off people who might be able to do it on an incremental basis?</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government does not work as well in this regard.  Deputy Humphreys is right, however, that the pay-as-you-save model will be aimed at home owners by definition because they are the ones who must go for the product in the belief that over a set period they will be able to pay for the works done from the savings in the bill.  It is a good concept.</p><p>  I do not think Deputy Murphy is right.  The existing scheme is broken down into different elements, one gets so much to do the attic or inject the walls.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is an expert on this.  He consults me frequently and there is not a home in east Galway that is not like a veritable nest, they are so warm.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is prohibitive.  Perhaps householders who are not purchasing elsewhere in the consumer economy are not doing this work.  That may be the bigger part of the explanation.  There is also a danger that those who are minded to take the energy efficiency argument on board and acknowledge that it makes their homes healthier, safer and warmer went and did it in the first flush of a few years and it is more difficult to get the message through to the remainder of the population.  Either way we are going to test the market.  That is why a great deal of effort is going into designing a product that will be attractive to the householder.</p><p>  The Deputy will have seen the announcement across the water last week about the green deal.  If the product is not attractive to the average householder there is no point boasting about its merits when the householder does not take it up.  I would also expect that the contractors who work in this area would be part of the sales process, that they would explain to people the merit of this, the significant savings in their energy bills at a time when energy bills are high because we are a net price taker.  We import the energy.  There is a great deal of work going into designing the product; however, you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.</p></speech>
