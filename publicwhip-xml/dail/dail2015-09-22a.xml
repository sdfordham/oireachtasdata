Is this going to be the pattern for the rest of this D&aacute;il, suppressing legitimate debate and basic accountability?  Why is there no normal Order of Business today?  Why can we not have an Order of Business?  Why must Leaders' Questions be pushed out to 7.35 p.m., with the Topical Issue debate and Oral Questions taken before them?  Why must the Taoiseach's questions be suspended?</p>  <p>  There is absolutely no accountability whatsoever today.  There is no reason not to have a normal Order of Business, Taoiseach's questions and Leaders' Questions immediately after the debate on the confidence motion.  Why can the Taoiseach not be here at 5.30 p.m. to answer questions that the leaders of other political parties, including me, put to him?  On the very first day back for the D&aacute;il, Leaders' Questions are being buried beyond the media cycle at approximately 7.50 p.m. with no rational explanation.</p>  <p>  We have written to the Government Whip, but he has not responded or contacted our Whip in any substantive way.

Also, Members were only handed this, or I was anyway, ten minutes before coming to the Chamber.  The decision by the Government to introduce a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach is no great surprise.  While that is fair enough, if Members have learned anything on these benches over the past four years it is about the arrogance and disrespect with which the Government treats the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il in particular.  The absence of the Taoiseach today is yet one more example of that.  The motion of confidence was predictable but the decision to abandon Taoiseach's questions was not.  Members should remember it has been two months since the D&aacute;il met and consequently they should have been given an opportunity to discuss issues of importance.  There is an ongoing crisis in the North at present.  I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but could I have the Chief Whip's attention?</p></speech>

All Members of the D&aacute;il, Government and Opposition, should have the opportunity, four and a half years into the Government's term, to give their verdict, on reflection, in relation to the critical issues facing us.  Therefore, I propose that the debate continue into tomorrow.  It should be extended by at least another three hours, and preferably more than that.</p>  <p>  We have a Government that is presiding over the worst homelessness crisis in the history of this State.  There are more than a thousand children in hotels, hostels and utterly inappropriate accommodation, now exhibiting all kinds of psychological and emotional ill-effects.  There are 130,000 families nationally on the local authority waiting list.  Even in the dismal 1970s, right-wing Governments built up to 8,500 local authority houses per year to meet a crisis, as compared with a few hundred per year at present.  We have a Government that seems totally oblivious to this.  We have a mass revolt of our people against the latest infliction of austerity in the form of water charges, with a huge majority saying clearly to the Government that they will not pay and that they want that charge abolished, but the Government will not listen.  These are only some of the issues that Members of this D&aacute;il need time to reflect on.  There are other serious issues, as well as the economic diagnosis.  I have made a serious diagnosis: I believe the Labour Party is suffering from an acute case of mass delusional psychosis in a political sense.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200009#H00300"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann welcomes the publication of the Interim Report of the Fennelly Commission and notes its conclusions and reaffirms its confidence in the Taoiseach, in the Attorney General and in the Government.</blockquote><p>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the interim report of the commission of investigation which is being chaired by Mr. Justice Fennelly, a retired judge of the Supreme Court.</p><p>The Fennelly Commission, which was established on my recommendation on 25 March 2014, is part of broad and comprehensive approach which the Government has taken to ensure that matters of very significant public concern related to the administration of policing and justice are thoroughly addressed.  These include the most wide-ranging reforms of the policing and justice system since the foundation of the State, as well as robust actions taken to investigate certain allegations.  No similar series of reports has ever been more thorough, or published more quickly.  No programme of reform of policing and justice has ever been more radical, or more necessary.  The reform programme includes the establishment of a new independent policing authority; the provision of enhanced powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, including enabling it to deal with and investigate complaints from serving garda&iacute;; and the passing of groundbreaking new legislation to protect whistleblowers, including to allow serving garda&iacute; to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence.</p> <p> The decision to establish an independent policing authority, which was taken by the Government on 25 March 2014, represents the most radical reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.  It brings a dedicated layer of public oversight to the administration of policing services and provides a new engine to drive reforms to ensure that the force is fit to meet the challenges of 21st century policing.</p> <p> As well as implementing wide-ranging reforms, a number of independent inquiries were established by this Government to investigate serious matters of public concern.  Judge Cooke was appointed to investigate allegations that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was the subject of unlawful surveillance.  His report was published in June 2014.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC was appointed to investigate allegations made by Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe about crime investigations in the Cavan-Monaghan district.  His report was published in May 2014.  His recommendation that a commission of investigation be established to investigate further certain matters has been acted on.  In 2014, the Government commissioned the Toland report, which was prepared by a group of distinguished independent experts.  That report identified a number of deficiencies in the structure, management and operation of the Department of Justice and Equality.  On foot of its recommendations, a programme for change and a new strategy statement for the Department have been finalised and are now being implemented.  When these reforms are fully implemented across the policing and justice system, I am confident that the reporting and communications failures that are identified in this interim report will not be repeated in the future.</p> <p> The interim report of the Fennelly commission deals with two specific issues which the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence unanimously requested be included in its terms of reference and reported on in advance of the main report.  The first concerns the furnishing to the Minister for Justice and Equality of a letter dated 10 March 2014 from the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The second concerns the sequence of events leading to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner on 25 March 2014.  These issues are, of course, closely interlinked.  In particular, the failure to furnish the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s letter of 10 March 2014 about the taping of telephone calls in Garda stations to the Minister for Justice and Equality had a very significant impact on subsequent events.  This was greatly compounded by the fact that neither the Minister nor I were informed of the letter&rsquo;s existence when considering the matter on 24 March.</p> <p> I repeatedly rejected claims that the report would not be published when I received it, or that I would somehow attempt to delay publication until after the forthcoming general election.</p></speech>

These need to be studied further, and Mr. Justice Fennelly's observations need to be acted upon in the spirit in which he has presented them in his report.</p>  <p>  It should be recalled that in the weeks leading up to the then Garda Commissioner's decision to retire, the justice system, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular, was engulfed in a series of controversies.  The allegations made by Garda whistleblowers, and the handling of these allegations by the Garda authorities, had been causing deep public concern for some time.  In addition, relations between the Garda and its oversight and accountability body, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, had deteriorated significantly.</p>  <p>  Twelve days prior to Mr. Callinan's decision to retire, the Garda Inspectorate published a report on the penalty points controversy that was widely interpreted as vindicating the complaints of the whistleblowers.  This reignited the issue of the former Commissioner's treatment of these whistleblowers, and particularly his use of the term "disgusting" in reference to them at the Committee of Public Accounts.  From Thursday, 20 March, a number of Ministers called on the then Commissioner to withdraw or clarify his remark.  Throughout this period, I strongly defended the then Commissioner, consistently and without qualification, including in Washington on 13 March and again in Brussels on 21 March, when I called on Ministers not to publicly comment about the then Commissioner in advance of the Cabinet meeting to be held on Tuesday, 25 March.  There was significant media commentary on these controversies and much speculation as to whether the then Commissioner would issue an apology or clarification for his remarks.</p>  <p>  It was against this backdrop that on Sunday, 23 March, I was informed by the Attorney General for the first time of the serious issue of widespread recording of telephone conversations in Garda stations throughout the country.  The Attorney General was deeply concerned at the revelations and it was clear that I, as Taoiseach, with responsibility for notifying the Cabinet of sensitive legal cases, would have to bring this new information to their attention and that it would form part of the discussion on the other ongoing controversies at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, 25 March.  My purpose in calling the meeting on the evening of Monday, 24 March, was to gather as much information as possible on the taping issue in advance of the following morning's Cabinet meeting so that I could fully inform the Government of this latest revelation, particularly as it related to the Bailey case arising from the du Plantier murder.</p>  <p>  What is deeply regrettable, and very significant, is that neither I nor the then Minister for Justice and Equality was made aware of the existence of a formal letter from the then Commissioner on the taping issue which had been sent to the Department of Justice and Equality.  While the interim report criticises the delay in submitting this letter on a matter of such significance, it had been in the Department of Justice and Equality for two weeks at this stage, with a legal requirement that it be brought to the attention of the then Minister.  Clearly, had this letter been brought to his attention or to my attention on the night of Monday, 24 March-----</p></speech>

These include the operation of telephone recording systems to record calls to and from large numbers of Garda stations over many years, the specific implications of the taping related to the Garda investigation into the death of Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier in County Cork in December 1996 and related matters, and how these matters were dealt with by the responsible authorities.  The very detailed terms of reference approved by the House last year addressed such concerns as which Garda stations were involved, how the taping systems were operated, what use, if any, was made of the information obtained by the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, whether any of it was destroyed and whether the taping was lawful.  I look forward to Justice Fennelly's main report, which will deal with all these very serious issues.  I will publish the report when it is received, in accordance with the law.</p> <p> The motion of confidence also gives the House the opportunity to debate the merits of those who will put themselves before the electorate in early 2016.</p></speech>

We owe the Garda a great deal.  The force has been essential to the stability of this State and the preservation of security through some extremely turbulent times.  Members of the force have lost their lives in the process.  The difficult and dangerous job that members face must never be forgotten.  The Garda has rightly long enjoyed the trust and respect of the overwhelming majority of citizens.  The Cabinet met on March 25 last year amid a number of controversies that had beset the force and - I can say - were doing no favours to it.  These controversies were threatening to erode the widely held trust and respect in the force.  The Government did not want to see such a situation materialise.  At the meeting, the Cabinet was briefed on an additional issue that had emerged, namely, the taping system in place at a large number of Garda stations.  Faced with these serious matters, the Cabinet took a number of decisions.  We agreed to establish a commission of investigation.  We agreed to accept the retirement of Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan.  Crucially, we reiterated our commitment to extensive reform of policing in this State through the establishment of an independent policing authority.  In politics, Governments are frequently accused of failing to act on issues.  This was the precise opposite: the Government took decisive action to have serious concerns investigated and serious reforms initiated.  I stand by those decisions.</p>  <p>  I have full confidence in the Taoiseach and I have full confidence in the Attorney General, who was central to ensuring the concerns around the force would be investigated fully and appropriately.  The Fennelly commission was subsequently established and tasked with investigating, among other things, the taping system and its origins and legality or otherwise; the recordings and events linked to the investigation into the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier; the furnishing to the then Minister for Justice and Equality of a letter that had been sent by former Commissioner Callinan to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality; and the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of Mr. Callinan.  We now have the interim report of Mr. Justice Fennelly.  I welcome that report, which deals with the issue of the letter and the retirement of the Garda Commissioner.  As the report notes and I have mentioned, a number of other events that occurred in the period preceding the former Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s retirement, including the treatment of whistleblowers, embroiled the force in public controversy.  The report makes it clear that the ultimate decision to retire lay with the then Garda Commissioner and that no directive was issued by the Taoiseach to Mr. Callinan.  It is also clear from the report that Mr. Callinan dealt with the circumstances of his retirement in an extremely dignified fashion.  It is clear that the Attorney General did her job, first, by ensuring potentially vital evidence in a matter of serious public concern was not destroyed and, second, by bringing her concerns rightly to the Taoiseach for onward submission to the Government.</p><p>Now, the Opposition would have it that somehow all of this amounted to some massive overreaction by the Government.</p></speech>

First, had we not established a commission of investigation into these matters the Government would rightly stand accused, particularly by the people gracing the Opposition benches.  I think everybody knows that.  The Members know that themselves but we established the commission and we ensured these matters would be fully and appropriately investigated.  Second, the investigation into the wider matter of the taping system is continuing and has not yet concluded.  Anybody attempting to down play that particular issue to score points against the Government is prejudging Mr. Justice Fennelly's independent work.</p>  <p>  I remain clear in my view that these were matters of significant public concern and merited investigation, and I challenge anybody on the Opposition benches to say otherwise.  In terms of process, Mr. Justice Fennelly's interim report identifies a series of deficiencies that require careful consideration.  In that respect, its findings are in keeping with the report of the independent review group on the Department of Justice and Equality, chaired by Mr. Toland, which examined the performance, management and administration of the Department.  It is important to note that a series of actions are being taken to implement the recommendations of the review group report which will address deficiencies also identified by the commission.  </p>  <p>  The Government has already acted on what, in my view, is potentially the most important policing reform in many years.  In keeping with long-standing Labour Party policy, the Government is establishing an independent policing authority to provide public oversight of policing services.  The new authority will be able to demand reports and information and will hold regular public meetings with the Garda Commissioner and with senior Garda management.  At these meetings the leadership of the Garda force will be required to account for their policies and priorities in an open and transparent forum.  I believe this is a very positive development for the Garda because it will help ensure that trust and respect for the force is maintained and preserved.  The policing authority is a fundamental, critical reform and the Government will not be found wanting if further reforms are necessary.  In the same vein, the Government is delivering additional investment in the force to ensure it has the resources it needs, with more recruits and more vehicles coming on line and a commitment to invest in a significant update of its IT platforms.  Indeed, I was delighted, only a few weeks ago, to attend the latest passing out ceremony in Templemore, a place that was shut down for recruitment purposes by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in 2009.  </p>  <p>  The track record of this Government has been one of delivery.</p><p>We have delivered a successful turnaround from the worst economic crisis this country has ever known and we are now working to cement the economic recovery and drive social renewal.  Slowly but surely - too slowly for many of us - we can see signs of recovery and renewal.  We have one of the fastest growth rates, if not the fastest growth rate, in the European Union.  More important, however, 1,300 new jobs are being created every week, international investment is choosing Ireland, consumer confidence is increasing and, very significantly, two in every three people believe the country is on the right economic track.</p></speech>

A new, improved and enhanced apprenticeship system will drive opportunities for young people alongside places for people who wish to go to college.  A budget will be published next month which will raise living standards for a second year in a row, helping low and middle income workers, families, retired people and the vulnerable.  We have provided for free general practitioner care for children aged under six years and people aged over 70 years, new schools across the country and a record &euro;3.8 billion social housing programme over the next few years.  We have also introduced marriage equality and new gender recognition laws.</p>  <p>  After harrowing and extremely difficult times for many people and businesses, including the loss of 330,000 jobs when the crisis caused by the bank guarantee unfolded, Ireland has made great progress in recent years.  As a country, we now stand at a moment of great potential and we need to seize this potential for all the people in this country to provide a real recovery dividend that is felt across society not only in business, education and the community, but also in areas such as culture.</p>  <p>  Most of the time, I see on the Opposition benches only parties and politicians who either ran this country down or talked it down.  </p></speech>

Through nearly every Department, it actively works to hide information and reject accountability.  It is so obsessed with trying to sell a fairy tale of decisive leadership that it has no time to recognise, let alone address, the enormous and entirely avoidable crises that have emerged during its term.  The withholding of information, twisting of statistics and refusal to answer questions has reached unprecedented levels, and this constant refusal to be open and honest with the people reached new depths in the Taoiseach's behaviour during and after the events investigated by Mr. Justice Fennelly.  The report is damning and the facts that it details are much worse than anything alleged in the House.  It is a mark of how low Fine Gael and the Labour Party have now sunk that they claim as vindication a report that shows chaos at the centre of the Government and a Taoiseach incapable of owning up to the implications of his own actions.  To them, accountability is merely something you demand of other people.</p><p>This debate has been stage-managed to avoid any hard questions yet again and to provide a platform for the Government's ridiculous self-praise and empty politics.  Not one member of the Government is capable of accepting the unequivocal evidence that the Taoiseach's actions on 24 March 2015 represented the effective sacking of the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is not some minor and insignificant issue.  The departure of the head of an independent police force due to pressure from the head of the Government and an attempt to hide this pressure would be a major scandal in any democratic society.  What the Fennelly report shows is a Taoiseach who panicked when he heard from the Attorney General about a serious issue.  He reached conclusions without hearing all the evidence and has since then tried to hide, twist, turn and then deny the impact of his own actions.  The Taoiseach did not even ring the Garda Commissioner to find out the full facts.  The Taoiseach did not even ring his Minister for Justice and Equality the day the Attorney General came in.  It is a fact that not one single piece of information concerning the events that led to the effective sacking of the Garda Commissioner was volunteered by the Taoiseach.  Everything was dragged out of him.  On the day of the Commissioner's departure, the Taoiseach informed the Opposition of the event two hours after it had appeared in the media.  He then came into the House and praised himself for being so open and attacked me for asking for more information.  He only confirmed that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality was sent with a message to the Commissioner's house when I asked him a direct question on it the following day.  Then, of course, he went on the attack again, saying it was beneath me to suggest that there was anything more to the story.  The Taoiseach refused to answer detailed questions or to have any debate after which he or any Minister would answer questions.  He has steadfastly refused to answer questions on this for 18 months and his only objective is to bury it as quickly as he possibly can.  What the Fennelly report has shown is that there was a lot more that was being withheld from the D&aacute;il and from the Irish people.</p><p>As has been said, because of how this debate has been structured by the Government, there is nowhere near enough time to go through the full range of damning evidence contained in the report.  However, the basic facts concerning the Taoiseach's behaviour during and after the main events are not complicated, and show that only the most partisan of hacks could believe his spin.  The concerns raised by the Attorney General were serious and worth addressing immediately.  What they did not warrant was the rush to judgment and scapegoating that the Taoiseach then engaged in.  It is quite extraordinary that the Taoiseach did not contact the Minister for Justice and Equality after the Attorney General spoke to him.  He was, after all, the line Minister responsible for justice matters.  The Taoiseach admits that he had grave concerns, that these focused on the actions of garda&iacute; and that he felt they merited an unprecedented late-night visit to the Garda Commissioner by a senior civil servant.  He also admits that he decided that the Commissioner was to be given no opportunity to defend himself.  What is shocking about this is that it was based on the entirely false belief on the Taoiseach's part that the Commissioner had failed to inform the Government of the discovery of potentially illegal taping in Garda stations.  The report shows that the Commissioner had fully discharged his responsibility to bring the issue to the attention of both the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality - in the case of the Attorney General, four months in advance of that March date.  The reason the Taoiseach rushed to judgment and denied the man a right to be heard was that, as always, he was putting politics first.  He wanted it dealt with before Cabinet so he could stop political problems and defend the Minister and Attorney General whom he had appointed.  It is striking that he has not had the decency to admit that he should have heard all the evidence before rushing to judgment.  He has not been able to admit any error or express any regret.</p><p>If one goes beyond the fact that the Commissioner was pushed out on the basis of incomplete and incorrect assumptions, there is also the matter of the Taoiseach's lack of honesty in refusing to admit the clear and obvious implications of a course of action for which he alone was responsible.  The Government has put everything into spinning one line concerning his intent.  It is as shallow a defence as it is cynical.  Four people - the then holders of the offices of T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Justice and Equality, Secretary General of the Government and Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality - knew about the Taoiseach's actions, and all disagree with his version.  They reject the Taoiseach's claim that he had no idea that he might be forcing the Commissioner to resign.  It is a well established legal principle that it is extremely hard to prove intent in the absence of recorded evidence.  In this case, the Taoiseach says he had no intention of forcing the Commissioner out.  Even those naive or blinkered enough to accept this face the reality that others believed his intention was to force the Commissioner out and that the Commissioner was in no doubt that he felt he was being forced out.  More importantly, Mr. Justice Fennelly himself says that, irrespective of what the Taoiseach believed, the reasonable interpretation was that the Taoiseach wanted the Commissioner gone and the actions he ordered achieved that intended outcome.  Everyone else thought he was telling the Commissioner to go.  The Commissioner thought - he was under no illusions - he was telling him to go and no alternative option was suggested.  However, the Taoiseach is incapable of admitting this.</p><p>The fact that the Taoiseach had to be questioned more than once and that his answers evolved significantly is unmissable.  So too is another piece of information that the Taoiseach withheld from the D&aacute;il and the public - that he demanded that the resignation be effective immediately rather than taking place some months later.  The report outlines how the Taoiseach had a sleepless night before he decided not to agree to the former Commissioner's request to stay in position for another two to three months, yet he also said he was very surprised when he was told of the resignation of the Commissioner.  The argument that delaying the resignation was legally impossible is nonsense.  This happens all the time in the Irish public service.  Announcing in advance that one will retire early is standard practice.  In fact, the Government is currently deciding who to appoint as President of the High Court as the incumbent has announced that he will retire early at the end of the year.  What makes this scandal more squalid is that the Labour Party and Fine Gael have reached a deal to support each other in order to protect their own.  Nothing else explains how Labour refuses to say anything or how Fine Gael is leaving the Attorney General untouched.  The Attorney General is an honourable person and it is a pity that she has failed to do the honourable thing and be accountable for her part in this affair.  The fact is that her office was aware of the issue of the tapes four months before the events of March last year.  She did not have or present the full information to the Taoiseach and contributed to the unprecedented forced departure of the Garda Commissioner.  Yet we have a situation in which it is obvious that the Labour Party is supporting the Taoiseach as a <i>quid pro quo</i>to ensure the Attorney General remains in place.</p><p>In recent days, Ministers have been sent out to say that the report mainly shows problems in the Department of Justice and Equality.  This is desperate and cynical in equal measure.  The panic was not in the Department of Justice and Equality; it was in the Taoiseach's own office.  The only person not clear about the intent to force out the Commissioner appears to have been the Taoiseach himself.  This is not credible, and deep down everyone in this House knows it.  The report states that one of the biggest issues is the lack of any record - of any type - of either the discussions in the Taoiseach's office or the decisions reached.</p><p>The Taoiseach will remember well that it took him nearly four years to withdraw a slur against his predecessor about destroying records of a decision when, in fact, 140 documents and everything had been retained.  He even self-righteously said: &quot;If the Taoiseach of the day meets a group from [a] constituency, [you] can be sure that whatever it is about, notes will be taken and be there for posterity.&quot;<br/><br/>If this report were anything other than damning of the Taoiseach, he would not have put so much effort into manipulating coverage of its launch and contents.  The report was made available to media and Members of this House at 5.40 p.m. on 1 September.  However, media outlets were reporting for hours beforehand that the Taoiseach had been &quot;vindicated&quot;.  The only interview the Taoiseach has done on the report was on &quot;Six One News&quot;, and this was before any journalist had been given time to read it.  To date, he has refused a debate on the report, refused to answer questions, refused to publish the transcript of his appearances before Mr. Justice Fennelly, refused even to acknowledge the disturbing evidence of a panicked and politically driven atmosphere.  The Government can spin all it wants; this report shows a deeply dishonest approach.  It shows an inability to tell the blindingly obvious truth.  It shows a willingness to put politics first and to search for a scapegoat when trouble appears.<br/><br/>We should remember that the root cause of the panicked atmosphere in the Taoiseach's office on those two days in March last year is that he had repeatedly stood by as the justice system was dragged into crisis after crisis.  He dismissed urgent issues as they were raised here and in the media.  He offered a blanket defence, particularly of his loyal Minister who was at the centre of the chaos.  Reaching a situation where a Garda Commissioner was effectively fired on the basis of false assumptions about his failure to act was not an accident.  It was the inevitable outcome of how the Taoiseach runs this Government.  Whenever an issue emerges, the Taoiseach's first reaction is to deny that there is any problem.  He then tells us what a great job his Government is doing.  Finally, he just attacks whoever is raising that question.<br/><br/>What makes this serious is that crisis after crisis is allowed to emerge while the Taoiseach and his Ministers carry on their obsession with political spin.  In housing, homelessness, crime, hospital waiting lists, Northern Ireland, mortgage debt, unfair contracts, child care, Irish Water and many other issues, problems have been allowed to escalate until they reach crisis level.  This is the direct and inevitable outcome of a Government that, from day one, has put politics first in everything.  In this debate, we have already heard the greatest fairy tale of all, that of a strong leader lifting his country out of recession.  He came to office driven by such a sense of urgency that he did not prepare a budget for nine months, published no new economic plans and only showed energy when breaking the many, many promises he had made in order to win votes.  We all remember the promises that the Taoiseach made on the Roscommon emergency department, including the one he denied making until a journalist produced a tape.  This type of shiftiness has not gone away.  In fact, it has got much worse over the past four and a half years.<br/><br/>The Fennelly report is yet another inquiry report that has been buried in a political snow job in order to protect an arrogant Taoiseach and Government incapable of admitting error.  It appropriately bookends his Government's term.  It started by ignoring Moriarty and will end by ignoring Fennelly.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach's affection for overblown rhetoric is long established, but it is wrong to let this distract from the claims he makes on his own behalf and on behalf of his Government.  In his first speech as Taoiseach, he stood up in this House, accepted the good wishes of all and said:</p><blockquote>... today I enter into a covenant with the Irish people... honesty is not alone our best policy but our only policy.  The new Government will tell the people the truth regardless of how unwelcome or difficult that might be.  We will tell it constantly and unreservedly.</blockquote><p>The Taoiseach's basic inability to admit the obvious truth, his attempt politically to spin his way out of accountability and his dismissal of something as serious as the effective firing of the Garda Commissioner due to false and incomplete assumptions mean that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has the right and obligation to vote no confidence in him.</p></speech>

The new Government had the chance and, in particular, the support of the majority of citizens in making a new beginning.  Ach mar a d'fhoghlaim muintir an St&aacute;it seo go daor - n&iacute;or tharla arthr&uacute; ar bith.  This is clear in the scandal surrounding the departure of the former Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  Although the Fennelly report deals with a number of issues relating to the crisis within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a damning indictment of the Attorney General, the most controversial aspect of the investigation is whether the Taoiseach sacked former Garda Commissioner Callinan.  This is a serious allegation.  The Taoiseach has always denied sacking him.  Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the power to remove the Commissioner from his or her position can only be exercised by the Cabinet.  For the Taoiseach to act alone would undoubtedly be an abuse of power.  It would also be unlawful.  Mr. Callinan stepped down just hours after a late night visit ordered by An Taoiseach to his home by the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell.  We now know that this visit was the "immediate catalyst" for the Commissioner's resignation.  The Taoiseach, in sending Mr. Purcell against Mr. Purcell's best instincts to Mr. Callinan's home, in effect sacked the Commissioner.  The commission found that the visit of Mr. Purcell to the Commissioner's home was "an event without precedent".  It concluded: "when all circumstances are viewed objectively, the mission on which Mr Purcell was being sent was liable to be interpreted as suggesting to the Commissioner that he should consider his position."  It is accepted by the commission that Mr. Purcell explained to the Commissioner that the Taoiseach may not have been in a position to be able to express confidence in the Commissioner following the next day's Cabinet meeting.  The T&aacute;naiste of the day, Deputy Gilmore, stated that the Taoiseach told him that this was his position.  The Taoiseach denies this.</p>  <p>  The Fennelly commission also accepted that Commissioner Callinan had "no option but to retire".  Although the commission report states that the decision to retire was still the Commissioner's to make, "the Commissioner was not wrong to arrive at the conclusion that he was expected to consider his position".  The visit of Mr. Purcell is described by the commission as the "immediate catalyst" and "direct cause" for the Garda Commissioner's decision to retire.  The interim report tells of how the Taoiseach refused to allow the Commissioner time to clear his desk, as the latter had requested.  The Taoiseach demanded that he go immediately.</p>  <p>  When the Government published the report recently but before we and journalists had sight of it, the Taoiseach was doing interviews on this issue with journalists who had not read about what he was discussing.  It was a classic case of media management.  Is this the transparent government that Fine Gael and Labour promised?  Is this the end of the old-style politics, which they were mandated to do?</p>  <p>  The dubious actions of the Taoiseach and his inner circle in the events leading to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner leads to unavoidable comparisons with the Fianna F&aacute;il style of government.  Let us be clear, in that Sinn F&eacute;in would not have objected or complained had the Taoiseach gone to the Cabinet and moved a motion seeking the Garda Commissioner's resignation, given the months of scandals and revelations leading up to the actual retirement.  This would be the view of the majority of citizens.  That is what the Taoiseach should have done.  He should have given the Commissioner the opportunity to give his side of the story.  He should have consulted the Minister for Justice and Equality, but he did none of these things.  He was not straight with the Commissioner or the Minister.  That is my main point.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach carried this lack of straightness into his remarks today.</p><p>He has yet to tell Members how many times he was interviewed by the Fennelly commission.  Most of what has been revealed to the Fennelly commission was not reported to the D&aacute;il.  Most of what Members have learned was not learned here, where they are supposed to keep the Government accountable, but through reading this interim report.  On this basis alone, Sinn F&eacute;in has no confidence in An Taoiseach or the Attorney General.</p> <p> However, it also has no confidence in the Government because the Taoiseach has made it clear repeatedly that he remains ideologically wedded to a destructive austerity agenda that is doing much damage to society when what is needed is a complete change in political direction.  This society now faces a choice and the fundamental ideological difference between Sinn F&eacute;in and the deeply unpopular Government is that Sinn F&eacute;in believes in a real republic and a citizen-centred rights-based society.</p> <p> The Government's budgets have been among the most regressive in the State's history.  Society has become increasingly polarised under Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  One third of children now live in consistent poverty.  The crises in housing and health have escalated to an alarming degree.  The disastrous economic policies initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party have seen more than &euro;30 billion taken out of the economy in taxes and cuts.</p> <p> Moreover, the Government's mantra that we are all in this together is a monstrous untruth.  Many citizens have suffered greatly, while those who were protected again are first in line to benefit under the Government.  Those being forced to pay the price for Government policies are families on lower and middle incomes.  Those paying the price are families who have been impoverished by the family home tax, the universal social charge and water charges.</p> <p> The Government, like others before it, has embraced forced emigration as a policy.  Half a million people, with huge damage societally to communities and families, have been forced to emigrate since 2008.</p></speech>

Those paying for the Government's policies include lone parents and others who have had their child benefit and back-to-school allowances slashed.</p><p>The folks in government sat around the Cabinet and took these decisions.  They took decisions to remove discretionary medical cards from thousands of seriously ill and disabled children and adults.  Collectively, the Government took the decision.  Sick people were forced to go without medicine because the Cabinet decided to introduce prescription charges, despite promises not to so do.  The Cabinet decided to cut home help hours, the mobility grant and annual respite care grants.  The Cabinet took these decisions.  As for public hospitals, one in eight people on a waiting list is in a queue for more than a year and in January 2015, there were 600 patients on trolleys.  These people are paying the price for the Government's policies.  Some people must wait for four years before seeing a consultant.  There are 90,000 families on the social housing waiting list and 104,693 households are in mortgage arrears.  Under the present Government, legal proceedings to repossess homes have increased tenfold.  Rents still are increasing and the number of homeless children continues to rise.</p><p>All these people, these citizens, these unfortunates, live in the best small country in the world in which to do business, but who did the Taoiseach protect?  What did Fine Gael and the Labour Party do and whom did they look after?  They certainly protected the property developers.  NAMA has been allowed to pay developers' salaries of &euro;200,000 a year while the Government has taken medical cards from children.  The Government protected bondholders and billions have been paid to international junior and senior bondholders who gambled on unstable banks while the Government broke its social bond with the people.  The Government protected the vulture capitalists and billions of euro worth of Irish assets are being subjected to a fire sale while the citizens pick up the losses.  The Government protects the tiny wealthy elites in the State.  Wealth tax and tax relief loopholes have been allowed to continue.  The Minister for Finance refuses to come to the D&aacute;il to account for the sell-off of NAMA's Northern loan book or to answer questions about insider dealings.  No, why should he?  Why should he be accountable here?</p><p>The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are about protecting the elites, the golden circles and the insiders.  In budget 2015, instead of easing the burden on those who have suffered the most over the past four years, Fine Gael and the Labour Party prioritised helping the richest 10%.  They protected the banks.  A total of &euro;64 billion of the public's money was pumped into the banks and then bank managers were allowed to pay themselves &euro;800,000 a year while they kept mortgage interest rates high and threatened families with eviction.  The Government objectively has failed to get a resolution to the problem of legacy debt.  Instead, the Taoiseach stated he will not have &quot;defaulter&quot; stamped on his forehead.  He refused even to try to face up to the elites in the European Union.</p><p>Moreover, just like Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party continued political appointments to State boards and failed to act on the high salaries for politicians, in banking or on State boards.  The Government's high regard for the arts was clear from the manner in which it appointed one of its own, John McNulty, to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  It has ignored the demands of hundreds of thousands of citizens who have taken to the streets repeatedly to demand that it scrap domestic water charges.  The Government's first launch of the commemoration of 1916 was an embarrassment.  It was a joke but it also was an accurate insight into the attitude of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to the Rising, to its leaders and, more particularly, to the Proclamation of 1916.</p><p>As for the peace process, the most significant political development on this island since partition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have failed to act as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  Instead, to their shame, they have sought to use the peace process to attack Sinn F&eacute;in and the Government has acquiesced continually in the approach of the British Tory Government.  The Taoiseach has failed miserably to press the British on legacy issues such as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Pat Finucane inquiry.  While the Taoiseach might mention it for the record at a meeting, he has no consistent strategic engagement with the British on all these issues.  Most recently, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader played politics with the brutal murders of two men in Belfast.  The Taoiseach tried to pressurise the SDLP into supporting the adjournment of the Assembly while the Fianna F&aacute;il leader went further and called for the suspension of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement, an agreement his party played an honourable role in bringing about.  Time and again I have asked the Taoiseach to make the North a priority and he has refused to do so.</p><p>The Taoiseach assumed office with a promise of a democratic revolution as he is aware that is what the people want.  The rhetoric rings true and those who write the Taoiseach's script are aware there is an urgency and a desire among people for fundamental change.  However, he has proved to be as adept as his Fianna F&aacute;il predecessors in practising unaccountable Government and stroke politics.  Irish Water now is a byword for unaccountability, the scandalous waste of public money and insider politics.  The Government has characterised the forthcoming elections as a choice between stability and chaos, but there is no stability for low-paid workers, those on zero-hour contracts, and patients and front-line workers facing chaos in hospital accident and emergency departments.  There is no stability for families facing the prospect of losing their homes because the Government will not put manners on the banks.  It is easy to put manners on the poor but the Government will not put manners on the elites.  The Taoiseach's idea of stability is different from that of most citizens.  His idea of stability is the maintenance of a deeply unequal<i>status quo</i>and that is not the stability the people need or want.  The people seek change and if the Taoiseach really believes, for once, what he says, he should go to the people and let them have their day.  He should resign now and let the people govern.  The Taoiseach should call a general election now.</p></speech>

I believe Mr. Justice Fennelly did a very thorough job, which must have been very difficult for him given his finding that senior people in government appeared at certain times to be contradicting each other 100%.  I am sure that reading over the report of his investigation caused him to laugh a little because he would have known that there was no way he could have made any of it up.  </p>  <p>  Why in God's name if the Taoiseach wanted more information on Sunday, 23rd and Monday, 24th did he not contact the Garda Commissioner and ask him in for a chat?  The Attorney General appears to have taken the same position as the Taoiseach.  She said that the people in possession of all the information about the circumstances were An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Why, if the Garda Commissioner was the person who had all the information, did the Attorney General not contact him?  It is blatantly obvious that former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was sidelined.  Leaving aside that the Taoiseach did not reply to his text at Sunday lunchtime, he made only one attempt to telephone him and left it at that.  Deputy Shatter was not asked to attend the meeting on Sunday night and was not even notified that he might be called on Monday evening.  It does not stack up.</p>  <p>  I find it hard to credit that the Taoiseach did not want to put some pressure on the Garda Commissioner to go.  We know it was not only about the tapes because the Garda Commissioner was not responsible for them.  Along with other Deputies, I called for his removal long before then.  However, we would have suggested that he be removed within the rules of the game in here.  In actual fact, he was pushed.  If the Taoiseach did not want him to go he would not have sent the Secretary General to his house in the middle of the night to tell him that he was concerned. I do not think the Taoiseach would have sent the Secretary General there for that reason.  The Taoiseach says he sent the Secretary General there to get more information.  Mr. Purcell has a different interpretation of the situation and was horrified at the idea of even being asked to go to the Garda Commissioner's house.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach says he did not want the Garda Commissioner to resign.  Why then, when the Commissioner asked for three months grace, which was later reduced to two, did the Taoiseach tell him he had to go immediately?  If the Taoiseach did not want the Garda Commissioner to resign could he not have refused his resignation?  Could he not have called him in and had a chat about it?  The Taoiseach wanted him to go because he had become a political liability but the manner in which he carried that out has left too much to be desired.</p></speech>

I begin by expressing solidarity with the homeless families in Blanchardstown who are currently occupying a NAMA-built home.  They stayed there over night and, by their actions, clearly have no confidence in the Taoiseach or his Government.</p>  <p>  Last night, I slept on a concrete floor with some of the families who are the victims of this Government's inaction.  They asked me to deliver personally to the Taoiseach the message that they have no confidence in him and are now driven to desperation.  This Government has done nothing to stop rents escalating, to introduce rent controls or stop repossessions, all of which factors have made tens of thousands of people homeless and left them dumped in hotels for months on end and forgotten.  Now, they are saying: "We can't and we won't wait any longer for housing: it's time for you to go."  </p>  <p>  One woman, who is pregnant, slept in the house last night because she cannot face the idea of her third child being born into hotel life.  Another woman who came to this country ten years ago for a better life has had to give up her PhD studies in favour of her child's education because, as she and her child are homeless and living in a hotel, they are miles from her child's school.  That woman cried this afternoon while talking to journalists.  </p>  <p>  The previous Government slowed down council house building.  This Government has completely stalled it.  It has sat on its hands for two years as this crisis escalated and worsened despite many warnings.  During the summer, some Ministers blamed the homeless agencies for not doing enough.  Everybody is to blame but this Government.  What is the solution?  First, something must be done about rents.  The Government has being talking for more than a year about doing something about rent controls and house building.  Houses will not come through the Government's friends, the private developers.  That will never happen.  They are not interested and they are not able.  They could be provided through NAMA, the State agency that over the past two years sucked in billions of euros of taxpayers' money, all of which proceeds go back to the banks and not into the public purse.  NAMA should be turned into a vehicle for ending the homeless crisis.  There are 120 families in Blanchardstown who are homeless and 120 houses currently being built in Diswellstown Manor by NAMA.  Why should those houses be sold to wealthy people when poorer people need them?  It is up to the Government to fund councils to build houses.  It could also change NAMA's brief and give it the authority to become a factor in the housing crisis.  Is the Taoiseach willing to do that?  Is the T&aacute;naiste, who is largely responsible for this crisis, willing to do it?  It is for the Taoiseach to answer those questions.  People on the ground will not wait much longer and will take further actions such as that outlined.</p></speech>

The manner in which the Taoiseach presented this previously was quite breath-taking.  I do not know how many people here have read the report but I have read it more than once.  The version of it which the Taoiseach has presented to this House belies its actual content.  Let us look at what Mr. Justice Fennelly actually says about the Attorney General.  He says that he is satisfied that she spoke in strong terms about the wholesale unlawful activity of the Garda, a conclusion not reached by her assistant who did a report that was very different.  He also says that the Attorney General substantially modified her evidence months after she was asked to give that evidence in the first instance.  He further says it is inescapable that she presented an alarming picture at meetings and that she made no effort to contact the then Minister for Justice and Equality or the Garda Commissioner despite a senior civil servant offering a face-to-face meeting with the Garda Commissioner on Monday morning.  The Taoiseach has the neck to come in here and ask us to express confidence in the Attorney General.  We have no more confidence in her than we do in him.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has today presented a picture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation that he has reformed.  He also said that he has given protection to whistleblowers.  Currently there are two serving whistleblowers in the Garda service, one of whom Assistant Commissioner Nolan, who is mentioned in the Fennelly report in relation to former Garda Commissioner Callinan destroying evidence, has been asked to initiate a disciplinary hearing in respect of a senior officer on foot of a complaint by one of those whistleblowers, despite having already leaked information to that same officer on foot of a complaint by another serving whistleblower.  This is the Taoiseach's newly reformed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Bill presented to this House is a watered down version of the heads of Bill presented last year and is a pale shadow of the legislation for a real independent Garda authority as presented to this House by Deputy Wallace.  </p>  <p>  Last night, many people around the country will have heard on a programme on RTE, which is hardly a vehicle for revolutionary propaganda, that on this Government's watch the top 5% of this society have more wealth than the middle 60%.  Not only are we not discussing the key issues of the day, but we are ducking, diving and hiding behind spin.  It is an absolute disgrace.  This Government's legacy will be a lack of reform and a record that makes the previous Government look good.</p></speech>

It should be debated and there should be an opportunity for questions and probing, but I do not think this should be done in the way it is being done today.  In fact, the report is being diluted by being presented through the guise of the vote of confidence or no confidence.</p> <p> As far as I am concerned the vote of confidence or no confidence is rather misplaced and mistimed because in two months' or five months' time the electorate will have time to show whether they have confidence in this Government.  Why is the work of the D&aacute;il, the normal Tuesday business, been diverted, cancelled and delayed?  It would be fair enough if this was an emergency, but this debate is not an emergency.  It is not an issue for which the D&aacute;il business needed to be changed.</p> <p> Another issue that is an emergency but which is not being seen as an emergency is housing.  Others have alluded to this.  There are 1,500 children living in emergency accommodation in Dublin, a 63% increase since last January, and the situation is worsening.  Another emergency for which we could have changed the Order of Business - the Taoiseach met the group last week - relates to the disability group and the stark and heartbreaking findings they presented to the Taoiseach.  I met them as well and I have met them previously on many occasions.  Fully 68% of those using disability services say they are of poor quality while 93% of those in residential homes have indicated that the homes have been found to be lacking in certain standards.</p> <p> Whether the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, was pushed, shoved, encouraged or went of his own volition, what difference does it make to the real issues taking up the lives of the people I represent or those represented by others here?  We are all public servants, we are all answerable and we are all here to serve the public.  I know the Department of Justice and Equality needs reform but as far as I am concerned the emergencies involving real people and the issues they have to deal with in their lives are more of a reason to change the Order of Business, rather than this bizarre debate that we are having for three hours today.</p></speech>

When I go to one page I read one thing but there is nearly a contradiction on the next page.  I must question one thing.  Were the participants or the players too big to give the real truth regarding what went on?  I believe, and I do not think anyone in the country would disagree, that given what went on during the committee meetings with regard to Mr. Callinan, he had to go.  There is no doubt about it.  However, it is a question of the way the Government went about that.  Mr. Purcell was sent off.  It reminds me of the film "The Field".  He was The Bird.  He was sent off to give the news to the widow and he went.</p>  <p>  Let us consider other parts of the report.  Mr. Callinan wanted two or three months and the Taoiseach pondered.  There were ways of doing it and ways of ensuring it was done right.  We talk about doing things differently and a different way of policing.  The Taoiseach should bear one thing in mind.  Our current Commissioner sat beside the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, at the time.  If someone is a leader, she should stand up and says what is right.  However, when remarks that were not true were made about people in the force, she did not stand up to be counted.  We need to have people with bravery to lead the force and if something is said that is wrong, it is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Let us bear in mind the country and where we come from, a part of the world that has been neglected in recent years, namely, the west.  We need to think of the hospitals, our elderly and everything that is going on this country.  Let us consider David McWilliams's programme last night in which he reported that 100 people increased their wealth more than the rest of our country.  That shows us there is something seriously wrong.  We heard of the cronyism going and of a different Ireland coming but, sadly, for many people, whether they be homeless, those with disabilities or those waiting on trolleys in hospitals, it is a worse Ireland than the country they had some years ago.</p>  <p>  I call on the Taoiseach to reflect on the Fennelly report.  As I said, I do not disagree altogether.  I will say it clearly: Callinan had to go.  However, it is a question of the way the Taoiseach did it.  There are ways and means.  The Taoiseach should bring in different Ministers, act in a united fashion and make it clear that it is a united decision by a Government.</p>  <p>  I believe the Attorney General has questions to answer as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200020#T00400"><p>The interim report of the Fennelly commission has been published and the conclusions of the report are available for every Member and every member of the public to read.  The great expectation from the Opposition to the effect that the report would confirm their versions of events has not materialised.  The commission accepts that the Taoiseach did not intend to put pressure on the Garda Commissioner to retire.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the actual conclusions of the commission, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in were united in their intention to use the publication of the report as an opportunity to table a confidence motion in the Taoiseach.  Of course, that is their prerogative and they prioritise what they believe are the most important issues facing the country at present.</p>  <p>  That is not to play down the significance of the interim report.  The retirement of a Garda Commissioner is a very serious matter and the decision by the Government to establish a commission of investigation into this matter was the right one.  The report identifies a number of failings within the system and these must be corrected.  Indeed, they are being corrected by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is leading her Department though a period of major transformation.</p>  <p>  This debate is not about the interim report.  It is another attempt by the Opposition to take the attention off the biggest issues and challenges facing the country in the weeks, months and years ahead.  It is a blatant attempt to keep the focus on the past and undermine the major progress that this Government, led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, has made in turning the country around.  That is the Opposition's priority today.</p>  <p>  I know those in the Opposition do not want to talk about the recovering economy or the fact the public finances are under control.  They do not want to talk about the thousands of people who now have a job.  I know for certain that they do not want to talk about the future, a future from which, under the leadership of Enda Kenny, every family in the country will benefit.  The policies implemented by the Taoiseach and this Government are designed to avoid the boom-and-bust policies of the past and create a future where people can have certainty about their incomes and pensions as well as access to the public services they need.  The economic recovery we are seeing is real and is underpinned by the most recent national accounts released by the Central Statistics Office.  In the second quarter of this year, real GDP rose by 1.9% relative to the first quarter, and, as a result, was 6.7% higher than in the same period last year.  This comes on the back of an increase of 7.2% in the first quarter of this year.</p>  <p>  The increase in economic activity is broadly based, unlike in the past when activity was excessively concentrated in the construction sector.  We are now seeing the domestic-facing and exporting sectors performing strongly.  Exports were strong in the second quarter, growing by 13.6%.  The multinational sector is contributing but so too are Irish-owned firms.  The competitiveness improvements we have seen in recent years are standing to us.  Domestic demand is also growing strongly with consumer spending continuing to recover.  These encouraging data are mirrored in strong employment growth as well as tax receipts.  By the end of August, tax receipts had increased by almost 10% over the same period last year.  Our overriding objective now is to build upon the gains we have made in recent years and secure the recovery.  Under the Taoiseach's leadership, this Government will continue to work to ensure the benefits of the economic recovery are widely distributed to families throughout the country and create further jobs.</p>  <p>  The recovery that is under way is fragile and must not be taken for granted.  Many people throughout the country have been very badly affected and have yet to feel the benefits of the recovering economy.</p><p>While large numbers of jobs have been created, the rate of unemployment remains too high.  Too many people in work are living on fixed incomes and are still under pressure to make ends meet, and too many of our young people are still working abroad.  Introducing policies to address these challenges is the priority of this Government.</p> <p> The Taoiseach is the leader of a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government that has brought this country back from the edge of bankruptcy and a situation in which more than 300,000 young people were emigrating.  He is the leader of a Government that has brought stability to the country.  He is the leader of a Government that knows what the challenges facing the people are and is prioritising actions to overcome these challenges.  His colleagues in government have absolute confidence in him, and later on this House will vote that it has absolute confidence in him as well.  </p> <p> In passing, I would also like to say that I have full confidence in the Attorney General.  She is excellent at her job and is a most dedicated and patriotic woman who works all sorts of late hours to serve the Government with appropriate legal advice.  Anyone who expresses no confidence in the Attorney General does not know the effort and work that Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan puts into her job.</p></speech>

The current Fianna F&aacute;il leader was a member of that Government, but on that occasion he chose to save his political career rather than the country by jumping from that sinking ship.  That he would table a no-confidence motion in respect of this Taoiseach is the finest exercise in brass-neckery I have come across in quite some time.</p>  <p>  Like other Deputies who have spoken, I have read the Fennelly report very thoroughly.  Most of us debated it at some length in the media three weeks ago, and we will have other opportunities to do so.  I agree fundamentally with Deputy O'Sullivan that a confidence motion is not the best way of dealing with this matter.</p>  <p>  Let us revisit the record of this Government over the past four and a half years, since we are debating a confidence motion.</p></speech>

Let us consider the record of the Government in which the Deputies opposite want us to vote no confidence.  From being the economic punch bag of Europe in 2010, Ireland is on course to have the strongest economic growth in the European Union this year and next.  Recent figures from the CSO show that GDP growth in the second quarter of the year was 6.7% higher than a year earlier and 5.3% higher in GNP terms.  Unemployment, which peaked at 15.1% and was rising when we came into government, dropped to 9.5% in August of this year, and continues to fall.  Critically, large reductions have been seen not just in the number of people who are short-term unemployed but also in the number of people who are long-term unemployed, which has dropped from a peak of 184,800 to 118,600 and continues to decrease.  Some 66,000 individuals who were long-term unemployed have been given the dignity of work.  Since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012, more than 120,000 additional jobs have been created, exceeding the initial target of 100,000 and much earlier than the deadline we set.  </p>  <p>  As well as creating the best possible environment for the economy to flourish, we have also sought to ensure the stability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  As per our commitment, the budget deficit, which was 30% or more of GDP in 2010, will fall below 3% this year.  Next year the target will be well under 2%.  As a result, the debt burden is also falling.  Having peaked at 120%, this year it will fall to 108% of GDP.  The net debt figure is some 20 points below that when we take account of the assets the State has in its reserves in the form of bank shares and cash.  </p>  <p>  We fulfilled our key commitment to the Irish people - that is, to ensure Ireland left the Fianna F&aacute;il troika programme at the end of 2014.  We renegotiated the poor deal done by Fianna F&aacute;il, which has saved the State and taxpayers billions.  Critically, the promissory note negotiated by Fianna F&aacute;il has been torn up and &euro;3 billion in annual payments removed.  The economic growth we are experiencing now is structural, sustainable and increasingly broad-based, and the domestic and exporting sectors show strong growth figures.  </p>  <p>  Jobs are being created in every region of the country.  Businesses are investing.  However, as a small open economy, we remain open to future shock.  We must ensure that the fiscal crisis that befell this country and its people never happens again.  That is why we will continue to pursue a prudent course in managing the public finances, investing wisely for the future and providing much-needed services and support to our people, but doing so in a sensible and sustainable way that will not undermine our future.  </p>  <p>  There are serious issues, many of which were touched upon by earlier speakers.  We are dealing with the fallout of the worst crash in our history.  That is the mess Fianna F&aacute;il left us, and this Government, having brought us back from the brink, will now pursue the solutions to these problems with the same vigour we brought to bear in addressing the economic problems in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  The general election will take place in the next six months.  The Irish people will be faced with a choice between electing this Government, which can offer stability and prosperity, and electing Fianna F&aacute;il, which broke the country and the party, or Sinn F&eacute;in, which is so addicted to the politics of crisis that it is incapable of articulating any sensible, mature or coherent solution to our problem.  The people will have their say soon.  For today, I am sure that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will vote confidence in this Government and its fine Attorney General, which have steered the ship of State from chaos to calm.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200021#U00700"><p>There are many reasons this Government and the Taoiseach should face a motion of no confidence instead of a motion of confidence today.  A motion of no confidence could be tabled due to the record number of families who find themselves homeless in this country due to Government policy.  We could debate a motion on how this Government is the first in the history of the State to introduce a tax that loses money.  A motion could be tabled condemning the fact that one in eight children in Ireland live in consistent poverty.  We could discuss a motion of no confidence in our health service and the many graduates who are fleeing the country.  We could discuss how many old people across rural Ireland and our cities live in fear of burglary and crime because of the Government's withdrawal of Garda resources across the country.  We could discuss how the Government has pulled up the ladder on many social welfare recipients by introducing consistent cuts to social welfare, its inaction on mortgage arrears, or the regional imbalance of the recovery.</p>  <p>  All of these issues are a direct result of decisions made by the people sitting opposite us today.  All of them would merit a motion of no confidence, but we are debating a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach as leader of this country.  This is an Orwellian turn of events and is, perhaps, a perfect indication of the arrogance that has seeped into the heart of Government Buildings and personnel in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Government put forward this motion of confidence in an effort to undermine debate on the failings of the Taoiseach and members of his Government as exhibited in the interim report of the Fennelly commission.  After 18 months, the interim report of the commission has been published with a highly co-ordinated PR approach by the spin doctors in Merrion Street to limit damage.  The three primary actors in the events - the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell - have all now been forced off the stage.  The Attorney General has been heavily criticised in the report, leaving only the Taoiseach claiming he is entirely in the clear.  He is not, of course, as he still has many questions to answer.</p>  <p>  The report verifies the facts around the resignation of the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and fully confirms our view that he was effectively sacked by the Taoiseach.  He was, in effect, forced to walk the plank on the instruction of the Taoiseach, with an infamous midnight call to his house by a senior civil servant, which was unprecedented in the history of the State.  The report finds that the Taoiseach's confidence in the Commissioner was not guaranteed in the next day's Cabinet meeting, despite the fact that the Commissioner had correctly dealt with the matter in respect of which the Taoiseach had lost confidence in him, namely, the issue of phone recordings in Garda stations.  The Commissioner had carried out his legislative duty by informing the Minister for Justice and Equality in a previous letter, dated 10 March, of the matters surrounding the recording of phone conversations in Garda stations.</p><p>Yet, it is put forward that the Taoiseach sought to breach illegally section 11 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which states that only the Government can dismiss the Commissioner.  Despite the Commissioner having carried out his duty in informing the Department of Justice and Equality of the phone recordings, the Taoiseach sought to use the issue as a politically expedient smokescreen to remove Martin Callinan to buy cover for the embattled then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  He did this by instructing the Secretary General at the Department to call to the Commissioner's home late on a Sunday evening and inform him that he no longer had confidence in him.</p> <p> The Fennelly report notes the immediate catalyst for the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, was the visit of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to his home, and the message conveyed to him from the Taoiseach during that visit.  The Commissioner would not have resigned if Mr. Purcell had not visited him that night.  Mr. Purcell would not have visited him that night if it were not for the instruction of the Taoiseach to do so.  Mr. Purcell described the meeting as one of the worst days of his career, a strong statement from an experienced public servant who, we recall, was shot in the leg, I think, when he worked in the then Department of Social Welfare, by the criminal known as "The General".  In effect, the Taoiseach sacked Martin Callinan.</p> <p> The report also highlights the serious communication dysfunction at the heart of Government.  Serious questions remain as to how senior managers at the Department of Justice and Equality did not know of the Garda recordings, given that it was revealed in November 2013 during the Ian Bailey case, and earlier that year as part of a GSOC report.  The fact there was no communication between the Attorney General and the then Minister for Justice and Equality about the matter until the fateful meeting in March in the Taoiseach's office shows a level of dysfunction whereby members of the Cabinet simply did not trust each other on these issues.</p> <p> It is now evident the Taoiseach misled the House with his statements that he did not order the circumstances which would result in the effective sacking of the Garda Commissioner.  The report's findings that the Taoiseach did not intend that outcome do not stand up against the evidence of other key witnesses.  The underhanded and dishonest approach of the Taoiseach is at the heart of these events.  It is also at the heart of the motion before us today.</p> <p> This motion is extremely ironic following the revelations of the report.  Those findings raise serious questions about the judgment of the Taoiseach in the execution of the powers of his office.  The report raises even more questions on the credibility of the Taoiseach in the evidence he gave to the commission.  The Irish people already appear to have made a judgment call on this matter, with the vast majority of the citizens of the State refusing to accept the Taoiseach's account of why the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resigned his post.  A poll published by RTE during a "Clare Byrne Live" programme was very telling.  It detailed that only 12% of those who responded stated they believed the Taoiseach's version of events.  This must be most distressing for the Taoiseach, who promised the people of this country a democratic revolution.  It is clear the Government's confidence in its leader can only have been undermined by the interim report.</p> <p> When proposing Deputy Enda Kenny for the position of Taoiseach in March 2012-----</p></speech>

The Fennelly commission raises serious questions surrounding the first two characteristics.  The massive failings of the Government on health, housing and Northern Ireland would raise serious questions on the third.</p><p>On being successfully elected as Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny stated in the House that we stand on the threshold of fundamental change, namely, that of renewal of what political leadership in Ireland should be about, leadership that cherishes responsibility, public duty and conscience over convenience.  Does the Taoiseach think the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan, would agree this is a Government of conscience over convenience?</p><p>The so-called democratic revolution has given way to a democratic revulsion as to how the Government conducts its business.  We have witnessed a total failure to reform the political institutions of our State as witnessed in the Fennelly report.  If anything, we have seen the people's trust in our political institutions fall even further under the watch of the Government.  Stroke politics, cynical politics and politics for the elite are practised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party instead of the new politics they promised us after the election in 2011.  The biggest disappointment of the Government is its failure to learn from mistakes of the past and deliver on its promises for the future.  This is on what the people will judge it.  This is what will be its undoing.</p><p>It is noteworthy that during his statement today in opening this motion of confidence in himself and the Government, the Taoiseach never once referred to the public comments, reported in the press, of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who described the Taoiseach's evidence as fantasy.  These were his words and they have been reported.  They have not been refuted by anybody.  The Taoiseach also failed to address categorically the fact the Attorney General had to alter substantially and change her evidence to the Fennelly commission.  Having read the report, as many others have, it has many stand-out moments which the Taoiseach glossed over and failed to record.  I will record this, which is a direct quote from page 270, paragraph 8.14.  The judge stated:</p><blockquote>The Commission has already found that the message delivered by Mr. Purcell in all the attendant circumstances in explicit contemplation of the risk that at the next day's Cabinet meeting the Taoiseach might possibly not be able to express confidence in him, carried with it the obvious implication that the Commissioner's own position was in question.  Accepting the Taoiseach assurances ... that he did not intend to put pressure on the Commissioner to retire nonetheless viewed objectively Mr. Purcell's mission was likely to be interpreted as doing just that.</blockquote><p>These are the words of the retired Supreme Court judge whom the Taoiseach has quoted to us today and it is on the record.</p></speech>

This is my first time to be involved in a government.  The Government has faced difficult challenges, but I have to say the leadership that has come from the top has been extraordinarily powerful and positive, something which was not evident in the previous Government when it faced many challenges similar to those we faced when we took office.  There is an irony in the fact the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, who was in government at that time and who left government before an election, has now decided to force a confidence motion in the Taoiseach who has solved many of the problems he totally failed to deal with.</p>  <p>  In terms of the specifics of the issue at hand with regard to the Fennelly report, there is much in the report of concern.  There is much in the Fennelly report which requires a Government response, and it is getting a Government response through what is probably the most fundamental reform of our justice infrastructure in Ireland we have seen certainly in my lifetime in politics-----</p></speech>

There are continuing challenges in the economy on which we are continuing to work and from which we are getting good results.  That is what we should be debating on the first day back, when people are listening to their politicians and leaders.  We have had a lengthy break over the summer months and people want to hear what we have to say; they want us solving their problems and not playing the kind of party politics that Deputy Martin is playing with a motion of no confidence that was announced immediately, more or less, after the Fennelly report was published.  By the way, that happened the day after it was given to the Taoiseach, and I am not sure if we have ever seen that kind of pace in publishing a report of this complexity.  It was an indication that the Taoiseach was anxious to get it out there and deal with the issue as soon as he could.</p>  <p>  Instead of judging the report from what is in it, the Deputies opposite are trying to create another political controversy in order to get some negative momentum around the start of a new D&aacute;il term.  That is a reflection of where those Deputies are coming from.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity but also frustrated, along with Deputy O'Sullivan, that we will spend such a significant amount of time on the opening day of this D&aacute;il session discussing a report that has been out in the public domain for quite a long time already.  I am pleased to reiterate my support for the ongoing efforts of this Government, being led by An Taoiseach.  It is a Government that is attempting to secure and embed economic recovery in this country and ensure that the economic recovery is felt in every home and community.  We need to be careful that people do not fall for - or are not tempted to fall for - the efforts by the Opposition to convince them to take that recovery for granted.  We now have stability and a recovery that is unfinished but could not have been imagined even a few short years ago.  That task has not been easy; it has not been easy for the Government or the Irish people.  It has not been easy because of the actions and inaction of the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government, in which Deputy Martin played a key role.  In many ways, we could be having a motion of no confidence in him today, except that that vote already took place in 2011, when the people of this country left him and his party in no doubt about their view of his record and legacy of destruction.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin and others made a political charge against the Taoiseach in this House and on every media platform they could find.  The Taoiseach accepted the recommendation of an all-party committee and asked a retired Supreme Court judge to assess that political charge, and the judge has reported.  Sadly for Deputy Martin, the findings are not convenient for the Opposition.  He wanted to debate the issues in a vacuum and pretend there was no crisis in justice.  I often wonder what he would have done if he were Taoiseach and somebody came to him late on a Sunday evening saying there were serious issues regarding security in the State.  What would he do?  Would he pop off to bed with a cup of cocoa and say that we would talk about it tomorrow?</p></speech>

The Deputy's <i>faux</i>outrage is hard to take, but it is made all the more galling in the absence of genuine outrage at so many pivotal points during his tenure in ministerial office.  Where was his outrage when he came to this House and voted confidence in Bertie Ahern when he could not produce a tax clearance certificate?  Where was his outrage when the former Taoiseach could not explain where he got the money and he said he made it on the horses?  Where was the Deputy's outrage when he had a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance who did not have a bank account?  Where was his outrage when his then ministerial colleague swore a false affidavit?  Where was his yearning for answers when his Government set up meandering, expensive tribunals that did not get to answer burning, important questions for the taxpayers of this country for many years?  More importantly, where was his concern for the 300,000 people who lost their jobs during the last 18 months of his tenure as a Minister?  The Deputy's fixation on one man's job, which a Supreme Court judge has already examined, is in stark contrast to his inaction in saving the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>It is fair to say the Opposition has been taken aback, because before this Taoiseach it would not have seen such a quick and efficient examination of issues by an eminent judge, followed by publication of that report in full within 24 hours.</p></speech>

There has only ever been one Garda Commissioner dismissed in this country whom the courts found was unfairly dismissed.  That was a Garda Commissioner dismissed under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.</p>  <p>  With regard to Sinn F&eacute;in, I apologise to Deputy Adams for not getting along to his little talk to the chamber of commerce today in Dublin.  He left us with a lovely quote, and I look forward to debating these issues during the election.  He was asked a question about figures.  I will paraphrase but be quite accurate on this.  He said, "I do not want to get into figures, because when I get the figures wrong they come back to haunt me."  Well, Deputy Adams, at some point we are going to debate the figures and we are going to debate the economy.</p></speech>

That is already happening due to the reforming programme being pursued by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, which includes the setting up of an independent policing authority, reform of the Department in line with the Toland report, and a renewal of Garda recruitment - which Fianna F&aacute;il stopped - along with investment through increased funding for Garda cars and numbers.</p>  <p>  I know the Opposition does not want to debate the economy - and who can blame it? - but that is what the people want us to work on and that is what the people need us to focus on.  It is not just for the sake of the economy, or having the economy as an end in itself; it is so we can deliver the society we want to deliver for all our people, one that our people need and deserve.

Far from needing to conjure any pretext to table a motion of no confidence, the objective conditions on the ground and the experiences of families right across the State leave us in no doubt about the very many fronts on which we could have moved a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  Today, at the top of the news, we were told that homelessness agencies have now declared the issue a humanitarian crisis.  That is how severe and acute the chaos is within the areas of housing and homelessness in our society.  The gentlemen and gentlewoman opposite have presided over that.  Over the summer, and for some months before that, we still saw record numbers of people lying on hospital trolleys.  That is the Government's chaos, record and form of governance.  It has persisted, of course, with the madness that is Irish Water and domestic water charges.  Those are only three examples, but I could go on.</p>  <p>  I should say to the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, that we are more than happy to debate the figures.  We will debate the figures with him any time.  How about the number of families on the social housing waiting list?  Would he like to discuss those?  Would he like to discuss the number of households in mortgage arrears?  Do the gentlemen opposite like those figures?</p></speech>

The Government's half-hearted, mealy-mouthed nod in the direction of those families is, at this stage, insulting.  If the Government were politically smart, it would stop doing that.</p>  <p>  Now I come to the Fennelly report itself.  For a person who has talked up Fennelly, the Taoiseach demonstrated a marked reluctance to come clean and give all the information to that commission.  I have some sympathy for the position in which he has found himself.  When the former Commissioner attended the Committee of Public Accounts and said the whistleblowers Maurice McCabe and John Wilson were "disgusting" - that was the word he used - I gave him the opportunity to withdraw or qualify those remarks and he refused to do so.  In my view, the moment that he chose to stand over that "disgusting" remark, the Commissioner's goose was cooked, if I could use that expression.  It is my view that the Commissioner had to go.  His credibility was shot and public confidence in him and, by extension, in the Garda at the time, was under incredible pressure.  I think that Commissioner had to leave.</p>  <p>  What Fennelly demonstrates very clearly is the truly remarkable turn of events where the Taoiseach chose to put a serving senior civil servant under the most incredible pressure to carry out an instruction that he believed to be wrong.  That is the term he used: "wrong".  The Taoiseach used that individual as a proxy, as a mechanism to do his dirty work.  He put arms-length and deniable distance between himself and the resignation of the Commissioner.  I believe he did that in a very deliberate and very calculated fashion.  I think he was conscious of the provisions in law under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  He knew that what he should have done was to go to the Cabinet, state his case and allow the Cabinet to take a decision that I believe would have been inevitable in respect of the Garda Commissioner.  However, because the Taoiseach was spooked, or maybe even because he was furious with the Commissioner for landing him in it again, he decided to do things his own way.  He said at the beginning of his own contribution that he welcomed the fact that Fennelly expressed confidence in the Government and in the Attorney General.  The Fennelly report does nothing of the sort.  Yes, it falls short of saying that the Taoiseach said, man to man, Taoiseach to Commissioner, "You must go".  He did not do that, but he unquestionably sent a person on his behalf to deliver that message.  He had lost confidence in the Commissioner and the Commissioner had to go, which is precisely what happened.</p>  <p>  Fennelly is absolutely damning in respect of the Attorney General.  Fennelly says, in his own words, that he was left perplexed by the evidence given, and subsequently modified, by the Attorney General.  The Attorney General, the senior law officer in the State, the legal adviser to Government, left Fennelly perplexed because of the nature of her testimony.  He was perplexed by her inconsistencies and by the fact that she had to revise her testimony.  He was equally perplexed at the fact that the Attorney General took it upon herself, unilaterally it seems, not to inform a serving Minister of matters of which she should have informed him.  This House will know I do not hold a candle for the former Minister, Deputy Shatter; far from it.  That is not the point.  The point is that he was the duly appointed member of the Cabinet but the Attorney General sidestepped all of that.  It is a matter of some concern to me that when we raise important issues like this, for a senior office-holder such as the Attorney General, the Government tries to bat them away and to depict them as nit-picking by the Opposition or the Opposition looking for a soft target.  People properly expect that the Taoiseach operates not just within the letter of the law, in this case the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, but also the spirit of that law, and we should expect that the Attorney General discharges her functions competently, fully, in accordance with established procedures and in recognition of the office she holds.  Fennelly reflects that this was not the case.  The Government's word of the season, which we have picked up on, is "chaos", which it attributes to those of us on this side of the D&aacute;il.  If ever there was irony, that is it.  The chaos within the Department of Justice and Equality; the chaotic manner in which the Taoiseach convened that meeting in March - the one he had no notes on; the absolute chaos of applying onerous pressure on a civil servant to go, under cover of darkness, to deliver the Taoiseach's message to the Commissioner; the chaos of his Attorney General giving information to a commission, revisiting it, and deciding she would not communicate information to a senior Minister - that chaotic scenario is just a sample of the generalised chaos in which the Taoiseach operates.  The really tragic thing - I will finish on this - and the reason we support a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, is that the chaotic enterprise that is his Government has delivered not only chaos but also huge hardship the length and breadth of this State.</p></speech>

What we now have is an economy that is delivering growth and creating jobs.  Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, with over 125,000 jobs having been created since our strategy to create employment was put in place.  This compares with the wreck of an economy this Government faced when we came into office due to the decisions made by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I listened with interest to what my constituency colleague had to say when she praised Members on this bench for their loyalty.

And the State is the name by which we call the great human conspiracy against hunger and cold, against loneliness and ignorance; the State is the foster-mother and warden of the arts, of love, of comradeship, of all that redeems from despair that strange adventure which we call human life.</blockquote><p>The beginning of this Oireachtas term was an opportune moment for the Opposition to kick-start an informed and, indeed, critical debate on this Government's record - its achievements, of which there are many, and also the areas where we have failed to reach the mark.  Moreover, it would have been even more beneficial for citizens interested in this debate - I wonder what those listening to this debate think are our priorities in here - for all parties in the House to honestly and credibly set forward their vision for Ireland.</p><p>Unfortunately, the parties opposite chose a different tack.  They have, in Kettle's words, revealed themselves &quot;as mere gabble and squabble of selfish interests&quot;.  This is epitomised by the tawdry attempt of those on the Opposition benches to cast aspersions on the role of the Attorney General, a departure that ignores the facts available to us and flies in the face of the content of the commission's report.</p><p>I am proud to place on the record of this House my full confidence in the Taoiseach and my admiration and faith in the professionalism, judgment and dedication of the Attorney General.  Any fair reading of the commission's report would endorse the Attorney General's actions.  At all times she acted as the impartial and objective legal counsel to the Government, not a part of the Government nor a party in government, but to the Government as a whole, led by the Taoiseach.  This is in keeping with the remarkable commitment to public service that the Attorney General has displayed since her appointment.  The attempts by some Members opposite to besmirch that hard-earned reputation through a malign mixture of innuendo, supposition and what-iffery is pathetic.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this was the opportunity to have a frank and honest debate about this Government's record and, more importantly, about how we build a thriving, compassionate, nurturing society in the coming years.  Instead, the Opposition turned its back on that debate, which is telling in itself.</p><p>A debate about future policy direction is particularly valuable in the vital area of education.  Last year was the first year in recent times that we secured an increase in the education budget.  It was a modest increase, but I am determined to see this as the beginning of increased investment in the important area of education.</p><p>In addition to the extra resources that the budgetary increase provided, I have, with the assistance of colleagues, in particular, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, secured additional support during the year for children with special educational needs.  I have ensured that every child with Down's syndrome will have an equal right to resource teacher support.  As many in this House will be aware, we had a situation whereby parents of children with Down's syndrome whose condition was diagnosed as &quot;mild&quot; were not guaranteed access to resource teachers, and I am glad to say that is no longer the case.  Also, in July, I received sanction and Government support to recruit up to 620 additional SNA posts starting this month.  This represents an 11.7% increase since the Government came into office, yet I still hear Members opposite clamour about the cut back in SNA positions, which is a complete distortion of the truth.  They may have loud voices but at times they are not very good at sums.</p><p>This is a missed opportunity to have a debate about values, competence and the future of the country, and we need to have that honest debate.  I do not pretend to have all the answers and I would have welcomed the opinions of those on the Opposition benches, as would my colleagues.  Unfortunately, others gained the whip hand in the lead in to this debate but, then again, perhaps that is what they want - all bluster and no substance.</p></speech>

He claims he did not and that the Fennelly report vindicates him, but it does nothing of the sort.  The Fennelly report states that &quot;The Taoiseach has assured the Commission in evidence that he had no intention of putting any kind of pressure, direct or indirect on the Commissioner and that he was genuinely very surprised when he learned that the Commissioner had decided to retire.&quot;  The report goes on to list the evidence that makes these claims impossible to accept.  It states: &quot;Mr Purcell was... instructed to tell the Commissioner that... the Taoiseach would be proposing the appointment of a Commission of Investigation and that there was a possibility that he, the Taoiseach, would be in a position where he might not be able to express continued confidence in the Commissioner.&quot;  No pressure.</p><p>The report states that Deputy Shatter, in his written statement to the commission, said that the Taoiseach was clearly of the view that the Garda Commissioner should resign or retire.  Again, no pressure.  Deputy Shatter is quoted as viewing the nocturnal visit has having &quot;the intent of a message going to the Commissioner that indicated very clearly to him that his position was in great difficulty or that he should consider his position&quot;.  No pressure.  The report states that the Taoiseach and the Attorney General gave evidence on the issue of no confidence and that it was not one of the concerns to be conveyed to Mr. Purcell, but Mr. Purcell, Mr. Fraser and Deputy Shatter, on the other hand, &quot;were in no doubt that it was part of the message to be conveyed to the Garda Commissioner&quot;.  Again, no pressure.  The report states: &quot;It was decided at the meeting that, for reasons that are not clear to the Commission, simply telephoning the Garda Commissioner was not sufficient but that the message should be conveyed by Mr Purcell in person.&quot;  No pressure.</p><p>The report states:</p><blockquote>Mr Purcell was thus instructed by the Taoiseach to visit the Garda Commissioner.  He was to visit his home, something which neither he nor, so far as he was aware, any of his predecessors had ever done before.</blockquote><p>No pressure.</p><p>Based on the evidence, clearly, the Fennelly report shows evidence that it is impossible to conclude that the Taoiseach had no intention of putting pressure on the Garda Commissioner, and 88% of the people do not believe it to be the case.  For this reason, the motion of confidence should be voted against.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200026#Z00200"><p>The motion is about the Fennelly report.  The Minister for Education and Skills has just said the debate should be about values and competence.  The debate certainly is about values and competence.  It is about the Taoiseach's values and how he dealt with the Garda Commissioner when the information came to light, and about how he did not use the proper channels to convey his message to the Garda Commissioner.  He sent a late night visit to the Commissioner from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and to quote a famous film, he "made him an offer he couldn't refuse".  He was left with no choice as to what he had to do.  While the Taoiseach might not have said, "I want you to resign", he certainly left the Commissioner knowing what he had to do, and that is what the Commissioner did.</p>  <p>  In his earlier contribution, the Taoiseach said had he seen the letter that was in the Department of Justice and Equality for a number of weeks before the information came to light, things would have been different.  However, are we seriously to believe that the Secretary General whom he sent to deliver the message to the Commissioner had not seen the letter and did not know about it?  Did he not mention it to the Taoiseach at any stage during the debacle?  It stretches credulity to believe it would have happened.  The Taoiseach delivered a message that he wanted the Commissioner to resign, and the Commissioner took the message on board, although it was not laid out in black and white for him.</p>  <p>  There are many reasons to have a motion of no confidence in the Government, and they have been highlighted over recent years.  The Taoiseach went to Switzerland and told our European masters we had all "partied", while here in the House he said we were not responsible for the crisis.  The Taoiseach said he had not increased taxes during the lifetime of the Government when, clearly, everybody here knows he did.  Last week, we had the spectacle of the T&aacute;naiste opening a food bank in the city, which shows the culture and competence of the Government, given that opening a food bank in our capital city could be seen as progress.</p></speech>

I do not have confidence in the Government and the result of the Fennelly commission of investigation is just one big reason, among many others - trust, integrity and the performance of the Government - for the lack of confidence.  The people have lost confidence, and during recent weeks most people are fed up with the Government's carry on.  The motion is about trust and confidence, and people believe the Taoiseach played a major role in the sacking of the Garda Commissioner.  Most people I know do not believe the Taoiseach and have major concerns about the credibility of the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is the bottom line, and when one digs deeper into the interim report, particularly on page 212, on the issue of Mr. Purcell's visit to the Commissioner's home, we see, for example, "Mr Purcell agreed with the conclusion that, although it was certainly not something he wanted to do [it was] the least worst option".  He was also "extremely uncomfortable" about finding himself in this position.  The bottom line on the debate is that the people have lost confidence in the Government and the issue of lack of respect for the justice system, and I will vote accordingly.</p></speech>

He went on to talk about "my force" and to be arrogant in a way which was symptomatic of a man who felt he was embedded in power and irremovable.  What was wrong with the episode was that the Commissioner, Martin Callinan, should have been sacked the next morning.  After he had said what he said in a public forum, undermining the work of good garda&iacute; who had been judged in a garda&iacute; kangaroo court guilty of something of which they were not guilty, the Government should have immediately sacked the Commissioner on that day.  Instead, it spent months defending him, going into political contortions to do so.  At the end, the episode occurred, which we are discussing today, the subject of the vote of confidence.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that because he was politically disposable and too hot to carry politically, he would then be fired.  The Government fired him in a way which was obviously unacceptable.  It was against every protocol known and, possibly, against the law, given that he was fired without the consent of the Cabinet, and behind closed doors.  It was typical of what happens in the Government, given that the same happened to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, who made mistake after mistake but was fired only when he became too hot to carry politically.  It is part of a pattern of the Government continually using and abusing the system to gain political kudos and capital for itself and disposing of people at the wrong time, possible unconstitutionally, when they become politically disposable.</p></speech>

The report has been presented as a whitewashing of the Taoiseach while, in reality, the details of the report are anything but that.  It is a very good reason not to have confidence in our Taoiseach, Government and, incidentally, the Attorney General.  There are many other very good reasons not to have confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.  Like Deputy Pringle, I was struck, as were many, by the image of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, happily cutting the ribbon on a food bank as a symbol of the recovery that is supposedly under way.  It symbolised precisely what is happening, what was exposed so well in last night's documentary in RTE, namely, the nature of the recovery.</p>  <p>  The Government is presiding over a recovery for the rich, the corporations and the high earners at the expense of the rest, and over a situation in which almost one in three people and almost one in two children is suffering from multiple deprivation experiences.  Those statistics have doubled since the start of the crisis and have significantly increased since the Government took office, while the wealth of the super-wealthy has gone from &euro;50 billion to &euro;84 billion and Denis O'Brien's personal wealth has more than doubled.  It sums up the reality of the Government's actions and the slogan and rhetoric of recovery on which it will stand for election and seek re-election and a vote of confidence from the public.  That is who the Government stands for and represents and it will not get the votes of confidence of the public when it comes to an election in the coming months.</p></speech>

Rather than focusing on the issues that affect people every day of their lives, such as job creation, housing or improving our health services, the Opposition would prefer that we spend today discussing a claim which does not stand up.  Time and again, the Opposition made the false assertion that the Taoiseach effectively sacked the Garda Commissioner.  Despite these claims, the Fennelly inquiry clearly finds that the former Commissioner took his own decision to retire.  I have full confidence in the Taoiseach in how he handled the lead-up to the retirement of the former Commissioner, much like I have full confidence in the Taoiseach in his handling of the economy over the past four and a half years.</p><p>Under the Taoiseach's leadership, this country has been brought back from the brink.  Back in 2011, we had lost our economic sovereignty, our international reputation was in tatters, unemployment was out of control and we had no money to invest in public services.  I will give two apt examples of what is happening now.  We are recruiting new garda&iacute; and we are investing in the Garda fleet.  As Deputies might remember, Fianna F&aacute;il halted Garda recruitment in 2009 because it had destroyed the economy and had no money to take on new recruits.  Between 2012 and 2014, this Government spent more than &euro;400 million on the Garda budget than Fianna F&aacute;il had proposed for the same period.</p> <p> Such investment would not have been possible if this Government, with the support of the Irish people, had not taken painful steps to repair the economy and get this country back on a sustainable footing.  By continuing to create jobs, we are sustaining the recovery.  As more people are at work, we have more money to invest in public services like the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We would not be in a position to invest in such services in the absence of the calm and considered leadership of the Taoiseach and his focus on improving the lives of people in this country.  He has led this country through one of the most difficult times in its history.  He has shown conviction in the face of adversity and courage in the face of difficult decisions.  As a nation, we are now seeing the benefits of that.  Some 120,000 jobs have been created.  Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe.  The unemployment rate has decreased from 15% to 9.5% and is continuing to fall.</p> <p> Step by step, under the leadership of the Taoiseach, the Government has repaired the old broken Fianna F&aacute;il model and replaced it with a sustainable economy based on enterprise and innovation.  The more we move away from the failed policies of the past, the more we can deliver prosperity for the Irish people.  Just one question that needs to be asked in the context of this confidence motion.  Is this country a better place now than it was when Deputy Enda Kenny became Taoiseach?  The only answer anyone can give to that question is "Yes".  I have full confidence in him as Taoiseach and as leader of Fine Gael.  I will be giving my full support to this motion.</p></speech>

The Government established an independent commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the Garda Commissioner.  These circumstances were investigated for months by a retired Supreme Court judge.  The commission has now considered all the evidence and concluded that the Garda Commissioner decided to retire and could have decided otherwise.</p>  <p>  This motion is old-style cynical politics at its worst.  Fianna F&aacute;il is attacking the Taoiseach for the sake of attacking him.  This cynical approach to politics has served this country poorly in the past.  Where is responsible opposition?  Where is Fianna F&aacute;il's desire to put the country ahead of the party?  Have its members learned nothing?  After the painful recession from which we are now emerging, the public expects better from politicians.  This is the type of behaviour that makes the public switch off from politics.  It is the exact opposite of what we experienced last May, when people who had never even voted before knocked on doors in every constituency in the country to campaign for their rights and the rights of others.  The decisive result that emerged at the end of that campaign provided a new optimism regarding what politics can achieve.  Fianna F&aacute;il may not have noticed this.  It may have been oblivious to the new mood, given that it barely lifted a finger to participate in the process in question.  It is now reverting to type by engaging in the type of politics that disillusions young people to the point where they do not even register to vote.  Is it any wonder that the public has turned its back on Fianna F&aacute;il?  Is it any wonder that one of its brightest young leading lights has turned her back on the party?</p>  <p>  The toxic culture of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party devastated this country.  Its reckless approach hurt every family in the country.  No home was left untouched.  As others have said, unemployment soared, taxes increased and the most vulnerable were walloped.  The country was humiliated.  Fianna F&aacute;il walked off the pitch after wreaking havoc on the country.  Many Ministers did not even bother to go to the polls.  The small rump of leftovers has now tabled a motion of no confidence in the leader who cleaned up their mess.  It is not surprising that Sinn F&eacute;in is voting with Fianna F&aacute;il today.  The members of that party are not comfortable when they have to deal with the facts.  Rather then listening to the evidence and accepting an impartial judgment, they prefer their traditional approach of being judge, jury and undertaker.  They would even like to remove our Attorney General.  Having worked with her on complex legislation, I have seen at first hand her unrivalled professionalism and her commitment to her job.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are telling us that they have no confidence in the Taoiseach who has turned this country around.  Under the Taoiseach's leadership, this country is coming back from the brink.  We now have the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  Some 1,300 jobs are being created every week.  The unemployment rate has fallen from 15.1% to 9.5%.  We knew that the man who rebuilt our party was the man to rebuild the country.  The recovery was not just about rebuilding our economy; it was about rebuilding our pride, self-esteem and confidence.  The recovery remains fragile in uncertain times, however.  The Chinese stock markets are tumbling.  The European economy has slowed to a crawl.  Our largest trading partner is actively considering leaving the European Union.  In these uncertain times, the man who brought this country back from the brink is the man to secure our fragile recovery and ensure its benefits are felt by every individual, by each family and by all households.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

They do not realise that this Government deals in facts.  I wish to deal with facts during this debate, in the first instance when speaking about the Fennelly report.  The central charge made against the Taoiseach by the Opposition is that he sacked the Garda Commissioner.  The conclusions of the Fennelly report show that this charge does not stand up.  I will set out the facts of the report.  Conclusion 14 in the report is that "there was no question at the meeting on 24th March of any proposal being made that the Government consider the removal of the Commissioner from office".  Conclusion 15 in it is that "the Commission accepts that the Taoiseach did not intend to put pressure on the Garda Commissioner to retire".  Conclusion 22 is that "the Commissioner decided to retire; he could have decided otherwise, but he did not wish to become embroiled in legal or other conflict with the Government".  That is enough on the report.  The facts are the facts and they speak for themselves.</p>  <p>  In turning to the motion of confidence in the Government, it is important that we remember where we were back in early 2011.  There were dark clouds hanging over this country.  We were on the brink of bankruptcy.  We were facing mass unemployment.  The rate of unemployment was heading up to 20%.  The nation was gripped by despair.  There was no hope.  When we went to the doors and met people on the streets, we could see fear in their eyes.  They feared for their jobs and prospects, but they had a greater fear for the future of this country and the future of their children and grandchildren.  They did not have hope.  They were genuinely afraid.  Four and a half years on, under the leadership of the Taoiseach, this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government has brought hope back to people.  Confidence has been restored.  When we meet people now on the streets and at the doors, they have hope and they see a future for themselves and for their children and grandchildren.</p>  <p>  Members would be wrong to think I am saying everything is perfect out there.  We are not delusional on the Government side.  We know things still have to improve.  Most people say they believe things are going to get better.  If one talks to those who are involved in small and medium-sized enterprises, most of them will tell one they intend to increase the number of people they employ.  There is hope and there is belief in the future.  The restoration of confidence is the most important thing.  This hope is backed up by the facts, as opposed to imagination and spin.  It is a fact that unemployment was at 15% and was heading to 20%, but is now at 9.5%.  It is a fact that we were losing thousands of jobs each week, but we are now winning 1,300 new and real jobs each week.  It is a fact that the budgetary deficit, which was &euro;22 billion in 2011, will be under &euro;5 billion this year.  The cost of Government borrowing was 15% but is now down to 1.63%.  The economy has now recovered to the same size that it was before the crash.  This time it is real instead of being based on a property bubble.  These are facts rather than spin.  We do not need to spin this recovery.</p><p>It is real, it is sustainable, and, most importantly, it is delivering jobs - real jobs.  This is an enterprise-led recovery built on exports.  It is a sustainable recovery that will give the Government the ability to pay for the improved services that the people of this country deserve.  Our job now is to future-proof the economy by investing in skills, research and innovation and in our young people.  This charge is being led by the Taoiseach, who has given clear example.  He can show real leadership, which, I am sad to say, I have not seen anywhere on the Opposition benches for the last four and a half years.  He has shown real leadership and has made real decisions in real time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1203" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200028#BB00200"><p>With the approval of the House, I would like to share my time with Deputy Billy Timmins.</p>  <p>  The central question that arises in this debate is "Does it matter whether the Taoiseach tells the truth?".  I think it matters quite a lot, and the public thinks it matters as well, in spite of the impression that is being created - or that the Government is trying to create - that nobody is really interested in this.  I heard a reporter on RTE saying that the Fennelly report does not matter and that nobody is interested, but I do not think that is the case at all.  The public is very exercised by this because it goes to the very heart of politics and whether one can believe a senior politician.  For that reason, it is quite disappointing that Fennelly did not reach a clear conclusion on the central point of the inquiry, in spite of the fact that there was so much evidence from almost everybody else who was interviewed to support the contention that we are getting something less than the truth from the Taoiseach.  That does matter to people.</p>  <p>  The report paints a picture of quite staggering incompetence and panic on the part of the Taoiseach and a complete disregard for proper procedures.  It also portrays quite serious dysfunction across a number of State offices, which should be a matter of concern to us all.  The report is littered with contradictions, and any fair reading would lead one to conclude that the Taoiseach's claims of vindication simply do not stand up.  In fact, the way the Taoiseach has portrayed this is reminiscent of Albert Reynolds in respect of the beef tribunal.  The whole approach, in terms of honesty in politics, is very similar to what happened on that occasion.</p>  <p>  We all know that the Taoiseach had a political problem.  There had been relentless controversies emanating from the Garda and from the Department of Justice and Equality.  It would appear that the Taoiseach used senior officials to help him to solve that political problem.  Clearly, this was completely inappropriate and improper.  There seemed to be a view that if the Garda Commissioner stepped down it would help to quell controversies.  If that was what the Taoiseach wanted, he should have followed proper procedures and got Cabinet approval to remove the Commissioner.  Instead, he sent a senior official to the Commissioner's home late at night to tell him that the Taoiseach could not express confidence in him.  This, of course, meant one thing and one thing only, and that was that the Commissioner was sacked.  If this was not the intention in sending Brian Purcell to the Commissioner's house that night, then what was the point of the visit?  Many feel that the Taoiseach is treating the public like fools, but they are not fools.  The public knows what the score is in this regard.  Again, I say to the Taoiseach, if the purpose of sending Mr. Purcell out that night was not to get the Commissioner to resign, then what on earth was the purpose of that visit?  The report itself is quite clear in this regard.  It says that the commission accepts the Taoiseach's assurances that he did not, by sending Mr. Purcell to visit the Commissioner, put pressure on the Commissioner to retire.  However, it goes on to say: "Seen objectively however, Mr. Purcell's message ... on behalf of the Taoiseach ... late at night, was likely to be interpreted as doing just that."  The other issue is that while the Taoiseach claims one thing, everybody else in the room that night understood exactly what was involved.  Everybody in the room that night was absolutely clear that the Taoiseach was sending Mr. Purcell out to sack the Garda Commissioner.  For the Taoiseach to deny this is simply not believable.  Irrespective of how he has spun the release of the report, it is just not believable.  </p>  <p>  I want to speak now about the role of the Attorney General in all of this.  Fennelly described her actions as perplexing and puzzling.  Certainly, it is very hard to know why she had a crisis meeting with the Taoiseach about phone taping on 23 March when her office had been told about the phone taping the previous November.  Indeed, her office was involved with the Garda Commissioner's office right throughout the month of February with regard to taping in respect of the Bailey case.  Reports that she was called back on four occasions would indicate that there were very serious problems with the evidence being given by the Attorney General.  There are very serious questions to be answered regarding the functioning of her office.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Department of Justice and Equality, an important letter came from the Garda Commissioner addressed to the Minister, but this was not passed on.  Was there an awareness of that letter?  Was the Taoiseach told about that letter on the night?  Did Mr. Purcell tell him about the dysfunction within his Department that resulted in such an important letter not reaching the Minister?</p>  <p>  One must also ask about the level of awareness of the taping of calls going into and out of Garda stations.  Everybody seems to be claiming they did not know this was happening - that it was news to them.  The system for taping phone calls was put in during the 1980s in a number of Garda stations, so it was not a question of its being done secretly.  Furthermore, the system was upgraded in the 1990s and some half a million euro was spent on further upgrading it in 2008.  How was it that nobody in the Department of Justice and Equality or in the Attorney General's office seemed to know anything about this?  This raises massive questions about dysfunction at the very heart of Government and the Civil Service.  Of course, critical questions also arise with regard to the functioning of the Civil Service and the relationship between the Civil Service and senior Ministers.  We have a situation at the moment whereby Secretaries General hide behind Ministers and Ministers hide behind the Secretaries General.  Deputy Rabbitte has drawn attention to this on numerous occasions but, of course, nothing has been done to reform this area.  What advice did Martin Fraser give the Taoiseach concerning his powers in this regard?  Are we not entitled to see that advice?  </p>  <p>  All of this is very important.  We have had eulogies from all of the Ministers today who spoke about the leader of the Government and what he has done.  The leader of the Government has doubled child poverty and is responsible for the fact that there are half a million people on hospital waiting lists.  The leader of the Government is responsible for the increase in the housing waiting lists to 130,000 and has overseen a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle classes to the wealthy.  The leader of the Government used the budget last year to widen the gap between rich and poor.  And, most importantly, the leader of the Government cannot be believed or trusted.  That is why we cannot vote confidence in him.</p></speech>

It is born out of an adversarial system that has ill served the public.  The outcome is well known in advance, the debate predictable.  The Opposition comes in and casts a jaundiced eye on the workings and failures of Government and Cabinet Ministers and others line up like King Lear's daughters, protesting their undying obedience and confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.</p>  <p>  This Government has done some good and some bad.  However, with respect to the issue at hand - namely, the interim report of the Fennelly commission - the Government has not covered itself in glory.  The Taoiseach has a view that he did not sack the Commissioner, a view I believe he genuinely holds.  However, his actions, which resulted in the visit by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Garda Commissioner's home, caused the Commissioner to resign.  Irrespective of the rights and wrongs or how the Commissioner was performing in his role, a public servant does not deserve that treatment but deserves fair process, whether he or she is the highest ranking member of the Garda or the lowest.</p><p>This view is shared by the majority of people.  This was a case of government by innuendo, which is not how things are meant to be.  While both sides of the House can selectively quote from the interim report, members of the public will draw their own conclusions and will not come down on the side of the Government.</p> <p> I would like the Minister for Justice and Equality to address a few minor issues arising from the interim report before the final report is published.  I refer to the failure of the management team to inform the Garda Commissioner about the tapes and the shredding of ten bags of material, which I understand took place ten days after the Commissioner resigned.  Under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Minister has the power to appoint a relevant person to carry out an investigation into such matters.  It would be helpful if such an investigation were completed before the publication of the final report.</p> <p> An attempt was made to manipulate the media in respect of the publication of the report.  It should be a requirement in future that such reports be laid before the House at the same time as they are received by the Government.</p> <p> This debate will be ignored by members of the public who have made up their minds and moved on.  Is it not regrettable that we cannot approach this debate with open minds, rather than adopting partisan positions with predetermined outcomes?</p></speech>

The same Members now cry a river of crocodile tears about the manner of the former Commissioner's retirement.</p>  <p>  The interim report of the Fennelly commission is careful to state several times that, after 15 months, it ventures no opinion as to the legality of the Garda station recordings, although it is possible to infer from the report that the Attorney General was expected to reach a conclusion on legality over one weekend.  While we await the second Fennelly report, the House appears agreed on the potentially grave implications for the administration of justice of the capture of telephone traffic in and out of Garda stations, a fact unknown to the then Minister for Justice and Equality or Garda Commissioner apparently.  We are fortunate to have a law officer advising the Government who spelled out those grave implications.  What a pity we did not have a similarly patriotic watchdog to advise the Government of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin of the grave economic implications of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party policies being pursued before the country went over the cliff.</p></speech>

I do not recall Fianna F&aacute;il observing any courtesies when the then Minister, Mr. Gerry Collins, sacked the then Garda Commissioner who subsequently won compensation in the courts.  Moreover, Deputy Martin has never been able to find the file last seen on his desk, according to the Travers report, when his inaction cost the Exchequer &euro;110 million.</p></speech>

Given that he presents himself as an alternative Minister for Justice and Equality, I propose to point out one or two things to him.  Last year, the Deputy wrote to a judge asking that a convicted drug dealer be allowed to go free.  Just two weeks ago, he called on the Taoiseach to publish all details, including transcripts, of his evidence to the Fennelly commission.  He should know that to do so would be illegal as the Commissions of Investigation Act, which was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government in 2004, specifically prohibits anybody from publishing any evidence given or the contents of any documentation produced by a witness.  This prohibition is set out in black and white in section 11(3) of the Act, which also provides, in section 11(5), that a person who publishes such evidence is guilty of an offence.  How can anyone treat Deputy Niall Collins seriously when he is not familiar with the legislation his party introduced?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been one of the best, most honourable and most decent Taoisigh to have sat in this House.  There have been no scandals or whiff of scandal associated with him.</p></speech>

While the report clearly outlines the various breakdowns in communications and so on, the bottom line is that it makes clear that neither the Taoiseach nor anyone else sacked the Garda Commissioner and that the Commissioner had other options available to him.</p>  <p>  I was present during Leaders' Questions on numerous occasions during that period and I remember Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and Independent Deputies jumping up and down looking for a commission of inquiry to examine the relevant events.  They got an inquiry but are not happy with its findings.  In other words, it produced the wrong answer.  I ask them to take a leaf out of the book of the Kerry football team which, after being beaten fairly and squarely by Dublin in the all-Ireland final, accepted the result and moved on.</p>  <p>  I have known the Taoiseach for the past 40 years.  During that time, I have had many dealings with him, including a few rows.  I will say, however, that he is a man of the highest integrity and honesty and a person who does what he says he will do.  It is as simple as that and history will judge his legacy accordingly.</p></speech>

It strikes me that one always hears Deputies speak about political reform.  While it may be possible to change rules, improve accountability or have things run more smoothly, it is not possible to account fully for human nature.  This motion is an example of Deputies playing silly buggers.  It wastes time that could be spent discussing ongoing issues that need to be addressed.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies in particular cannot speak about economic success and recovery given that the Taoiseach has taken us back from the precipice to which their party led us.</p><p>We were about to fall over but he has put the country on the road to recovery with the support of Government and all on the backbench.  What we should be debating is the fallout of Fianna F&aacute;il in government and how we are trying to fix legacy issues, whether it is housing or the many other issues we face as a consequence of the bad management, to say the very least, of Fianna F&aacute;il.</p> <p> I pay tribute to the Attorney General.  Fair play to this Government for appointing her as the first woman.  We have an outstanding Attorney General in M&aacute;ire Whelan.  I spent at least four hours with her alongside another colleague, debating and exploring my concerns about the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.  Not only is she extremely competent, she is deeply motivated to serve in her office for the common good.  This Attorney General has overseen probably the greatest amount of reforming legislation in the history of the State.  She has a deep commitment to the public interest.  In relation to the 30-year Garda recording controversy, the Attorney General demonstrated this deep commitment by her action to ensure that the rights of citizens were not adversely prejudiced by the potential destruction of recordings that could possibly contain exculpatory evidence.  Those on the Opposition benches are doing their best to put her down and rubbish her.  The way the old boys standing together on the Opposition benches are attempting to gang up on her smacks more than a little of male chauvinism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-09-22a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200030#DD00200"><p>Listening to the previous speakers, one would think this was all very clear-cut.  Unfortunately, it is not clear-cut and I find it remarkable that many of the Government speakers feel we should not be discussing the interim Fennelly report at all.  If we had three hours' debate it would be a disgrace, but we have had nothing like three hours because most people have not even spoken about the Fennelly report because they have not read it.  That is very evident from the speeches that have been made.</p>  <p>  There is a certain irony that some of those on the Government benches who are being wheeled out today to defend the Taoiseach were themselves only five years ago pushing ahead with their own motion of no confidence in Deputy Enda Kenny.  Five years is almost a lifetime in politics.  Back then, those individuals voted to remove Deputy Kenny from his post having no confidence in his ability even to lead the Opposition.  Their judgment of his abilities then was better than their judgment of the Fennelly report today.  Today, they will loyally defend the leader they once sought to depose but the tale of utter mismanagement set out in the Fennelly report has proven them right.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's defence to the charge that he sacked the Garda Commissioner has been a weak one.  It seems that he relies on the pedantic defence that he did not sack the Commissioner but merely forced him to leave office - a wafer-thin distinction that the public can see through immediately.  Only the Taoiseach knows what he was thinking when he sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on the nasty mission of forcing the Garda Commissioner to resign.  While the Fennelly commission refrained from concluding against the Taoiseach on the key issue of intent, how could it do otherwise when the Fennelly commission could not get into the Taoiseach's mind?  On that very narrow point, the Taoiseach has built his entire defence.  Mr. Purcell was an experienced civil servant, however, and he knew the import of what he was being asked to do.  Indeed, even the Taoiseach was forced to concede to the commission that he could not dispute the fact that the Commissioner would be compelled to resign if the Taoiseach stated publicly that he did not have confidence in him.</p>  <p>  No one who actually read the report could credibly state that the Taoiseach was exonerated by it.  Repeating the mantra that the Taoiseach was exonerated a thousand times does not make it true.  The fact is that the Taoiseach's evidence was rejected by the commission on a number of points.  The Taoiseach's evidence was that Mr. Purcell's brief was to apprise the Commissioner of concerns and ascertain the Commissioner's views on that.  Indeed, the commission notes that it was his evidence on several occasions that he wanted to have the view of the Commissioner.  The commission rejected the Taoiseach's evidence on this point, finding explicitly that the Taoiseach in fact did not instruct Mr. Purcell to obtain the views of the Commissioner on any question.  The commission noted that the Taoiseach was forced to concede in evidence that the Commissioner would be compelled to resign if the Taoiseach stated publicly that he did not have confidence in him.  The commission also found that Mr. Purcell was instructed to tell the Commissioner that that was exactly what was on the cards; that the Taoiseach would be in a position where he might not be able to express confidence in the Commissioner.  To any ordinary person it is very clear what the import of that was.  While one would not think it to listen to Government Members today, we must remember that the fundamental finding of the commission was against the Taoiseach.  It was that the immediate catalyst for his decision to retire was the visit of Mr. Purcell to the Commissioner's home and the message he conveyed from the Taoiseach during that visit.  The simple reality is that the Taoiseach ignored the legal process that was in place for the removal of a Garda Commissioner.  That process is a key protection in the national interest of any democracy.  Equally, he ignored the requirements of fair procedures and constitutional justice provided for in the Garvey judgment.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has offered a weak defence to these charges and it is a weak defence the public has already made its judgment on.  No defence weak or otherwise, however, can be offered by the Taoiseach to the charges that he completely mismanaged this crisis.  Not only did the Taoiseach show a complete lack of leadership, he shut down essential communication with the Garda Commissioner and the relevant Minister and kept himself deliberately in a position of wilful ignorance of key facts.  In its own polite and professional tone, the commission is also scathing of the "serious information deficits and multiple failures of communication" over which the Taoiseach presided.  The crisis being dealt with was a considerable one.  Even now, we do not know if the final report of the Fennelly commission will conclude whether the systematic recording of Garda station calls was legal.  The Attorney General stated that there had been "wholesale violation of the law by An Garda Siochana", describing this as "criminal activity".  In her own words, speaking to the Fennelly commission, this was "a most grievous matter".</p></speech>

I note that the Taoiseach did not offer any apology to the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  At minimum, the Taoiseach made the decision to send Mr. Purcell out to Mr. Callinan's home late at night when the Taoiseach did not have the full facts at his disposal.  As such, the Taoiseach owes that man an apology.  Perhaps some of the Taoiseach's own party front bench should visit him in his home late at night and inform him that, if asked the following day, the vast majority of his parliamentary party would not express confidence in him.  Maybe then, the Taoiseach would understand the very hollow distinction between being sacked and merely becoming resigned.</p></speech>

We have had the Fennelly commission and people, of course, are entitled to their own opinions about the circumstances that gave rise to the Commissioner's retirement.  However, there are some things that no one can dispute.  We had a commission of inquiry established in law and chaired by Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly, a respected retired Supreme Court judge.  He is the only person who interviewed all of the key people involved and reviewed all of the evidence that was available.  His conclusions were clear that the central claim made by the Opposition against the Taoiseach was not true.  Despite these findings, we are having a debate today for some reason on a motion of confidence.  I remember when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin first became leader of his party, one of his preferred catch phrases was to say "That's old politics".  To me, this is classic old politics; getting personal rather than focusing on the issues; scoring points, slinging mud in the hope that some of it sticks; and trying to get one over on the opposing party.  It is old politics.  There is a new leader, but it is very definitely the same old Fianna F&aacute;il.</p><p>In assessing whether the House and the country have confidence in the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and the Government, we need to remember where we were before Deputy Enda Kenny was elected as Taoiseach to lead the country.  Four years ago, the economy was in free fall.  Europe and the IMF were calling all of the shots.  Unemployment was soaring, forced emigration had returned and home values and incomes were plummeting.  Today, we are the fastest growing economy in Europe, perhaps growing even faster than China.  Some 120,000 jobs have been created in the past three years.  Unemployment has decreased from 15% to 9.5%, we are turning the tide on emigration, incomes, home values and living standards are starting to recover and the national debt is decreasing again.  Surely any reasoned or fair analysis would have to give the Taoiseach and the Government some credit for the leadership that brought about this turnaround, but the Members opposite cannot bring themselves to do so.  Rather, they would try to bring someone down, just as they would like to bring the country down again by returning to the politics and economics of the past.<br/><br/>I wish to state my confidence in the Attorney General.  Here we enter into important constitutional territory.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of motions of no confidence in a Taoiseach, we can all at least understand that they are a regular part of the Punch and Judy political process with its own history and traditions.  However, there is something deeply disturbing about the way one party has attempted to drag the Attorney General into this dispute.  In doing so, it is playing politics with the Constitution itself.  The position of the Attorney General is governed by Article 30 of the Constitution, which provides that the Attorney General shall not be a member of the Government.  Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, in McLoughlin <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Welfare, stated in the Supreme Court that the Attorney General  &quot;is specifically excluded from being a member of the Government, which again underlines his special position&quot;, in this case her position.  The role of the Attorney General could be considered as &quot;the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion&quot;, as prescribed by Article 31, and as guardian of the public interest.  The Attorney General is also the key institutional link between the Executive and the Judiciary.  What this means, and what the Opposition has chosen to ignore, is that, given the nature of the role of the Attorney General, he or she ought not to be dragged into political controversy or made subject to gratuitous attack.  This does not mean that an Attorney General cannot be held to account,-----</p></speech>

It has also exposed a dangerous lack of understanding about the Constitution and how it is protected.  Fianna F&aacute;il used to boast that it was a "slightly constitutional" party.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been so desperate to steal its clothes and, indeed, votes, that it seems to have stolen this as well, except that Sinn F&eacute;in is more accurately a slightly unconstitutional party.  For too many years, it tried to subvert the Constitution.  Now, it damages by accident where once it tried to do so by design.</p>  <p>  This motion is a tired distraction from a bored and frustrated Opposition, one with no vision or programme and possessed only of carping negativity.  Its only desire is to court popularity by being all things to all people, offering to get rid of taxes and spend more on every worthy project but with no plan on how to fund that.  As the one-time ally - Syriza in Greece - of some on the Opposition benches has found out, government requires that one take realistic positions and decisions.</p>  <p>  We in the Government have full confidence in the Taoiseach and the Attorney General.  We stand over the inquiry that has vindicated them.  We vote to set aside this distraction from the business of government and from the concerns of people.  We reject the distorted claims of the Opposition, we reject a motion that was born out of ignorance, and we have answered it with the facts.</p></speech>

The post office network plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike.  However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year.  It remains Government policy that An Post remain a strong and viable company.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the changing commercial environment the Minister established the Post Office Network Business Development Group, of which I a member, earlier this year.  The group's remit is to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network.  The group presented its initial report to the Minister in May 2015 and outlined, in summary, that the future of the post office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services, including basic banking for the unbanked, Government services, social capital and enterprise, and white labelling of financial and other products.</p><p> To gain further insight into these areas, a public consultation exercise was held from 16 June to 28 July.  Interested parties were invited to submit their views on the initial report.  A total of 16 responses were received, and a summary of these responses together with the initial report is published on the Department's website.  It is clear from the responses received that there is a strong public desire to maintain the nationwide network of post offices.  While An Post remains a trusted brand, with 1,132 active company- and contractor-operated post offices as well as 125 postal agencies, it needs to further diversify into areas such as financial services and continue to develop attractive products and services that customers want and need.  The consultation responses will assist the group in identifying opportunities that can benefit the post office network and will inform the final report, which I expect to be submitted to the Minister later in the autumn.</p></reply>

The post office network and its maintenance have been matters of debate or discussion in this Chamber for 20 years or more.  I will be bringing forward legislation - I hope it will be taken in this D&aacute;il session - that will change the memorandum of understanding of An Post to ensure there is a universal obligation for An Post to maintain the business network as it currently is.  Anything else only amounts to paying lip service to the post office network.  I have always said that unless we have measures enshrined in legislation to the effect that the post office network must be maintained, retail outlets in communities throughout the country will continue to dwindle.  We have seen what the Department of Social Protection has done in recent times.  In a debate in this House in early spring of this year, we were informed by the Minister of State in that Department that the letters in question had been withdrawn by the Department.  However, all the new social welfare reforms encourage people to use banks rather than the post offices.  The point I am making is that regardless of the rhetoric or goodwill that exists in terms of the post office network, if the Government continues to encourage the preference for banks rather than using the post office network, we are at nothing.</p></speech>

The social welfare contract is the kernel of the matter and is critical to post offices at the moment.  We have to look at the broad spectrum, including services that are available in other departments within counties.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the consultation process.  Deputies can see all the submissions on the Department's website.  We should listen to the post office people themselves.  A campaign is under way at the moment as part of which post office proprietors are inviting politicians in.  I have met a number of them.  In one particular town a postmistress came up with the idea of having a one-stop shop and tourism information outlet along the Wild Atlantic Way.  We have to look at all the options.  We have to look at footfall, but we have to look at the bread-and-butter issues as well, and the Government contracts are critical to that.</p></speech>

It was stated previously that the encouragement to use banks rather than post offices would be withdrawn.  Will the Minister of State take this matter back to his Department and make the case for withdrawing these statements in the vast majority of new social welfare forms which encourage people to use banks instead of post offices?  Will the Minister of State do that?  When the small tranche of legislation that I will introduce to ensure a universal network of post offices materialises, will the Minister of State and his Department accept it?</p></speech>

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to providing 40% of its electricity energy, 12% of its heating energy and 10% of its transport power from renewable sources.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, especially in the heat and transport sectors.  Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity.</p>  <p>  To further support the use of renewable electricity and heat, the Department launched two separate consultations on 31 July 2015 on support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive.  While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme.  Subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes will become available in 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland aims to meet its target for renewable transport mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels.  Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target.  The Minister, Deputy White, intends to initiate a consultation on this over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Minister is finalising a White Paper on energy policy, which will be published by the end of the year.  The overall objective of the White Paper is to provide a coherent joined-up policy statement aimed at ensuring that Ireland has a modern, sustainable, secure and cost-effective integrated energy system which will support the transition to a largely decarbonised society and economy by 2050.  The White Paper will be set in the context of broader EU energy policy, as recently articulated in both the Energy Union strategy and the EU 2030 climate and energy framework document for coherent climate and energy policies.</p></speech>

A lack of energy strategy has caused us to fall behind somewhat on our targets at the minute.  It was scary to see the kind of ham-fisted attempt that was made to impose the massive wind farms in the midlands with little real discussion with the people living in the midlands.  I expect the White Paper on energy will give clear guidelines on how we will approach our energy needs in the coming years in a way that respects and enjoys the support of the citizens of this land.</p>  <p>  Will it take into account the prediction last weekend from the chief executive of the ESB that one third of Irish households will be generating their own electricity and moving towards self-sufficiency within ten years?  Will this aspect be taken into account in the White Paper?  What impact will that have on our ability to reach the targets?</p></speech>

My predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, worked very hard on a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom that did not come to fruition.  It is off the agenda now.  A good deal of focus went into that at the time.  Anyway, the White Paper is an opportunity to pursue the agenda of the three main pillars, namely, security of supply, competitiveness, and - this relates to Deputy Colreavy's second point - self-sufficiency over a period.  As I have said before, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past.</p><p>Mistakes were made in the approach by the private sector regarding what went on in the midlands, such as the forward planning announcements of vast numbers of turbines without consulting the community.  If any lesson can be learned from that, it should be that we should be big and mature enough to put up our hands.  If we are to have an energy supply challenge, we will need to develop the grid in a mature and responsible way, in consultation with communities.</p></speech>

I assume the White Paper will also cover aspects of retrofitting and maximising the efficiency of dwellings and businesses.  </p>  <p>  On wind turbines, in the absence of revised guidelines there is still a very great fear that the old guidelines are being used by companies that are imposing wind turbines on populations.  I argued at the time that there should be a moratorium on the development of industrial scale wind turbine farms - I am not referring to individual or small numbers of wind turbines - until such time as the new guidelines were put in place.  If we go through another episode of imposing unwanted solutions on a captive population, it will do a disservice to the development of renewable energy in the nation.</p>  <p>  I am concerned to hear that there may be differences of opinion between the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government on, for example, set-back distances.  Will the Minister of State comment on that aspect?</p></speech>

Once those proposals and policies come to the fore, we will be in a position to elaborate further on them.</p>  <p>  On tensions between Departments, I do not see what happened as a tension.  There is ongoing engagement and it is important to note that all of the experience of the past has to be part of the conversations on new guidelines.  </p>  <p>  On whether we can put a moratorium on any type of development between periods of time, there are inherent challenges.  The biggest lesson we can learn has two fronts.  First, the community has to be pivotal in the conversation and local authorities can play a major role in that regard.  Second, there is a great opportunity for communities to have self-sustaining energy production.  I was in a secondary school a number of months ago which has an electricity bill of around &euro;10,000 a year.  If it had the option of generating and providing its own electricity, it would be a win-win from community, security of supply and affordability points of view.  A lot of very concrete and competent submissions have been made to the White Paper at a community level.  That is where we must have a focus.</p></speech>

The national broadband plan draft intervention strategy which was published on 15 July 2015 sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention.  It sets out the key elements of the intervention, what services are proposed and how they will be delivered.  It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention, including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds envisaged, the length of the contract for services and whether the network should be public or privately owned.</p><p>The draft intervention strategy has been developed following intensive engagement with industry and wider stakeholders.  In addition, the European Commission has set out detailed guidelines on what is required to obtain state aid approval for Government interventions in the broadband sector.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has followed these guidelines when formulating the proposed intervention strategy.  Through ongoing commercial investment, most of our cities and towns will benefit from high speed broadband over the coming years.  The areas that are not covered by commercial investment are the target for State-funded investment. </p><p>Last November, the Minister published a national high speed coverage map for 2016, which is available at The map shows Ireland with two colours, blue and amber, and was developed based on the most up-to-date information available at the time of publication.  The areas marked blue represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016.  The areas marked amber represent those areas where the State intends to intervene to ensure those areas will have access to high speed broadband services and this includes all the offshore islands. </p><p>The Department is currently in the process of updating the map, taking into consideration any new information received or operator announcements made of any new plans.  It is expected that an updated version of the map will be published before the end of this year.  The national broadband plan's ambition is to achieve 100% access to high speed broadband by the end of 2020, with 85% of all premises covered by 2018.  I assure the Deputy that communities in offshore islands will be served either through commercial investment or State intervention.</p></speech>

It is also important in preventing further depopulation of the islands.  Broadband could provide employment, online education and online help for start-up businesses, as well as combatting isolation.  Islanders do not have the access to night classes, entertainment, etc., that we have on the mainland.</p>  <p>  I have visited practically all the islands and I have a long association with one in particular.  Its mobile phone service is also on the decline and the broadband service causes problems.  The national broadband plan states that "[It] aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland" and the Minister of State mentioned the intervention strategy.  The strategy for the islands is very much on the long finger and the Minister of State needs to re-examine the issue.  I ask for direct engagement with islanders because they are the ones who know exactly what is needed to serve their communities.</p></speech>

This debate is important because the national broadband plan will go to public procurement by the end of this year.  As part of that intervention, it will target the 30% of Ireland, including the islands, that is not commercially viable.  The winning bidder or bidders in the procurement process will be in a position to provide that service.  No decision has been made on where we start or which areas should get broadband first.  It is important to have that debate and this is an opportunity to highlight the potential of the islands.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the islands are an integral part of the Wild Atlantic Way along the west coast.  Given that hundreds of thousands of people intend to visit the area and will need broadband services when they are on holiday, we should include it in the debate.  It is an important area which needs priority broadband intervention.</p></speech>

That is another debate.  We have to accept that islands and islanders are different.  My experience is that islanders are dedicated to their community and want to stay on the islands.  Broadband is a major step forward.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned 2020, which is another five years down the line.  The Blasket Islands are a glorified museum today and we do not want any more of our vibrant islands to lose their population.  Eir has begun a nationwide competition to find the next Belcarra and is looking for a village or community to connect to fibre broadband.  It involves an investment of &euro;750,000 and one of the offshore islands has applied.  Why is the same type of investment and encouragement not in place for all islands?  A competition which one island may or may not win should not be the solution.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to ensure the islanders are engaged with directly through the national broadband scheme.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that 85% of the 30% intervention area will be completed by 2018, but this work will start next year.  In the Deputy's contribution she spoke about the potential on the islands and those living on the islands.  To give a particular example, I met a person last week who works in Scotland and on Arranmore Island, who is looking for direct connectivity between Glasgow and Donegal and Arranmore Island.  She highlighted the absolute need for broadband in the work in which she is involved.  I completely take the Deputy's point and her proposal or suggestion to engage with the islands on the issue.  This engagement has started because there has been much public discourse coming from the islands.  The Deputy also mentioned education.  The Department funds an art course on Sherkin Island and broadband is a prerequisite for that course.</p></speech>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended.  Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on mobile network operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  However, given that mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by several factors.  These include topography, the capacity of the network and, more generally, the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennae.  Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennae due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers.</p>  <p>  In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are various initiatives under way to achieve this aim.  The commercial telecommunications sector is investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks.  This includes some &euro;850 million invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 multi-band spectrum auction run by ComReg.  Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide.  These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrading mobile services nationwide.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae.  The Telecoms and Internet Federation, TIF, which is part of IBEC, has been quite proactive in seeking to meet local authorities and public representatives to discuss fully the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience.  I encourage all local authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.</p></speech>

There are misconceptions.  Yesterday, when taking part in a debate with me, a leading member of the media made the point that at this stage it is only the tops of mountains and the bottoms of bogs which do not have mobile phone coverage.  Parts of Dublin city have very poor mobile phone coverage.  Our local radio station, County Sound, did a trawl and took complaints from different parts of County Cork on which we are trying to follow up.  The same could be done by every local radio station the length and breadth of the country, no more, I am sure, than in the Minister of State's county of Donegal.</p>  <p>  It is a crisis.  What were blackspots 15 years ago at the turn of the new millennium are still blackspots.  I contend that some parts of the country have got worse.  I was quite shocked and worried by the debate we had yesterday that people would accept or think there is almost universal mobile phone coverage.  There is no ten miles in any county outside of the cities where one can travel where one's phone call would not be dropped.  It is time the Minister and the communications regulator took it upon themselves to audit what is out there and what type of mobile phone coverage we have.  It is a tool of modern-day living, no more than any other modern convenience.</p></speech>

There is no point saying there are no problems because it is a difficulty.  One hears many reasons.  When the Deputy made the point yesterday on the radio, he heard technical reasons it is not happening, but the texts coming in from the public were in support of the Deputy's point that coverage has deteriorated.  There are all sorts of reasons and I will not waste the Deputy's time or the public's time on whether it is because data gets priority over phone calls or whether it is because of an increase in data being communicated.  There are antenna challenges.  I take the Deputy's point on doing an audit of mobile phone coverage on a national basis.  It is something about which we cannot be complacent.  Mobile coverage is as important as broadband.  People do business on their hands-free kit on the road.  There is nothing more frustrating than dropping a call, and it does happen.  It happened to me a couple of times today on the way to Dublin from Donegal.  It happens quite regularly in Northern Ireland also.  Perhaps we could widen the debate.  I will certainly speak to my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to see whether different factors are involved in Northern Ireland, whether it is looking to do things differently and whether there is something we could learn together.  The same sequence of dropping calls happens there as it does in the South when I am <i>en route </i>to Dublin.</p></speech>

This type of language frightened me because they were saying that if they increased the power there would be better coverage, but why is this not the case?  According to legislation and statutory instrument there must be 70% coverage of the population.  This should be increased to 100% of the population.  The people from Kishkeam, Rockchapel and Freemount in my area, or any other towns, villages and communities with bad or no mobile phone coverage from Kerry to Donegal or Galway to Dublin, should not be disenfranchised.  Why should they be without mobile phone coverage?  RTE had 99.9% coverage back in the 1960s when it was first established.  The technology has developed beyond what was contemplated 50 years ago.  Why do these companies not provide mobile phone coverage?  It is a crisis.  Will the Minister of State not move it to a committee but rather take it on himself, with his senior colleague and the communications regulator, to embark within a couple of weeks on finding out the mobile phone coverage available to the citizens of the State in every community the length and breadth of the country?</p></speech>

There is a critical mix of stakeholders, be it the industry or local authorities.  We can look at what did not go right in the past, when we built new motorways, and if there was enough engagement between the Government and the National Roads Authority, NRA, in the building of antennae beside motorways.  We can look at what went wrong but the critical issue is to move forward.  We should do anything we can as a Department to increase the engagement with different providers in the private sector.  In my constituency, where there have been gaps, lapses or an unwinding of the service in certain areas, representatives of the private sector have met people in the community.  We need to do more of that and I encourage service providers to let people know what is planned in a particular area and, if there are deficits, we need to meet them head on.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I fully appreciate the fact that the emergency call answering service, ECAS, has been operating to an extremely high standard, with the dedication of the operators and the quality of the service they provide being a major contributor to this.  The ECAS operators handle calls effectively and efficiently, often in response to stressful and distressing situations for citizens.  The service answers more than 2 million calls annually and has one of the fastest emergency call answering times in Europe.</p>  <p>  BT Ireland has operated ECAS on behalf of my Department under a concession agreement since July 2010 and is responsible for the conditions and resourcing of the service.  BT Ireland employs a third party contractor, Conduit Ireland Limited, to provide operators to answer calls.  Operators at ECAS call answering centres in Navan, Ballyshannon and Dublin process emergency calls and forward these to the appropriate emergency service as quickly and effectively as possible.  BT Ireland uses an industry standard model to determine the number of operators required across each centre. It forecasts the number of operators required to meet the necessary operational requirements on a monthly basis and notifies Conduit six weeks in advance.  BT Ireland has a health and safety policy of having a minimum of two operators on each site at any one time.  This facilitates appropriate breaks, ensures the work environment is safe and allows operators time to recover if they have taken especially stressful calls.  In addition, BT line managers directly answer calls if required.</p>  <p>  The number and cost of operators is assessed annually by the Commission for Communications Regulation as part of its annual review of the cost of the ECAS service.  An expert report commissioned by ComReg is appended to this review.  The latest expert report was appended to a decision on costs by ComReg published in January 2015.  The expert report states that ECAS "is run effectively against the service targets and quality requirements and overall is approaching 'leading practice' from a performance perspective".  Furthermore, ComReg's review concluded that an increase to the operator&rsquo;s hourly rate was reasonable and notified BT Ireland accordingly.  This is a matter now for BT and Conduit and I understand that discussions between the two companies are advanced, with a view to addressing ComReg's findings. I hope, therefore, that the matter can be dealt with quickly, given the important service that ECAS operators provide.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the professionalism and efficiency of the emergency call answering service.  It operates 24-7 all year round, engaging with services and, occasionally, the Coast Guard.  It is absolutely vital.  However, there is a high turnover of staff at one centre, at East Point in Dublin.  This high turnover of staff means there is a loss of very valuable skills and expertise, and the Minister of State may ask why this is so.</p>  <p>  The Communication Workers' Union did a survey and found 100% dissatisfaction with the rate of pay.  In the ComReg review, it was indicated that the hourly rate should increase.  We know the work is essential to the safety of the public and yet the employer continues to ignore legitimate concerns from the workers.  The Minister of State indicated that he hoped this is a matter for BT and Conduit and that the companies will engage, but this is a public contract awarded by the Department responsible for communications.  The workers want to be treated with dignity and respect and they want the right to be recognised by a trade union.  In other words, they want the right to collective bargaining.  That was also supported overwhelmingly in the survey.  I ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure the company respects the workers' basic right to collective bargaining, as that is where these issues can be addressed.</p></speech>

In the correspondence I have seen, as the Deputy has correctly alluded to, people use the two words, "dignity" and "respect".  I am hopeful that the ongoing conversation between Conduit and BT Ireland will lead to a conclusion to this that will be favourable.  I am not in a position to say whether this will happen or what will be the outcome, but I am hopeful that when people are talking and engaged in the matter, we will get an outcome that can be accepted by the workers.</p></speech>

I know the workers who handle the calls to the ambulance and fire service are members of SIPTU but the emergency call answer personnel are being denied this right.  ComReg also indicated that because of the critical nature of an emergency call, the system cannot be run like a fully commercialised call centre.  I am not too sure if that has been taken into account.</p>  <p>  One other aspect concerns staff cover, which affects annual leave.  I know some workers were finding it difficult to get annual leave to which they are entitled because of the cover aspect.  I do not share the Minister of State's confidence that the companies will deal with these matters in a fair way that respects workers' rights.  If that does not happen, will the Minister then use his influence to ensure the companies - the employer - will respect worker rights, and especially the right to join and engage with a trade union?</p></speech>

I am clearly not involved in negotiations or conversations between BT Ireland and Conduit but I am led to believe that conversations are ongoing.  I am hopeful there will be a successful outcome.  The Deputy asked if the Minister can intervene if that is not the case.  At this stage we must focus on a successful outcome, which is important from the workers' perspective.  It is also important because we are talking about a stressful environment and these people are at the coalface.  They receive phone calls that can be very stressful from time to time.  It is important we highlight this.  The Deputy has raised this issue publicly and I encourage BT Ireland and Conduit to take the issue seriously.  I have no doubt they are doing so.  I hope we can have a favourable outcome for the workers.</p></speech>

It is timely for us to have an update on this.  The issue of post office closures, particularly in rural areas, is an old chestnut.  What is envisaged as the way forward by the development group is for post offices to be put on a sustainable footing.  We know there has been a change in the number of people using the postal system, so post offices have had to diversify.  Equally, we know that in rural areas there is a deficit in services like banking and so on, so it would seem that post offices could be in a position, if properly supported, to step into that breach and provide vital services to rural communities.  There is also the issue of social welfare payments into banks.  If the post offices had a range of services to receive money in that fashion, it could address the issue of such payments having to be made to banks.</p></reply>

The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and I are on the group so there is political input.  There are other representative groups and stakeholders as well.  From day one, Mr. Kerr was consistent in saying that he wanted outcomes and proposals to go directly to the Minister.</p><p>Later in the autumn, after all the consultation input has been collated, we will be making proposals that will not only be going to the Minister, Deputy White's desk, but to Cabinet.  Within that, as we discussed with Deputy Moynihan earlier in respect of social welfare and other Government contracts, there are bread and butter issues with the post office which needs these contracts to survive.  That has been the focus and has been very much the way Bobby Kerr has steered this.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Bobby's role in this.</p> <p> It is not finished; there is still a lot of work to do.  It is not about convincing the electorate that things might happen.  Key commitments must be given by various Departments, whether the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, where there are services through local authorities that could potentially help post offices.  The Deputy's raising of this question today helps to feed into this process and I thank her for that.</p></speech>

Maybe there should be a minimum requirement that people would have these basic services in their small market towns and we should have a reasonable ambition of how this might be delivered.  I do not mean every town, but that people would not have to travel beyond a certain radius to access some basic services that people in cities and big urban centres take for granted but for which increasingly people in rural Ireland must travel to avail of.  That would consolidate communities.  The post office is vital, but it is part of a bigger picture of services that we need to copperfasten for rural Ireland.  Often these issues are dealt with in a more <i>ad hoc </i>way.  I know this is more the portfolio of the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and it requires looking at the bigger picture, but the post offices are crucial.</p></speech>

Whether one is on Tory Island, where the postmaster has told me that is where people meet on pension day, where they talk and congregate, or in Letterkenny, Castlebar or Westport, one will be meeting people in the post office and that must be the focus.  The bread and butter issue in respect of the service providers, the postmistresses and postmasters is keeping the offices open.  That does require Government contracts and we must keep the focus there.  As I said earlier, a certain person who runs a post office suggested to me that there is a role for the Wild Atlantic Way.  As a Mayo person, Deputy Mulherin can think of post offices along the Wild Atlantic Way, in small villages and towns, which could be information points for people coming in and wanting to know about the services in a particular area.  Ideas like that are critical in forming the basis of Bobby Kerr's report and it is important that we continue to feed into it as legislators and remain vigilant.  We have to look at other countries too.  I saw a photograph recently of a post office in Australia, which was a hub, a place where people congregated, no different from in Ireland.  It is the same the world over, but we have to ensure their survival through continued Government intervention.</p></speech>

Further to Deputy Mulherin's question, as the Central Bank is pushing towards a cashless society and as more moneys, including social welfare moneys, are lodged to bank accounts, can the Minister of State explain to the House the obstacles to An Post providing banking services and, in particular, every post office having an ATM, not just inside it, but one that is accessible to the community through the weekend as well?  Many communities do not have an ATM, which is now a real hindrance as people carry less cash for a variety of reasons.  The Minister of State mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way.  I made a submission to the group with regard to tourist information offices.  It is not only on the Wild Atlantic Way that we need tourist information and post offices are ideally equipped to provide tourist information, both on a national basis and information that is particular to the locality.  Maybe they could charge commission for some tourist services.  Is there an obstacle to that?  What is the obstacle to a greater array of banking services being provided by post offices?</p></speech>

I compliment everyone in the tourism sector in County Clare in that regard.  He is right that there are opportunities.  I am glad he made that submission as well.  That is a proactive way of doing that.  I do not think there are any obstacles to providing the card.  When we think of providing a card for a post office, we do not have to be looking at the possibility of an ATM at a post office because if a person has a current account and has a card, they can use it anywhere, in any other banking outlet.  There is work going on in respect of that.  Key discussions about financial services and opportunities are happening.  To instil confidence in the public, we have to ensure that this agenda stays live.</p></speech>

It deals mainly with the Minister of State's role and that of his Department in providing for greater financial inclusion, specifically in the establishment of the standard bank account and the role the post office network can play in the roll-out of that.  I wanted to see where that factored into the work the Minister of State's Department is doing.</p></reply>

A pilot project for a standard bank account was completed in March 2013 after a nine-month pilot period.  A total of 205 accounts were opened during the pilot.  The report of the working group on the pilot project noted a number of reasons for the low level of take-up, including the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a standard bank account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is currently transposing the payment accounts directive, which requires that all consumers legally resident in the EU must have access to a payment account with basic features, regardless of their financial circumstances.  The directive must be transposed by September 2016 and the Department of Finance is considering how to make progress on this issue in light of the experience of the standard bank account pilot project.</p>  <p>  The initial report of the post office network business development group was presented to the Minister in May 2015.  The report identified the provision of financial services, including those for the unbanked, as fundamental to the future viability of the post office network.  There are several advantages in offering basic banking services through the post office network, including the trust factor and the community focus of the network.  Successfully aligning these advantages with the provision of suitable basic banking products has the capacity both to support financial inclusion and enhance the role of the post office network.</p>  <p>  While it is too early to indicate the contents of the final report, financial services will be an important component of it.  I expect the final report to be submitted to the Minister later in the autumn.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned in his response the pilot project that was run by the Department of Finance.  The remarkable thing about that was that An Post was not included in the pilot project.  That is why there was such a low uptake of the standard bank account, because people simply did not trust the banks enough to open an account with them.  The vast majority of the 17% of people who are unbanked are probably people in receipt of social welfare who use the post office network to get their payments.  The fact the post office should be able to have the standard bank account makes perfect sense in terms of financial inclusion and promoting financial inclusion.  Unfortunately, the only ones who do not seem to see that are those in Government.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the post office development group launched its consultation in May.  On the same day it published its six-point consultation, the Department of Social Protection was sending out forms to clients encouraging them to open bank accounts and to move away from the post office.  There are different Departments working to different agendas and there is not a united vision across Government in this regard.  Unfortunately, that is the role on which the Minister of State's Department is falling down.  He must get a grip on it and ensure there is a uniform response right across Government.</p></speech>

It will be subject to discussion by Cabinet which will also discuss acceptance of the proposals.  It has to be uniform, united and proactive.  Otherwise, there would have been no point doing this in the first place.  I am not here to be part of a business development group which is not serious about what it intends doing.  There has to be an outcome, be it financial or through Government intervention.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to trust in banking.  Credit unions and post offices are in the community.  Those in the banking sector, including many who are retired, would speak of the lack of community engagement today whereas bankers knew their communities 15, 20 or 25 years ago.  The credit unions and the post offices know the people in their communities and they are now at an advantage in terms of winning the trust of the public.  What we have got to do is build on that.</p></speech>

I would be worried about the commitment of other Departments to build on that, particularly considering the Department of Finance did not even include An Post in the initial roll-out and trial project for the standard bank account and has been dragging its heels on including An Post in it ever since.  Given what the Department of Social Protection did on the day the working group published its consultation, how one will achieve that within Government will be key to the success in ensuring financial inclusion is achieved and the post office network is protected and allowed to build and develop.  That is the big task the Minister of State has ahead of him.</p></speech>

That is why we have a business development group and why Mr. Bobby Kerr was appointed.  However, there is no point having a group if one does not do anything with it.  Mr. Kerr and all the members of the group are intent on putting proposals to Government, because it has to feed back in and those proposals must be tangible.  Deputy Pringle is correct that the letters issuing from the Department of Social Protection eroded confidence in the future viability of post offices and created difficulties, and we need to be united.  It needs to be a Government approach.  The Government commitment is there and it is about following through on the commitment.  That can only be done by having proposals, listing them and stating where we will follow through.</p>  <p>  That is also subject to procurement.  Government cannot provide all these services merely by stating it is providing them.  There are difficulties, and the House will be aware of the difficulties that arose with a certain service that is being rolled out at present.</p></speech>

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  More specifically, the SEAI has calculated that 22.6% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.2% of transport were met from renewable sources.  While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, especially in the heat and transport sectors.  Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity.</p>  <p>  Regarding renewable electricity, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT, schemes underpin the development of a range of technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year.  In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the building regulations, the 2014 draft bioenergy plan recommended the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  On 31 July, the Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive.  While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme.  Subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes will become available in 2016.</p>  <p>  As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels.  Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target, and the Minister intends to initiate a consultation on this over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Hydro power counts for only 0.5% of our energy and other renewables 6%.  Even though there is an increase in gas power, which generates lower emissions, nevertheless it is still a fossil fuel.</p>  <p>  There are reports that we will not achieve the 2020 targets, and yet the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report tells us that clean renewable energy has saved Ireland &euro;1 billion in fossil fuel imports.  The point I would make is we cannot afford to miss the 2020 targets because we will face significant fines if we do.</p>  <p>  My question is about the new technologies, such as offshore wind energy.  Does the Minister of State accept that offshore wind energy can deliver significant amounts of the renewable energy shortfall for Ireland?</p></speech>

We import coal from Poland.  We import coal on ships from Colombia.  That is the reality of the world we live in.</p>  <p>  With the price of oil being so low at present, the consumer-led consumption of that product from an economic point of view is great in that it is cheaper for consumers, but at the same time we still must keep the focus on renewables.  That is why we must be as proactive as ever, through the university sector, in the progression of offshore wind, hydro and tidal wave.  While that research and development is going on within the universities and they work closely with industry, we must up the ante.  I note one particular submission to the White Paper is looking at floating turbines off the west coast.  We must be ambitious.</p>  <p>  A big focus of this House over the past four and half years has been on the economy and trying to get us out of the mess we were in.  We must look at new technologies, how quickly technology is changing, and be ambitious and creative around that engagement between the university sector and industry.  Government must support that in whatever way possible.</p></speech>

If we can bring the two together, then I think we might see some progress.  According to new figures published, we are more reliant on imported energy than almost every other country in the European Union.  Among the new technologies is wave technology, and wastewater is also a resource.</p>  <p>  I accept that wind technology and wind farms are controversial.  In that regard, I will go back to my favourite island, which, in 1986, had a pilot project using wind turbines with a German firm because both the ESB and the powers that be did not want to know.  The project, which went on for ten years, produced wind energy which they sold in to the national grid as well.  It cut down diesel consumption, but then the ESB came along with the underground cable.  It is an example of where a new technology was community driven.  It was community led and it was very much a community approach.  There is a need to be more creative when it comes to those issues.</p></speech>

If we can provide offshore floating wind turbines, as an example, we should be examining and harnessing that potential.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is in fisheries, and there are proposals around Ireland's ocean wealth.  Within that there is the ongoing research, urgency and creativity around what we can use off our west coast, and off our east coast, for that matter.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for the question.  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  A well-balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility is essential to Irish consumers.  While fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix as we transit to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, significant progress is being made in increasing the share of renewables in the mix.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for 2014 indicate that energy import dependency fell to 85% in 2014.  This was driven by lower demand for coal, oil and gas coupled with increased indigenous production of energy.  The bulk of the increase in indigenous energy was from renewable sources and the remainder from peat.</p><p>In summer 2014, the European Commission, under the European energy security strategy, carried out stress tests in the event of a Russia-Ukraine gas disruption.  This stress test was co-ordinated for Ireland by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The results showed that Ireland was likely to be one of the countries that would be least likely to be adversely affected.  The results also showed that, in the event of such a disruption, gas prices would be likely to increase.  The European energy security strategy also proposes to i<font color="#333333">ncrease energy production in the EU and to diversify supplier countries and routes.  Energy security is a key pillar of the European Commission's recently published European energy union strategy, which Ireland strongly supports.</font></p><p>In Ireland we have a policy framework that is incentivising both an increase in indigenous renewable energy and the exploration and production of indigenous non-renewable fuel sources.  Both of these energy sources contribute to reducing import dependency.  Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>There are a number of other important measures which also enhance our energy security such as EU funding for infrastructure, EU legislation that promotes co-operation on energy security, energy demand reduction measures, good emergency planning and oil storage reserves.</p></reply>

We are very vulnerable and are at the mercy of international markets and prices.  We saw what happened to Ukraine with its reliance on natural gas from Russia.  Over the weekend I read a story about a green plan by firefighters at the fire station in Kilbarrack who are using old batteries.  The green plan was applied to every station in Dublin and has generated &euro;7.5 million in public sector savings.  Dublin Fire Brigade has cut its energy consumption by 44%.  There is the creativity coming in.  We should take those examples and see them as urgent, and examine making more carbon-neutral workplaces.  We are very energy inefficient in this country.</p></speech>

We are part of the European Union, a collective grouping of countries with the same sense of responsibility.  Whether it is EU funding for infrastructure or EU legislation that promotes co-operation on energy security or energy demand reduction measures, we must work together.  It is critical that we continue that co-operation and we cannot be exposed.  Although I am very conscious that we are an island, we are also connected in other ways, be it at European Commission or European Parliament level.  My colleagues in the European Parliament are very focused on energy security issues.  There is an electorate in this country that is very genuine, sincere and passionate about climate change and, politically, we must tap into that new energy - pardon the pun - and vibrancy in a young, smart, intelligent electorate that wants to contribute to meeting the challenge.</p></speech>

I want to put the issue in the broader context of climate change.  We are moving into sustainable development goals and Ireland has been playing a very strong role at EU and UN level.  However, we are giving with one hand - and we have a very strong reputation regarding development aid - but taking with the other unless we address the climate change issues and tackle our emissions.  As well as our own energy needs, there is the broader picture for our planet.  One of the new sustainable development goals, which replace the millennium development goals, is about seriously tackling climate change.  We cannot be hypocritical about this, giving all this development aid - and we have a high reputation there - and taking on the other hand because we are not supporting measures to combat climate change.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  It is important and it is a wider context within the climate change Bill, which will be discussed in this House and the Seanad.  There must be an integrated departmental approach.  I recently met a group in Letterkenny regarding climate change and energy security.  As legislators, we are faced with difficult decisions.  We must use our place at a global level, and Ireland can do it, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, at a UN and European level.  We are doing it, and we must use our strong voice in these different corridors to push for an overall global, European approach to these very challenging issues.</p></speech>

Do we know how much it will cost and will ring-fenced funding will be made available to ensure the more remote areas will have broadband services?

I will take the broader aspects and then read into the record.  We are not putting the costs down in this phase of the conversation.  As the Deputy knows, it will go to a public procurement process.  There will be money available for this Government intervention.  The Department would not have spent time contacting the European Commission to ensure all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted regarding State-led intervention without having the backup, and the Government is committed to it.  There is no plan yet as to which areas will be done first.  While 30% of the land mass is not commercially viable, this could change over the next six months if operators decide to intervene in particular locations.  If the likes of Eircom - now known as Eir - or other companies come in and propose to provide broadband to certain towns, it is important that there would be a commitment there.  My officials are working very hard and very closely with the operators that announce that they will provide broadband in a particular town and there must be the question of responsibility at a private intervention level and at Government level.</p></speech>

I do not doubt that my officials have done their research and examined the best possible solution.  I know that under the SIRO solution in towns, houses are being connected in Cavan at the moment.  There are plans for large towns like Castlebar, Westport and Letterkenny.  The Deputy is correct when he alludes to the age-old core-periphery argument about whether services should always go into more populated areas in the first instance and what happens rural areas in such circumstances.  No decision has yet been made on how this will be rolled out in the 30% of areas that are de facto rural areas.  That decision will probably be made in co-operation between the Department and whoever the preferred bidder or bidders, or successful company or companies, will be.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised issues relating to the importance of the islands.  These are big questions that keep being raised.  As a Sligo man who also represents a large rural population in County Leitrim, Deputy Colreavy wants to ensure there is equity and balance.  I take his points.</p></speech>

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources.  On 31 July last, the Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive.  While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September last, there will be two further opportunities to contribute to this.  Ireland aims to meet its renewable transport targets mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels.  Increased use of electric vehicles will also make a contribution.  Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target.  The Minister intends to initiate a consultation over the coming weeks.  The details requested by the Deputy concerning the sources of renewable electricity generation projects that have been developed, or are in the course of being developed, are available on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites.  Greenhouse gas emissions targets are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

I am more than reasonably satisfied with some of the submissions that have been made.  While the Government has a role to play in this, obviously the private sector will play a big role too.  I am looking forward to the collation of all the submissions that have been made through the White Paper regarding the three pillars of heat, transport and energy.  I think it is critical that we are serious about it.  I am confident that the intricate relationship between the Government and the creative sector within business will provide the solutions.  There are smart people with solutions out there and we have to respond to them.</p></speech>

I happen to agree with the thrust of the minority grouping report, which is that cities drive regions.  I think the amalgamation of Cork city and county councils would have a very negative impact on the capacity of the region to attract foreign direct investment into the future.  I am particularly in favour of a governance structure for the city that would be focused on the development of the city in the cultural, economic and social spheres.  I think the solution that has come forward is an unworkable one.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Kelly, was unduly hasty in accepting this particular proposal.  I note that one of his colleagues on the Government benches, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, has strongly criticised the officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He has blamed that Department for the momentum towards the amalgamation process.</p>  <p>  I disagreed with the decision of the Minister's predecessor, Phil Hogan, to abolish town councils.  I still disagree with it.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, displayed breathtaking cynicism when he arrived on the scene and said that the decision to get rid of the urban and town councils was a bad mistake and that he would reinstate them if he had his way all over again.  He suggested that the Labour Party might even consider reinstating them in a new Government.  For how long more will the public be treated to this kind of theatrics and be taken for fools?  This whole agenda is politically driven.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has clearly driven this particular agenda in relation to Cork.  I happen to know from talking to people in Kilkenny that the amalgamation of city and county is not working there.</p></speech>

The people of Waterford city are very upset about the declining capacity of the urban centre of the city to market itself.  I refer the Minister to the submission to the review panel that was made by William Brady, Jonathan Hall and Brendan O'Sullivan of the UCC department of planning.  I do not believe they had discussions with the review panel.  They have spoken publicly and in detail about how they believe the recommendations will not work.  They have emphasised the need for Cork to concentrate on carving out a niche urban identity, as its competitors are doing.  They suggest that this urban identity will be lost if the merger goes ahead.  They have said that the second challenge is to maintain an identity with Cork's large rural agriculture and food sectors.  They suggest that the towns, villages and coastal communities must equally be considered.  They believe there needs to be a rural counterweight to represent these citizens.</p></speech>

I accept that the chief executive of Cork County Council, Tim Lucey, is now saying he is in favour of it.

He was producing maps and writing to the Department to urge those responsible to get off their backsides and look at extending the city boundary.</p></speech>
