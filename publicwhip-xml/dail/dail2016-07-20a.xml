    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000003#A00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the opportunity to address the House today on Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which is a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 and has the sole purpose of extending by two years an existing transitional period in respect of the registration of centres for people with disabilities.  I will also take this opportunity to say a few words about the broader issue of the safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State which is of paramount importance to me and this Government.  There have been a number of cases coming to light in recent weeks and months which have given me significant cause for concern.  I am joined in this reaction by other Deputies in the House today.  Unacceptable events and practices, mainly historical but also more recent, are coming to light following the RTE Prime Time programme.  It reflects an attitude in the past to people with a disability.  I have major, urgent concerns and during my watch I will protect and guarantee the rights of all people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  It is important.</p>  <p>  Let me make it clear today, I am determined that the utmost priority will be given to the full protection of people with a disability in the care of the State.  Furthermore, I am determined that historical issues will be comprehensively examined and addressed.  The cases in recent media reports are of serious concern but it is important to note they are now coming to light because the system has changed.  Things are far from perfect but in recent years we have introduced new policies and regulation to attempt to prevent this kind of event from happening again.  Since 2013, all residential centres for children and adults with disabilities must be inspected by HIQA.  The regulator is a shining a light into every corner of every centre where our most vulnerable citizens live.  Notwithstanding the reports we read in the media, most of these centres are providing very good person-centred care and support.  </p>  <p>  The inaugural annual report by HIQA on the regulation of centres for people with disabilities published last week found evidence of a high standard of care and a focus on individual residents' needs and preferences in many cases.  It stated that regulation has brought a cultural change to the sector and has steadily led to improvements in the standard of care provided to residents.  My objective will be to ensure that residents are protected from all kinds of abuse.  There are exceptions to this and some HIQA inspection reports do not make for easy reading.  I totally endorse the work of HIQA.  There have been cases where massive improvements have been demanded by HIQA and there have been cases where HIQA has cancelled the registration of centres that are unable to meet the standards required.  I emphasise that regulation is a work in progress and it takes time to bed down these new systems.  The Bill before the House today is a small component in this system.  I will return to its specific provisions shortly. </p>  <p>  On Monday of this week, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I met with HSE officials.  We made very clear and outlined our serious concerns about the recent allegations in the Prime Time programme and we listened to the HSE on a range of measures that are being implemented and have progressed in recent years to improve these matters.  The meeting on Monday was very tough and difficult but we had to put it on the line to ensure the safety of all residents.  This includes the Transforming Lives agenda, which is driving the move towards person-centred, community-based care and the roll-out of the critical policy of safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse.  In addition, the HSE confidential recipient, Ms Leigh Gath, is working diligently to assist people who need to approach a person in confidence to have a concern addressed.  The confidential recipient is another key part of improving safety for residents.  Ms Gath&rsquo;s first annual report set out a range of cases in which she has been involved and was able to assist people with concerns.</p><p>I urge all Deputies, if they have any concerns or issues, to contact Ms Gath.</p> <p> Regarding some of the allegations, I expect to receive shortly from Mr. Conor Dignam, SC, the report which will feed into the terms of reference for a statutory commission of investigation.  This will be established as a priority following agreement on the terms of reference and the approval of the Oireachtas.  When this happens, I will be looking for cross-party support in regard to the commission of inquiry and the terms of reference.</p> <p> I will also receive shortly the independently chaired inter-agency review in regard to the case of "Mary", who lived in a former foster home in the Cork-Kerry region.  As soon as the facts are established, I am determined that every required action will be taken.</p> <p> Actions and developments are in progress.  It is important that everybody is reassured regarding these matters.  None of these vital changes can take effect overnight; all are works in progress.</p> <p> I am committed to developing the framework of regulation and investigation to safeguard and protect people with a disability in the care of the State and one part of this Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which I will now discuss.  </p> <p> The Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, its inspection and regulation of designated centres and the framework for registration of these designated centres.  The measures provided for in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 relate exclusively to residential centres for people with disabilities.  It was planned that all such designated centres for people with disabilities would be inspected and registered by HIQA, or be refused registration, within a three-year period of the relevant section of the Health Act 2007 coming into effect.  This period is now due to expire on 31 October 2016.  Due to the complexities of the disability sector and, in some cases, the significant quality and safety issues identified by HIQA in the first two years of regulation, HIQA alerted the Department of Health in 2015 that it would not be possible to complete a final registration decision for all designated centres which had been deemed to be registered in this way by the end of the transitional period on 31 October 2016.  There are 1,000 residential centres for people with disabilities throughout the country and by June 2016, 556 had been registered.  HIQA estimates that more than 350 centres will not be registered by the end of October 2016.</p> <p> It is important to understand the very serious consequences if the deadline is not extended.  Under the existing legislation, HIQA would be obliged to cancel the transitional registration of a large number of centres.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, would be required to take over the running of these centres and to make alternative arrangements for residents of the centres taken over.  This would have major implications for the affected residents but also significant budgetary, administrative and staffing implications for the HSE and Department of Health.</p> <p> The Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is simply a technical amendment to the 2007 Act with the sole purpose of extending by two years the transitional period which sets out the final deadline for registration of centres for people with disabilities.  The Bill has no impact on the registration or regulation of residential centres for older people or children.  The exact same standards of safeguarding and protection will continue to exist for residents of the centres for people with disabilities.</p> <p> The proposed two-year extension will not limit or diminish the responsibility of providers to manage and operate the services under their control, nor will it limit HIQA in the application of its sanctions and powers of enforcement.  HIQA is in full agreement with the extension of the transitional period proposed in the Bill and that is why I ask the House for its support today.  Furthermore, there is no additional cost to the State involved in extending the timeframe for registration by HIQA of centres for people with disabilities.</p> <p> The Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is relatively short legislation, providing only a minor technical amendment to section 69 of the Health Act 2007.</p></speech>

I hope it will be possible for this Bill to receive broad support and I  commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000004#B00400"><p>As the Minister will be aware from taking the Bill through the Seanad, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill.  However, it is somewhat disappointing that the Bill is necessary and that more time is needed to render residential centres compliant with Health Information and Quality Authority regulations.  Not all disability residential centres will have achieved the standards required to be registered by 31 October 2016 and, therefore, it has become necessary to move the deadline out by two years.  Are the Minister and HIQA confident that all will meet this new deadline?</p>  <p>  It must be said that we would all like to see more people with disabilities living independently and that fewer residential centres would be needed.  However, as long as we have them, it is important that they are well regulated and compliant with that regulation.</p>  <p>  We cannot ignore the background against which we are debating this Bill.  There have been many shocking revelations in the past week and it is crucial we tackle these issues head on.  On Thursday night last, the "RTE Investigates: Lost in Care" programme exposed how the HSE failed in its duty of care and protection to hundreds of adults with intellectual disabilities - some of most vulnerable people in the country.  Many viewers will have reacted with anger and disappointment.  Sadly, there may not have been great surprise at the revelations as we are witnessing yet another failure of care by those whom we trust to provide it.</p>  <p>  The Minister has had a number of meetings with HSE officials in recent days.  I trust he gave them the clear message that this cannot go on and that rather than have these matters exposed by whistleblowers or leaks, we need to know now what other deficiencies remain in the system.  What other internal reports are there?  Is there more to come?  What reassurances can the Minister offer?  Has the HSE offered him reassurances and, if so, is he reassured?  The Minister must have doubts because we all do.  It is simply outrageous that, in many cases, the HSE did not even have a file on the individuals in question and, in some cases, where files existed, the detail and the record keeping were completely inadequate.  It is shameful.  It is as if the 200 defenceless and vulnerable citizens our health service would not even dignify with a record were seen as non-persons.  </p>  <p>  In one case, the absence of information led to a vulnerable woman being frequently returned without any supervision to her family home even though it was known that she had been sexually abused in childhood by a family member.  We also learned of a man with Down's syndrome who spent his whole life in residential care and went for 16 years without any contact from officials.  The HSE states there are no current safeguarding issues.  However, I suggest the Minister follows the policy of trust but verifies issues.  After all, it is just over 18 months since the &Aacute;ras Attracta expos&eacute;.</p>  <p>  Last week's revelations came in the wake of other revelations earlier this year about "Grace" and allegations that children and adults with intellectual disabilities, some of whom are mute, were seriously sexually assaulted at a foster home in the south east.  This resulted in almost the last act of the previous D&aacute;il being the establishment of a commission of investigation into the allegations.  Five months on, the commission is yet to get up and running and there have been concerns expressed that its scope will now be too narrow.</p>  <p>  Is there a case, in view of last week's programme, to set up a more wide-ranging commission to look at all residential centres?  Surely, we need to be honest with ourselves and find out the full truth of what happened.  Can the Minister or anyone be confident that more revelations will not be made in the months and years ahead?</p>  <p>  The Bill we are debating amends the 2007 Health Act which provided for the establishment of HIQA incorporating a new and independent inspectorate and registration authority for residential services.  While the 2007 Act was steered through by the former Minister, Ms Harney, the establishment of HIQA was a key element in the health reform programme initiated by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  It is all about standards and their enforcement and the need to ensure that an independent organisation with teeth was created to provide accountability.</p><p>The purpose was to ensure that the standards set would be applied consistently and on a national basis and, where necessary, action could be taken quickly and effectively to protect service users.  It is fair to say HIQA has had an impact.</p> <p> Early last Thursday, before the RTE investigation programme was broadcast, HIQA published its annual overview report on the regulation of designated centres for adults and children with disabilities.  It pointed out that the initial inspections in 2014 led to the finding that residents living in many large congregated settings were not being adequately protected or kept safe and that institutionalised care practices, ongoing for years, had an adverse impact on the quality of life for residents.  However, it is welcome that HIQA is now reporting that regulation has brought cultural change to the sector, steadily leading to improvements in the standard of care provided to residents.  The report really highlights the need for further action to help support people with disabilities to live in a community environment.  The report makes it clear that regulation has helped bring about steady improvements in the standard of care provided to people with disabilities, although it nonetheless highlights that further work is needed.</p> <p> The recommendations made through the 2011 HSE report on congregated settings are yet to be implemented, with congregated settings or institutions with ten or more residents being replaced with supported placements in the community.  It is estimated that approximately 3,000 people with a disability were living in congregated settings as of December 2014, at the time of the &Aacute;ras Attracta programme's transmission.  Sadly, not much has been achieved in moving people into community-based environments since.  The HSE prioritised the transition of just 150 people from congregated settings in 2015 and yet it only managed to move 112 people last year, which is wholly inadequate and must be addressed.  Regrettably, the Government has not made this a real priority in the programme for Government.  It is unlikely to make any serious inroads as the reduction targeted is only in the region of 900, which represents just a third of the total figure.  At this rate it will be 2031 before congregated settings come to an end.  I urge the Minister of State to step up the campaign to bring the practice of outdated congregated settings to an end.</p> <p> The Minister of State might agree that we cannot wait until 2031 for this to happen.  I have praised HIQA and its achievements but I know some people feel it could be doing more for people with disabilities.  In February 2015, Inclusion Ireland published The Distant Voice working paper, which analysed the HIQA inspection of 123 units providing residential services for over 700 people with disabilities across Ireland during 2014.  Inclusion Ireland claimed that only 11% of residents across 50 reports were asked about communication needs, which is in stark contrast to the position in the UK, where persons with a disability are part of the inspection process.  Is this something that can be provided for so we can ensure people with a disability are represented in the inspection process?</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill but if a further extension is required in 2018, there will be great disappointment and many questions will be asked.  There is much we must do during this D&aacute;il to improve the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities.  That is a priority for me and my party.  Before the end of the year I look forward in particular to the promised legislation for ratifying the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.  I welcome that the Minister of State with responsibility for the disability brief is at Cabinet, although Fianna F&aacute;il wants to see a Department with disability inclusion specifically in the title.</p> <p> Since my appointment as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on disability, I have met representatives of a number of organisations working in the disability sector and all these groups have expressed their frustration at the slow pace of change in the area.  They also pointed out there is a need for real political leadership to drive forward positive and inclusive reform of the disability sector in Ireland.  People with disabilities must be prioritised in the upcoming budget.  The Government must demonstrate its commitment to improving the lives of people living with a disability.  We want an Ireland in which people with disabilities are given the resources they need to live their lives as full and equal citizens.  It is our goal to realise this objective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000005#C00200"><p>The impact of austerity policies on people with disabilities and their families has been devastating.  I know the Minister of State knows that to be the case.  The mobility allowance scheme was closed and educational supports, including resource teachers and special needs assistants, diminished.  Medical cards have been targeted and the mainstream public services upon which those with disabilities disproportionately depend have been decimated.  People with disabilities remain more than twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the typical population and just 15% of people with an intellectual disability are in employment.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a vision for society in which all citizens, including those with disabilities, can play a full and independent role in all aspects of life, relying as far as possible on mainstream services for health, education and employment but with the support of tailored disability services where necessary.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, known popularly as HIQA.  It provided for inspection and regulation of designated centres and the framework for registration of these designated centres.  The introduction and establishment of such a body as HIQA was very positive.  The measures in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 relate exclusively to residential centres for people with disabilities.  I understand there are 1,000 residential centres for people with disabilities throughout the country and by June 2016, some 556 had been registered.  HIQA estimates that over 350 centres will not be registered by the end of October this year.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in will vote in favour of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2016.  We would of course have wished for all centres to have been registered by 31 October 2016, although we understand some of the complexities associated with such a process and we will therefore support the extension of time request.  However, we have a number of concerns that we would like the Minister of State to address.  I ask him to note these questions.  We appreciate the major administrative task involved in the process but are other specific factors leading to such a delay?  In 2015, HIQA reported to the Department of Health that it would not be possible to complete all registrations by the prospective timeline.  Is it a question of resources?  If so, why were more resources not directed to HIQA to allow it to complete the work within the initial agreed timeframe?</p>  <p>  Following consultation with Inclusion Ireland, a body with which the Minister of State is well familiar, it has come to my attention that there is a list drawn up by the HSE of centres that it has already accepted will never meet the criteria required for registration.  I ask the Minister of State to note this important fact.  Will he comment on this?  Given some of the controversies and scandals uncovered by the media and HIQA in recent times and not exclusively in disability residential settings, but across the social care sector, we have deep concerns that more than 400 residential settings have never been inspected.</p><p>We are aware that HIQA has returned to facilities that received unfavourable and damning reports many times, yet this large number of facilities remain uninspected, with the potential for service users to be at unrecorded and increased risk.</p> <p> As recently as last week it was reported that three residential centres for people with autism have now been taken over by the HSE at the direction of HIQA due to serious non-compliance.  It is extremely concerning to learn of the significant failings found by HIQA relating to the care and welfare of 47 adult residents with autism living in three farm-based centres.  These centres were inspected on a number of occasions over the past 18 months and particular concerns were raised regarding inadequate measures to ensure residents were protected from assault, ongoing risks to residents that were not being appropriately managed or responded to, poor governance and oversight leading to negative outcomes for residents, and poor management of staffing resources and inadequate staff training.  Adults with special needs and their families require and deserve the highest standard of care.  To hear of such non-compliance is extremely distressing.  I am anxious that the extension of two years provided for in this Bill may mean that many other centres will continue to operate without being inspected for a considerable period, potentially leaving vulnerable people in facilities that are simply not at the standard required.</p> <p> In the context of this Bill, we are of the strong belief that there is a great need to move the focus from congregated settings to the community, and not just to smaller settings but to full integration.  Congregated settings are facilities where residents live in close proximity to each other and with an institutional mindset.  They are inappropriate homes for anyone, particularly those with complex needs.  The focus needs to shift from centre-based services to supported mainstream integration.  The focus may be on empowering service users to take as full a role in life as possible.  Resources are also needed to support families.  This process of decongregation is happening but at a very slow pace.  It must be accelerated and funding redistributed so that the main focus is on community rather than specialised settings.</p> <p> I would welcome a response from the Minister of State to some of the points I have raised.  In particular, I lay emphasis on the question of whether there is a HSE list of centres or an understanding that there are a number of centres that will never meet the criteria for registration.  I ask again if this is the case.  Does such a list exist?  If it does, we have the alarming and incredible situation of residents who need care living in substandard care conditions with no prospect of the situation being appropriately addressed while those facilities remain in service.</p> <p> I have a great respect and regard for HIQA and its work.  It is appropriate and important to register that fact here this morning.  I hope the issue of resourcing, to which I have referred, strikes a chord with the Minister of State.  I believe it does and hope that in his position as Minister of State with responsibility for the disability sector he will help to ensure that HIQA is resourced and empowered to carry out all the important work it must do in the interests not only of those who cannot voice their own concerns and needs but of all citizens who depend on the State's health and care provision.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is one of those who has had to fight every step of the way to ensure their children will have the same rights and access as children who do not have a disability.  I thought the stories from those in the industrial schools and the ladies in the Magdalen laundries were the worst we would hear about how we treat vulnerable people.  However, we are hearing more heartbreaking, devastating and disturbing stories of what has been happening to those with an intellectual disability.  Even more heartbreaking is that we know it continues today.  However, I acknowledge those organisations, homes, front-line staff and intellectual disability nurses who have been instrumental in the giving of high-quality care.  It is unfortunate that their positive work is being taken from by those who have abused their position.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the registration process has an opportunity to be completed, but registration in itself is pointless unless there is follow-up.  It is disappointing that the registration was not completed within the timeframe, which now needs to be extended by two years.  HIQA mentioned various complexities with regard to quality and safety issues and the consequences if the deadline was not extended for the HSE.  It stated that it would have to make alternative arrangements for the residents and that that would have major implications for them.  We are speaking about vulnerable people in settings that are their homes.  They have become used to these facilities and have visits from their families there, and those family members are satisfied with the standards.  When people become settled and used to a routine, it can be difficult for them to handle change.  I therefore support the provision of this extension, but it is disappointing that it is required.  In the meantime, it is important to have a mechanism to address issues in unregistered homes.  I know the Minister of State has made a commitment in this regard.  However, we do not want to be hearing these stories for the first time in the media.  We need to be more proactive so that the Government and the authorities know about them first.</p>  <p>  The review by the National Disability Authority refers to the demands on service providers when applying for formal recognition.  It mentions the time commitment involved in the paperwork.  That is replicated in many voluntary organisations, which find it onerous, particularly voluntary management boards.  I accept the need for regulation but I do not believe good paperwork necessarily equates to high-quality care.  I have been involved in voluntary work for quite a long time and I know that organisations are overwhelmed by the extent of the bureaucracy and paperwork required.  It is almost as if there is an agenda to try to remove as much of the voluntary effort as possible, something which would be very disappointing.</p>  <p>  With regard to congregated facilities, the HIQA report notes that 70% of residents with a disability in designated centres are living in congregations of ten or more residents.  They are the ones that are more likely to be non-compliant when the inspections take place, rather than the smaller residential institutions.  We know that a smaller setting is better but we must be cognisant of the existence of centres with ten or more residents that have worked well and in which the residents are happy.  The relationship between the staff and the resident, the standards in the home and the programmes available for people with intellectual disabilities are the most important aspects when looking at inspections of these homes.</p><p>Regrettably, after a certain age people with intellectual disabilities can be left with nothing to do and nothing to stimulate them day by day.  Various organisations have referred to the challenges for the disability sector, such as those around registration and inspection, but there are challenges for those who work with people with an intellectual disability too.  I deal quite a bit with people with an intellectual disability and I know how time-consuming and challenging it is.  The voice of those with a disability should be part of all the processes. </p></speech>

The Minister of State said it was a technical amendment to the 2007 Act with the sole purpose of extending the transitional period but the necessity of the amendment is certainly not technical in the lives of the people affected.  I and everybody else throughout the country who watched the programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta were rendered speechless.  Being rendered speechless is not a good position for a legislator to be in.  I had the experience of being present at the redress board relating to a number of institutions.  It is an offence to talk about the details of that but I will talk in general terms.  A charity in Galway which looked after people with a disability was before the redress board and the abuse we heard about was horrific.  That was some time ago but what have we and the Government learned?  I welcome the Minister of State's strong statements and his promise that he will take charge and not let this happen again under his watch.  However, I have heard such speeches before from different Ministers.  What will be different this time?  It seems to me that no matter which Government is in power, it will make decisions based on resources and vulnerable people will suffer each time.  We do not realise that we will use up scarce resources in following cases up with commissions of inquiry and reviews, Garda investigations and so on.  I have returned to the theme of money on many occasions since I came into the D&aacute;il four months ago and have spoken of how we end up spending more money in the long term in any event.  In our new politics, will the Minister of State have an influence in pointing out that we will save money in the long term by valuing people who have a disability?  We can learn from such people on a daily basis, given their strength in surviving with disabilities of which we know little.  Our role is to give them the chance to thrive and to allocate funding to enable that to happen.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about resources.  Is the bottom line the fact that we are not allocating enough resources?  If that is the problem, let us get it out into the open and discuss it in this Chamber as intelligent beings, so that we can make decisions.</p>  <p>  We have dragged our heels for years on the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and still have not ratified it.  I am delighted that we have now given a commitment to do it before the end of the year but we have been forced to do it.  It has not been a proactive policy by any Government and the move to give it priority has come from pressure applied prior to every election, local and general, by people who work on a voluntary basis.  I support the amending legislation but would like the Minister of State to respond to the more general issues I have raised.  </p></speech>

I give them a commitment to listen to their points of view and to respond to the issues they have raised.  I absolutely share the deep concerns Deputies have expressed about the care by the State of vulnerable people with a disability.  This Government is committed to the protection and safeguarding of children and adults with disabilities and I am determined that historical issues will be comprehensively examined and addressed.  We have to change the mindset in Irish society and bring in real equality for all people with disabilities and that is part of my broader vision for the reform of services for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  A range of measures have been put in place in recent years to improve the care provided to the most vulnerable citizens and this will be progressed and improved.  The system is clearly far from perfect but the fact that these issues are coming to light and are being investigated points to the fact that our oversight and regulation are getting better.  My Department will receive a number of reports and reviews in the coming weeks which will shape and direct the way the disability sector is regulated.</p>  <p>  I will now deal specifically with some of the issues raised by the Deputies.  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony raised the issue of abuse and I agree that we have to ensure the protection of our citizens.  She also raised the issue of congregated settings and I totally accept that we need to focus on them.  However, the process is being supported this year by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health while assistance with transitional costs is being provided by the service reform fund to the tune of &euro;45 million, with support from the Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The Deputy also said we needed more reform and more positivity in our health and disability services and some of the reports I will be receiving will deal with these issues.  I hope there will be evidence of this reform come the autumn.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the support of all Deputies on this issue.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about resources.  The answer to his question is "Yes".  Disability services have been devastated for the past ten years.  We need to up our game and to invest in services.  He also asked about the inspection of services by HIQA, a very important question.  All centres had been visited at least once by April 2016.  The Deputy also raised the case of a number of centres of autism being taken over by the HSE in recent months.  This shows that the system of regulation works and that there is a procedure in place to deal with centres which fail HIQA standards.  There is no exception in the case of centres covered by section 69 of the 2007 Act.  HIQA will continue to monitor and inspect all centres and will expect centres with the greatest challenges to meet the standards that have been prioritised for decongregation.  The centres with the worst level of services, where physical space is often the issue, will be prioritised in the context of decongregated settings.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also mentioned mobility allowance.  The Department of Health has prioritised the development of the transport support Bill in line with the commitment in the programme for partnership Government.  The heads of Bill are in an advanced stage of development.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the resource issue with regard to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  That is an issue we have to fix; it is a reality.  I give a commitment that I will support HIQA on access and resources, because it is the guardian of citizens.</p> <p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the issue of abuse.  She acknowledged that we must have a strong, professional services but also acknowledged the good work that takes place.  Many of us have experienced high quality services in the disability sector, but that is due to the staff - the right people doing the job in the right services.  That issue continues to arise.  I accept that Deputy O'Sullivan is disappointed about the extension, but I want to ensure that these services are up to standard.  She also raised the quality of the day services.  Yesterday, I met representatives of the National Disability Authority and they accepted that we had a very good discussion.  We came up with a major programme for the end of December to examine the standards, because there is a variation of standards within day services.  I am aware of many centres that have a structured day service with a high-quality timetable, and young adults with intellectual disabilities love the centres.  Equally, in regard to other centres, I had a complaint recently where for one family it was costing the Health Service Executive &euro;180,000 a year for a service that was appalling.  The mother of that young person with an intellectual disability said that for half that amount of money she would get a better service.  There is much inconsistency in the services, but we have high-quality day services.</p> <p> I appreciate Deputy Catherine Connolly's support and I take her point.  While I referred to a technical amendment to the 2007 Act, the wider view is that we have to ensure that respect for, equality and reform of the services must be developed.  The Deputy asked whether the Government had learned a very important lesson from what happened in the past.  I hope to God we have, because I have become very frustrated with some of the situations I have come across recently.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  Deputy Connolly also made a strong point about high costs.  I know we will probably have to go down the road of a commission of investigation, but it annoys me that we have to spend that money.  Who will get the money?  It will not be the services for adults with intellectual disabilities; it will be sections of the legal profession, but that is another debate.  We might have to do that in this particular case.  The Deputy made the strong point that if we invest in high-quality services it will save us money in the future.  That is a reality and a vision we need to bring to the issue.</p> <p> When it comes down to savings and resource issues, as I said to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, these are important things that we have to change, and we must change the mindset also.  Disability has to be brought to the top of the political agenda.  I try to do that every day.  It is very difficult at times but we do make progress.  I hope we will make progress on these matters.  Those were the issues and concerns raised.</p></speech>

It is more about dealing with outdated services, and my view is that they have been prioritised.  I believe there are around 165 places on that particular list.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is not to change any of the fundamentals of the HIQA inspection, regulation and registration regime, which is working very well.  HIQA regulation has brought a cultural change to the sector and has steadily led to improvements in the standards of care provided by facilities.  This Bill will simply extend the deadline by which residential centres must be registered in order to allow HIQA the necessary time to ensure that every centre is inspected fully and properly.  HIQA will in no way be limited in the application of its powers and sanctions.  I want to reassure parents, families and TDs interested in this section that it will retain its ability to inspect and, if necessary, cancel the registration of a residential centre that persistently fails to meet the required standards.  I hope I have addressed the concerns expressed in the debate and that the Bill will receive broad support from all sides of the House.</p></speech>

We raised the issue many times in the discussions on the programme for Government, on the Order of Business and at other times here, but nothing has changed in Kerry with regard to improving home help services.</p>  <p>  This Government will be judged on its ability to make a difference to the people we represent.  I believe that the people who need home help are not getting a sufficient number of hours.  I know of many cases where the husband and the wife are trying to stay in their home but they are not getting a sufficient number of home help hours.  A half hour in the morning and a half hour in the evening for five days is not sufficient in terms of helping people to get out of bed, give them a meal or whatever.  Very little can be done in that short time.  The home helps are wonderful people and they stay longer than they are paid to do.  I am aware of an elderly couple that is using the pension of one of them to provide a home help.  That is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Very few people get a home help on a weekend.  That is not acceptable.  They do not get a home help on bank holidays.  I mentioned previously that home help was taken from people on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day.  That is a time of peace and goodwill when we are all supposed to look after each other, but especially elderly people.  That is the service our State is providing.</p>  <p>  It appears to me that there is no accountability in this area.  The HSE is not accountable to the Minister for Health, but the buck should stop with the Minister.  If we raise an issue in this House the Minister should address it and see how it can be approved.  If we do not help our elderly people to stay in their homes for as long as they possibly can, we are not doing our duty.  Kerry has been badly let down with regard to the provision of a sufficient number of home help hours.  I ask that this matter be addressed.</p>  <p>  On another issue, Deer Lodge is a new facility that was built 12 months ago at great expense in St. Margaret's Road, Killarney, to deal with people with mental health problems, but the door has not been opened yet.  That brand new facility has been lying idle for 12 months.  I want the Minister to make a statement on when he will open the doors of that facility.  Our county is riddled with suicides, and I am not saying that facility will stop suicides from happening in our county, but it is not acceptable that its doors are not yet open.</p><p>As an elected representative, I promised many people that we would do our level best to ensure the facility would be up and running.  The facility was completed in June of last year and was supposed to open in July of last year but the doors and gates are closed and it has not yet opened.  I want the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to make a statement on when it will be opened.  That is the question we are being asked day in, day out.</p> <p> Another serious problem is manifesting itself regularly.  Consider a person who has had a heart attack and goes to Cork University Hospital in the hope of having a triple or quadruple bypass.  I have a constituent who was waiting for three weeks and who had to return home many times during those three weeks because when he went to the hospital, there was no bed available and the operation was cancelled.  Imagine the stress and trauma that family had to endure wondering if he would get another heart attack.  The operation was cancelled several times.  That was not fair on the family, the patient or the patient's poor wife who could hardly sleep for those three weeks all because a bed was not available to cater for that patient following the operation.  Those matters need to be addressed.</p> <p> Members elected to this Chamber highlight these concerns but nothing is happening.  The Minister needs to make a statement on what he will do about these serious matters.  I am not alone in raising these issues but I ask that they be addressed and that the Minister makes a statement on them.</p></speech>

When he said that all centres had been visited by April 2016, does the word "visited" equate with the word "inspection"?  I note the nod of his advisers that that is the case.  The information I have been given is that the process is not complete and I will go back to check that detail.  I was trying to establish that there were no semantics regarding the words "visit" and "inspection", etc., and that we had absolute clarity that none of the entities to which I referred have not had an inspection by HIQA.  Will the Minister of State clarify that?  I will seek to confirm this with HIQA.</p>  <p>  My second point relates to the list to which I referred.  In his reply, the Minister of State said that there was no list but went on to advise that there was a list.  In regard to the 165, or whatever the number the Minister of State referred to, is it the case that within that figure, it is now known that a particular number will not cross the line within the two year extension for HIQA to progress the issue of registration?  Will the Minister of State confirm that a number of facilities will not cross the line?  Therefore, as I said earlier, we are allowing a situation where people who cannot speak for themselves and people with intellectual disability of varying degrees are being retained and kept in substandard circumstances that have no believed prospect of improving within the extended time provided for by this legislation.  That is a very worrying point.  Does the Minister of State have anything further to say regarding that matter or, more importantly, is there is something he can do about it?</p></speech>

An extra &euro;12 million was returned to the fund for the Vision for Change for mental health services.  Surely, this would be an opportunity.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae also spoke about the issue of waiting for heart operations in Cork University Hospital.  I will bring that issue back to the Minister for Health as it is not under my brief.</p>  <p>  In regard to HIQA, as far as I know, the word "visited" in this context means "inspected".  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that I was not playing word games.  When I said all centres will have been visited at least once by 2016, I interpreted that to mean HIQA visiting, monitoring and inspecting the facilities.  I will ensure that all the centres are inspected to ensure safety and high quality of standards.</p>  <p>  In regard to the figure of 165, I think I misread that.  What I meant was that the &euro;20 million which is being spent in different centres throughout the State was being used to take 165 people out of congregated settings and to put them into smaller community-based housing and service schemes.  The figure of 165 refers to the particular people involved in those arrangements.  I appreciate the Deputy's point but it is important to remember that in the first round of funding, we have prioritised the disability residential services and congregated settings that are in the worst condition.  We felt it was important to start with those.  However, it is not acceptable to have people still living in them.  Part of my project over the next year or two years is to deal with these issues and ensure quality services for people.</p>  <p>  We are doing much catching up on investment in services after the past seven or eight years and I accept the points made earlier.  I thank Deputies for their support for the Bill.  I understand they have concerns, which are shared by many of us, but we will do our best to deliver quality services for all people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

Of course, subsequently, when he took office as Minister for Education and Skills, he blatantly and cynically disregarded that commitment.  Ever since then third level funding has been on a cliff.  It is in a seriously difficult situation.  Pupil-teacher ratios have got progressively worse, going from 16:1 to 20:1.  There is little or no capital investment, apart from the Grangegorman campus, in third level education.  The central role of third level education in economic development is not reflected in current Government policy and has not been for some time.  It is indisputable that over the past 40 years investment in third level education was central to economic and social development, particularly in attracting foreign direct investment and in developing small to medium sized companies and giving young people a chance in life.  The great success story of modern Ireland has been the degree to which we have opened up third level education through institutes of technology and universities to far more young people than was the case in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>  <p>  The quality of the experience for students is in decline.  That is a real worry for those in charge of the universities and for those who have analysed this.  There will be more young people going into third level education in years to come.  Population growth and the numbers coming through second level all point to far greater numbers attending.  The quality of the experience should be good.  We have been slipping in some of the world league tables of university rankings and that is a considerable worry.</p>  <p>  The report of the expert group on future funding for third level education, the Cassells report, has highlighted much of this and pointed to the urgent need to restore and enhance quality.  It has recommended an immediate increase of &euro;120 million per year over the next five years.  It recommends spending &euro;5.5 billion over the next five to six years on capital infrastructure in third level education.  Students need additional supports.  Postgraduate students should be prioritised and their grants restored.  I have been saying this for the past three to four years.</p>  <p>  Do the Taoiseach and the Government accept the recommendations of the Cassells report?  As discussions and negotiations begin about the forthcoming budget, will the Government reflect significantly increased funding of approximately &euro;120 million to the third level education? </p></speech>

That is through the educational system, which is not perfect but which has more than measured up against any of its competitors around the world.  Primary, second and third level are all important parts of that jigsaw.  From the evidence of my engagements with business abroad, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation is a very important cornerstone, more so than tax in many respects, for people who want to invest here and work with the young Irish.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has received the Cassells report, which sets out three options.  The report will go to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for consideration and discussion.  Deputy Martin is well aware that most of the universities raise significant sums of money themselves for their capital programmes, assisted in part by the State.  There is always a balance to be achieved between the output from universities and the challenge to provide sufficient money for them.  We did not have this capacity for many years.  I do not want to predict the outcome of the budget allowances but this report will be considered very carefully because that is in the country&rsquo;s interests. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has signed off in general with Ministers in respect of the budget for 2017 but it is an issue that concerns Government because the future years will in many ways depend on a world that is changing so rapidly and upon Ireland&rsquo;s flexibility to deal with those challenges and changes.  The third level sector has to be at the core of that.  The report will go to the committee and the Minister looks forward to hearing the views of the Deputies and parties and their observations on the priorities.  The budget will be outlined at sectoral level at the committees and will be presented by the Minister in October.</p></speech>

There are three options, each of which calls for increased State funding.  The third level sector is in financial crisis.  The Committee of Public Accounts last year identified some institutes of technology as being in dire financial straits.  I do not want to name them here and create further embarrassment for them but they are in trouble.  It is a question of priorities and prioritisation.  We nailed our colours to the mast on this in our manifesto and have subsequently said there has to be a direct increase in allocation to the third level sector.  Otherwise we are storing up big trouble for the country.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach if he accepts the recommendations of the Cassells report.  Does the Government accept them?  There has been no statement from the Government, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education and Skills other than that it is being sent to the committee.  Does the Government accept the recommendations of the Cassells report and will they be reflected in an increase in the forthcoming budget?</p></speech>

The expert report makes clear that doing nothing is not an option.  The Deputy would accept that it would not be fair for the Minister to say at this stage that he is nailing his colours to option A, B or C.  There are downsides to all the options and they are not without significant challenges.  It is only right and proper that, having accepted and received the Cassells report, which has been published, and members of the public and various bodies are sending in their views on it, that the Members of this House should have their say because these matters need to be teased out and there are no easy options yet something has to be done.  The Deputy knows that if we follow the concept of a student loan scheme the higher postgraduate achievers can add greatly to their earning power.</p></speech>

I recognise the scale of the challenge, as universities have pointed it out over the past number of years.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is focused on getting a ten year consensus on where we want to be with the education sector which includes a capital programme to provide for the many changes and challenges to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000011#K00400"><p>Yesterday, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government released the State's latest homelessness figures.  Last month, 6,358 people were living in emergency accommodation, a shocking 2,206 of whom were children.  Child homelessness has increased by over 70% in the past 12 months.  Children are sleeping night after night in cramped hotels or unsuitable hostels.  These figures do not include those who are living in overcrowded housing, sleeping on someone else's floor or sofa or those waiting for emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Why are these people homeless?  It is not an accident or an act of nature.  Rather, it is because the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il before it failed to build social housing, tackle spiralling rents and help those in mortgage distress.  The Government ignored all the warnings about this pending crisis when Sinn F&eacute;in and others brought it to its attention.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, launched his action plan for housing and homelessness.  It has some merit, and Sinn F&eacute;in has welcomed its positive elements.  Clearly, the Minister is making a genuine effort to tackle the housing crisis, but it is results that count.  The Minister, like the Taoiseach, seems restrained by an ideological reliance on the market.</p>  <p>  What is not in the plan is as important as what is.  Crucially, it fails to address the most urgent aspects of the crisis.  It is not ambitious enough and not enough social housing will be built.  Gone is the dedicated court to tackle mortgage distress promised in the programme for Government.  There are no proposals to tackle spiralling rents.  Crucially, it commits a mere &euro;150 million in extra capital spending for social housing next year.  At the very best, that will deliver an extra 833 social houses next year.</p>  <p>  Whatever the longer-term impact of this plan, one thing is very clear.  Those in need of housing today, those sleeping in emergency accommodation tonight and those who will struggle to pay their rent at the end of the month are offered very little comfort by this plan.</p>  <p>  Why did the Government ignore the Committee on Housing and Homelessness which called for a moratorium on home repossessions?  The committee included members of the Taoiseach's party.  Why is he walking away from the programme for Government commitments to help families in mortgage distress to stay in their homes?  If they are forced out of their homes, that will make the crisis even worse.</p>  <p>  Why did the Taoiseach ignore the call of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness for the introduction of rent certainty, linking rent to the consumer price index?  Why is the Taoiseach once again refusing to invest enough money in social housing to build and buy the homes so desperately needed by children living in emergency accommodation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000011#K00500"><p>Deputy Adams is well aware that what happened in this country over quite a long number of years left us in a position whereby we had neither the money nor the capacity to build what was needed in terms of affordable and social housing and to deal with the rising challenge of homelessness.  It is a complex issue.</p>  <p>  The Government spent quite an extensive period of time putting together all of the elements that relate to housing, be they homelessness, social and affordable housing, mortgage arrears, renters, voided dwellings and houses that are not in use for whatever reason.  All of these factors have been included in the action plan for housing, the first chapter of which deals with homelessness.  As Deputy Adams knows, the reasons for homelessness are not as simplistic as statistics might suggest.  There are stories behind each of the cases of homelessness that the Government wants to address. </p>  <p>  That is why, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, pointed out yesterday, the detail of the first chapter of the action programme deals specifically with homelessness.  We know from the report of the housing authority that 4,152 adults used State funded emergency accommodation nationally during one week in June 2016.  That survey identified 1,078 families in emergency accommodation, consisting of 1,457 adults and 2,206 dependents.  The number of homeless families increased from 620 in June 2015, a 74% increase, while the dependent figures increased by 67% and were 1,318 last May.  Details of homeless families have been recorded since July 2014 when a total of 344 families with 749 dependents were homeless.</p>  <p>  It is the recognition of these kinds of statistics that have brought about the significant investment by the Government.  The challenge is to prove that the action plan works and will be implemented.  That is why 47,000 social units are envisaged, with a spend of &euro;5.3 billion to deal with this issue in a comprehensive way.  Social units alone will not solve the problem.  Rather, we will provide opportunities for those who are homeless to be housed with quick build and rapid build solutions, voided solutions, repairing houses, the acquisition of houses that are empty and, as the Deputy said, the opportunity to deal with mortgages.  Significant numbers of previously distressed mortgagees are now paying their way.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality will introduce a new service in respect of MABS for the thousands of cases - I understand the total is 35,000 - where there has been no communication between borrowers and lenders for whatever reason.  We need to be able to deal with that in a different format rather than people receiving formal notices from banks.  There is a solution to these problems, but they need to be worked on.</p>  <p>  In respect of the discussion that took place yesterday and will take place again tomorrow, the challenge for the Government and everybody else is to make this work.  I commended Deputy Curran and the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Government did not accept all of the recommendations, but a special appendix was inserted which dealt with each of the proposals made by the committee, which we welcomed.  Not all of them were accepted, but they were commented upon favourably.</p></speech>

It started when this and previous Governments reneged on the State's responsibility to provide homes for citizens.  That is the crucial element to all of this.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach tried to blame local councils for the lack of social housing, yet the Government has failed to provide sufficient funding to allow councils to build and buy houses.  He is still not providing sufficient funding.  The plan promises to meet the needs of 131,000 families over six years, but 94,000 will remain in the private rental sector and will be subsidised by the State through HAP, RAS and leasing.  How is that not an over-reliance on the private sector, guided not by housing need but rather by the ideological position of the Government?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach commended the Committee on Housing and Homelessness - it is the most commended committee in the D&aacute;il.  A lot of nonsense is talked about new politics.  The Taoiseach did not take on board some of the major findings and recommendations of the committee.  The number one priority recommendation of the committee was to increase the housing stock by 10,000 units per year every year.  The Government's proposal falls 40% short of this.  Government Deputies signed up to the plan.  The Taoiseach has ignored this issue. </p>  <p>  He also ignored my other questions.  I asked the Taoiseach to tell me why the plan falls 40% short of the number one priority recommendation of the committee.</p></speech>

He is well aware that in the so-called boom times up to 90,000 houses were built per year, and the figures collapsed to fewer than 10,000.  This is the most comprehensive and significant investment in the history of the State in terms of dealing with construction, housing and homelessness.  The plan also includes mortgages, renters, voided units, ghost estates and so on.</p><p>This is a genuine attempt, taking into account the views right across the spectrum, of the Government to drive this process so that people can have a home and a roof over their head, so that they do not have to be in bed and breakfasts or hotel rooms and so that those who are on the streets are looked after, but also there is an opportunity to provide affordable houses for those who need them and opportunities for local authorities to deal with the situation.</p> <p> I served on a council myself many years ago and at that stage it was building more houses than were required both in isolated areas and in towns, but councils lost the ability to provide houses in numbers for people.  Housing associations do a good job, but it is about time county councils got back into the business of providing houses.  They have been given the money, the opportunities and the incentives to open sites that are currently off limits, and they must get on with the job.  This is a challenge for everybody.  It is a real priority for the Government.  This is the biggest investment in the history of the State in this area.</p></speech>

I outlined my concerns and those of politicians, trade unions, civil society and NGOs.  The main concern was TTIP's aim to remove any regulatory barrier to profits and the profit-making potential of multinational and transnational companies.  There were also concerns about banking, agriculture, the environment, food safety, workers&rsquo; rights and education.  Of particular concern was the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS, which gives foreign investors the right to sue a sovereign state with a democratically elected government for loss of profits resulting from public policy decisions.  I asked for a debate, and six months later we got two and a half hours in the last week of the previous D&aacute;il, which was then dissolved.</p>  <p>  The latest round of talks on TTIP began recently.  We know that the US President, Mr. Obama, wants to speed up the TTIP agreement process.  That is in spite of the fact that more and more voices are expressing concern, including some leading EU politicians, and that the protest against TTIP is gaining momentum.  There are also implications from the outcome of the Brexit referendum, because the UK was one of the main EU supporters of TTIP.  There is a worry that TTIP will erode the gains developing countries have been making through the World Trade Organization, such as some of the sustainable development goals.  Trade policies have a role to play in eradicating poverty but they can also contribute to further poverty and inequality.</p>  <p>  In the meantime there is CETA, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.  I question the rush to support CETA.  The line and the spin seem to be that there are opportunities for Irish businesses, but that is to ignore the concerns people have about the agreement.  Those concerns are economic, financial and also constitutional.  The ISDS settlement will create a new legal power to make a charge on the state.  Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution says that the State must seek the approval of the D&aacute;il to sign up to an international agreement that is likely to place a charge on the State.  We have an example from Egypt, where the government was trying to increase the minimum wage and it now faces a lawsuit from a multinational company for the extra costs on it.  We face a provisional application of CETA, and if we sign it, that means the agreement will come into effect in this country and in other EU member states before the D&aacute;il and the other parliaments in the EU have a chance to debate it or vote on it.  I suggest that we do not allow the agreement to come into effect without thorough investigation and clarification of the economic, financial and legal implications, and also in the interests of our constitutional integrity.  There is a real fear that CETA and TTIP will benefit a global business model over local people, and that could also have an impact on our efforts to solve the housing and homeless crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000012#L01100"><p>International trade agreements carry with them huge opportunities and also huge challenges.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan is well aware of the Canadian deal, CETA.  It was originally assumed to be a done deal and that it would just be signed by the European Commission.  In fact, it has been determined to be a mixed agreement which includes both European and national competencies.  Therefore, the elements that are appropriate to Europe will be dealt with by it, and the government of each country will have to approve the agreement in terms of its own provisions, which will obviously require lengthy discussion in some countries.</p>  <p>  In respect of TTIP, there is a great distance yet to go in that regard.  Work is starting on the 14th chapter.  It was originally agreed to start the discussions when Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  There were two very good teams, on both the American side and the European side, and they began to discuss the many complex areas involved in TTIP.  It was assumed that the agreement could be concluded towards the end of this year but, personally, I doubt whether that will happen.  It will probably go some distance beyond that.</p>  <p>  It is a precondition of the negotiations that there can be no dilution of standards in labour conditions, the environment or health.  It is an issue that is proposed to be completed.  It is different from the old type of dispute and the way settlements can be arranged.  I assume that if and when the discussions on TTIP are concluded, the opportunity for a couple of million jobs either side of the Atlantic is one attraction, but there are issues that need to be teased out.  On the European side, we have reading rooms close to Government Buildings and all of the information and notes are online for everybody to read, assess, understand and comment on.  There is no secrecy in any of the deliberations from the European end in respect of TTIP.  That does not apply from the American side, as it takes a different view.  For us, the negotiations are all in public and up front.  For those who wish to involve themselves in a deeper way, we have provided specific reading rooms for elements of the chapters that have already been concluded and those that are currently under discussion.</p></speech>

We cannot provisionally apply CETA for a number of reasons.  First, the EU is waiting for the decision from the European Court of Justice on the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, and that is not expected until the end of this year or early 2017, and there is also an issue with the legal analysis that ClientEarth has done.  I urge the Taoiseach to look at that, because it found that the proposal was in violation of EU law.  In addition, a German political party is filing a lawsuit against CETA in the German constitutional court.  Will the Taoiseach indicate at the Council of Ministers meeting in October that we will not sign up to the provisional application of CETA, and in the meantime could he seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice on the ISDS?  Under Article 218.11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland can seek to clarify the legality of the investment arbitration proposals in CETA.  There are significant implications for Ireland if the ISDS goes through, because corporations and multinationals can sue the State for loss of profit and potential profit.  The Taoiseach has agreed to have a debate on the issue.  I hope we do not have to wait six months for the debate on this aspect of the agreement as we did for TTIP.</p></speech>

The European Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union in that regard on the basis of specific mandates of instruction given to it by the Council of Ministers.</p>  <p>  The TTIP proposal is one of a number of new-style trade agreements, as the Deputy is aware, that the EU is negotiating that not only covers tariffs, services and investments but also regulatory coherence and co-operation.  It would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal.  A recent EU study showed that this country would gain approximately 1.4% in GDP from the deal.  This is not about reducing standards or increasing costs for SMEs; it is about setting down world standards for trade for the coming years.  There is some distance to go in the negotiations, which are still ongoing.</p><p>I will come back to the Deputy in respect of his comment about the European Court of Justice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000013#M00200"><p>The South East Economic Monitor report produced by the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, school of business confirmed that unemployment in the south east is at crisis levels and is rising.  It currently stands at 12.5% compared to other regions that are experiencing a national trend of 8.4%.  The report finds further that the quality of employment in the south east is dramatically lower than the national average and continues to deteriorate.  The report also identifies that the reason the south east economy is struggling is due in large part to the inactivity of the IDA, Departments and Enterprise Ireland in the region over the last three decades.  The south east is missing a total of 6,312 IDA-supported jobs.  I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Halligan, is here because he understands this.</p>  <p>  In Tipperary alone in the last few months, we have seen the closure of Suir Pharma in Clonmel with the loss of 134 jobs, Ranbaxy in Cashel with the loss of 140 jobs and of Clonmel Chemicals and Gleesons in Borrisoleigh.  Two of those companies were indigenous, homegrown companies that had survived a number of recessions and gave valuable employment over the years.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, in his previous incarnation as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced an action plan for jobs for the south east and that the IDA would, over five years, invest &euro;150 million in a capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs to the regions.  Yet, there was no mention of County Tipperary in that report, even though the Minister, Deputy Bruton, came to Tipperary for a wife.  I am surprised he forgot about us.</p>  <p>  The south east and County Tipperary, in particular, cannot endure this level of underachievement and underinvestment.  The focus of the IDA must be improved.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, escalate the activity of the IDA to drive inward investment into counties like Tipperary and restore fairer and more sustainable regional balance in terms of unemployment?</p>  <p>  I was delighted to be a part of the Taoiseach's negotiations on the programme for Government.  The goal of the new Government will be to deliver 200,000 jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 will be outside of Dublin.  I think that is very important.  I am not anti-Dublin but it is vital that we work to eliminate the two-tier economy that is emerging in our country.  This is even more important in light of the inevitable economic impact of Brexit after the recent referendum.  Will the Taoiseach, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and all Departments to look at rural-proofing any legislation they introduce and insist that the IDA step up to the mark, carry out more visits to County Tipperary and be more encouraging and supportive of businesses?</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Government approved grant assistance for an expansion of an industry in Tipperary.  In general, unemployment in the south east is down from more than 20.1% in 2012 to 11.9% at the end of 2014.  There are 23,200 additional people in employment from the south-east region since the launch of the Government's action plan back in 2012.  There was an 18% increase by 2014 in firms supported by the south-east local enterprise office.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, informs me that a comprehensive proposal will be put together for the south east.  People from Tipperary were represented at a meeting held in Kilkenny recently where the presidents of WIT and Carlow IT and others came together to focus on what they can do collaboratively to continue to make the area more attractive as a location for investment.  This involves local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, other NGOs and organisations, chambers of commerce and so on.</p>  <p>  Revenue from overseas visitors increased by 20% to more than &euro;200 million between 2011 and 2013.  In the hospitality sector, the south east is going to add immeasurably to Ireland's Ancient East in the time ahead.  There is a lot of activity.  The Action Plan for Jobs continues and is monitored by my Department.  It is Government policy to spread the vast majority of new jobs outside the major cities.  The broadband proposal, opportunities for power, communications and water are all things that are important in making a location attractive.  As Deputy Martin said this morning, the importance of young graduates coming through from third level colleges is an added incentive and bonus there.  Deputy McGrath can take it that the south east, no more than any of the other region, is a focus and a particular priority for the Government and will continue to be so.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for the continuing stagnation of the economy in the south east is down to the administrative burden being placed on SMEs and other business ventures that are having their entrepreneurial vision and passion restricted or crippled.  In reply to a parliamentary question I recently submitted, I was told that the various Departments identified the cost of the administrative burden for businesses nationally at approximately &euro;320 million annually.  That is a frightening figure.  I know that during the talks on the programme for Government, the Taoiseach mentioned a reform of the public services and all of the agencies.  We need that figure to be driven down because people need support, not restraint.  They have the initiative and the energy but they want to be allowed to do their job.  Some &euro;320 million is an astonishing figure that could be spent on, or could do, many other things.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned Ireland's Ancient East and all of those ideas.  They are wonderful and there is wonderful buy-in from rural communities as well.  However, this is about investment, attracting FDI, site visits and visits to the county by the IDA.  All of Tipperary and I expect that the county will get a fair share of the cake; no more, no less.</p></speech>

When one looks at the entire sector, unemployment is down from 20% to 11.9%, although that is still too high.  Every region has its attractions and its strengths.  The comprehensive programme being referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is another opportunity to build on that.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Brexit outcome, the Government has decided to increase staffing numbers over time in our overseas offices, particularly in regard to trade.  It will be necessary to reach new markets and so on for goods and products that we produce.  I met with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland quite recently, both of which are powerful agencies.  World standards apply in both their cases.  They have full Government support to continue working with companies here that are exporting and with FDI coming into Ireland.  Yesterday, the Government approved sizeable grant assistance for an industry in the Deputy's own county of Tipperary.</p></speech>

That is from the programme for Government.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, ward watch figure for this week show a spike in trolley numbers for the second week in July.  It shows an increase of 38% compared to the same week in 2015.  The figure was reduced for the month of May by 14% and the month of June by 24%.  However, last week's figure confirms that 1,839 patients admitted for care were on trolleys compared with 1,336 for the same period last year.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this bed capacity review has commenced, and if not, when it will commence?</p></speech>

He met with the HSE last Friday regarding measures to tackle waiting lists and hospital bed capacity.  The Minister requested the HSE to prepare an action plan setting out specific measures it will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, from now to the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The bed capacity review is part of the overall presentation of where we want to be with the health system over the next ten years.  I am glad that most Members and the parties here generally buy into what kind of health system we want to have over the next ten years.  I will give Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin an update on the commencement date and progress that is being made. </p></speech>

The programme for Government makes numerous commitments about the management of hospital referrals.  However, the MRI unit in Cork University Hospital recently sent letters to Dr. Nick Flynn, a general practitioner in Hollyhill, Cork, detailing the patient referral system operating in that unit.  The letters say that patients referred to the unit by a GP will not receive an appointment.  Referrals have to be made by a consultant in order to obtain a scan.</p>  <p>  However, one of the letters goes on to state that GP referrals would be accepted where the patient was willing to self pay or had health insurance.  Therefore, wealth, not health, is the decisive factor.  As the Taoiseach knows, in some cases the waiting time is two years.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health to investigate this downright offensive act of medical discrimination whereby vulnerable patients are not given their scans or referrals as required?</p></speech>

The Government wants the best outcome to be made available for all patients.  That is why the universal health system should apply to all.  The Minister for Health is focusing on a ten-year programme.  In addition, the &euro;300 million which was put into the budget last year and the extra &euro;500 million this year will go to deal with many of the more difficult issues that have been in the health system for some time.  I am sure the Deputy welcomes the announcement yesterday of legislation on medical cards for recipients of the domiciliary care allowance.</p>  <p>  As regards GP referrals, we have had a two-tier health system for so many years.  That is why the Government's emphasis is on providing a universal health system that applies to everybody.  In that way, people can have medical attention as close to them as possible when they need it.  That is where the Minister's focus and priority will be.</p></speech>

The point of those provisions was to provide a legal basis for people to trace their natural parents where possible.  There is a growing consensus in the House that it is the right thing to do.  The Taoiseach will remember that this matter was championed by the former Deputy, Anne Ferris, and was supported by Deputy Joan Burton.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Government has decided to separate these provisions from the remainder of the adoption (amendment) Bill in the legislative programme published to date.  Can the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that the provisions on tracing will be brought before the House, and when that will happen?</p></speech>

The recommendations show that the commission's name is apt and well-earned.  It is, indeed, the low pay commission.  In any case, there has been talk in recent times of leprechaun economics and here it is - pots of gold for tax-evading multinationals and insulting pay recommendations for the little people.</p>  <p>  I have a question on promised legislation as follows.  My understanding is that there is a requirement to amend minimum wage legislation in order to change the rates.  Is the Government prepared to reject this recommendation and go for something which would take low-paid workers out of poverty?  These are poverty pay rates, so is the Taoiseach prepared to go above that and settle on a rate which is far more in line with what low-paid workers need?  </p>  <p>  The House's budget committee-----</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that, before his time here, the previous Government reversed the cut to the minimum wage and increased it subsequently.  The Low Pay Commission has made its recommendations, taking into account its view of the economic road ahead, including the consequences of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Government agreed to give approval for publication of the report, and I expect it will be discussed here.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has three months to respond and will consider carefully this recommendation from the Low Pay Commission.  The Minister will return here in September, as is required under law, in respect of the proposal she will make to Government arising from the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission.  </p>  <p>  There was also a minority report as part of the recommendation.  The reason for establishing the Low Pay Commission was to have an objective, structured way of recommending increases.  Work should be seen to pay, so it is important to have that incentive for people to go to work.  Clearly, however, when one increases the minimum wage, it has a knock-on effect further up the line for those on low pay.</p></speech>

I refer to one in particular, security of tenure for people who are currently subject to repossession proceedings.  When will the new court be in place?

What is the position concerning people who are currently the subject of repossession proceedings before the courts?

In fact, the promise is to increase the number of speech therapists by 25%, bringing the number to over 1,100.  I raised this matter a couple of weeks ago with the T&aacute;naiste.  On that occasion, she informed me that a lot of money was being put into it and it was hoped to make progress.  However, the problem was that they could not find adequate and properly qualified people available.</p>  <p>  Since then I have been contacted by many people who tell me they are on a HSE panel for speech therapists.  That panel has over 300 speech therapists on it, but the problem is that they are not being sanctioned for recruitment.  That is the case all over the country.  </p>  <p>  In my particular area, many people are waiting for speech therapy services, including preschool children in particular, but they cannot get them because there are no speech therapists since they are not being recruited.  I want a commitment from the Taoiseach and the Government that before September speech therapists and occupational therapists will be recruited.</p><p>I understand there are more than1,000 of them on a HSE panel waiting to be appointed but these appointments are not being sanctioned by the Government.</p></speech>

Child care costs in Ireland are the most expensive in Europe.  For many families, this cost is the equivalent of a second mortgage.  Ireland spends approximately one quarter of the amount spent by other countries on child care.  In France, a person can access a child care place for approximately &euro;200 per month.  In parts of Dublin and elsewhere that cost is approximately &euro;1,000 per month.  Does the Taoiseach not see this as a burning issue for the Government?

The position adopted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources does not stand up to any independent scrutiny.  The proposal has been carefully couched so as not to contravene European law.  The hoary old chestnut of a reply that there is no clear definition of what constitutes contemporary Irish music in all its diversity that would convince the EU authorities that we have legitimate case for legislating for a quota in Ireland is wrong.  Why was it possible for France to do it?  Perhaps in the context of Brexit the European Commission will cop itself on and realise that we have some degree of independence, particularly in our culture and music.</p><p>Surely the Department is aware that the EU authorities have already sanctioned the definition of contemporary Irish music submitted by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to the Commission in the last decade of the last century.  What blocked that proposal was an objection from the independent Irish radio sector, which felt that the awarding of the quota if sanctioned by the EU might be used as a legal tool to discriminate against the predominant form of popular music that they were promoting in their stations throughout Ireland, particularly in Dublin.  The quota is now down to 3%, even though the original contract provides that it should be 30%.  We have sat on our hands and allowed this to happen.  We have the legislative tools to deal with this issue, particularly this Bill.</p><p>This legislation is tightly framed, but there is no proposal that cannot be improved by amendment.  I was careful to remain within the legal parameters of what is permissible under EU law.  The definition provides: &quot;.....the music and lyrics should be composed and performed by persons in authentic sympathy and in tune with Ireland's unique cultural ethos&quot;.  As stated by Johnny Duhan, because our songs are now primarily written in English, it is often alleged that Irish music culture is part and parcel of a link or nexus with the UK or the US.  That is not the case.  We have a rich musical culture of our own, stemming from our Celtic past, which we have developed in a modern way through engagement with other national cultures.</p><p>I should point out that nowhere in the Bill is the nationality of the proponents of Irish music specified.  As such, Ministers who come forward with that excuse are ill advised or do not understand what the Bill seeks to achieve.  A lot of prominent Irish musicians and composers who know the situation on the ground endorse the idea of introducing a quota, including Danny McCarthy, Christy Moore, Paddy Moloney, Brendan Grehan, Paul Brady, Mary Black, Frankie Gavin, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, Steve Wickham, Jimmy McCarthy, Sean and Delores Keane, Finbar Furey, Finbar Wright, Sean Tyrell, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n O Connor, Peadar &Oacute; Riada and Louis Walsh.  I intend to hold a press launch in respect of this Bill in late September and to meet with all Deputies and Senators to discuss why it is necessary.  I will hold a meeting in the AV room at the end of September for that purpose, and, perhaps, an impromptu concert as well.</p><p>I know that people were shocked by the viewing figures of over 500,000 for RTE's &quot;Late Late Show&quot; country music slot.  Mr. Tubridy was in awe in that regard.  While he often travels beyond the Pale, he might want to travel further afield to the real country, where he will discover the importance of country and western music.  Venues across the country are packed out, including in Westport, which is in the Taoiseach's area, and in Ballinrobe.  In Ballymore, which is in my own constituency, the August weekend music festival is one of the largest in the country.  I invite my colleagues to attend.</p><p>Traditional c&eacute;il&iacute; music and Irish dancing are flourishing.  There will be more than 350,000 people in Ennis for the national fleadh next month.</p><p>John Creedon covers it in short programmes.  Irish TV covers it for two or three hours every night.  It is time our national broadcaster got its finger out.  Folk music is similarly well acknowledged across the country.</p> <p> This quota covers Irish music of all genres.  Thousands of the finest Irish musicians are being excluded from our airwaves simply because we have allowed ourselves to be steered by musical trends and fashions constructed primarily in the US and Great Britain.  In the context of the new make up of the D&aacute;il, the current political dispensation and the supposed new politics, I look forward to seeing this Bill become fully fledged, important legislation on the Statute Book.  It will protect our musical heritage for future generations of our citizens.  They deserve nothing less.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000016#P00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to regulate wind turbines through providing limits on the exportation of product generated from wind turbines; protecting nearby dwellings from noise and shadow flicker by providing minimum set back distances; allowing access to public consultative processes and related matters.</blockquote><p>This issue has huge implications in rural areas.  Never mind regulations, the previous D&aacute;il and the previous Government failed to put in place guidelines for this industry.  We urgently need regulations for wind farms.  They continue to be built, particularly in the midlands, without proper guidelines or regulations.  Four Ministers worked over a period of five years and failed to put them in place.  I and other Deputies raised this issue continually in the past two and half years and promises were made to us.  The result is Wild West-type development of wind farms in Counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.  A large development is planned for Cullenagh in County Laois with no protection for the landscape or rural dwellers in that area.</p><p>We are hoping to introduce some common sense.  This Bill seeks to introduce practical regulations that can be implemented so that wind farms are located in the right places.  The regulations would allow for sensible development and the protection of our landscape and rural dwellers.  The Bill deals with excess product.  Where there is a surplus, this can only be exported when approved by a Minister.  It is a very serious issue.  It is only where the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources deems that there is an excess that it can be exported.</p><p>The location of wind farms is dealt with.  The set back distance will be ten times the height of the wind turbine to the tip of the blade.  Noise levels would have to be within WHO limits and shadow flicker from a propeller would not be permitted to pass over a house.  It deals with the issue of public consultation so that it is real public consultation with local communities rather than cosmetic consultation.  Crucially, it gives back power to local authorities which was taken away by previous Governments in which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin took part and the last Government in the noughties.  The Critical Infrastructure Bill took away the power to zone land for wind farm development from local authorities.  This Bill would give back the power to make those decisions to elected councillors.  The issue of co-ownership is dealt with.  The Taoiseach will have noticed that wind farm developments have come up against huge resistance because there is no element of local ownership.  In line with the practice on the Continent and other continents, our Bill provides local communities, particularly those within 4 km, with the opportunity to buy up to 20% of shares in the company and get a return.  This could help disadvantaged areas such as areas with marginal land and sparsely populated areas.</p><p>We are putting this Bill forward as a sensible and practical approach to deal with an issue that has met with huge resistance.  We see the need to have some wind farm developments and for them to be part of meeting our targets for green energy but we do not see them as the complete solution.  Other methods such as solar power and hydro power need to be developed.  I ask the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to accept the Bill in good faith, take it on board and allow it to go to the next Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1254" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000016#P01700"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce Bill entitled an Act to end religious discrimination in admission to primary and post-primary educational establishments and to provide for full participation of pupils of all faiths and none in primary and post-primary educational establishments.</blockquote><p>We live in a State where in school admissions, it is perfectly legal to discriminate against a child based on that child's parents' religion or lack thereof.  This Bill seeks to end that discrimination.  We live in a State where we have a multitude of religious beliefs and a growing number of people of no religious belief yet in our schools we can segregate and discriminate on the grounds of religion.  We live and work side by side with people of different beliefs yet our schools are separating people on the grounds of religious division based on parents' belief.  This Bill would end that.</p><p>This Bill seeks to recognise that we live in a diverse society.  Society has changed hugely since schools were established in many cases and since the Equal Status Act gave permission to schools to segregate on religious grounds based on parents' belief.  There is a huge demand for change that has been shown by numerous polls.  Equate Ireland has published polls showing that 62% of people agree that school patronage in Ireland should be a key priority for this Government and that it is seen as something that must be changed, 82% of people agree with the concept that the Irish education system should be reformed so that no child is excluded because of their religion or lack thereof and 87% of people agreed that the State has a responsibility to ensure children do not experience religious discrimination in the school curriculum.</p><p>This D&aacute;il is very much behind that curve.  It seems that the Government is attempting to back track on what was the perceived belief in the previous Government that there would be a change to section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act which permits this discrimination.  Instead, it would seem from reports that the Government plans to introduce a new system that would allow patronage to remain largely in the hands of the Catholic Church, retain segregation and not get rid of what is called the baptism barrier.  I think this is wrong and regressive.  It is timely that we bring forward this Bill to put pressure on the Government to recognise that society has changed and that it should reflect that change.</p><p>As well as removing the baptism barrier and the deletion of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act, the Bill also deals with some of the provisions in our Education Acts that take no account of children's religious viewpoint or lack of religion when they enter a school and allow them to be discriminated against throughout the school day.  There is a constitutional right to opt out of religious instruction but that right is not facilitated in schools on a daily basis.  It is a particular problem when large parts of the school timetable are given over to religious ceremonies, particularly First Holy Communion.</p><p>Those not of the Catholic religion or those not taking part in the ceremony are segregated within the class.  In many cases, what happens is that a child is put at the back of the class and must still listen to all of the religious instruction that is given to the other children.  The opt-out has to be facilitated and there has to be change in the education system whereby a school ethos does not prevail for all students throughout the school day.  We need an opt-in system, not an opt-out.  School facilities can be given over to parents who want to practise their religious beliefs after the school day ends.  I am absolutely in favour of that.  As a socialist, I stand for freedom of religious expression but I also stand for a complete separation of church and state.  A person's religion or personal belief should not be imposed on others by the State's laws and at the taxpayer's expense.  Who is paying for these schools?  These are all taxpayer-funded schools.  The staff and all the other facilities are paid for by the taxpayer.  We also need to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act to end religious discrimination against school staff.  This is a very important Bill and the Government should take note of it and move with the times.</p></speech>

The Bill I am introducing seeks to reverse a particularly bad decision of the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Last year he made a very controversial amendment to the Planning and Development Act which allowed the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, for the first time in planning history, to place specific planning policy requirements on local authorities.  This amendment essentially gave the power to the Minister to impose very detailed planning proposals on local authorities irrespective of what the democratically agreed councillors in those areas had agreed to in their county development plans or local area plans.  Members will remember that this amendment was used only once, very controversially, to reduce the minimum apartment size that local authorities are allowed to approve in planning, which obviously will result in substandard and sub-sized apartment accommodation into the future.  What this Bill seeks to do in a very simple way is to repeal the controversial power that was given to the Minister by himself and by the Government of the day, and also to allow local authorities to determine, as is their statutory responsibility and democratic entitlement, the most appropriate planning frameworks for their development plans or local area plans.</p></speech>

The meeting provided the new Irish Government and the new Northern Ireland Executive with the opportunity to meet formally for the first time and exchange views on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and concern, especially in light of the recent UK referendum decision to leave the EU.  We had a detailed discussion on the potential impact of the UK referendum result.  It was agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and the benefits of North-South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements that emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.  Ten specific actions were agreed to optimise North-South joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the UK referendum result.  This will include a full audit of key North-South work programmes to establish risks and likely impacts arising from the UK&rsquo;s planned withdrawal from the EU.  In the margins of the ministerial council meeting, I had brief bilateral meetings with the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  We agreed on the need to work together to preserve the benefits of the peace process in any future negotiations.</p>  <p>  While proposals for an all-Ireland forum were not discussed at the ministerial council meeting, the Government believes that there is a need for the widest possible conversation on the implications of the referendum result for Ireland, North and South, and for North-South relations.  We will continue to explore options to achieve this in a way that is not divisive.  I hope to bring forward proposals on this shortly and I will discuss these with all parties.  </p>  <p>  There is a clear need for broader public dialogue, including on an inclusive all-island basis, on all of the many issues that may face the people of the island, North and South.  There will also be an ongoing engagement with other parties in the Oireachtas.  This is in addition to the engagement with the Brexit stakeholder group, which has already  been meeting for some time now.   </p>  <p>  On Friday, 24 June, the then UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, telephoned to inform me personally of the result of the referendum and of his intention to resign.  He thanked the Irish Government for its support all through the process.  Irish and British officials met in Dublin following a commitment made by the Prime Minister and I to early bilateral engagement at senior official level on a number of issues arising in the context of the result of the UK&rsquo;s EU referendum.</p>  <p>  I spoke with the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, by telephone on 13 July.  I offered her my congratulations and best wishes following her appointment that evening.  We discussed a range of issues of mutual interest, including the importance of continuing to work together to build on the excellent relationship that now exists between Ireland and Britain, our joint support of the peace process, and the wider development of co-operation between our two countries.  We also discussed the important challenges that arise from the recent vote by the UK to leave the European Union.  I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s key areas of concern and shared my perspective on the challenges that lie ahead in the forthcoming negotiations.  We agreed to stay in touch and that we would meet each other in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Sinn F&eacute;in is a united Ireland party.  Fine Gael once described itself in this way also.  In the wake of the Brexit vote, we said that an opportunity existed for a referendum on Irish unity as contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments about the potential or possibility for a referendum on Irish unity arising from the Brexit decision in Britain.  I also want to welcome the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's move to this position.  The SDLP and the Irish Labour Party have expressed support for this.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach says this is not the time for such a referendum, and that is fair enough.  Achieving it will depend very much on political will.  That means the parties and Independents in this State and the wider society must work alongside people in the North to ensure all of this is on the agenda of the negotiations around Brexit which could be over two to four years, so we have a bit of space.  We need to be open, imaginative and inclusive in all these matters.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's commitment, which he reiterated today and at a meeting with party leaders last week - which I thought was a positive engagement and a good meeting - to establish an all-Ireland dialogue or forum to bring in as many sectors as possible.  I spent Monday afternoon at Stormont and there is big concern among many sectors - I know the Taoiseach picked this up himself - and fear in some cases about the impact that pulling the North against its will out of the European Union on the basis of a decision taken mostly in England will have.</p><p>Of course, there are challenges but I think the Taoiseach will be surprised at the number of sectors, who traditionally would not see themselves in this position, starting to think themselves into a different space.</p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that we need to ensure this is not put on the back-burner.  When would the Taoiseach see the first meeting of this forum taking place?  When would he see the dialogue commencing?  We must be persuaders on these issues; we cannot be passive.</p> <p> If I may say so, the issue of Irish unity is bigger than any of us.  It is bigger than any political party or anyone else.  There are challenges and there are opportunities and we face into them very positively.</p> <p> Perhaps the Taoiseach could also indicate, if it is feasible, when he will meet the new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will meet his counterparts in the North.  The lead British Ministers all voted in favour of getting rid of key elements, such as the Human Rights Act 1998, voted against or expressed dislike for elements of the European Convention on Human Rights which is integral to the political infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement, and the British Prime Minister has made a point of emphasising and reiterating her Unionist credentials.  Therefore, we really need to be on our game, not only around the consequences of the vote to the leave the European Union but also in regard to the Good Friday Agreement consequences with what is arguably a more right-wing British Government in place in London.</p></speech>

I noticed a report published in the<i>Belfast Telegraph</i>on 28 June which indicated that there are now 100,000 children living in poverty conditions in Northern Ireland - some 25% of all children in that state.  The report indicated that 395,100 persons, or 22% of the overall population of Northern Ireland, in the year 2014-2015 were living below the poverty line.  If I was asking the question of Sinn F&eacute;in, I would ask Sinn F&eacute;in quite sharply how it defends being part of a government and presiding over a system that delivers that level of poverty within the state but my question is to the Taoiseach.  Obviously, we, on this side of the House, would argue that the solution is for working-class people, North and South, Catholic and Protestant, to organise to fight and to challenge the social conditions, the austerity and the capitalist property relations that lie behind them.  My question to the Taoiseach is whether these issues featured as part of his discussions and what solutions, if any, did he discuss with the political parties in the North as a means of addressing them.</p></speech>

It needs to be put back to the reform committee during the recess.  It is not fair to anybody trying to have meaningful discussion about these issues.</p>  <p>  There is broad agreement now about the need for an inclusive process to help define and address the many threats posed by the Brexit vote.  The new Northern Secretary, Mr. Brokenshire, stated on Monday that he could see everything being handled at the level of the North-South Ministerial Council.  This goes completely against the spirit of what is required.  It is an issue that goes beyond business as usual and there is no way it can be dealt with by a body which meets infrequently and has a different remit.  That is a body for discussion between two official entities.  It is not capable of the sort of broad inclusive dialogue that we need and that the Taoiseach articulated in his response.  Employers, unions, professional organisations and wider civic society have a wide range of concerns and they have to be listened to.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that we should have a form of national dialogue.  We do not need a politician-focused approach.  Equally, we do not need the type of forums we have held in Dublin Castle in the past.  It cannot and should not be State-heavy.  It should include business and other members of civic society, including younger people.  It should be fast, accessible and practical in terms of that dialogue around Brexit.  Will the Taoiseach outline any developments on this matter and what is to be done in the next two months to move it forward?</p>  <p>  To be absolutely clear, I do not favour an immediate Border poll, as advocated by Sinn F&eacute;in in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.  Some 55% voted to remain in the European Union.  One cannot automatically say that 55% would vote tomorrow morning for a united Ireland.  We need to be straight-up about that.  A united Ireland is about unity of people.  It is about persuasion, consensus and bringing people with us, not to now inflame passions unnecessarily or create unnecessary divisions.  The focus at present must be Brexit and ensuring that community groups, business people, trade unions and workers all have an input in trying to articulate their concerns and needs and then working a way through that.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach about the UK Presidency.  The British Government has stated it will not be taking that up.  I put it to the Taoiseach three weeks ago whether he would consider Ireland agreeing to participate as part of a multinational replacement Presidency.  Has anything happened on that matter and have we held discussions with the President of the European Council, Mr. Tusk, on what will happen next in that regard?  At some stage, the Taoiseach might answer, in the context of Question No. 4, whether or not he alerted the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the forum idea.</p></speech>

Fortunately, there was 20 years of good growth in trade and commerce between North and South and South and North.  Those businesses in the Border region - I am familiar with those in the two southern Ulster countries of my constituency, Cavan and Monaghan - that are heavily dependent on exporting to Northern Ireland and to the British market have already been hard hit by the weakening of sterling.  The Government and the Oireachtas need to focus on the immediate issues hitting business at present and there must be a case for some support for small and medium-sized enterprises that are heavily dependent on exporting to the sterling area.</p>  <p>  In this whole discussion, we all are mindful of the difficulties that will arise for exporters to the sterling area.  We must also be conscious of the exporters who will send their products through Britain to further destinations.  If there are customs and tariffs, products exiting Ireland and transiting through Britain to Asia and elsewhere will meet with additional costs.  Even if there are not hard borders, there will be customs and tariff regulations to be met.  That all generates additional costs.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body was established in 1990.  The Taoiseach was a member early on, as I was.  We worked together, both representatives from the Oireachtas and from Westminster, in very difficult political times in the early and mid-1990s.  That body now is the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and it has representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the assemblies in Northern Ireland and Wales, the Scottish Parliament and from Jersey and Guernsey.  It was established in 1990 as a forum for discussion for Members of Parliament and members of political assemblies to discuss and consult on issues and areas of mutual concern and interest.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly could be given an additional remit in ensuring that we use the parliamentary processes that are already in place.  We are not only talking about North-South.  Unfortunately, we are also talking about an east-west dimension as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000018#R01100"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating all of us.  These are really important questions.</p><p>As has been mentioned by a number of other speakers, representatives of all parties and groups in this House gathered in Government Buildings last week at the Taoiseach's invitation to discuss the implications of Brexit for the island of Ireland.  It was a very useful and constructive meeting and, surprisingly, there was much consensus.  There was unanimous agreement that a forum or dialogue between those North and South of the Border to tease out in real terms the implications of Brexit was urgently needed.  It was further agreed that the forum should be as broad-ranging and inclusive of all strands of society as was possible.</p> <p> I am trying to get my head around what has happened since.  I read the remarks of Deputy Martin and the Taoiseach's reply to questions at the MacGill Summer School.  It seemed to me that he is now in support of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal calling for a Border poll.  The Taoiseach's comments yesterday in this House seemed to move back from that, and there was further clarity from Deputy Martin this morning.  The suggestion immediately infuriated Unionists in the North, who were already sceptical of the all-Ireland dialogue proposal.  It was unnecessary and unhelpful to inject fears about the objective of a forum into this, as it really would be a forum that would be to everybody's benefit on the island of Ireland.</p> <p> As Deputy Martin indicated, the Good Friday Agreement enshrined consent as the principle on which matters in Northern Ireland relating to constitutionality are to be determined.  There is not a majority in the North that would now vote for unification, according to all opinion polls, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made it clear there is no intention on behalf of the British Government to call for such a poll.  Plainly, it will not happen.  It is unfortunate in that context that there is in any way a connection by some between a proposal and a reality.  All of us would like to see the day arrive when such a poll would carry in the North.  To have any connection in the eyes of Unionists between proper and open dialogue on the impact of Brexit and how we can continue deep and meaningful co-operation on the island of Ireland, and a fast-track to a constitutional poll, would be unhelpful.</p> <p> I ask the Taoiseach to put things back on track and advance the idea agreed by all parties and groupings in the House in the Sycamore Room in Government Buildings last week to advance the dialogue we spoke about and return to serious thinking about relations that are inclusive, welcoming and not frightening for anybody on the island of Ireland.  Perhaps we can then think about preparing to accommodate Unionists in a united Ireland when that becomes a real possibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000019#S00200"><p>Deputy Adams raised a number of points.  We had a good meeting last week with the different leaders of the groupings here.  It was a positive and constructive engagement.  I should make it clear that what is actually unique in respect of our position here is the Good Friday Agreement, as we are a co-guarantor of the Agreement with the British Government.  It deals with all the aspects of life in Northern Ireland and, by implication, North and South and east and west.  My point in Donegal was that the authors of the Good Friday Agreement in their vision put a clause in the agreement, and at some point in future - we are nearly 20 years on now - a Secretary of State might have evidence that would trigger that clause.  That evidence is not there now.  My following point was that, were it to happen at some point in future, the negotiations as part of the overall reflection on the Good Friday Agreement should ease the way if the majority of people in Northern Ireland said they wanted to leave the United Kingdom, and, having found themselves removed from the European Union and wishing to join a country - the Republic of Ireland - that continues to be a member of the Union, the road should be made easier for them.  It is just that point, and it might never happen.  As part of the overall discussions, the position should be catered for.  Clearly, there is no evidence of a majority in Northern Ireland voting for that now or in the immediate future.  One can consider the discussions we will have, and the Good Friday Agreement is central to that.  It is an issue the original authors foresaw and, whether it happens or not, they put in a clause that will allow for it to happen.  I am just continuing that for the time ahead.</p>  <p>  I would like to think we could have this engagement and conversation in September.  I agree completely with everybody that this is far bigger than any individual party, as it is about all the people.  This process should be enthusiastic, forward-focused, welcoming and inclusive, allowing for every person's view, whether he or she is an entrepreneur, a researcher, a farmer, a worker, a housewife or whatever type of citizen.  It is much too important not to have that happen.  In the 1980s, when the New Ireland Forum was set up, not all the parties agreed to join, and I remember the McGimpsey brothers attended on behalf of the Unionist party to give evidence in a personal capacity.  When one considers the implications of what we may have to deal with, it is very important that people have the opportunity, or whatever term we put on it, to have their point of view put forward.  Whether it is an island conversation, conference or opportunity, the issues need to be heard so that everybody understands the scale of what we are at.  I am receiving much interest from businesses North and South that want to express their opinions.  I would like that to be done in a non-divisive way, as it is in the interests of everybody that this should happen.  I am quite sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has been in touch with his counterpart asking for a meeting, and I spoke with British Prime Minister, Theresa May, saying that when it is appropriate, and as early as possible, we should arrange a meeting to build on the relationships we have had for quite some time.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Barry's question, we have the North-South Ministerial Council, cross-Border activities and agencies working with each other because of social issues, as they reflect on the challenges, disadvantages and unfairness in many areas of society.  That is why the peace process has been backed by the European Union for all these years, and there is &euro;3 billion on the table between now and 2021 for fragile communities coming out of a conflict situation in which 3,000 people lost their lives over 30 years.  The overall intention is that Northern Ireland should be peaceful, prosperous and outward-looking and should be able to provide opportunity for its citizens.  That involves trade and business.  That is why we have the many discussions and activities going on and why we support, in both monetary and political terms, the likes of the A5 project and the north west gateway.  It is why we continue to be strong supporters of the Narrow Water bridge, the Ulster Canal and so many other activities North and South, including medical, educational and infrastructural projects.  These are social issues that have an impact in enclaves and areas where there have been difficulties - where the peace walls apply and outside them.</p><p>Cross-Border trade is of greater importance to firms in Northern Ireland dealing in goods and products with companies and people down here than <i>vice versa</i>.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been in touch with both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which have contacted their companies and small and medium enterprises individually.<br/><br/>The point made by Deputy Brendan Smith made is true.  One can leave the Republic with a lorry load of machinery and drive to the Ukrainian border but if controls and checks are in place, they will add to the amount of paperwork on the way in and out.  While hard borders have disappeared in many cases, there is the capacity with modern technology to track the movement of goods and conditions apply in terms of country of origin for raw material, products sourced for manufacturing and so on.  Ireland has improved greatly in terms of its competitiveness and we do not want to see anything happen that would damage it.  For us, one of the outcomes following Brexit should be that Britain would be as close to the Single Market as possible because that impacts on us and our interests including the common travel area, trade links, the peace process, the common Border and the opportunity to continue to expand.<br/><br/>We have discussed it before and I agree with Deputy Martin that the kind of conversation we should have should be about the future.  It should involve as many as is possible from across the spectrum, including young business entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, politicians and so on.  I agree it is not a static forum such as that of the 1980s, but it is an opportunity to be able to reflect on the many issues.<br/><br/>The British Government has stated that it is not accepting the EU Presidency now.  I know that others have expressed an interest.  Belgium has been referred to in this context.  There may be a statement later in that regard.</p></speech>

I understand it has been mentioned but I do not have confirmation of it.</p>  <p>  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which is now the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council present opportunities but we need a different sense of contact in respect of what we have to deal with here.  I was a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in the beginning.  The idea was that we would become acquainted with the system and the members of the House of Commons and talk about issues.  It was a big success.  We should also not forget the North-South Interparliamentary Association which was set up by the former Ceann Comhairle and the speaker of the Executive.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Howlin in respect of North-South dialogue.  It should be inclusive and broad-ranging in everyone's interest.  We are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The point he makes is important.  Comments about a Border poll or having a discussion about the future of the island, North and South, should not be connected or linked to an attempt to influence people's thinking in the North about an all-island situation.  This is much more immediate and of profound consequence.  It is important that we have access to the advice and views of the businesses and people of Northern Ireland.  I do not see why we cannot have that, while not interfering in any way with the politics or priorities of the parties in Northern Ireland or down here.  This is about people, North and South.  I agree it should be inclusive, comprehensive and welcoming and it should allow everyone to set out their stall.  Until such time as the British Government sets out its objective and its own horizon, it is difficult for Europe to respond in detail.  I note in some cases that it has referred to Article 50 not being triggered until the new year.  I think that might be the cause of some frustration in some European countries.  The Prime Minister will make a statement when she has reflected on it.</p>  <p>  From that point of view, I would like to speak to the leaders about my set of propositions and to have a conversation early in September.  We need it then so that we can move on, build on the consensus we have and get that of our friends and colleagues in Northern Ireland, while respecting their views.  It could be in everyone's interest.  I will work hard on it over the next few weeks.</p></speech>

Is a united Ireland something that cannot be named?  Is it something for which we do not have a responsibility?  Are we always to behave like Slattery's mounted foot and rubbish Sinn F&eacute;in's proposition, only to go for it later?  This is bigger than all of us.  We should become persuaders for Irish unity because we will not have a workers' republic, nor any kind of real republic, without the unity of the people of this island.  That is the Connolly proposition for those from the William Walker school of gas and water works socialism.</p>  <p>  We need to have an inclusive discussion in this House about new relationships.  The Taoiseach talks about people joining this State.  Does he think the people in the North are mad?  We want a new Ireland but look at our health services.  Why would any thinking person, in the Unionist community or otherwise, want to leave the public health service they have, for all its faults, to come to what we have here?  The same applies to all the other social and economic issues, such as homelessness, which press down upon us.  Partition created two conservative states on this island and while the focus has historically been on the Orange state, this one, as a result of the counter-revolution, was just as bad.  Let us reimagine Ireland not just as one part joining the other part and not as a 32-county free state, but as a new imagined Ireland to which the founders of the Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il parties, as well as the party of which I am part, subscribed.  I say this provocatively because we need to be a bit provocative in looking at these matters.  We also need to expedite funding issues in this space.  It is not good enough that the failure of the British to start negotiations should put so many people under so much pressure, whether it is in respect of the Narrow Water bridge project, some other project in the Border corridor where capital investment is needed, or people on the PEACE or INTERREG programmes.  We need to push all of those ahead but, most important, we need to set aside time in this D&aacute;il to discuss these matters in a reasonable and rational but robust way.</p></speech>

I thought we had a broad agreement last week on an invitation to an inclusive dialogue without preconditions for people to ask about the implications of this profound change in the status of the United Kingdom for the people on the island of Ireland.  We invited people, whether farmers, industrialists, workers or employers, to come and talk to us.  Over the weekend that seemed to change.  The suspicion of Unionists and the dismissal by the DUP of the proposal were not well handled and it was not the Taoiseach's finest moment.  Notwithstanding that, the linking of this notion to the idea that it might speed up a Border poll and somehow hasten a vote on unity move what was suspicion to a feeling of being threatened.  This damages the prospect of it being as inclusive as we would want.  It has been characterised as a Sinn F&eacute;in proposition.</p></speech>

It is one thing to have a Border poll but it is another thing to win it and there is no point in posturing about polls that one knows will not be won or will not even take place.  James Connolly said the working class were the incorruptible fighters for Irish freedom.  In saying this, he understood that unity meant having a consistent line of defending and promoting the interests of working class people North and South and needed to be built from below by winning over Protestant workers to a united fight against inequality North and South of the Border.  Connolly was primarily an internationalist and his motivation was to break from empires, rather than siding with them or going into Government with people who were loyal to empires.  If we want unity we should start not by looking for corporate tax reductions, which will only come at the expense of working class people, or having a race to the bottom in the area of pay for working class people but by siding consistently with working class people, North and South, in the fight against austerity and inequality.</p></speech>

There is never anything wrong with talking about these issues.  I take the Deputy's point fully that there should never be a correlation.  There will be no Border poll now.  There is no evidence of a majority wanting to join the Republic.  My point is a different one in that it is about catering for the future, in whatever number of years.  If that were ever to be triggered, there is an opportunity to deal with that consequence in the discussions.  That is all.  It has nothing to do with immediacy in terms of a border poll.  People of the Unionist persuasion are fully entitled to their views and there should not be a false understanding that there is some kind of an attempt to have an immediate border poll to pressurise them into joining the Republic of Ireland.  That was never the intention and is not the case but in the interests of the island of Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic, we should at least be able to discuss and hear their view of the challenges that will be faced now because of the consequence of the vote, particularly when Northern Ireland voted to remain a member of the European Union.  We need to have a rational, commonsense, inclusive way of doing that and I hope we can get that going in the interests of everybody.</p></speech>

Ireland has moved from 7th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, up from 16th.  Our improved competitiveness has been central to recent strong economic growth.</p>  <p>  However, as the National Competitiveness Council has warned in recent months, the global outlook is precarious.  The recent UK referendum result adds to the uncertainty in the external environment.  The key challenge for us now is to remain focused on the addressing the competitiveness policy areas that are within our control domestically.  A programme for a partnership Government is committed to sustaining the focus on structural reform across the economy and to attaining a top tier competitiveness position.</p>  <p>  As a first step, last week I brought the council's forthcoming Competitiveness Scorecard to Cabinet where it was discussed.  It was also considered by Government yesterday.  I will be working with Ministers on the key issues identified by the council.  The Government is committed to ensuring fiscal sustainability.  We will step up investment in infrastructure.  We will drive the implementation of our research strategy Innovation 2020.  I will be, and I am, working with the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, on consolidating our trading relationship with the UK and on broadening our trade and investment footprint in growth markets.</p></reply>

There are two areas I want to focus on in my supplementary question, first, the tax environment for entrepreneurs, that is, Ireland versus the UK.  It is widely accepted by investors that the UK is more competitive than Ireland on taxation incentives for entrepreneurs and attracts more businesses.  The UK has a more attractive income tax regime, for example, share option treatment, to attract multinationals and entrepreneurs.  That is an issue we have to examine.  Capital gains tax incentives for entrepreneurs are also much more favourable in the UK, as the Minister will be aware.  For example, the Irish capital gains tax, CGT, rate for entrepreneurs who sell their business is 20%, limited to the first &euro;1 million of gains.</p>  <p>  Second, in regard to corporation tax, in budget 2015 the UK Government set a policy objective of reducing it to 18% by 2020 and it has since announced a target of less than 15%, which challenges our corporation tax environment.  Given the regime for entrepreneurs and the regime for corporations, what does the Minister believe will be the effect of the reduced corporation tax envisaged in the UK on this country when we are competing for foreign direct investment?</p></speech>

There is huge uncertainty around this issue.  The Deputy asked me about capital gains tax and corporation tax.  I can assure him that I am working with the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  We have put in a submission, as have other interested parties, and we will be following up that in the budget.</p></speech>

To rebut some of what the Minister said, in the World Bank rankings for ease of doing business across 189 economies, we dropped four places to 17th in 2016.  At our highest point we were ranked 10th out of 189 and we are now behind Estonia and Macedonia in world rankings.  The World Bank report states: "Ireland made paying taxes more costly and complicated for companies by increasing landfill levies and by requiring additional financial statements to be submitted with the income tax return."  It went on to outline the complexities of red tape and cost of compliance, which ultimately impacts on our competitiveness.  We have dropped to 17th in the rankings and we have also slipped six places in a ranking on how easy it is to start a business.  What is the Minister, her colleagues beside her and the Department doing to improve Irish competitiveness, which will help our entrepreneurs and job creators and society as a whole to progress and compete better on the international stage?</p></speech>

He quoted some figures which I will take on board.  The World Bank's annual Doing Business report measures and tracks changes in regulations affecting business.  Ireland has achieved an ease of doing business ranking of 17 out of 189 economies.  That is up two places from the previous year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about tax and, obviously, it is hugely important.  UK tax issues are a matter for the UK administration and Parliament.  However, we are working on it with the Department of Finance.  Our competitive 12.5% corporate tax is underpinned by a competitive regime.  That 12.5% rate sticks; it is absolutely written in stone.  Our world class research and development tax credit and our best in class OECD compliant knowledge development box are there to make sure that we are competitive.  Our low rate applied to a broad base ensures sustainable economic growth which will maintain tax revenues.  Ireland's foreign direct investment policy, of which tax is but one part, has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland - the kind that brings real jobs.  We have has an enviable track record.  Ireland's transparent and competitive tax regime and our membership of the EU continue to provide a certainty that is valued by business.  Ireland has an English speaking business environment, ease of doing business and access to talent and consistently performs well on key international indices.  Ireland has a certain, stable and competitive offering.  Ireland is, and will remain, a member of the EU and the euro zone.</p></speech>

The Low Pay Commission was established last year through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  Its principal function is, once a year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair, sustainable and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The commission submitted its first report in July 2015.  Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1 January this year.</p>  <p>  In its first report, the commission recommended that anomalies in regard to PRSI which could adversely affect employer costs should be addressed.  To that end, adjustments were made to PRSI in budget 2016, which have been provided for by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  These changes will assist employers in reducing costs, thus ensuring a continuing positive climate for job creation.  Measures were also introduced to ensure that the benefit of the increase was not lost to taxation for the employee.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the commission&rsquo;s second report on the national minimum wage was submitted to Government yesterday and the recommendation made by the commission that the national minimum hourly rate be increased by ten cent to &euro;9.25 will be considered by Government in the context of budget 2017.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the independence of the Low Pay Commission is firmly established in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  The commission can only operate in accordance with that statutory remit and make recommendations to the Minister in accordance with the criteria that are clearly and explicitly set out in the Act.  I want to make it very clear that I cannot speak for the commission and I stress the value of its independence.  Clearly, the commission has to look at the matter across all the criteria of the Act.  We will look at the report over the next three months and the Minister will make a decision on it in respect of budget 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000023#W00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  In the summer economic statement, the Government has given a commitment to increase the minium wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over a five-year period.  How does one get from the current minimum wage rate of &euro;9.15 per hour to &euro;10.50 over five years with a ten cent increase?  The answer is that it is impossible to do that.  On the other hand, if the Government is making statements about the projected increase in the minimum wage over a five-year period, then what is the function of the Low Pay Commission?  If the Government is going to set the rate, there is no need for a commission.  Therefore, what is the role of the commission?</p>  <p>  Yesterday's recommendation is an insult to workers.  It is a disgrace that a commission which costs the taxpayer almost &euro;0.5 million would propose a ten cent increase to minimum wage for low paid workers.  More than 70,000 people in the State depend on the minimum wage.  The living wage is &euro;11.50 per hour.  At this rate, it will take 23 years for a minimum wage worker to achieve a basic living standard.  Combined with the Government's deferral of addressing the situation of zero-hour and low-hour contracts this month, this recommendation tells us two things, namely, that the Low Pay Commission is not fit for purpose and that the Government has no interest in tackling low pay, poverty and inequality.</p></speech>

That is exactly what is laid out in the rules in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, as passed in the D&aacute;il last year.  The independence of the commission must be respected and observed by all, including the Government.  Obviously, all the criteria must be taken into account in the legislation but the commission is independent.  It has met on 18 occasions since February 2015.  It has examined the available data and the 33 responses it received.  There was public consultation and it held meetings in Monaghan, Galway and Dublin and it met with a wide range of groups.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Minister must, within three months of receiving the recommendation in the report, make a decision and make the necessary order.  If the Minister departs from the recommendation or declines to make an order, the Minister must prepare to lay this before both Houses of the Oireachtas and state the reasons for his or her doing so.  I stress once again that the commission is independent.  I cannot speak for the commission nor can the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and that is extremely important.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what considerations the commission takes on board.  It takes on board a wide range of considerations when it makes decisions, which are not made lightly.  The commission has looked at all the areas of concern for the employers and employees.  The commission's role is to ensure the wage is appropriate and is one employers and employees can sustain, which is extremely important.</p></speech>

However, I received a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday which stated that there were 22 meetings, so there is a slight difference there.  Is the Minister of State aware that the chairman of the commission earned &euro;22,493 from 2015 to the first quarter of this year?  In that period, according to the response we received, the chairman attended 22 meetings, which works out at approximately &euro;1,000 per meeting.  This is the person who is chairing the Low Pay Commission which yesterday recommended a ten cent increase for workers on the minimum wage.  Surely to God, if there was ever an example of gross hypocrisy, this is it.</p></speech>

The aim of the minimum wage is to have an incentive to work, which is extremely important.  A rate has to be set that is fair and sustainable to help as many people as possible without having a significant effect on the economy or a negative effect on employment.  That is where the commission is coming from.  It is made up of nine people, three representing the unions, three from the employers sector and three academics with expertise in the area.  We must support their independence.  They have made this decision based on what is fair and sustainable.  It is now up to the Government.</p><p>I am sure the Deputy has seen the report.

The Minister will be aware that my party tabled a Private Members' motion on this some weeks ago.

I will answer that in the supplementary reply.  He asked for the timetable for the review of the book of quantum and that is the question I will answer now.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is an independent statutory agency and, as Minister, I am not permitted in my executive function to interfere in any way with the day to day operations and functions of PIAB.  Section 54(1)(b) of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 sets out the principal functions of the board: &quot;to prepare and publish a document (which shall be known as the 'Book of Quantum') containing general guidelines as to the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in respect of specified types of injury&quot;.</p><p>The book of quantum was last produced in June 2004 and data was sourced by independent consultants on behalf of PIAB from a number of sources including the Courts Service, the insurance industry and the State Claims Agency.  PIAB is reviewing the book of quantum and has engaged outside consultants to assist in this work and it is due to be published in the second half of 2016. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The book is not a recommendation for compensation levels but rather a reflection of the prevailing level of awards</font>, <font color="#2F2F2F">compensation values awarded by the courts, settlements agreed by the insurance industry, settlements agreed by the State Claims Agency, and settlements agreed through the PIAB process. </font></p></speech>

I would have thought it was fairly obvious from my question on the book of quantum that it was linked to the very obvious issue of motor insurance premiums and the scandal of the rip off at the moment.  I appreciate that PIAB is independent and I have met with it but as the Minister pointed out it has not updated the book since 2004.  There are several problems with car insurance.  Many claims are settled outside PIAB and the courts and the insurance company pay-outs are invisible.  Implicit in the information we do have on the claims pay-outs are the injuries and the levels of awards that are visible.  Unfortunately, the book of quantum seems to be very out of date.</p>  <p>  What will the Minister do to address the spiralling insurance costs?  Has she considered the model operating in the United Kingdom, care and not cash?  This applies to minor injuries.  The book of quantum will come up with a guide.  It will not be definitive or be a blueprint but it will help I hope to force down premiums.  Under the care not cash model, care such as rehabilitation and physiotherapy are awarded rather than a cash payment.  Has the Minister, the Department or the Government considered that in reviewing the book of quantum and the spiralling costs? </p></speech>

The objective of the review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  The review will include an examination of the factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has established a task force in the Department to undertake the review.  The first phase of that review, dealing with the framework for motor insurance compensation, has now been completed and I understand the Minister for Finance expects to publish the report in the coming weeks.  The next phase of the review will focus on the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  This phase of the review will be overseen by a working group chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The group holds its first meeting today and has scheduled further meetings for early September and the coming months.  It is proposed that an interim report will be provided to the Minister for Finance by the end of 2016.</p></speech>

There was an attempt last week to introduce an au pair Bill that would prevent those workers having access to the industrial relations machinery of the State.  I am very concerned about certain companies establishing here and practising which are paying workers well below the minimum wage and refusing them access to the Workplace Relations Commission.  I am talking in particular about Deliveroo.  How can the Minister regulate that and stop these things happening?</p></reply>

Most employment rights legislation does not apply to independent sub-contractors with the exception of health and safety and equality. </p><p>Ireland has a well-resourced and proactive labour inspectorate, which now forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There are already existing mechanisms in place to tackle this issue.  Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain areas of focus.  Where the WRC inspection service receives complaints in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and-or the scope section of the Department of Social Protection for investigation either solely by the recipient or jointly with the WRC. </p><p>In most cases, it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual, the relevant Departments and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals.  This code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Departments with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Finance and Department of Social Protection have recently conducted a joint public consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements.  </p><p>There is a convergence of interests with my Department.  Apart from the significant losses to the Exchequer, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated so that employees are not deprived of employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers. </p><p>The case highlighted by the Deputy is one example of the changes that are emerging in the world of work.  The European Foundation for Working and Living Conditions, Eurofound, has identified nine distinct new forms of employment.  The work of Eurofound reflects a common problem at EU and international level, and not just in Ireland. </p></reply>

According to the contract, the people who work for it are self-employed, so they do not deserve the minimum wage but are on &euro;4.25 or &euro;4.50 an hour.  They have no recourse or access to the WRC, and if any person attempts to go to the WRC or any other State machinery such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Deliveroo is indemnified against any costs or claims the person may make.  Deliveroo is a growing company.  I have a leaflet that was distributed to every home in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, not just restaurants.  It exploits, in a hyper way, young people, foreign students and very young students in this country.  A wage of &euro;4.25 an hour is unacceptable, as is not having recourse to State legislation.  Are we back to 1913?  Can the Minister of State give us some guarantees that this will stop?</p></speech>

There are new forms of employment all over Europe.  It is a problem for Europe, one with which Eurofound is dealing.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners examine the taxation problems for such workers and the scope section of the Department of Social Protection has the function of deciding whether a person is an employer or an employee.  It is important to point that out.  In the code of practice we discussed, there are criteria in place to determine whether a person is an employer or an employee.  I can send the information on to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The WRC has a statutory authority to share information with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  A total of 575 joint operations took place between the two bodies in 2015 and 353 took place in 2014.  Many more inspections have taken place.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, many problems arise in the food and hospitality sector.  The WRC has 56 inspectors to carry out this work.  I am satisfied that it has the necessary resources.</p></speech>

It is not that long ago that there were more dog wardens in the country than labour inspectors.  I worked for a union, tutoring in labour law.  We were acutely aware of the lack of resources for inspections.</p>  <p>  I do not want to take up too much of the Minister of State's time, but we have to go a bit further with this.  We need a mechanism in labour law which will insist that if a watchdog such as the WRC receives enough complaints from the public it can carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of any company, such as those I have mentioned, and the hyper-exploitation of young people.  If we let this happen, why would all bus drivers, teachers and nurses not be on self-employed contracts?  We are hurtling in that direction if we do not stop this.</p></speech>

There is employee sharing, job sharing, interim management, casual work, ICT-based mobile work, voucher-based work, portfolio work, crowd employment and collective employment.  I am satisfied that the WRC is doing its job.  Problems that previously took two years to solve now being dealt with in three weeks.  The WRC has the necessary resources and manpower, and we should let it do its job with the assistance of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.

Prior to this, the lease had passed through number of State agencies since a 65-year lease was first taken out in 1969.  Carrisbrook House was 85% vacant for a number of years, despite having been actively marketed by Forf&aacute;s and the IDA.  The building was difficult to sublet, partly on account of the high cost of refurbishment.  The IDA also did not have vacant possession of the entire property due to an existing lease with a tenant which runs until 2025, thereby limiting its marketability further. </p>  <p>  After carefully considering the best course forward, the IDA decided to exit the lease with effect from December 2015 as it was the least costly option for the State.  The alternative was continuing to meet contractual obligations to pay rent over the remaining lifetime of the lease until 2034, together with meeting additional liabilities that arise in the context of the full repairing and insuring lease.  While the payment of &euro;9.4 million to exit the lease was a significant amount, it represents a saving to the State of an estimated &euro;13.65 million in comparison to maintaining the lease until completion.</p></speech>

It would represent a saving, but how was this allowed to happen?  What was the Minister's knowledge of it?  When did it come to her attention or that of the previous Minister?  How could something like this be allowed to happen, where &euro;10.4 million of taxpayers' money was spent on a property that is empty?</p>  <p>  The Minister has given me the background to the case, which I appreciate.  I appreciate that she is trying to do her best, but is she standing over this waste of taxpayers' money?  When did the Department become aware of it?  What have we learned from it?  Is this being repeated in other buildings?  We had this experience with the HSE in Galway, where it had to break a lease and pay almost &euro;1 million.  There is something seriously wrong with Government Departments that tolerate this type of policy.</p></speech>

The IDA commissioned the services of a professional property company to review a number of options, including the early surrender of the lease.  The agency carefully considered this advice, along with that of a real estate company and a financial services consultancy which also provided professional options.  After almost two years of discussions, and following intensive negotiations, the agency and landlord came to an agreement in late 2015.  Had the IDA decided to remain in the lease, it would have continued for an additional 19 years.  A tenant was in place that could not be moved.  The IDA tried to lease the building but failed to do so.  The building was vacant.</p></speech>

I became aware of the situation in the past number of weeks.  The decision to enter into this lease was taken a very long time ago, in 1969.  Given the nature of the lease and its terms, the State's hands were very much tied in terms of options to exit its contractual obligations.</p><p>Clearly, there is a need to prevent such a scenario from happening again.  I am confident that through the lessons learned we will make sure that this does not happen in the future.</p></speech>

The potential absence of the precautionary principle is also very worrying, as exposed in the leak by Greenpeace recently.</p></reply>

Such an agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU member state.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  An independent study commissioned by my Department and carried out by Copenhagen Economics in 2013 suggests that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  These findings are backed up in a comprehensive independent report contracted by the European Commission, carried out by Ecorys and published on 13 May 2016.  Ireland strongly supports the negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  Regulatory compatibility and co-operation is not about reducing standards or deregulation.  Rather, it is about facilitating increased business and trade opportunities between Europe and America and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable.  That is particularly important for SMEs.</p></speech>

There is no real evidence whatsoever that Ireland will benefit from the TTIP.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada, which seems to be an attempt to get a foot in the door before the TTIP is agreed.  CETA includes an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS, which would allow corporations to bypass the normal court process, which is a privilege members of the public could not possibly get.  If the agreements go through they will give corporations an incredible advantage in getting their way in any state in which they operate.</p></speech>

However, the treaties are foundation documents for all European decision making so TTIP negotiators must be cognisant of those in all negotiations.  Any final agreement will be subject to scrutiny by every individual government across the European Union.  Each of the 28 member states will be able to raise objections to any matters they consider might breach principles of the EU treaties such as the precautionary principle.  Added to that, if the democratically elected Members of the European Parliament feel that any proposed agreement undermines that clause, they may fail to ratify it.</p></speech>

I went to the reading room in the Department and compared the released document with a similar document in the agreement.  I was not allowed to bring anything out of the reading room but I was able to make comparisons.  I discovered that the Greenpeace document was 100% accurate, which is even more worrying.  The truth of the matter is that climate change, the environment, workers' rights and consumer protection will be undermined by the agreement.  The Minister said we would be able to change the agreement by voting on it, but the Council of Ministers will make the decision and the agreement can be ratified even without each member state's parliament voting for it.  The agreement would automatically be introduced for three years and much damage would be done even if we chose to vote against it in this country.  The situation is very worrying.  I do not blame the Minister but we must take the issue much more seriously.  We should be very concerned about what is coming down the tracks.</p></speech>

The EU-US free trade negotiations are the most open and transparent trade negotiations to date.  Reports relating to each round of discussions with all information on the EU position in the negotiations are published on the European Commission's website.  Unlike the EU, the US does not publish its negotiating texts and the US has separate protocols for reading its documentation, effectively limiting access to Members of Congress.  Special reading rooms have been created in capitals around Europe to allow equivalent access to European and national parliamentarians to review the consolidated EU-US versions of the negotiating texts.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle and I have invited Deputies to come and view the documents.  Members are very welcome to do so.

The Minister said she had written to the Ceann Comhairle and to all Deputies inviting them to take up her offer of a briefing from her Department and to visit the reading room.  I did that and I found it interesting, to say the least.</p><p>Given the lack of public awareness about the exercise which is being undertaken and its potential, does the Minister not think that it would be a good idea to do a public awareness roadshow around the country and visit the regions?  The Minister's Department divides up the country into various regions.  If we look at the Action Plan for Jobs, which the Minister's predecessor launched and she is continuing, it is broken down by region.  The Minister visits the various regions and focuses on and emphasises each one as she visits.  Given the enormity of TTIP and the potential and consequences on both sides, as it is a big debate that is out there, we should all try to make a value judgment call on it.  We need to have more public consultation.  That requires visits to the regions as part of a public awareness consultation.</p></speech>

I am disappointed with that, though I take on board the Deputy's comments.  As I said, the trade agreement is not finalised nor near to it.</p></speech>

Will the D&aacute;il have the opportunity to debate this hugely important trade agreement and will we have a vote on it?  I believe this agreement has major implications for workers' rights.  Labour standards are not on this agenda.  It also has major implications for public services and perhaps most worryingly it proposes to give privileged rights to foreign investors and corporations to sue states.  Under CETA, foreign investors will have more rights than any other group in this State.  Foreign investors will also be able to bring claims against regulations in the public interest that impact their investments.</p></reply>

On 5 July 2016, the Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application of CETA, which are available on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website.  I ask that the public look at that website.  Given the position taken by Ireland and other member states, I note that the commission has now decided to submit CETA to the council for decision as a mixed agreement.  This means that the agreement contains provisions that fall under both EU and member state responsibility.  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  Following a decision by the council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  Its full entering into force will be subject to the conclusion by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament and by all member states through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that the Oireachtas will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.  That means that we will vote on it here in the Chamber.  The process will require that I, as Minister, move a motion in the D&aacute;il to ratify the agreement and that there will be a vote.</p></reply>

Since being appointed as Minister of State, I have placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that we have the talent and skills available to meet enterprise needs.  I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I am pleased that, under the auspices of the apprenticeship council, the first enrolments on the new apprenticeship programmes will commence in autumn of this year.  The number of undergraduate ICT places will increase this autumn.  I also recently launched the new web portal, Tech/Life Ireland, which is funded by my Department, to attract skilled professionals to this country.</p>  <p>  In addition, the expert group on future skills needs, EGFSN, reports to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills regularly.  The EGFSN plays a key role in advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy.  Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles.  These include ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.  Future opportunities are also anticipated in international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics and the hospitality sector.  I met the Irish Road Haulage Association over the last number of days.</p>  <p>  Co-operation between employers and the education and training system is crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs and the regional skills fora will be important in that role.</p></reply>

I want to flag one particular aspect of that report, because I have received correspondence about a shortage of chefs.  The Restaurants' Association of Ireland says there is a shortage of up to 5,000 chefs in this country, so the situation is coming to a critical juncture.  When frequenting pubs and restaurants, we can see for ourselves that the vast majority of staff, particularly chefs and other kitchen staff, are non-Irish nationals.  They have come to this country to fill a void.  Has that problem appeared on the Minister of State's radar?  The Restaurants' Association of Ireland has called for the re-establishment of CERT, the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training.  CERT ran valuable courses and produced chefs and people with associated skills, of which there is currently a huge deficit.</p></speech>

He is correct.  A number of weeks ago I launched an initiative programme for chefs who have gone through a three- or four-year apprenticeship in Tallaght.  The indications are that over the next four, five or six years the hospitality sector will require perhaps 8,000 to 10,000 chefs.  There is no doubt that this is an important issue.  The hospitality sector provides some of the most important services in the economy.  It employs approximately 158,000 in 16,000 enterprises.  I have asked Enterprise Ireland to prepare a report on how small and medium-sized businesses feel about economic growth in the next couple of years, including the exact number of chefs and other staff that will be required.  They will report back to me hopefully by September. </p>  <p>  If the ability is there to create so many jobs in that sector, which I believe there will be, we will not be founding wanting in that regard.</p></speech>

Basic apprenticeship schemes for carpenters, plasterers and bricklayers completely diminished over five or six years, down to about 4,000 or 5,000.  In September, we will be launching 25 new apprenticeship schemes, many of which will be in the sectors the Deputy mentioned.  I have written to employers' groups asking them to indicate whether employers are in a position to take on apprentices in those areas, which have the capacity to create a substantial number of jobs.  As the economy progresses there will be more building projects, so it would be unacceptable if we could not have basic apprenticeship schemes for electricians, carpenters and bricklayers.  In September, we will have 25 apprenticeship schemes which include many of the jobs referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

A central co-ordination unit in regard to Brexit has been established in the Department of the Taoiseach.  In regard to my own Department, given the breadth and diversity of policy and operational areas that are relevant to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, this is a matter that has an impact on, and is being monitored by, all the divisions across my Department.</p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the UK referendum result on 24 June, as part of my contingency plans, I have established a co-ordination group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, Single Market and trade officials, together with the chief executive officers of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to oversee the management of our immediate response, including messaging to businesses both at home and overseas.  I chair this group and will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold at EU level and bilaterally with the UK.  In addition, the EU affairs unit of my Department exercises a dedicated overall co-ordination role across all the relevant policy areas, and represents my Department in the work that is being undertaken at cross-government level, led by the Department of the Taoiseach, in response to the outcome of the referendum.  This facilitates the framework for my Department&rsquo;s interaction with other Departments in this regard.</p>  <p>  The North-South unit of my Department, which co-funds and provides strategic oversight for InterTrade Ireland, the North-South enterprise development body, is actively working with that body to ensure that it will review and adjust its supports if necessary as new trading rules and regulations emerge.  I have met with representatives of InterTrade Ireland.</p>  <p>  The management board of my Department, chaired by the Secretary General, meets weekly and co-ordinates the Department's own response across all its divisions to the referendum outcome.  As I have previously indicated, a team of senior officials from my Department visited London on 1 July to discuss Single Market and trade issues in light of the referendum outcome.</p></speech>

I welcome the concentration of resources and effort on this matter.  However, I must flag the necessity for collaboration and co-operation within various Departments on this matter.  The Brexit decision has many facets, including the North-South and east-west dimensions, as well as international relations and the EU negotiations themselves.  The particular focus of my question, however, is on the risk to jobs and industry, as well as other economic factors which come within the remit of the Minister's Department.</p>  <p>  Brexit is here and it is real, so we will have to deal with the consequences.  It is worth recalling some of the figures involved.  Some 400,000 jobs depend on trade between Ireland and the UK.  For small Irish businesses seeking to expand, the UK is usually the first target market, as it is for 43% of our exports.  The UK is our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner.  The consequences of Brexit, while worrying, must be dealt with now that they are here.</p>  <p>  I agree with ISME's call for a dedicated unit within the Department to co-ordinate activities related to the challenges and opportunities arising from the Brexit decision.  Many other bodies have also called for a co-ordination of such activities.  </p>  <p>  I was concerned by a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins-----</p></speech>

While there are many factors involved, the most significant is the impact of large multinational retail chains on small business.</p>  <p>  Has the Government considered the introduction of a progressive rates system which essentially gives a break to small and medium enterprise and gives them a leg up in terms of the competition they face from large multinational companies?  This is commonplace in places like France, Scotland and elsewhere.</p></reply>

A key priority of this Government is to improve the living and working environment of local communities and to increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.</p>  <p>  My Department provides many supports to assist small businesses to start and grow.  The 31 local enterprise offices offer financial and soft supports in the form of training and mentoring to small and microenterprises across the country. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the eight regional action plans will greatly benefit local economies, facilitating the development of local businesses and thus encouraging occupancy in work space and commercial properties in towns across the country.</p>  <p>  Through the work of the retail consultation forum, which I chair, I support the work of the town centre revival working group.  This group, the membership of which includes retail representative bodies and public sector bodies, is working towards the preparation of a framework for town centre revival.  The framework will encourage collaboration between key stakeholders to implement initiatives to create and support vibrant town centres. </p>  <p>  However, responsibility for planning rests with my colleague, the Minister for housing, planning and local government.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has responsibility for the retail planning guidelines which duly recognise that vibrant and viable town centres are the lifeblood of the local community and local economy.  The guidelines set out the key policy objectives which should guide planning authorities in addressing retail development within their development planning role.</p>  <p>  I come from a small village in County Galway where many of the shops that had been there for up to 70 years are now closed.</p></reply>

My own personal view is that that only tinkered around the edges of the issue.</p>  <p>  I refer the Minister to the preliminary census figures released in the last number of days.  One of the most striking statistics is that there are almost 200,000 vacant dwelling units around the country.  In Limerick, there are 8,500 vacant dwelling units, many of which are accommodation units above shops in our towns and villages.  The core has been hollowed out of our small towns and villages consistently over the last number of years.  What I am trying to impress on the Minister is the need for a bigger plan such that we are not just tinkering around with the commercial rates issue.</p></speech>

I am glad there are so many Limerick Deputies in the Chamber today.</p>  <p> Given the proliferation of large multinational retail chains, we are working on a town centre revival framework, including an action plan for the town centre revival.  The action plan for towns is tasked with establishing town teams to carry out health checks, prepare town strategies and to identify and signpost supports that retailers can avail of.  The primary concern of this group is to assist struggling towns by increasing footfall and the vibrancy of the town centres.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I cannot support either retail or the local authorities directly.</p><p>However, I am working with the Minister for regional development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht to ensure the work of this group is aligned with the aims of her Department's town and village regeneration fund.  I will also be working with the Minister for housing, planning and local government in terms of his responsibility for overseeing the local authorities to communicate the recommendations of this working group and to ensure that the work of the group is complementary.</p></speech>

I am asking for a change in the way we administer rates.  In Scotland, rates were changed to give preferential rates to smaller businesses.  A total of 60% or 70% of small businesses benefitted and got reduced rates as a result and it has helped reinvigorate small towns.  This is a fairly standard policy in France, which is why its town and village centres sustain themselves far better than many of our town and village centres.  I suggest that as part of this framework for supporting small and medium enterprises in towns, the Minister must think about a new rates system that distinguishes between a bank that might have the same square meterage but has massive profitability and turnover and a small flower shop or shoe shop.  The Minister gets my point.</p></speech>

In our county, the vacant commercial premises incentive scheme involves the council refunding rates for businesses in premises that have been vacant for over six months.  It gives 75% for the first year, 50% for the second year and 25% for the third year.  Business priming funding is available for micro-enterprise within the first 18 months of the start up.  There are businesses other than shops in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or any other town.  They include financial businesses.

Significant progress has been made in the Dublin region.  Since the national action plan for jobs was launched in 2012, more than 70,000 additional people are back at work in Dublin.  This compares with job losses of 90,000 in the period from 2008 to 2011.</p><p>The process of rebuilding the capacity of all the regions was started with the roll out of eight regional action plans for jobs during the past year.  The action plan for the Dublin region was launched last January.  The plan aims to increase employment in the Dublin region by between 10% and 15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 66,000 additional jobs to the region in that period.  Key sectors targeted as part of the plan include areas like technology, financial services, life sciences, manufacturing, tourism, retail, &quot;smart cities&quot; and the creative industries.</p><p>The plan will be monitored and driven by an implementation committee comprising representatives from the enterprise sector, the local authorities, enterprise agencies and other public bodies in the region.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in the plan's development and will be central to its delivery.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>By supporting SMEs, continuing to attract foreign direct investment and providing assistance to start-ups to grow and develop, we will see our recovery take hold which will result in improved standards of living for the people of Dublin.</p></speech>

As he is aware, we are talking about a region with a population of 150,000 or so.  The Minister of State will appreciate that the unemployment figures I read out are very high.  Could he look at some of our more traditional industries?  The Cadbury Mondelez plant in Coolock was threatened with a series of job losses.  I raised this issue on numerous occasions with the former Minister in the previous D&aacute;il.  The last update I received from the Department about the plant was in March 2016.  I was told that Enterprise Ireland was in contact with the company.  What has happened on foot of that?  Cadbury's was taken over firstly by Kraft and then by Mondelez, which is a Brazilian company.  What is happening in this case of this plant?</p>  <p>  There are many logistics and transport companies in Dublin Bay North.  I heard the Minister say earlier that she is taking particular steps concerning Brexit.  Has the area of logistics and transport been looked at given that we will be dealing with a different regime?

The implementation committee is a collaboration between enterprise and public service groups and is led by Caroline Keeling, chief executive of Keelings, with Ronan Harris from Google is vice chairman.  The Deputy is very well-known in the area.  There is no point in me dishing out ten pages of statistics relating to the particular area.  If the Deputy feels there are groupings of people the Department should meet to see how the region is affected, there is no problem with him bringing in interested bodies to meet the Department in August or September.

Although they are at an early stage, it is clear that the proposal raises a number of practical, legal and technical issues.  These will need to be addressed over the coming months.  Until we know the scope and content of any final EU measure, it is too soon to consider national measures on this type of public reporting.  However, Ireland is already to the fore in introducing similar reporting obligations for large multinational companies.  Under the Finance Act 2015, certain Irish-resident parent companies and subsidiaries of non-Irish companies must file a country-by-country report on tax with the Revenue Commissioners each year.  The first of these reports are due to be submitted to the Revenue by the end of next year.

Already, even before that, our contribution to the EU is grossly inflated and distorted because it is, in proportion to population, double that of countries such as Portugal and others due to the tax avoidance strategies of multinationals based in this country.  It is in our interests to have public country-by-country reporting of the big multinational companies to stop them engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.  Yet, incredibly, when offered the opportunity to do that by the European Union, we used the spurious excuse of subsidiarity to reject that proposal.  What the Minister seems to be saying is that we cannot do it on our own.  I agree with that, but why the hell did we not sign up to a pan-European proposal to do it, instead saying that we could not sign up to it because it infringes our sovereignty?  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

We cannot do it on our own.  If we were to publish the figures the Deputy is referring to, it would allow some companies to gain a possible commercial advantage over others because matters would be deemed to be commercially sensitive.  Other jurisdictions might not share the information with us if they knew we were going to publish the reports.  It would not help the tax transparency agenda and a system of country-by-country reporting.  I cannot do it.</p></speech>

We cannot leave it pushed out to 2022.  It is three years this month since the courts ruled on the bypass and the way was cleared for the land purchase to begin.  In the meantime the land purchase has been moving along slowly, little by little.  At this stage, three years on, it is a bit over halfway.  Late last year there was great fanfare when Government Deputies were telling us we were on the new programme and were promising us everything was going to go ahead and was hunky-dory.  However, there was no start date, which was of great concern for locals.  Earlier this year it was very worrying for locals when the moneys allocated for the land purchase were reduced from &euro;5 million to &euro;3.8 million.  To date, much of that allocation has already been spent.  Up to this morning, &euro;3.426 million of this year's allocation had been consumed and we are only as far as July.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland really let the cat out of the bag in recent weeks when it met with Cork County Council.  It said, "It is TII's intention to appoint a contractor for Dunkettle in 2018, as it is their top priority project, with a view to commencing in 2019/2020 while the N22 and N28 will be post 2021".  That means it is not on the current programme but post-2021, which is the next programme.  That is a serious setback for locals, who are keen to be unburdened of traffic by having the Macroom bypass built.  It causes serious distress for people.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to prioritise the Macroom bypass.  Various Ministers have moved it through the different stages, and I ask the Minister to release it to tender for construction and raise it at Cabinet level, and possibly, if he has an opportunity-----</p></speech>

It is something I have raised here on numerous occasions over the last five and a half years.  I did so with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, on a number of occasions on Topical Issues and during Question Time.  It was really good news to learn last year that the N22 was being put on the capital plan for 2016 to 2021.  It was very positive.  Various dates are being thrown about now for the start of this vital socioeconomic project for the entire south-west region.  A date of 2022 was given to Cork councillors by TII; a date of 2020 was given to the chief executive of Kerry County Council by TII; and, at the most recent meeting of the transport committee, the Department indicated a date of post 2018-2019.  Can the Minister give us an indication of what the date will be and if this matter will be prioritised?  Logistically, from an engineering point of view, the N22 is a far more straightforward project than the Dunkettle project, which was referred to, or the Ringaskiddy road.  There is no reason this road cannot go ahead in the very near future.  There is no reason it cannot be started by the end of 2017.  It is nearly shovel-ready.  The need is well proven.  From a socioeconomic point of view it would be a massive boost to the entire region.  Figures I obtained last year from the NRA showed that there had been 41 fatalities since 1990 on this stretch of road, so the reasons are compelling.  We need the Minister to ensure this is a priority project.  When the capital plan was announced I went to the people of Kerry in good faith to tell them this road was on the capital plan, and my objective is to get it built as soon as possible.  The Minister could help us with this and make sure it is a priority project.  That is why I am raising it here today.</p></speech>

I am very aware that Deputy Griffin raised this consistently in the last D&aacute;il.  It is a legitimate running sore for those who represent the area, and I will try to address the problem as adequately as possible in the time that is left.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding of the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  The Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme involves the construction of 22 km of new carriageway from just east of Macroom to west of Ballyvourney, including a bypass of Macroom town.</p><p>Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  There have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past number of years because of the national financial position.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes.</p> <p> The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  I understand that the transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's strategic investment framework for land transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure, together with targeted investments, to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.</p> <p> The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.  Given the funding limits, the decision made by my predecessor was to provide for a mix of projects across the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity.</p> <p> While it will not be possible to address all the demands for improvement schemes over the capital plan period, the plan provides for a number of important projects in the Cork area which are scheduled to commence construction within the plan period, including the upgrade of the Dunkettle roundabout and the N22 road between Ballyvourney and Macroom.  In addition, the plan also provides that the N28 upgrade scheme will also commence subject to necessary approvals.</p> <p> The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual build up in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  Funding will continue to be tight in 2017, with a step up in 2018 and 2019 and then a significant ramp up from 2020.  As Minister, I must work within the capital budgets included in the plan and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in planning the construction schedule for individual projects, must also take account of the annual budgets available.</p> <p> As regards the Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, the scheme has full statutory approval and land acquisition is under way.  Construction on this scheme is due to start in 2020.</p> <p> As I have indicated previously, we all are conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the government system, including capital investment needs.  As part of a programme for partnership Government, there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services but the Government still must operate within the EU fiscal rules and this does constrain options.  There will be a mid-term review of the capital plan and this will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment depending on economic growth.</p></speech>

There are various dates floating around on it.  Cork County Council has been given a date of 2021 or later for the construction of it.  TII and Cork County Council, the bodies at the coalface dealing with this on a daily basis, are saying it will be post-2021.  Will the Minister sit down with representatives of TII to clarify, and impress on them, that it is a priority for TII that the Macroom bypass is started immediately?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister release the bypass to tender for construction because we cannot afford to have it waiting much longer than it is?  As outlined earlier, it is a dangerous road on which there have been far too many fatalities.  Since the compulsory purchase order, CPO, was made by the Minister more than three years ago, the number of people killed on that road would fill the entire front bench where the Minister is sitting.  While I have been a public representative, and in my own area alone, the number of people killed on that road would fill that front bench, the one behind the Minister and the one behind that.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister release this road to tender for construction without delay?  Even 2020, if one goes by that date, is still a number of years away and one is looking at further danger and further fatalities.</p></speech>

As a Deputy for the county of Kerry and working with my colleague across the border in Cork, I am pleading with the Minister to do what he can to prioritise this project, which is badly needed.  What it has going for it is that it is almost shovel-ready.  There is no reason this should be delayed any further.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the clarification of a possible 2020 date as distinct from the 2022 date that was bandied around earlier, and with some point-scoring from certain quarters earlier in the week and last week, it is still too far away.  It is four years away and there is no reason we should have to wait four years for this.  There is no reason this cannot start in 2017.  Where there is a will, there is a way.</p>  <p>  Primarily, my fear is lives will be lost but the significant socioeconomic boost that this will give the region cannot be overlooked.  What this will do for the south-west region is that it will open up a whole world of possibilities on both the Cork and Kerry sides.  I urge the Minister to go back to TII and ask its representatives to find a way to move this forward.</p></speech>

They must understand funds are short.  There is clearance for many roads but there is no funding for them.  This is, of course, a priority.</p>  <p>  The confusion is difficult to understand but the Deputies have heard all I have to say about that.  I am meeting representatives of the TII in the next two weeks.  I will ensure when I meet them that this is on the agenda, not only whether there is any need or compelling reason to hasten this up or whether there are any funds for that - I doubt if there is - but to sort out the mix-up in the dates, which is a legitimate point made by both Deputies.  When I have discussed it with them at my meeting, which is definitely in early August, I will communicate with the Deputies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-20a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016072000032#FF00700"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topical issue.   On 26 April 2016, a press release appeared on the Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, website announcing that it intended to cease its operation in fish farms.  This was issued at a time of significant political uncertainty and paralysis and in the backdrop of a caretaker Government.</p>  <p>  At that time, I consulted the then Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, in regard to this and he advised me that he communicated with the chairperson of the board of IFI that no further action was to take place until there was broad consultation with all the stakeholders and, importantly, with his Department.  However, on 5 July 2016, a notice of public consultation appeared on the IFI website explicitly stating that IFI will exit fish farm operations.  This is not meaningful consultation.  Indeed, it is an insult to the stakeholders, the people and, indeed, the Department involved in this area.</p>  <p>  People might be aware that in 2015, a report was commissioned by Canadian Aquaculture Systems, Inc. which found that there was no explicit reason for IFI to cease its operation in fish farms.  Indeed, it found that the operations were comparable to those of the private sector.  When one considers how dated the plant is in Roscrea, it was a significant achievement.  The report also explicitly stated that in the past, IFI issued a public tender for the supply of rainbow trout for put-and-take fisheries and there were no responses or bids to the tender.  This clearly states that there is no alternative to the current operation and, therefore, a view being advanced that we should look to the private sector to fill in the void does not hold water.</p>  <p>  The CEO of IFI normally states there are opportunity costs.  I would put to him clearly the opportunity cost of the assessment in the unique position held by IFI in having minimal access to large volumes of high-quality water.  Water supplies are available at the fisheries at little or no cost, relying on longstanding arrangements.  If these arrangements are terminated, these will almost certainly not be repeated in any sector.  A conservative estimate of the volume of water used by the three fisheries amounts to 25,000 cu. cm per day which would cost in excess of &euro;35,000 per day.  What is the opportunity cost of that?</p><p>A socio-economic study into recreational angling indicates that angling is responsible for &euro;750 million in revenue per annum and in excess of 10,000 jobs so what is the opportunity cost of compromising that sector?</p> <p> I want to be very clear about this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has been exceptional.  He came to Mullingar yesterday evening and attended a public meeting with all the anglers' associations and concerned representatives.  We took a tour of the fish farm in Cullion and we could see clearly its self-sufficiency.  There have been workers there for generations who have brought together a strong strain of trout that they have spent 40 or 50 years breeding.  Why should we compromise this to import fish from outside Ireland that could bring germs or diseases?  There are no pumps at Cullion as the water is brought in from Lough Owel, going to Lough Ennell through the Brosna.  It is operated with natural gravity.  We must stand up and be counted on this issue, making it very clear to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, that this will be done at its peril.  It is a key industry that must be protected.</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is the State agency responsible for the protection, management and conservation of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  IFI was formed on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency.  Ireland has over 74,000 km of rivers and streams and 128,000 ha of lakes, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of IFI.  It has a long history of providing rainbow and brown trout to support the fish stocking requirements of Ireland's trout angling stakeholders.  IFI's main fish production unit is located at the IFI fish farm near Roscrea, with a supporting facility, which mainly supports the maintenance of broodstock, located at Cullion in Mullingar.  There is also a small operation at Lough Allua.</p><p>The proposal around rationalising the fish farm operations of IFI is a day-to-day operational matter for the board of IFI, although I acknowledge the major impact on the local economy across the country but particularly in the midlands.  It should have been taken into account by the board of the IFI.  IFl advises that from a structural perspective, the fish farming operation is based on physical structures and facilities designed and built in the late 1950s and since then and has been meeting the increasing demands of operational and regulatory requirements from facilities that are dated.  In that context, I accompanied Deputy Burke and Councillor Andrew Duncan on a visit to IFI's Cullion broodstock and hatchery facility in Mullingar yesterday evening to review at first hand the existing facilities, where we were briefed by a member of IFI's senior management team and the operator of the farms.</p><p>I am advised by the board of IFI that it is IFI's intention to exit fish farming operations over the coming years at current locations, with the agency maintaining one aquaculture facility at Cong, County Mayo, which will be used for research and conservation stocking.  This site has been identified as having the most potential due to the quality and quantity of its water supply, which is an important consideration for fish production.  Ultimately, the IFI hatchery at Cong is expected to be upgraded to a facility capable of housing modern hatchery and research operations.  IFl also advises that it was always intended that the phase-out plan will include consultation with affected stakeholders.  The former Minister of State had written to the chair of IFI noting IFI's intention to consult with affected parties prior to any action and that a report of the consultation would be made to the Department.  I recently met the board of IFI to reinforce the requirement that a full report be made to the Department before any action is taken.  However, I regret the lack of consultation and the wording of the consultation when it was advertised.  It was seen as a sort of <i>fait accompli</i>rather than a full public consultation to assess the future of the very valuable resource at Cullion and Roscrea.</p><p>IFl has written to affected stakeholders, advising them that the farms are operating as normal for 2016.  It is important to clarify that the decisions of the board were not prescriptive regarding a timeline or a particular option as to how IFI might exit commercial production.  In consultation with the chairman of the board of IFI and on the advice of the chief executive officer, I have decided to extend the deadline for the consultation to 19 September.  I ask all interested parties to participate in the consultation.  I will shortly meet the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer when he returns from a break to discuss the issue further.  I understand the grave concern about the decision made by the board in the interregnum between the election and the formation of the Government.  I know there is deep unease and unhappiness about this but I intend to consult fully with the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer to see if we can resolve the issue.</p></speech>

The Twenty-six Counties of Ireland benefit from the stocks in these farms, so it is a vital resource in Ireland.  If we appoint an independent company to commission a report into the sector but do not heed its advice, what is the point in having that process?  The company was clear that there is no alternative in the private sector, so there will be a compromise on that front.  The water values being brought to the farm may not be achieved in future.  We have heard much about how the fish farms are loss-making but let us do an audit on the figures.  I am surprised as staff will be redeployed and I understand staff are included in the figures cited.  There may be national and scientific costs that should also be included and that must be examined closely.</p>  <p>  I understand a former Deputy's book has a chapter on the rod war and the difficulties of the time.  This has the capacity to escalate to that level if it is not dealt with urgently because this is a natural resource.  As Councillor Andrew Duncan articulated so well at the meeting last night, we are highly dependent on the quality of our lakes with regard to the revenue brought in through tourism.  Do we want to throw that away?  We are trying to throw away 50 years of work in generating resilient breeds of trout to put into those lakes.  Anglers come to our lakes because of the experience and the quantity and quality of fish in those lakes.  They will not come if we back away from the industry.  We must be very clear.</p>  <p>  It is reprehensible for a chief executive officer or board to take a decision as drastic as this when a Government is being formed.  The disrespect shown to the Government is also reprehensible and we should stand up to it.  We must take urgent action.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</p></speech>

They represented the fishing rivers in Dublin, Louth, Mayo, Galway and other places.  Although the facilities in Cullion and Roscrea are doing a job, there have been decades of under-investment.  I have seen the facility at Cullion but I have not been to the Roscrea facility.  The Cullion facility is functioning, as I noted at the meeting, but it is antiquated and needs investment, particularly in the existing buildings.</p><p>I raised the issue of public consultation but when I met the board on 30 June, I was not informed by anybody - either the chief executive officer or any member of the board - that a week later the public consultation would be advertised as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Deputy is correct in that there are 50 years of research and breeding in the facilities.  I advocated to the board and chief executive officer that before any decision should have been considered regarding any cessation, there should have been a plan to ensure the valuable fish stock and resources being put into the rivers locally would be replaced with an alternative.  There is none, as far as I can see.  There is talk of private operators but there is no clear alternative in place.  Once the chief executive officer is back from the break I will sit down with him and the chairman to push the issue of planning further.  There is widespread disquiet and I have extended the period of consultation to 19 September.  I hope to use that period to consult further about the future.  I recognise the Deputy and thank him for the invitation to yesterday's meeting and to visit the facilities in Cullion.</p></speech>

At the time, the president of PayPal, Mr. David Marcus, described the company's relationship with Ireland as an everlasting honeymoon and the Dundalk facility as being the heart of eBay.  I hope the Minister will today confirm that this still is so and that it wishes to remain there.  The company had plans to grow to 450 staff in Dundalk at the time.  We are all aware of the division of eBay and PayPal.  We are appreciative of the value that this leading company, PayPal, has been to Dundalk and the surrounding districts of Drogheda, Newry and Dublin.  I am advised that the company wishes to utilise the space currently being occupied by the eBay side of the business and, hopefully, this will result in additional employment at PayPal.</p> <p> I believe that eBay has viewed properties in the area that are suitable for its operation and I have confirmation of that from leading auctioneers.  There is a strong belief in the area that, although such accommodation is available in the Dundalk and Drogheda area, eBay has been induced by State institutions, with no doubt a little political coaxing, to consider places such as Sligo and Castlebar as options, and perhaps I should throw Athlone into the mix also.  Regrettably, I cannot seem to get confirmation to the contrary from any company or State body to confirm or deny this rumour.  Nor can I get such confirmation from some of my colleagues in this House who may well be better informed than other Deputies at this stage.  A constituency colleague in the Government from my local town has caused alarm by admitting to the media that he has known about this for more than eight weeks, as has the Minister.  Will the Minister assure this House that IDA Ireland and its senior management have not used a range of methods such as grants, employment incentives, credits and discounts to move eBay from its present location to another area of the country?</p></speech>

There are a lot of rumours about the future of eBay, which employs 200 people, and its revenue.  It shares a site at the Xerox Technology Park with PayPal, although it parted company with it two years ago.  It is a highly successful business and its revenue is expected to be in the region of $2.2 billion.  In February 2013, eBay announced it was creating 450 jobs in Dundalk with the establishment of its new European operations centre.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of speculation about the future intentions of eBay.  These could be entirely without foundation, but it has been suggested that because of the separation of PayPal and eBay the latter now needs its own site.  Workers, local businesses and families are understandably worried about the uncertainty.  Will the Minister clarify the situation, end this damaging speculation and give firm assurances that these jobs and projects, which have benefited people not just in Dundalk but right across the Border up into County Down, will stay there and that the Minister and IDA Ireland are focused on ensuring that this is the case?</p></speech>

I also thank Deputies Fergus O'Dowd and Peter Fitzpatrick, who have raised it with me also.  As they will know from my statement in the D&aacute;il yesterday in response to Deputies Martin and Adams, I have been in touch with the CEO of IDA Ireland to discuss the concerns of both the employees and other stakeholders in the Dundalk area.</p>  <p>  In September 2014 it was announced that eBay and PayPal would split into two entities by 2015.  The official split happened on 17 July 2015 and both companies began trading as separate entities on 20 July.  I understand that the two entities wish to operate from separate premises and, to facilitate this, IDA Ireland is working with eBay to find a suitable premises.  My concern is to ensure that eBay stays in Ireland and, therefore, I have asked IDA Ireland to work with the company to facilitate it in any way possible in finding a suitable premises in which its operation can continue here.  However, the final decision lies with the company alone.</p>  <p>  As part of my remit in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am responsible for driving regional development.  I wish to ensure that we have a good spread of jobs countrywide and away from the greater Dublin area.  Dundalk has done very well in recent years in attracting foreign direct investment, and that is a testament to all the hard work done in making Dundalk an attractive place to do business.  In fact, County Louth stands out among the Border counties for its successes in job creation, with 21 IDA Ireland companies supporting 3,245 jobs.  This has been a real success story for IDA Ireland.  As a further example of this progress, in June 2014 PayPal announced that it would add two new strategic functions, with the employment of an additional 400 people at the Dundalk site to support business growth in North America and global credit functions support in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The addition of these 400 new jobs will bring total employment at PayPal in Dundalk to 1,400 by 2017.  Recruitment for these new positions has already started.</p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, my focus has been on driving forward the regional action plans.  The north east north west action plan, which includes County Louth, was launched last November and aims to increase employment in the region by 10% to 15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 28,000 additional jobs.  Other key targets of the action plan include increasing the number of start-ups by at least 25% through targeted initiatives and programmes to support enterprise, and increasing the number of IDA Ireland investments by between 30% and 40% to 2019.  While these are ambitious targets, they are also achievable and well thought out.  The agencies under my remit will continue to strive to facilitate the needs of both multinationals and indigenous companies to maintain existing jobs and increase the number of new ones while also ensuring a good spread of employment throughout the regions.</p></speech>

I also recognise eBay's right to make its own decision.  I put it that the reason the region has been doing so well is a result of the work of the local authority, the Louth Economic Forum, the Chamber of Commerce and the presence of Dundalk Institute of Technology in the region.  However, the Minister has not answered my question.  I put it to her categorically that I want an assurance that neither IDA Ireland nor its management is using a range of methods to attract investment to various regions that are contrary to what should be happening in the development of industry in Ireland - namely, inducements to people from outside these regions.  All I am looking for is a fair playing field and for eBay to recognise, as it did from the start, that Dundalk is at the heart of its operations and decide, given the workforce in Dundalk and the development that has taken place, not to move on.  We all recognise that PayPal will expand and that is great.  The bottom line for most of the Oireachtas Members and the people of the region is that we want to retain eBay and expand PayPal.  Everyone benefits from that regional approach.</p></speech>

I do not think that is an issue.  There is no question of its moving.</p><p>Dundalk is an area of considerable disadvantage but it has a very innovative and skilled workforce and lots of local leaders from the Institute of Technology, the economic forum, the local chambers and Louth County Council.  It lies on the main corridor between Belfast and Dublin and is close to the airports and is in the Border region.  There are other sites close to or in Dundalk and, while the Minister says it is up to the company to take its own decision, it can be influenced, as it was in the first instance to locate in Dundalk.  I ask the Minister to look at the particular needs of this area and the success of this project and to give an assurance that she will do her utmost to ensure it stays where it is at the moment, or at least in the general Dundalk area.</p></speech>

He will come out towards Tallaght and Kiltipper on the right.  Following the river to his left he will see the Glenasmole valley going past Bohernabreena where a lot of the water we drink comes from.  He will then get into the valley, which is one of the most spectacular places in this country and matches anything in County Mayo, such as Croagh Patrick, in its beauty.  It is a stunning wilderness and there is nothing there - not a shed and hardly a fence.  It is a wildlife reserve to match any other.  If one walks up to the source of the Dodder, which is hard to find on account of there being so many pools and tributaries, one will arrive at the top under Kippure mountain which is spectacular and looks out over Dublin.  It is a huge wide valley with huge history, lore and heritage.  No other capital city in Europe, or maybe the world, has what we have, which is the sea and the mountains, and this is an integral part of the mountains.  The valley sits surrounded by 200,000 hectares of the Wicklow National Park which is a patchwork of areas including Lough Bray and Glencree.  It is up for sale at the moment but we cannot let it go for sale and have to keep it in State ownership to be added to the Wicklow National Park, which it would grow by some 10%, providing an amazing facility for the people of this city and the whole country.</p>  <p>  What contact has the Department had with NAMA on the subject of this land?  The land came into the ownership of the State through a developer who was involved in the Dundrum town shopping centre and was not able to hold onto it.  NAMA has put it up for sale with an auctioneer but we have to make sure it is not sold.  It is of no development potential.  Some 93% of the land is in the Wicklow SAC and one can do nothing with it, such as put up a wind farm or buildings.  It is under freehold at the moment and we should get back control of it to use it as part of the Wicklow National Park. </p>  <p>  There is only one difficulty, which is that it is in Dublin.  If we can see beyond borders it could also be part of a Dublin mountain uplands park, as proposed by South Dublin County Council.  Last week the council announced this as the centrepiece of its tourism strategy, suggesting it could bring in some &euro;26 million and create 2,500 jobs.  The Dublin mountain partnership, which I was involved in setting up, has been an amazing achievement in the past ten years.  People walk, cycle and engage in all types of activities in the Dublin mountains and these 5,000 acres would be an incredible facility.  I ask the Minister to make sure the National Parks and Wildlife Service intervenes and recognises that this has huge value to the State.  NAMA cannot sell it as a social requirement was stitched into the legislation.</p>  <p>  I am keen to hear what the National Parks and Wildlife Service thinks of this resource and what mechanisms we can find, at this late stage, to make sure it is not sold but kept for the people of this country to whom it belongs.</p></speech>

Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the role of NAMA.</p>  <p>  I can, however, provide some background to the role of my Department regarding the land surrounding Glenasmole, which I understand incorporates much of the land known as the "Featherbeds".  The land in question encompasses some 4,900 acres, as outlined in the advertisement issued by the firm handling the sale of the land.  The majority of this land lies within a special area of conservation and a special protection area and for that reason is a very important site for nature conservation.  The land also adjoins the Wicklow Mountains National Park, Ireland's largest national park.</p>  <p>  In February 2014, the predecessor of the current Minister for arts, heritage, regional, rural and Gaeltacht affairs met with officials from Mountaineering Ireland, at which the question of lands near Wicklow Mountains National Park held by NAMA was discussed.  After this meeting, officials from the Department approached NAMA to discuss those lands, with a meeting held in April 2014.  On foot of the meeting, in early May 2014 the Department expressed an interest in acquiring the lands in question.  NAMA responded by indicating that the board of NAMA had recommended that NAMA engage, where feasible, with other State bodies, where that body has expressed an interest in acquiring a property for a purpose specifically linked to its statutory functions.</p>  <p>  Between May 2014 and September 2015 there was intermittent contact between officials from the Department and NAMA.  Discussions in August and September 2015 related to the valuation of the land in question.  In June 2016, I understand there were media reports regarding the proposed sale by NAMA of the lands in question.  I also understand a separate commercial property management firm is handling the sale and has advertised the property for sale by private treaty.  Given its closeness to Wicklow Mountains National Park and given its importance for nature conservation as an SAC and SPA, the land in question would be very important to the national park.  However, given the scarce resources available for capital investment in our national parks and nature reserves, I am mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the parks and reserves.  For that reason, the Department could only consider acquiring this property if the price fell within a certain range.</p></speech>

If officials and NAMA have been involved in talks and been haggling over price, which I presume is what the Minister of State said, how have we let it be publicly put up for sale?  Media reports suggest it has an asking price of some &euro;2.5 million but the problem is that, when it is opened up to other bidders, it will be difficult for the State to get the price right between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and NAMA, though I hope there will not be any difficulty in this regard.  The Minister's response confirms that we are all agreed on the fact that this makes absolute sense.  A national park beside the existing national park would increase the park by 10% and is a perfect fit for what we already have.  It would add huge value to the State.  How does the Minister of State propose entering into talks with the Minister for Finance and NAMA to stop this and not allow private people to come in?</p><p>If the price reported in the newspapers is correct, it is only about &euro;500 an acre.  I believe the Minister has done some work in auctioneering and he will know that is not a high price.  In terms of some of the benefits that would accrue, this site is located beside a huge population and is used frequently for recreational purposes.  The health benefits alone of encouraging people to walk there and enjoying the natural benefits of it would mean we would get a very quick return on that price.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to intervene directly in this matter.  I know there are sensitivities around NAMA in terms of how he can approach it and so on, but this is a perfect example in that there is no possible commercial development.  It makes sense for us to get hold of it, finish this quickly so we can stop a private bidder coming in and increasing the price to &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million.  If that happens, we will have real difficulty in getting it back to the State.  How does the Minister of State think he might do it?</p></speech>

In the NAMA Bill politicians were exempt, and rightly so, from interfering with or talking to NAMA.  However, the Minister for Finance can do that, and I will tell him the Deputy's concerns about this issue.</p>  <p>  I want to put on the public record that I agree with the Deputy but I worry about NAMA's valuations with regard to this particular piece of land.  The Deputy is correct.  With the special areas of conservation, SACs, and the habitats directive it will not be used for development; there will be major restrictions in that regard.</p>  <p>  My budget this year for the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service is &euro;2.5 million so I do not have the resources.  I will have to talk to the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with another situation where it is in the public interest, and I repeat that I worry about the valuations NAMA is putting on these properties.  I cannot interfere, and I cannot make that point to NAMA, but I can make it in the D&aacute;il.  This is in the public interest.  I would like to see this property being acquired by the State but with the price I am told NAMA is looking for it is not commercially viable.  I will ask the Minister for Finance to intervene with NAMA.  I cannot personally do that.  I will ask my officials again to talk with NAMA, the Minister for Finance and officials in the Department of Finance to see what can be done because what the Deputy stated is correct.</p>  <p>  I will travel to Wicklow National Park next week where I will have an opportunity to examine the area.  I have visited it in the past.  It is a beautiful area and I would love to see this land being bought by the State.  I cannot intervene but I will ask my officials to talk to the Minister for Finance.  I will ask the Minister for Finance what we can be done with this land.</p></speech>
