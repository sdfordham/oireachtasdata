    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100003#A00500"><p>Wide-ranging reforms to the budgetary architecture have been implemented by this Government with a view to supporting the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for our people.  The medium-term expenditure framework and periodic comprehensive reviews of expenditure have provided the opportunity to move discussions about expenditure decisions away from consideration of short-term issues to a broader strategic debate about key challenges facing public expenditure and public services.</p><p><font color="#181818">  The reforms introduced at national level operate within the broader context of the EU level reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP.  For 2015, with Ireland in the corrective arm of the SGP, the key budgetary fiscal target is to bring the general Government deficit below 3% of GDP as required under the excessive deficit procedure.  As outlined in the spring economic statement, Ireland is on track to exit the corrective arm at the end of 2015 with a general Government deficit of 2.3%.  This is well below the 2.9% that we set as our target.  Thereafter, Ireland will become subject to the preventive arm of the SGP with budget 2016 being framed within that context.  The new fiscal rules under the preventive arm will serve as a tool to help us responsibly manage our recovery.  With future increases in public expenditure linked to potential economic growth, all areas of current and capital expenditure need to be managed to ensure that public expenditure is sustainable and delivers the maximum benefit.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  Ireland's entry into the preventive arm of the SGP in 2016 afforded the opportunity for the spring economic statement to set out the parameters of next year's budget.  Fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion is available for budget 2016, with this amount split evenly between expenditure and tax measures.  In this context, the material published at budget time will reflect an estimated expenditure outturn for this year, taking account of any additional expenditure planned for the year.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.</p><p>I just want to ask one or two specific questions.  We understand what the Minister is saying about the move from the corrective arm to the preventive arm.  With regard to the target, we are expected to be at 2.3% this year.  The Minister did not tell us what level of reduction will be required for 2016.  I think we have to make a reduction of the order of 0.6%.  The Minister mentioned that the increase in public expenditure will be linked to the potential growth in the economy.  I do not think that is the full picture.  I suggest it would be more accurate to say that expenditure will be linked to the average potential growth in the economy over a ten-year horizon.  This ten-year horizon was mentioned in replies to previous parliamentary questions, but the Minister studiously avoided any reference to it in the reply to this question.  Was that an oversight or has there been a change in policy?  Is the Minister trying to unlink himself from the previous ten-year horizon?  I think people would be concerned if there was a move away from it.  The Minister might tell us whether the costs of the Lansdowne Road agreement will be included in those figures.</p></speech>

The two measures that will underpin whether we meet the rules - the judgment criteria - next year are the expenditure benchmark and the annual structured adjustment.  Under the expenditure benchmark, public expenditure can only grow at rates determined by the potential growth of the economy, less a convergence margin if the member state is not at its medium-term objective.  We have set our medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget and we expect to reach it by about 2018.  In the interim, we have to make progress towards that at a rate greater than 0.5% of GDP.  The ten-year horizon referred to by the Deputy has been renegotiated.  It is now a three-year horizon, which suits Ireland better.  Obviously, we did not want to be trapped within a horizon that covered the depression years.  A horizon of growth potential for the economy that looks at what happened last year and this year will be much more favourable to us in terms of giving us fiscal space.</p></speech>

This change has fundamental implications for the forthcoming budget because a ten-year horizon would cover many years in which negative growth figures were recorded.</p></speech>

This percentage increase based on a three-year horizon is phenomenal.  One would hope that the Government does not intend to use that short-term figure excessively to increase expenditure at an enormous rate and thereby add fuel to an economy that is growing.  The Minister might tell us when this change was completed.  Can he give some indication of the percentage increase in expenditure that the Government will facilitate in the budget that is to be announced in this House less than two weeks from now?</p></speech>

A three-year horizon was negotiated by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, at ECOFIN and agreed there.  I will have to check the exact date for the Deputy.  We set out the space we will have for next year in the spring economic statement and we are sticking to that.  The space will be of the order of &euro;1.5 billion, which is at the upper end of what we set out in April.  The adjustment will be divided equally between expenditure and taxation.  Expenditure over the outturn figure for 2015 will be of the order of &euro;750 million.</p></speech>

I will try to fill her shoes.  Our first priority question, which asks when the capital plan will be published, has been overtaken somewhat by events.  It is not surprising that Deputy McDonald tabled this question because it had been expected that the plan would be published in June, but the Government kept moving the date back.  The Deputy hoped that by tabling this question, the publication of the plan might be accelerated.  I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the plan.  We welcome some parts of it, especially some of the projects mentioned in it.  I would like to be parochial and mention the Cloonamahon Road, which is a death trap.  It is great that this project is included in the plan because the work on that road will save lives.  To what extent are the commitments or promises made in this plan predicated on economic well-being and EU instructions?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100004#B01000"><p>I suppose the Deputy could claim that the question tabled by his colleague was the catalyst for making sure all of this was done.  If he makes such a claim, I will not deny it publicly.  As he is aware, I launched the public capital investment programme, Building on Recovery, earlier this week.  It sets out the Government's commitment to a &euro;27 billion six-year capital plan.  This investment will increase the State's infrastructure, support economic recovery and jobs and support sustainable communities throughout the country.  When we include investment from the wider semi-State sector and from public private partnerships, as outlined in the plan, it is clear that total State-led investment will amount to &euro;42 billion over the period covered by the plan.  The capital investment plan has been carefully designed to meet the needs of a growing economy, to improve the delivery of services to communities and to maximise the benefit of support by providing Exchequer investment throughout the country.  It builds on the recovery and addresses emerging pressures, especially on transport networks.  It supports the regions, provides social infrastructure to enhance quality of life and is responsive to environmental challenges.</p>  <p>  The provision of jobs has been the Government's top priority from day one.  This &euro;27 billion plan will sustain 45,000 jobs.  I will give a rough outline of the distribution of the money.  Some &euro;4 billion will be spent in education, &euro;4 billion will be spent in the area of the environment, &euro;3 billion will be spent in health, &euro;3 billion will be spent in promoting enterprise and jobs, &euro;1.25 billion will be spent in agriculture and &euro;1 billion will be spent in justice.  In order to grow businesses, we are also allocating a special envelope to support transport, amounting to &euro;10 billion over seven years to fund public transport and roads.  My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, has outlined the flagship project, which is the new metro scheme for Dublin.  However, I emphasise that this is a national scheme.  I know the Deputy will be particularly interested in rural broadband, the rural development programme, the new village renewal programme and all the other supports that are laid out.  I will be very happy to go through them in detail if he wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100004#B01100"><p>I would certainly welcome many of the projects that are listed in the plan.  I have worked out that over the six-year period covered by this plan, Ireland will continue to have one of the lowest levels of capital spending of any country in Europe.  This overall figure includes public private partnerships.  I would argue that such partnerships are a very inefficient way of doing business because it costs more to borrow the money and investors and shareholders have to be paid out of it.  I think it is far better to provide for public investment in public services because a return can be got from it.  The Minister has not answered my question about the extent to which this is predicated on the economy doing well.  Could this Government or any future Government decide not to proceed with certain projects in this plan if the economy is not doing as well as expected?  Is it anticipated or possible that the EU could direct us to have less ambitious capital plans - if one wants to use the word "ambitious" in this context - that differ from those announced in the report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100004#B01200"><p>The total sum involved in the plan is &euro;42 billion, of which &euro;27 billion will be directly allocated by the State from Exchequer funding.  Semi-States such as the ESB will spend money on energy development.  Ervia and Irish Water will spend &euro;4 billion.  Just &euro;500 million of the &euro;42 billion in question will involve additional public private partnerships.  I am mindful of what the Deputy has said about such partnerships.  I agree that we must get value for money and I have set up a new regime to ensure that we do get it.  We are vigorous in ensuring that is the case.  When we had no money at all following the collapse of the economy, we were seeking any resources we could get.  For example, we sought funding from the European Investment Bank.  Public private partnerships were an option at that time, but they will be less of an option into the future.  It is clear in the plan that I have set an annual cap of 10% on the total capital expenditure to be used to pay back all public private partnerships.  I refer to the unitary payments we have agreed, including the site preparation payments, etc.  There is a cap on what we will use for these purposes.  I will answer the Deputy's final question when I come back in.</p></speech>

A friend of mine from Sligo rang me the night the plan was published.</p><p>He stated it was an awful pity that an election is not held every year because the economy seems to improve in the run-in to elections.  In any case, it may be that he was being slightly cynical. </p></speech>

From where does the figure of 45,000 jobs come?  Will these jobs be in Ireland for Irish people paying Irish taxes and will the companies involved pay taxes here?</p></speech>

On the figure of 45,000 jobs, there is a rule of thumb for determining the number of jobs to be created per &euro;1 million investment.  The 45,000 figure refers only to the direct investment of &euro;27 billion by the State rather than total investment which will be a much larger figure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked whether the plan could be threatened in future.  If a different Government were in place and it did not have the level of stability and focus on jobs that this Government had in recent years, if it failed to deliver the growth rates we have delivered or if that growth were threatened, we could be faced with what we had to deal with in 2011 when the capital plan was eviscerated because the income of the State and its capacity to fund the plan collapsed.  I hope that will not happen.</p></speech>

Under the new budgetary cycle, the Estimates are voted on by the D&aacute;il in the first few months of the year and Departments are expected to live within the voted expenditure.  On occasion, however, as the Deputy will be aware, the Estimate for a Department needs to be increased or changed during the course of the year.  This occurs for a number of reasons, including policy reasons, for example, when the Government decides it is appropriate to allocate additional funding to certain areas.  A second reason could be an overrun in expenditure, which occurs occasionally, for example, in a demand-led area where Estimates are not always exactly accurate.  Timing events may also occur, which change the timing of certain receipts or payments, particularly payments from the European Union or appropriations-in-aid that may come later or earlier than expected.  Such changes in timing may also alter the voted moneys.  Technical adjustments also occur when Departments move money within their Estimates for technical reasons.  Such changes must be voted on by the D&aacute;il.  As the Deputy will be aware, sometimes the House votes to shift rather than increase money provided for in an Estimate.  These are the reasons Supplementary Estimates are introduced.</p><p><font color="#181818">  As outlined in the spring economic statement, Ireland is on course to exit the excessive deficit procedure this year.  In this context, the Government is prepared to allocate an appropriate level of additional expenditure in 2015 to enhance delivery of key public services.  More details of the 2015 outturn position will be issued at budget time, as requested by the Deputy.  Under the Government's fiscal strategy and compliant with the fiscal rules, the budget on 13 October will set out the 2016 level of expenditure, which will be &euro;750 million above the outturn figure.</font></p></speech>

It is possible that no Supplementary Estimates will be introduced.  Does this mean the budget will be based on figures in respect of the outturn of expenditure in 2015?  If so, will this figure be held back from the D&aacute;il or will this information be shared with members of the public whose money the Government is spending?</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Minister referred to the possibility of &euro;750 million being made available for additional expenditure in the coming year and indicated he wants to live within that figure.  However, given that the Supplementary Estimates for 2014 amounted to &euro;1.2 billion, the public is entitled to conclude that the additional expenditure provided for on budget day is only small change when compared to the additional expenditure that will be announced by the end of the year.  The Government is diminishing the role of the budget by introducing Supplementary Estimates that are larger than the expenditure increases provided for in the budget. </font></p></speech>

I will provide the figure we have already allocated to indicate the shape of the additional expenditure I have sanctioned to date.  As he will be aware, an additional provision has been made for health in respect of delayed discharges, the fair deal scheme and the winter and waiting lists initiatives.  These were set out in the spring economic statement and amounted in total to an additional allocation of &euro;100 million.  I also allocated an additional &euro;50 million, also set out in the spring economic statement, to cover a summer capital works programme in the Department of Education and Skills.  Supplementary Estimates will be required for that allocation and for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to which I allocated an additional &euro;100 million before the summer to deliver additional rolling stock for Irish Rail, replace and expand the bus fleet and carry out maintenance work on non-national roads.  A number of technical adjustments will also be required.  The additional allocation in these three areas alone will amount to &euro;250 million.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The reason we are providing for additional expenditure is that we have the capacity to do so.  If the economy was not growing at such a rate and income to the State was not robust, we would not be able to allocate these additional sums.  I do not believe the Deputy would decry the additional expenditure I have allocated.  Certainly his party would not do so given the Private Members' motions and so forth it has introduced.  We have increased spending because we are able to do so.</font></p></speech>

However, as my party's spokesperson on public expenditure, my objective today is to discuss the budgetary process with the Minister.  He confirmed that a minimum of &euro;250 million in Supplementary Estimates will be required for the three items of expenditure to which he referred.  Further Supplementary Estimates will be required because the Department of Health has exceeded its expenditure allocation.  The Minister also stated that he will spend additional money if economic circumstances allow because he will have it.  In the budget, the Government will provide an expenditure plan on paper in the full knowledge that if it has more money next year, it will spend it.  A full assessment of the forthcoming budget would, therefore, require finding out how much additional revenue the Government expects to receive next year.  I presume Supplementary Estimates will be introduced this year and next year.  If the Government has more revenue next year, it will spend it and it does not propose to announce this expenditure on budget day.</p></speech>

The Deputy is fully aware of the new rules under the Stability and Growth Pact.  We are exiting the corrective arm of the pact.  Our legal objective this year was to have a deficit below 3% of gross domestic product.  As long as we maintain a deficit below 3% of GDP under the corrective arm, we could adjust expenditure within that context.  However, that will change next year when we enter the preventative arm, where we will have to work in legally agreed steps towards are achieving our medium-term objective, MTR.  As such, there will not be scope for Supplementary Estimates next year.  We have the capacity to address issues in the course of this year.  In many ways, the budgetary analysis will have to be robust to ensure everybody lives within their budgetary allocation for next year.</p></speech>

Specifically, I propose to ask questions about a recent recruitment competition for assistant principal officers in the Department.</p><p>My understanding is that a competition was held for the assistant principal officer grade and there was a change in the recruitment process.  While change is not necessarily a bad thing, part of the process involved candidates sitting an online test.  I imagine this was part of an assessment prior to short-listing those candidates.</p></reply>

Its recruitment mandate encompasses a large volume of entry level competitions, including clerical officer and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trainee recruitment as well as administrative, professional and specialist posts at all levels, including hospital consultant and senior management positions across the Civil Service, public service, regulatory bodies and some State agencies.  PAS, therefore, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the human resource and workforce needs of the public service are met by qualified, high calibre and committed candidates.  PAS operates within a strict legal and regulatory framework to safeguard the core principles of Civil Service employment which have played such an important role since the foundation of the State.</p><p>The easing of the moratorium on recruitment to the public service in late 2014 has resulted in a significant increase in activity for PAS, particularly in the large volume competitions.  To the end of August this year, PAS has completed 313 recruitment campaigns, handled over 45,000 applications and assigned over 3,640 people to positions in the public service.  In terms of the scale of individual competitions that PAS have successfully run, it is worth acknowledging that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na campaign in December 2013 attracted nearly 25,000 applications while 28,000 people applied to the clerical officer competition in 2014.  In order to effectively manage the significantly increased workload of recent years, PAS has implemented significant changes and process improvements in its methods of operation while continuing to adhere to its strong values of independence, fairness, transparency and the making of appointments on merit.  In operational terms, all applications for positions in the public service are handled online via the bespoke website .  The initial testing stages of recruitment processes are also completed online allowing candidates the benefit of competing for positions from wherever they are in the world.  Many interview processes are now conducted in a paperless fashion.</p><p>Finally, I ask the Deputy to note that PAS also took on responsibility for the new State boards assessment process following the reforms introduced by Government in 2014.</p></speech>

Are there not Irish companies which could have done this?  My second question relates to the fact that it is a little bit like "phone a friend".  I could be sitting in a room anywhere with my laptop and have a friend do the test for me.  I would not even have to phone that friend.  The third issue is that when some of those who did the electronic questionnaire sought a response as to where they performed well and where they did not perform quite so well, no information was forthcoming.  Anybody who is anxious to get a job and goes through this process will be keen to know where he or she can improve whether it is an interview or electronic assessment.  People have good grounds for complaints as to the lack of feedback regarding their participation in the process.</p></speech>

It is very well regarded not only by the Irish public but by international comparisons.  It has robust online procedures which meet the best international practices.  If the Deputy has any individual concerns about them, I would be happy to hear from him.  PAS itself would also be delighted, I am sure, to meet with the Deputy to go through its processes.  In terms of the volume of work, where one has 28,000 applications for a clerical officer position or 25,000 for a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recruitment campaign, one must have an initial sifting procedure in place.  As is now normal, that is done online.  The Deputy is correct that it must be done in a very robust way and I am assured and am confident that it is.</p></speech>

It is unfair on a person who does an interview or fills in a questionnaire that there is no response or indication as to which areas they have done well in and which areas they have not.  An interview should be a two-way conversation.  It is one thing asking people who are desperate for work to give information but it is unfair that there is no feedback.

This project has been in the ether for a couple of decades and lay on the shelf during the lifetime of the last Government.  In fairness, however, the current Government has resurrected it.  I am conscious that &euro;400 million has been allocated for flood protection works in the capital programme announced in the last few days.  What is the prognosis for the scheme in Arklow?  Can we have an update?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100006#D01000"><p>I thank Deputy Timmins for raising the matter and providing me with an opportunity to update the House on the status of plans for the Arklow flood relief scheme.</p><p>A flood relief scheme for the town of Arklow is being advanced by Wicklow County Council in partnership with the Office of Public Works, OPW, which is providing the funding.  The project is being overseen by a steering group which comprises representatives of Wicklow County Council, the council's engineering consultants, environmental consultants and the OPW.  The scheme is moving through the required stages of design and development and has progressed to a stage where a feasibility report is nearing finalisation following detailed consultations between Wicklow County Council, the consultants involved and the OPW.  There is an absolute commitment on all sides to progress and complete a flood relief scheme for Arklow to ensure that the people and businesses of the town are protected from the flooding that devastated the town in previous years.  I confirm that on the basis that a viable, cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable scheme is proposed to the OPW, funding will be made available as required.  The Arklow scheme is provided for in the OPW's multi-annual capital expenditure profiles.  In fact, the Arklow scheme is specifically listed in the capital plan published by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, this week.</p><p>I understand the frustration of communities over how long it takes to bring major flood relief schemes such as that for Arklow to the point of commencement of construction.  However, it is in the nature of flood defence schemes which involve complex civil engineering works within a river environment in an urban setting that the amount of planning and preparation required is necessarily very detailed.  I note in this context, however, that my office provided funding to Wicklow County Council in 2012 under the minor flood mitigation works scheme to carry out interim flood relief works in Arklow.  These works comprised the construction of a new flood protection wall and have now been completed to offer protection to properties and businesses in the river walk and town centre area of the town.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, a feasibility study to identify possible flood mitigation measures for Arklow Town is nearing completion.  The study was commissioned initially by Arklow Town Council and is being progressed by Wicklow County Council with funding provided by the Office of Public Works.  In addition, environmental consultants were appointed by the OPW to carry out an environmental impact statement and to work in tandem with the engineering consultants to identify environmentally acceptable measures.  It was also necessary to commission separate surveys of the quay walls and an assessment report on Arklow Bridge when it became evident that a number of potential flood alleviation measures might impact on the bridge.  All of these assessments will be brought together in a draft final feasibility report which I expect to receive shortly.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The purpose of the report is to identify and assess using technical, environmental and economic criteria the viability of a range of possible flood relief measures for Arklow.  Based on this assessment, the report is to identify and recommend a preferred flood relief scheme and set out an outline design of the recommended scheme.</p><p>The OPW has been engaged in extensive consultation and discussions with Wicklow County Council and its consultants in relation to technical aspects of the proposals for the scheme and also on the methodology employed in early drafts of the feasibility report with regard to cost-benefit assessment.  To enable additional flood relief options to be considered, further hydraulic modelling was also carried out this year and a workshop involving the relevant personnel will be held in the next month to consider the various options from a multi-criteria perspective in terms of the study objectives - technical, economic, social and environmental.  I am confident that any remaining issues can be resolved without undue delay and that Wicklow County Council will be in a position to provide the final draft feasibility report for the scheme shortly.  When the final draft is produced and provided that the preferred scheme is economically and environmentally viable, it is proposed to hold a second public information day, PID, in Arklow to afford the public an opportunity to view the proposed scheme works and to invite their comments and feedback in relation to these proposals.  The comments received at the PID will inform the progress of the scheme.  It is envisaged that this PID will be held early in 2016.</p><p>It has been agreed that once an environmentally and economically viable scheme has been identified, the works will be carried out under Wicklow County Council's legislative powers with funding provided by the OPW.  This will involve the council acting as the contracting authority to progress the project through the next stages of planning and statutory consents, detailed design and procurement of a works contractor.  Pending this, it is not possible to give a definite timescale for the implementation of the scheme.  However, I assure the Deputy that the OPW will work constructively with the local authority to ensure that the scheme is progressed as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is my hope and belief that we will be able to hold a public information day in Arklow in early 2016 at the latest.  If all goes well following that consultation and there is an acceptance of the scheme by local residents and business owners, I expect the county council to lodge a planning permission application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in mid-2016.  A scheme which has been discussed for a long time but which was left on the shelf to gather dust is nearing the point of being put on public display for the input of local people, if not by the end of this year, which would be my main hope, then by early 2016 with a view to having the planning permission application lodged in mid-2016.  When completed, the scheme will protect approximately 600 properties that are at risk, of which 450 are residential, and prevent road closures and traffic and economic disruption in the town.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that funding is in place for the scheme.  We must await the finalisation of the feasibility study, but the likely works involved include channel and bank maintenance, tidal and fluvial flood containment walls, non-return valves at pumping stations, a debris trap in the river channel, the removal of built-up river sediments, modifications to and underpinning of the existing bridge and the removal of a pinch point downstream of Arklow Bridge.</p></speech>

According to the Minister of State at the time, "The Claregalway scheme is the first flood relief scheme submitted for confirmation following the coming into effect of the 2012 regulations", which "require my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to carry out an environmental impact assessment of drainage or flood relief schemes prior to confirmation or approval of the proposed schemes".

I confirm that the River Clare drainage scheme will be proceeding.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, in association with Galway County Council, has developed a flood relief scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts for the River Clare in the environs of Claregalway.  In recognition of the significant flooding problems in the area, it was agreed to proceed with interim measures to reduce flood risk.  In 2012, the following remedial works were carried out in advance of the main scheme works: construction of a flood eye at Claregalway bridge; and construction of new bridge at Crusheeny.  These advance works have been successfully completed at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  While they have significantly reduced flood risk in the area, they do not provide the OPW standard level of protection that the overall scheme will provide, which is to protect against the one-in-100 year flood event.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a public exhibition of the River Clare scheme was held in late 2012 and stakeholders were afforded an opportunity to submit their observations on the proposals.  A number of responses were received, including a detailed submission by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on nature conservation and the underwater archaeological aspects of the proposed works.  Where necessary, the issues raised were considered fully by the OPW with in-depth technical input from the environmental consultants and were addressed where appropriate.  The proposed scheme was subsequently approved by the OPW and submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in late 2013 for confirmation, that is, statutory approval.</p>  <p>  Regulations were introduced across a number of Departments in 2012 in order to ensure that Ireland was fully compliant with EU environmental impact assessment, EIA, laws.  These regulations introduced necessary changes to Departments' EIA consent systems.  In the case of flood relief schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts, the regulations require that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the "consent authority" for such schemes, undertake an independent assessment of the environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted with the scheme documents by the OPW under the confirmation process.  The Minister is also required to publish his decision to confirm or not to confirm a scheme and to provide for a process of appeal of his decision.  The Claregalway scheme was the first scheme to be submitted under this process.  I will respond further and with more detail in a moment.</p></speech>

The Claregalway scheme was the first that needed to be approved under the new regulations and the EU directive.  Presumably, this means that no flood relief scheme has proceeded in the interim.  They are all waiting.</p>  <p>  People are exasperated by this situation.  We are told that the money is available under the capital plan, but it was available this time last year.  The scheme has been announced repeatedly, including by the Minister of State's predecessor.  People are wondering about the reason for the delay and when these schemes will be approved.  Will this be the process for all future relief schemes?  Will there be a couple of years of a delay or is the Minister of State still trying to fine-tune a template for approvals?  Must the existing environmental impact statement, EIS, be approved or must the Department conduct an assessment of its own?  There was some confusion in that regard last year, so I am wondering whether it has been decided.</p></speech>

As a result of the Claregalway scheme being the first, it is fair to say that it has taken longer than one would wish.  We have consulted the Office of the Attorney General on putting in place an adequate, streamlined and efficient system to deal with schemes.  However, there is news for the Deputy that differs from that provided last year, namely, the process in my Department will be completed in October and we are moving towards finalising the evaluation.  Being the first, not only was it important to evaluate the Claregalway scheme, but also to put in place a template for further schemes.  Lessons should be learned.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the confirmation process by the Minister - assuming that it is a positive decision - and allowing the necessary time for the Department to inform the public of that decision, the OPW will be in a position to commence works on the scheme in a matter of weeks subject to their being carried out within environmental windows and satisfying any precondition that may be attached to the confirmation process.  When VAT and future cost fluctuations are taken into account, the total budget for the scheme is &euro;7.1 million, including the approximately &euro;2.5 million that has already been expended.</p></speech>

Following completion, when is it likely that a decision will be made?  The major capital investments that were announced in the capital plan this week are welcome, but I would not like such delays to ensue in other projects.  In that regard, it is important that schemes under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme be expedited within the environmental requirements and legislation.  Sometimes, a good news story that provides relief and assurance to people can be negated by delays.</p></speech>

It is important that we have systems in place to deal speedily with schemes.  It is also important that the State carry out this work in accordance with the law, including our European commitments under environmental law.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to be able to update Deputy Kyne on the significant progress that has been made with the Claregalway scheme.  Under the capital plan announced by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, this week, the Government has pledged to spend more on flood relief in the next five years than was spent in the past 20 years combined.  This shows the Government's commitment.</p>  <p>  Maintenance works have been carried out on the River Clare.  The OPW employed two long-reach machines to remove a build-up of silt from bends on both banks of the river from Lough Corrib upstream to Crusheeny Bridge.  I am informed that this work has been substantially completed.  The Minister has assured me that, as soon as the process is completed in the Department, there will be no delay on his end and there will be none on mine.  We are eager for the scheme to progress as quickly as possible.  I reiterate that the funding is in place.</p></speech>

I published the plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, this week.  It sets out the Government's &euro;27 billion Exchequer capital plan for the next six years.  It includes a new third phase in the Government's public private partnership, PPP, programme and is in addition to other State-led investments, bringing the total to &euro;42 billion.</p>  <p>  In terms of transport, the plan outlines an investment of &euro;6 billion on roads across the country over the next seven years, including roads projects targeted at removing critical bottlenecks, some of which will be known to the Deputy, and upgrading inadequate sections.  Additional investment will be provided for the continued development and improvement of sports facilities at regional and local levels and for further enhancement of the tourism offering through further investment in the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and other innovative tourism products.</p><p>As well as building schools across the country, which will be focused on demographic need, we will fund the installation of wireless networks and ICT hardware in all schools.<br/><br/>With regard to supporting regional development and sustaining communities, there are substantial investment commitments to support the roll out of broadband.  The rural economy will benefit from the critical investment set out in the investment framework by a provision of &euro;235 million<b></b>for Leader.  A new village renewal scheme has been set out to support the revitalisation of towns and villages.<br/><br/>As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, said, we are providing an investment of &euro;430 million in flood risk mitigation across the country in areas where there is the greatest risk.  We have provided extra funding also for the peatlands restoration programme to restore peatlands to their natural state.<br/><br/>The Government is committed to rural Ireland.  We are committed to creating jobs on a sustainable basis across the country.  The roll out of local enterprise offices provides an opportunity to increase engagement with the wider enterprise community to provide micro and small enterprises, which are the main employers in rural Ireland, with the funding and the supports they need.  Over the lifetime of the plan, Exchequer investment will support 45,000 jobs in every part of the country.</p></speech>

On the village renewal scheme in rural Ireland, the plan provides for Exchequer funding of &euro;5 million in the budget but that amounts to about &euro;200,000 per local authority.  That level of funding for each local authority is hardly what one would class as a significant investment that would help to regenerate rural areas.</p>  <p>  On the broadband plan, it is vitally important that the roll out of the broadband plan targets the most disadvantaged areas, the regions and the most distant areas first to try to give them some chance to play catch-up over the coming years.  I ask the Minister to focus on that when he is talking to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources about it.</p></speech>

That has been the focus of the Government from the outset.  If we consider job creation across the country, the national figure is a 3% increase in the past 12 months.  The regional figures are much better than that.  In my own area, for example, the south east, it is better.  The focus of the Government has been on ensuring that every region is supported by this measure.  The strategy to ensure fast-track broadband is available across the country to everybody is very important in that context.</p>  <p>  Although the Deputy mentioned the &euro;30 million for the new rural programme, that is a small subset of the moneys that are available.  As he will know, I have agreed a multi-billion euro investment for rural Ireland, co-funded by the European Union with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which will impact on every village and area of the country.  The schools, roads and primary health care systems we are building will support and enhance every region of the country.</p></speech>

That has been achieved.

A total of &euro;6.3 million returned to the Exchequer, which was mainly due to the delays in recruitment of staff to the OGP, which impacted the pay bill.  The total allocated for 2015 is &euro;18.9 million.  Expenditure for next year will be a matter for the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  The OGP is still at an early stage of operation, having recruited the majority of its resources through 2015.  Setting up the OGP will develop capacity to enable better value for taxpayers, better management of risk for the State and better management of suppliers.  The OGP sourcing teams have completed 68 projects this year to date capturing an estimated annual spend of &euro;1.3 billion.  They are currently working on 187 active projects across all eight categories with an estimated value of &euro;720 million.</p>  <p>  In July, the OGP published an updated target schedule of contracts and frameworks giving public sector bodies and the markets a nine month horizon of planned OGP sourcing activity from the third quarter this year to quarter 1 next year.  This enables the markets to plan their bidding in a much more structured way.  Savings enabled this year by the OGP and sector sourcing organisations are estimated at &euro;66 million, with a balance of &euro;58 million savings being enabled next year.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, I launched a report entitled Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013, which provided, for the first time, an examination of detailed non-pay expenditure for a large portion of the public service.  This has brought much needed data to policymakers and to the markets.  It is planned to issue a similar report for 2014 before the end of this year.</p></reply>

I was a supporter of this office but I am disappointed not just with what the Minister said but, specifically, what he did not say in his response.  I refer to the Revised Estimates for the Public Services 2015, and Vote 39 is the Vote we discussed in committee.  The Minister came into the committee earlier this year and said that these were the 2015 output targets for this new office to complete the recruitment of all staff.  He has said now that has not happened.  The Minister said he would secure Cabinet agreement to put the office on a legislative basis, but there was no mention of that.</p>  <p>  In terms of how the office is operating, the Aer Arann fiasco in which it had an involvement clearly shows it is out of touch.  Sometimes centralisation can be a good move and achieve efficiencies.  I will not go into describing how it is excluding many small businesses from being involved in the procurement process but the way it handled the Aer Arann air service is an example of how much it is out of touch.</p>  <p>  The Minister might give us an update on the service level agreements between the Office of Government Procurement and the various public bodies, in terms of the number that have been completed, and between the office and the various designated lead buyers.</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite content to have a dysfunctional procurement operation that was the hallmark of his own time in Government when nobody knew the price of goods and services and every State agency was buying the same products from the same suppliers at different prices.  We professionalised that system but it cannot be professionalised in an instant.  The recruitment process has been slower than we expected but I can tell the House now that as of 11 September there were some 178 of the expected 231 people recruited.  There are some vacancies still in the process.  Obviously, appointments have been made and people waiting to take up those appointment.  When we have recruited the full cohort of people, we will have a professional procurement system for the public service for the first time in our history.</p><p>It will give transparency to the way we buy goods and services that will be analogous to best commercial practices that we would expect of very large companies.  The State and taxpayer deserve and expect nothing less.</p></speech>

I said they seemed very busy.  I said I supported the principle of centralisation, but I want it to be in touch.  The Minister has said he is still waiting to recruit 60 staff into that organisation.  It has been in operation for two years and the full complement of staff still has not been recruited.  It was one thing last year to claim we had a plan of expenditure of &euro;12.5 million and we spent less than half of it.  I hope that was a lesson to the people involved to get on with the job.  This House of the Oireachtas voted substantial funding for it this year, &euro;18.9 million.</p>  <p>  How many public bodies does it deal with?  How many service level agreements are expected to be in place ultimately?  How many are already in place especially for the organisations that are the lead buyers?  How many service level agreements are in place for bodies such as Kerry County Council for local authority purchasing, the HSE which is still the lead buyer for other services, and the Department of Defence which still does its own work?</p></speech>

I do not have those data before me, but I will ask the OGP to forward them directly to him.</p>  <p>  Every agency of State and every Department is transforming how they do their business in a professional way.  It takes a while to recruit the professionals we need.  We want to get the right people in place and we have largely done that.  There are still a few more we need to recruit, but largely all the key people are in place.  It will have a transformative impact on how the State operates in the right way so that all goods and services can be bought in a transparent way.  There are no side deals or local deals that, unfortunately, used to be a feature of how the State operated in the past.</p></speech>

Nobody in this House would deny that.  The fiscal adjustment implemented in order that Ireland could successfully exit the troika programme and return sustainability to our public finances required expenditure reductions.  Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009, when infamously we were told we were awash with money, to &euro;54 billion last year.  Consequently any international comparison of Government expenditure needs to be viewed in that context.</p>  <p>  In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority was to ensure that a targeted approach was adopted in order to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible.  The key sectors of health, education and social protection were prioritised throughout this period, and this year these three areas of health, education and social protection account for some 80% of the Government's gross voted spending on the current side.</p>  <p>  The fiscal forecasts in April's stability programme update outline that in 2016 general Government expenditure, excluding debt interest, is projected to be just 32% of GDP or 37.5% of GNP.  As a proportion of the overall economy, this would leave Government spending next year at roughly the same size it was in 2001.</p>  <p>  Budget 2015 marked a turning point in our fiscal and economic recovery, as expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets.  The Government was in a position to hold overall spending steady and to make some targeted increases in selected areas.  The capital plan which I published this week involves an additional &euro;27 billion of capital spending over the period 2016 to 2021.</p>  <p>In setting out expenditure measures for next year's budget, Government will seek to enhance further key public services while building on the progress we have made in returning our economy to stability.</p></speech>

The &euro;27 billion package over six years the Minister mentioned represents 1.9% of GDP.  So between this year and 2021, the annual average increase in public investment will be less than &euro;250 million, compared with the Government's intention to provide &euro;750 million in tax cuts.  Rather than a 50:50 split I believe the Minister would have preferred to lean more towards investment in the services rather than tax cuts.  As the Minister knows, indirect taxation in Ireland is pretty draconian and obviously impacts most on those with least money.  Would the Minister not admit that he would rather see a better balance in favour of service investment?</p></speech>

A very interesting article published by Seamus Coffey, the UCC economist, indicates that across all countries health, education and social protection for families and working-age population represent the biggest chunk of expenditure normally.  In 2013 the average expenditure across those three areas in the 28 countries of the EU was the equivalent of 19.7% of GDP.  In Ireland we spent 22.8% of GDP, which ranked Ireland as the seventh highest spending EU country on health, education and social protection.</p></speech>

Indeed, the Government six-year programme will be the lowest of any six-year tranche at any time since 1970.<br /><br />The long-term annual average level of public investment is 3.5 percent of GDP with peaks in the 1970s and in the run-up to the crash.  To reach our long-term average by 2021 would mean an investment package of &euro;41 billion, or a 50 percent increase on the Government&rsquo;s package.</blockquote><p>Let neither of us get lost in the figures and in what the economists say.  I return to my question: I will ask the Minister once more.  Would he agree that, given that, we should lean more on the investment side rather than tax cuts?  As a Labour Party man I would like to think that he would definitely think that.  I ask him to answer that question.</p></speech>

However, there is objective fact: there must be some objective truth in all of this.  In truth, I am reading from a UCC economist who has analysed the figures.  He indicated that measuring as a percentage of GDP is problematic for Ireland because of the operation of multinational companies.</p><p>Deputy Wallace is aware that GNP is often a much more accurate assessment of Ireland.  If one takes a hybrid of the two, Ireland ranks third in expenditure on the social areas.  Only Denmark and Finland spend more of their income on those critical areas.  We need to know the facts before we draw conclusions.  This is taxpayers' money and we need to know what we are spending and what we are getting for it.  We need to have a system based on the truth before we all, if one likes, arm ourselves with economic facts to bolster a theory we have.</p> <p> To return to the Deputy's question, I will set out my view and that of the Labour Party on the division of tax and spend when the election campaign starts next year.  In terms of this year, we have an agreement with our partners in government.  In view of the very significant increase in taxes over the crisis period, including universal charge, all trade unions are campaigning very actively on it, as they consider it a punitive tax, in particular for low and medium income earners and they say we need to rebalance that this year.  We will probably have a different view, as the Deputy might envisage, beyond this year.</p></speech>

Good progress is being made on the national catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme which is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU floods directive and forms the strategic focus of national flood policy for some years, since approximately 2006.  Engineering consultants have been appointed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to implement the programme, through six regional studies.  Local authorities and other stakeholders are involved, in partnership with the OPW, on steering groups and progress groups across the six study areas.  I am sure Deputy Fleming and all Deputies in this House are aware of and have been involved in the consultation days in their own areas.  This programme is focusing on 300 mainly urban, areas for further assessment, AFAs, including 90 coastal areas.  It involves the production of predictive flood hazard and risk mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.</p><p>The flood risk management plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Structural measures in the plans will be taken to outline design stage.  The plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis that takes into account social and environmental factors as well as economic criteria.</p><p>Under the programme, draft predictive flood maps have been produced.  They are currently available to view on the website.  They were the subject of a series of local public consultation days which concluded in April 2015.  The flood maps will be finalised following a statutory national consultation scheduled for late 2015.  A series of local public consultation days on the preliminary flood risk management options is under way in the west and Shannon CFRAM study areas.  The flood risk management plans, namely, the solutions, are scheduled to be completed in late 2016.  Further information is available on <i>www.cfram.ie</i>but ultimately, as the Deputy is aware, this is a major plan which has been undertaken over a significant period of years by the Office of Public Works.  We are getting very close to the point whereby this time next year we will have the emergence of not just maps but potential solutions for many of the 300 communities.  It will require significant investment.  It is a matter for Government but the plan could take ten years to roll out at an ultimate cost of approximately &euro;1 billion.</p></reply>

A few years ago we had river basin catchment plans for the rivers Lee and Shannon and in the south east, among other areas.  Perhaps they are the six regional study plans to which the Minister of State referred.  I do not recall whether there were six or eight.</p></speech>

Will much work be involved in joining up the six plans into one national plan?  One could say that all that is required is for them to be added together.  However, it should not be as simple as that.  We are a single island.  Could the Minister of State refer to the transition from that method of operating to following the EU advice that we should have one national plan?  The view was that the island is too small for so many individual plans.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister of State also elaborate on the statutory national consultation process, which he said would take place in late 2015?  A reply to a previous parliamentary question indicated it would be held later &ldquo;this summer&rdquo;.  We have missed the boat somewhat in that regard.  Could the Minister of State clarify the position?</p></speech>

I expect the consultation to take place very shortly, in the coming weeks.  We have carried out more consultation in this country than we ever had to do on CFRAM.  That was the appropriate thing to do.  We put in new layers of consultation, which exceeded our obligations under the EU floods directive.  We must now physically publish the maps.</p>  <p>  The various CFRAM areas will come together to offer Ireland&rsquo;s national flood plan, which will be the CFRAM solution.  The programme has involved the capture of approximately 10,000 sq. km. of detailed aerial survey data, which is approximately 13% of the total land area, 6,673 km of channel survey data and the development of models of all the major river systems in the country.</p>  <p>  I am especially proud that we took the decision to factor in climate change to the CFRAM process.  We did not have to factor that in under the current EU directives but it is likely it will be required in future.  Both the flood maps and the identification and outline design of flood risk management measures will consider two potential future scenarios, including the potential impact of climate change.  That will ensure our flood risk management strategies and the measures set out in the plan are robust in the face of an uncertain future.  An incredible body of work that has been done by officials in the Office of Public Works in consultation with local authorities is coming to fruition.  We need to ensure the political will to fund the plan is available.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has clearly shown that is the Government&rsquo;s position.  We must get on with delivering the process.  I expect the solutions for communities to be delivered around this time next year.</p></speech>

The first is the draft flood maps that are currently available.  They are very important.  I ask that the Minister of State would give a little guidance to local authorities in respect of their county development plans.  I said previously to the Minister of State that some local authorities included the draft plans in their county development plans, as a result of which financial institutions refused to give loans in areas that were considered to be a possible flood risk within a 100-year period.  The situation caused significant damage.  I accept the Minister of State said one should not use the plans until they are finalised, but what are local authorities to use in the meantime given that they should take some account of the plans?  Local authorities are in a limbo situation.</p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to Irish Water.  Much of our drinking water comes from rivers and the adverse impact of flooding can affect water quality.  Could the Minister of State explain the involvement of Irish Water in the process from a water quality point of view, given that some of the areas in question which are prone to flooding are the source of drinking water?</p></speech>

I visited far too many homes where people have been flooded in houses that should never have been built but were, due to irresponsible planning by local authorities throughout the country.  The publication of the CFRAM maps does not create risk.  The maps tell people about the risk that exists.  There is often a misconception that the maps are creating new risk.  It is better to know.  There are people who will be surprised at the information presented in the maps.  Although they have lived in a home all their lives they are only now learning from the maps that their home is potentially at risk of flooding due to climate change and other factors.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, has developed guidelines for flood risk and the planning system.  The guidelines on the planning system and flood risk management 2009 have introduced a comprehensive and transparent framework for the incorporation of flood risk identification, assessment and management into the planning process.  The guidelines were issued in 2009 by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to the guidelines in carrying out their functions under the Planning Acts.  Taken together with the flood maps, they should improve decision making on building in areas at risk from flooding.  That should happen from now on.  When analysing schemes, we will not factor into the cost-benefit analysis where councils decide to pursue irresponsible planning decisions and grant development.</p>  <p>  I will seek an answer to the Deputy on the specific question on Irish Water and revert to him.</p></speech>

As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is not automatically bound by EU measures in the area of freedom, justice and security under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which includes the asylum area, but may opt in to any measure where it wishes to do so.  It is clearly apparent that Europe is facing an unprecedented migration crisis.  This is a humanitarian crisis which has continued to escalate and to which there are no simple answers.  Both Italy and Greece have experienced unprecedented flows of migrants over the past 18 months in particular, placing significant pressure on their migration and asylum systems.  Since the beginning of the year, approximately 116,000 migrants have arrived in Italy in an irregular manner and more than 211,000 have arrived in Greece.</p><p>As Members are aware, to date, the Government has been working proactively with its colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union respond comprehensively to this critical humanitarian crisis facing Europe.  Ireland has played its part and many months ago sent some of our naval vessels, including the <i>LE Eithne</i>and subsequently the<i>LE Niamh</i>and the<i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, to the Mediterranean to carry out vital rescue missions to ensure the safety of many people.  These vessels have rescued people in truly horrific conditions, with examples of individuals sitting in tiny dinghies that are completely unseaworthy with petrol spilling into them and people being burnt and unable to move, of young children being on board them, of numbers on vessels far exceeding their carrying capacity and of people being kept in situations in which they could not move and had no chance of surviving when the vessels got into trouble.  People have been found in truly horrific positions and I must condemn unequivocally the smugglers who are involved in this regard.  Ireland has sent its naval vessels and through Irish Aid, the Government's development co-operation programme, it has been supporting efforts to assist the Syrian people.  This measure will see the provision of &euro;41 million in support by Ireland.  Deputies will also have noted the decision made by the Council meeting of all the EU Prime Ministers to allocate &euro;1 billion in aid to the refugees and, in particular, to help ameliorate the position within the refugee camps, which had deteriorated.  This substantial funding was agreed after the meeting to which I refer and is important in dealing with the many different aspects of the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>The decisions being discussed today form part of a package of measures introduced by the European Commission in response to this crisis.  The first decision, which was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14 September 2015, provides for the relocation of 40,000 people in clear need of international protection over a two-year period, that is, 24,000 from Italy and 16,000 from Greece.  The distribution of these persons was agreed by consensus by member states in July and, under that proposal, Ireland agreed to accept 600 people in the first instance.  Since the July meeting, the influx of refugees through the western Balkans in particular has increased dramatically.  While there has been a stabilisation in the numbers of people crossing the Mediterranean, there have been huge increases of those coming via the Balkan routes and, consequently, it has become clear that significant further measures were needed.  Accordingly, at a further emergency Justice and Home Affairs meeting on 22 September, a second decision which provides for the relocation of a further 120,000 people in clear need of international protection was adopted.  In this decision, 66,000 of the 120,000 people will be relocated from Italy and Greece initially.  As for the balance of 54,000 people, these will either be relocated from other member states coming under pressure in the future, if necessary, or, alternatively, they could be relocated from Italy and Greece.  That number came about because Hungary decided in latter weeks that it did not wish to be a country from which refugees would be relocated and that redistribution of 54,000 people is to be decided.  The distribution of the persons to be relocated across member states is set out in the annex to the decision.  Ireland has not been included in the annex because we did not opt in to the proposal before it was adopted.  It is estimated that Ireland's allocation under this decision would be in the region of 1,850 people.</p><p>Three weeks ago, the Government agreed, in response to the crisis situation, to establish an Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU resettlement and relocation programmes.  Resettlement is when refugees who are already in the camps come to us and relocation pertains to those people who have arrived across the borders in Italy and Greece in particular.  Included in the 4,000 people the Government has agreed to accept are 520 people it has agreed to resettle in Ireland from the refugee camps, 600 people to be relocated under the Council's decision of 14 September and 1,850 people who are expected to be relocated under the Council's decision of 22 September.  The make-up of the balance is yet to be decided.  It is important to note that persons accepted here under these programmes also have an entitlement, once their protection claims are processed, to apply for family reunification if they wish to so do, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland. The 4,000 agreed to is in addition to those who reach our shores directly to claim protection.  Again, Members will be aware that numbers of people arrive here and claim asylum.  Those numbers, in line with the rest of Europe, have increased substantially from the beginning of this year, admittedly from a low base.  Ireland has seen probably an increase of 50% in those claiming asylum and that is a separate tract to the subject under discussion this morning.</p><p>A task force has been established to co-ordinate and implement the logistical and operational aspects associated with this programme.  I chaired the first meeting on 16 September, which was a large meeting attended by all the main Departments that will be involved in providing supports, as well as the agencies, the Red Cross, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and others.  The Irish people also have also shown great generosity in offering support and assistance of all types including accommodation, support to families and children and clothing.  There have been thousands of offers of accommodation and the Red Cross has been given the task of drawing together these offers of assistance in a cohesive manner.  On Monday last, the Red Cross launched its website to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges.  I suggest to Deputies that people who offer help or support should be advised to give their pledge to the Red Cross - which can assess those offers of help - because obviously one must consider the appropriateness and sustainability of all such offers and how they might be taken up, probably more in the medium to long term rather than immediately.  I thank the Red Cross for taking on this role.</p><p>At its meeting, the Government also approved the establishment of a network of emergency reception and orientation centres for the initial acceptance and processing of those in need of international protection who are accepted into Ireland under the EU programmes.  I note the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality heard a presentation yesterday from the two agencies involved and I understand there was much discussion of and detail provided on preparedness at that meeting.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which also was present, has put in place various initiatives to ensure it is ready to deal with the situation.  In view of the profile of the relocation applicants, I expect they will have their applications for protection processed in a matter of weeks and that many will be granted status.  This is a new programme by the European Commission.  It is not like relocation, where refugee status has been granted previously and nor does it pertain to asylum seekers arriving directly in one's country but is about people coming to Ireland, who had arrived in another country, with the expectation that the vast majority are refugees and will be assessed as such.</p><p>We have all been shocked and upset at the scenes witnessed in southern and central Europe and the distressing scenes during rescues in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Ireland has always lived up to its international humanitarian obligations as is evidenced by our resettlement programmes which has seen almost 500 people resettled here since 2009, our sending of naval vessels to assist in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, unlike other countries, and the introduction of a Syrian humanitarian admission programme, SHAP, last year which involved 114 persons being granted permission to come to Ireland.</p> <p> By opting-in to these decisions we will not only provide a safe haven for families and children who are forced to leave their homes due to war and conflict but also show solidarity with other EU member states whose protection systems are under enormous pressure due to the large influx of migrants.  I commend the motions to the House.</p></speech>

At least 350,000 migrants crossed the EU&rsquo;s borders in January-August 2015, compared with just 280,000 during 2014.</p>  <p>  This is an EU level crisis which requires an EU level solution.  Thus far, Europe has failed the test of providing a comprehensive response to the crisis.  Ireland, having now agreed to accept 4,000 applicants, is in the top three countries of the EU as a proportion of our population for receiving immigrants from this crisis.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision in this regard, although it was slow to react to events initially.  However, we have yet to see a detailed, fully funded plan from the Department of Justice and Equality as to where and how exactly the people seeking refuge in Europe will be accommodated here.  I would appreciate if the Minister could outline what is planned at present at the soonest opportunity.  It is important that a proper plan is in place to ensure full integration of refugees into Irish communities across the country once regular status is given to those seeking asylum.</p>  <p>  It is obvious that the distribution of refugees must be shared proportionately within the EU to ensure that those seeking asylum are properly catered for.  Some of the approaches taken by other member states have been shameful to say the least.  Hungary, in particular, has not acted in the spirit required to help in this crisis.  Its government has called for European forces to take control of Greece&rsquo;s borders, for example.  We believe many of our neighbours within the Union could do more in accepting an increased number of applications.  All member states need to step up and show compassion faced by the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II.  Ultimately, it is important that the EU works on an international level to address the wars and instability driving the crisis.  Ending the civil war in Syria must be an international priority.  As a neutral country, it is beyond us to take an active approach in a military or defensive sphere.  That is our tradition and one which has served us well in the past.  We must, however, be active at institutional levels within the EU and the UN to encourage a resolution to the current crisis in Syria and the Middle East in general.</p>  <p>  The last EU leaders&rsquo; summit in September appeared to act as a fudge and failed to come up with common policies to solve one of the greatest humanitarian crisis we have witnessed on this Continent in decades.  It was clear that our heads of government have continuously failed to contain and manage the migration emergency.  I understand that the emergency summit in Brussels decided to allocate &euro;1 billion to aid agencies and transit countries hosting millions of Syrian refugees.  Some have accused the EU of seeking to pay off Turkey to deal with the immigration crisis.  This is not a long-term policy of which anyone within the EU can be proud.  It still appears as though many in the Union are sticking their heads in the sand and hoping the problems will go away.  The challenges will not be dealt with until the core reasons for the mass migration of people who are in great desperation are addressed.  The crisis in Syria and across much of northern Africa and the Middle East has been ongoing for almost five years now.  The failure of the international community to address the instability, war and destruction in the region is lamentable.  Today, hundreds of thousands of people are dead and millions of people are displaced due to this failure.</p>  <p>  The EU must have a comprehensive set of policies in place in order that countries receiving migrants are able to deal with this in a timely and humanitarian fashion.  This is imperative to ensure the principles of freedom, security and justice are realised for those seeking a safe haven, but also for countries receiving immigrants.  With regard to the motions, it is important that member states recognise the great difficulties currently facing southern Mediterranean countries in trying to cope with the refugee crisis.  As stated in the Council decision, to which the motions relates, Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, allows for the EU to deal with emergency situations characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries into member states.  This is an important provision and one which reflects the principle of solidarity, which is central to the EU&rsquo;s success.  We will support this motion in that spirit of solidarity.</p></speech>

However, I would like to make a number of comments and outline our ten-point plan, which we offer to the Minister and her senior officials for consideration as part of their deliberations, towards the end of my contribution.</p>  <p>  This crisis is not a new one.  A few years ago, I visited Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, which have been there for decades.  They were taking in Palestinians from Syria.  In other words, refugees were housing other refugees in appalling conditions.  One of the buildings we visited had been bombed out by Israeli forces but refugees were living in it.  Our delegation of parliamentarians from Ireland and Britain met officials from the UNHCR and UNRWA to discuss our concerns, which we also raised with EU representatives.  This crisis has been going on, therefore, for quite a while.  Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey have taken in a huge number of refugees and they have taken on a massive burden in the context of this crisis.  The Minister gave assurances that Ireland would ensure the international community would give those states as much support as it can to deal with the crisis.  When we talk about stepping up to the plate, it is remarkable what those three states have done.  However, other states in the region have not stepped up to the plate, including the wealthy gulf states.  We need to confront them morally about their failure in this regard and challenge them.  It cannot just be commerce and business as usual with these states.  We need to say we are part of a global community and everybody has to step up and do what is right as part of their international obligations.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, INIS officials and the Refugee Applications Commissioner appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to which the Minister made reference.  They are good people doing their best but it is clear that there is not a definitive plan.  They are working their way through what needs to happen, which presents an opportunity.  Obviously, we would like full costings and a detailed plan but that will take time over the next number of months.  Sinn F&eacute;in will submit its own suggestions, which I will address shortly.</p>  <p>  President Juncker in his state of the Union address referred to a contribution of &euro;6,000 per refugee to states and &euro;500 per refugee for travel and so on.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform rightly said the Government would say to the Union that whatever expenditure is undertaken in this crisis will not be factored into normal budgetary considerations, which would mean it would not have an impact on other decisions the Government makes.  I note both these important points.  A considerable number of our citizens are wondering about our own housing and unemployment crises and our economic recovery and asking whether they should be addressed first.  I strongly believe that we can address both domestic and international obligations but we need to lay out clearly how and why the State can do both.  That is absent from the debate currently.  I ask the Minister and her senior officials to ensure there is a clearly communicated plan and a clearly communicated message that the Government will deal with these domestic issues but can meet our international obligations and to reassure people before this is turned into a silent resentment or, possibly even worse, racism.</p><p>It is very important that we co-operate with the non-governmental organisations.  There are superb people in those organisations who have tremendous expertise in terms of integration and location at various places throughout the State.  We need to involve communities in advance.  We need to tell them that there will be X number of refugees and their families moving to their areas and involve them in the process.  There are good models.  For example, Southill in Limerick was brought to my attention yesterday.  I understand there was a relocation of Congolese or African citizens there that worked really well.  That is a good model, which I would ask the Minister to examine.  That can be done but we need to plan it out and involve non-governmental organisations and thereby have an inclusive process.<br/><br/>This State has not opted in to two directives that would have allowed those seeking asylum to work after nine months.  That is a reasonable expectation.  I think we would all accept that our system has been way too cumbersome and that it has taken too much time to make decisions.  I welcome the fact that legislation relating to this matter will be brought forward in the near future, and the sooner the better.  We have had people stuck in these direct provision centres for far too long, in some cases for more than ten years.  We need to make decisions about people who have been there for that length of time.  We should allow them to stay, that is my firm view.  As the Minister will be aware, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions did a good deal of work on this - its members visited the centres and it published a report.  We are not happy at all with the direct provision system.  It fails our people and does not reflect their values.  It needs to go.  I do not want the new numbers of refugees who will come here to face similar experiences.  We have a bad track record on this, which is out of kilter with the history of the State.<br/><br/>As I have said in this Chamber on numerous occasions, ours is the only country in the world that has a smaller population than was the case in the early 1800s.  That reflects our history of mass emigration, which has continued right up to recent years.  I am a Donegal man.  Our history in Donegal has been one of emigration.  My father and grandfather emigrated.  I emigrated for a short period and was lucky to be able to come home.  That has been the history of people from Donegal and the west.  It is the history of our country.  With that history in mind, surely we can do better on the issue of taking a reasonable and fair allocation of refugees and welcoming them to our country.  However, we must do it in a way that deals with the fears - sometimes these are legitimate - of citizens.  We can do all of that.<br/><br/>I want to outline some of my party's ten-point plan on this issue.  Ireland should commit to taking one refugee per every 1,000 of our population.  A proposal in this regard was made by the non-governmental organisations and that is one of the figures mentioned in it.  In fairness, the 4,000 figure over the two years is in that ballpark.  That would see us take in 4,500 to 5,000 people this year.  The direction the Government has taken is a good step.  We probably can do more but it is certainly very encouraging and it is a good signal.  We need to continue this in the next number of years because this crisis is not going to go to away any time soon.<br/><br/>We need to develop a national action plan.  That plan should be both short-term and long-term focused.  The Government should immediately set up a working group, made up of immigration experts.  Some of what I am calling for may already be happening.  I will set out the points, as we put them forward before these measures were taken.  As stated, the Government should establish a working group, made up of immigration experts and civil society groups, to speedily identify the infrastructural requirements and other needs and the logistics necessary to make our response to the crisis as successful as possible.  I understand from yesterday's meeting that a fair amount of that is happening.  The Government should also engage with the Northern Executive - this is very important - and the British Government to work on a common approach across the island.  We call for the immediate implementation and enhancing the Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme from Britain into the Six Counties.<br/><br/>We fully support the use of the Irish Naval Service in search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean and the Government's call to ensure that these missions continue.  We do not want Ireland to be involved in a EUNAVFOR Med mission or a military-style mission.  However, all of our people are immensely proud of the work of our Naval Service and we should continue that work.  I have already said that we need to end direction provision system.<br/><br/>We call for an emergency summit of member states to be convened immediately.  Emergency meetings are ongoing and I ask the Minister to be at the forefront of that process.  We call for others to play their part on setting up safe and legal access to Europe.  This could be done through a UN Security Council resolution, as well as all European member states working together in a spirit of the Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, to make this happen.  This could also include the provision of the issuing of humanitarian visas for those travelling from conflict zones.<br/><br/>We must suspend the Dublin regulations to ensure effective access to asylum.  The regulations usually mean that the responsible member state will be the state through which the asylum seeker first entered the EU.  The Dublin regulations establish a hierarchy of criteria for identifying the member state responsible for the examination of an asylum claim in Europe.  This is not practical under the current circumstances.<br/><br/>We call on the European Commission and member states to activate the temporary protection directive.  Temporary protection is an exceptional measure to provide displaced persons from non-EU countries and unable to return to their country of origin with immediate and temporary protection.  It applies in particular when there is a risk that the standard asylum system is struggling to cope with demand stemming from a mass influx that risks having a negative impact on the processing of claims.  This directive and its concrete proposals must be immediately activated in light of the current situation.  We call on the Commission and member states to stop co-operation with third countries which aim to prevent asylum seekers from reaching a safe place in Europe and we also call for an end of negotiations on any such agreements with third countries, such as Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt, that do not guarantee the protection of refugees and respect for fundamental rights.<br/><br/>Ireland should opt back in to the common European asylum system, CEAS.  As I said, we should opt in to the directives.  If we set a challenge that somebody has the right to work after nine months, it will mean that we will get our act together in terms of applications process.  We cannot leave people languishing, for more than ten years in some cases, without the ability to work, living on &euro;19 a week.  I have visited these direct provision centres in my role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  They fail the standard of decency that we set as a State.  We cannot allow this to continue and we need to address it.  We need to opt in to directives, which will ensure that our State meets the standards that are expected of the European Union.<br/><br/>We need to address the root cause of the crisis.  We need to strengthen long-term efforts to resolve the root causes of the refugee crisis by advancing political solutions to conflict and inclusive socioeconomic development across Africa and Middle East.  Ireland has a proud track record in overseas development aid.  We had the highest <i>per-capita</i>contribution to overseas development in the world a few years ago.  It is a proud track record.  We can do more.  We can position ourselves in terms of conflict resolution because of the recent history in this State; we can be human rights defenders and we can be honest brokers.  We have a fantastic diplomatic service.  I have had the pleasure of seeing those in that service many times over the years.  We can play a key role here but I am happy with the response to date.  I have been disappointed historically but recently we have started to show a new direction and I hope we continue on that path.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100013#L00200"><p>I too welcome the motion and, even though I speak only for myself, because I am an Independent Deputy, I will be supporting it.  Unfortunately, our approach last winter was not quite so positive.  We argued about the cancellation of the Mare Nostrum programme and protested to the Europeans that it was not a good idea.  When programme was brought to an end, the refugees were never going to stop trying to come across the sea, they were just going to drown and that is what happened to many of them.  People were also drowning when the Mare Nostrum programme was working but it was, at least, a big help at the time.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that this is an incredible crisis.  On the issue of the refugees coming in, I support Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point about the importance of getting these people into a work situation as quickly as possible.  Surely, it would be rational to do this.  The manner in which we have dealt with that issue in the past has left too much to be desired.</p>  <p>  I still worry about this situation.  If we consider what has happened in the past 20 years, the statistics are frightening.</p><p>The militarisation of the planet has continued to increase, especially since 2001.  In the past five years, there has been a 16% increase in the proliferation of arms in comparison to the previous five years, a frightening development.  Of the 60 million people currently displaced, it is estimated 33 million of them are displaced because of war.<br/><br/>What will we do about this?  Ireland is a small country but I believe we can play a positive role in this regard.  Several weeks ago, Annette Groth, a member of the German Parliament who had been in Hungary watching the plight of the refugees there, told the German Parliament:</p><blockquote>Germany is the third biggest weapons exporter in Europe and has good relations with, for instance, Saudi Arabia and Qatar ... Our government is still delivering arms to Saudi Arabia which happens to be supporting ISIS, the jihadists.</blockquote><p>We all realise the whole Middle East region has gone crazy but we cannot stay silent on the reason for it.  The number of refugees will actually increase, not decrease, unless there is a serious examination of the root causes of it all.  For example, Deputy Mac Lochlainn made the point some countries are prepared to help more than others.  Two countries not prepared to take in refugees are Saudi Arabia and America, yet the part they are playing in the destruction of this region is unbelievable.  Yemen is being destroyed, with refugees being created every hour there, but no one has said a word about it.<br/><br/>Shannonwatch, through freedom of information requests, got the statistics on the planes coming through Shannon Airport last year.  There are planes going through the airport from America to Saudi Arabia with all kinds of arms and most likely cluster bombs, which are being used in Yemen.  We are allowing Shannon Airport to be used by the American Government and the arms industry to bring arms to the Middle East region to cause havoc.  Bombs are falling on innocent people's homes and they are being driven out of them but we are not stopping it.  It is great we sent two boats to the Mediterranean and it is to be commended that we are prepared to take in refugees but how can we continue to allow Shannon to be used for as a US military base?  If the Minister for Justice and Equality did nothing else for the rest of her time in government before the election, it would be wonderful if she took a positive decision on this issue, as it would mean so much.  We cannot possibly defend our facilitation with what is happening.<br/><br/>Those fleeing to Europe now are fleeing to countries which sold the arms that caused the havoc and displacement in the first place.  The Russians have now started to bomb Syria, making them as culpable as the Americans.  Bombs do not solve problems; they create them.  The French and British cannot wait to get in there more.  The region is a minefield now.  They have been training rebel groups to fight Bashar al-Assad.  While I would not defend Assad for one minute, the alternative is worse.  The ISIS crowd are flourishing because of what is happening.  It is crazy what they are like.  Bad as Assad is, his is one of the last multicultural governments in the region.  His biggest crime is that he is independent of America and Israel.  I accept he is guilty of many crimes against his own people over the past five years.  He should be tried for war crimes, the same as the likes of Blair, Bush and Obama for what they have been involved in.<br/><br/>I make no excuses for Assad or the Russians but Ireland has an opportunity to play a positive role.  We are an island, a small country, but it does not stop us from having a real and strong neutral voice for peace.  We cannot start talking about peace, however, while we continue to allow Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base.  That is the height of hypocrisy.  Up to 2.5 million US troops have gone through Shannon since 2001.  The amount of arms that we allow through with permits on civilian planes is astronomical.  We refuse to search military planes that land at the airport.  When people are in opposition, they say we should search the military planes in Shannon.  When they get into government, however, they say they have assurances from America that all is well.  All is not well.<br/><br/>Deputy Clare Daly and I had three days in court in Ennis recently.  Witnesses came forward who were working in Shannon to testify they saw arms on military planes which is illegal.  Still our Government does not want to look into this.  The judge accepted the bona fides of the testimonies of these individuals.  He ended up fining us in the end, which was irrational given his own arguments but that is a different issue.<br/><br/>Will we look at the Shannon issue and stop helping one country bomb another?  It would mean so much.  Can one imagine visiting people in the Middle East region and watching bombs falling on the houses beside them, looking to kill someone involved military activity but wiping out women and children?  Can one imagine sitting there knowing the bombs could have come through Shannon before they were dropped?  What does it say about us that we can tolerate this?<br/><br/>The manner in which the world operates has never been as disappointing.  The arms industry, along with the pharmaceutical industry, is one of the two largest industries in the world.  One cannot get elected President of America without the support of the arms industry.  It will cost Hillary Clinton $2 billion just to run for president, which is a lot of money.  One needs the arms industry&rsquo;s support to run for President of America in a serious manner.  The end result is payback.  Bombs have to be dropped on people to support the arms industry and keep it thriving.  We are complicit because we choose to turn a blind eye to Shannon Airport being used as a US military base.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.</p></speech>

Our only response to people fleeing from these desperate circumstances has to be support and compassion.  We should not, for one minute, allow anybody to encourage the idea these people represent a threat.  It dishonours our own history if we act with anything less than compassion and solidarity to refugees attempting to come to Europe or this country.</p><p>The ships we see trying to cross the Mediterranean to escape war and horror are the 21st century equivalent of the coffin ships which left this country when people fled the horrors of the Famine to seek safety, security and a life elsewhere.  If c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte romhat is to mean anything, it has to be brought to bear on this situation.  We must offer support and safety to people fleeing desperate circumstances.  The people of this country have demonstrated their willingness in this regard.  My office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has acted as a collection point for materials to be sent to Calais.  There was an amazing response.  I have never seen anything like it.  Our office was packed to the rafters with blankets, toiletries and clothes.  All the indications are that the people of this country recognise the desperate plight of the refugees and want to help and support them.  </p> <p> The response of the European Union has been slow and in some cases outrageous.  The attitude of the Hungarian Government is despicable but Europe as a whole has been slow to act.  It is engaging in a numbers game and playing both sides of the fence in the debate on refugees.  On the one hand, it speaks of the need for compassion but, on the other hand, it speaks of a need to strengthen border controls.  We do not need to strengthen border controls, we need to open them to as many people as need assistance and support.  To do less would be to dishonour our history.  Would we have wanted border controls and restrictions on the millions of people fleeing this country during the Famine?  Would we want them if, God forbid, anything like it were to happen to us again in the future?  I subscribe to the view that we do not need borders on frontiers at all.  There is one race, the human race, and our response should be to treat people as human beings and give them the support and backing they need. </p> <p> It is also important to say there is no connection whatsoever between an increased population and adversity.  If a small or reducing population was good, which is the other side of the argument, Ireland would have been the best place in the world in the 1950s and the 1980s when hundreds of thousands of people were leaving the country.  Did things get better when we had mass emigration?  Of course not, they got much worse.  People are not a burden.  It is people who generate wealth, provide services and make a society function.  We are a very underpopulated country and Europe has an ageing population.  Over the next 50 years or so, we need probably an extra 50 million people to sustain the European economy and its society.  People are not a burden or a threat.  If given the opportunity to thrive they become the world's greatest resource.  </p> <p> There are two things we must do beyond providing a humanitarian response.  If some people are worried because they are victims of things such as the housing crisis, poverty and deprivation, we must recognise they are right to be angry about those things.  They are wrong if they direct their anger at refugees but they are right to be angry about people living in tents and families stuck in homelessness, because none of it is necessary.  We have more than enough resources to resolve the housing crisis and provide housing for all, including the refugees coming here and the people on the streets, but we have failed to do it.  We have also failed to do it for the refugees who have arrived in this country to date.  The direct provision system is a matter of shame for this country.  This must be the catalyst for us to put resources into ensuring that everyone who needs a house, be they a refugee or an Irish citizen, gets it as a matter of right and that the shame of the direct provision system is ended.</p> <p> As stated by Deputy Wallace, we have to address the reasons this is happening.  To cut a very long story short, if we had not facilitated the United States and if the United States had not bombed Iraq, this would not be happening.  If the western world did not continue to arm Saudi Arabia with its despicable manipulations in that region, this would not be happening.  If we stop supporting dictators and despots across the Middle East and north Africa this would not happen.  Yet we continue to do it.  It must stop.  Our complicity with those despicable manipulations by the big powers in north Africa and the Middle East must end.</p></speech>

If we curtailed military expenditure and stopped boosting the arms industry, the type of programme necessary to alleviate this humanitarian crisis could be delivered.  We need something akin to the Marshall Plan delivered after the Second World War, if not more.  The reality is that we have a crisis the likes of which has not been seen since those times.  I am delighted we provided the naval ships and very happy with the role they played.  I am sorry they did not bring those people to Ireland sooner than now, given the role we played in rescuing them.  I am happy for us to take in any number of refugees here.  As Deputy Wallace said, we are culpable in this humanitarian disaster.</p>  <p>  In the limited time we have, it is more beneficial to deal with the reason for this crisis.  Like it or not, from the times of the colonial eras, Europeans sailed around the world, pillaging and conquering, and then came home to enjoy the spoils.  When those whose lives have been destroyed seek a better life and have to leave their countries, barriers are imposed .  The lucky ones are those who we have seen washed up on beaches or herded into trains in Hungary. </p>  <p>  The people who end up in Europe are a tiny fraction of Europe's population and a tiny fraction of the refugee crisis worldwide.  Almost 60 million have been displaced.  If they were a nation, they would be the 24th largest country in the world.  Where do these people go?  They go to the misnamed developing countries.  The poorest countries take 86% of the world's refugees.  The poorest of the poor give asylum to 25% of the world's refugees.  In relative terms, very small numbers of people end up on Europe's doorstep, yet we call it a European crisis.  It is a migrant crisis which Europe has played a part in sponsoring, not least through our facilitation of the US military machine.</p>  <p>  The countries from which the majority of these refugees come are countries which the West has gone into and destabilised.  Of these countries - Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen - some of them were poor countries and some of them are now utterly decimated.  Through the destruction of Libya, we see the growth of ISIS.  Colonel Gaddafi was traditionally one of the EU's favourite border policemen, given the deal with former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi to keep refugees out of Europe.  Everyone was happy as we did not have to see them.  Now with the disintegration of Libya, the issue is very much on Europe's doorstep.  We have to deal with issues such as the US bolstering and facilitation of the Saudi regimes.  Last year weapons were transferred through this country on their way to Saudi Arabia.  We had a proud record of championing against cluster bombs.  Are we going to find out that some of those cluster bombs which recently ended up killing children in Yemen passed through Shannon?  There is a good chance of it.  According to reports published this year, the US is now the world's top exporter of munitions.  Many of those munitions have been used against civilians.  Last year, 200 tonnes of weaponry passed through Shannon on the way to Afghanistan.</p><p>It is inevitable that some of this ended up in the hands of the Taliban and ISIS, as occurred in Iraq.  That came through Shannon.  This is a critical issue for us.  We are complicit in this.  Last year, there were 600 permissions for military aircraft, with 55,000 troops transiting through Shannon.  Most of them were on their way to the Middle East.  We have heard the words of the Americans, who thank Ireland for its steadfast support in permitting US military transits which back-stop US actions in the gulf region.  In other words, we are responsible too.</p> <p> I do not like some of the media coverage that has occurred and some of the spin whingeing about the so-called cost and problem of refugees and migrants.  Yes, it is a big problem, but we are partly responsible for creating it.  While we must respond in humanitarian terms, the best thing we could do is to stop making them refugees in the first place and stop facilitating the biggest war machine on this planet on a twice daily basis by landing military aircraft and transiting thousands of troops.  It is not good enough and is hypocrisy supreme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100016#O00200"><p>I thank Deputies for their support.  I note the unanimous support for the decisions the Government has taken in respect of the Irish refugee protection programme.  I also thank Deputies for their principled support for the relocation of 4,000 refugees to Ireland over the next two years in line with our opt-in at recent Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings.</p>  <p>  There were some thoughtful contributions on the range of issues that arise when one considers this humanitarian crisis and how it must be addressed.  I refer Members to the European action programme on migration, which is a comprehensive range of initiatives.  We are focusing today on the relocation but examination of the action programme on migration, which has been agreed by all member states, shows that it recognises the points a number of Deputies have made regarding the need to deal with the root causes of the migration crisis, the need to work with the countries of origin, the need to work with Turkey and the African states and the broader global and international issues relevant to the conflict zones which have led to the 30 million refugees in the world, as mentioned by Deputy Wallace.  Very serious national and international challenges must be dealt with.  I agree that Ireland can play a leadership role both at European and world level.  We have a very good track record of interventions and we have experience of ending conflict.  We intend to take as much of a lead role as possible in the coming months to deal effectively with this humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the conflict situation and the threat posed by ISIS, for example, are very real.  I welcome the solidarity in Europe in response to that threat.  Solidarity is necessary at world level to deal with the threat posed by ISIS, because it is so severe.  Thousands of young people from Europe are travelling to become foreign fighters.  When they return they pose real threats.  The radicalisation we see online must also be dealt with.  This is all part of the current picture and is worthy of a debate in its own right.  In fact, I recently met with the Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister to discuss both migration and the terrorism issue.  It is a real threat.  Bulgaria has 2 million people on its borders who could potentially enter the country.  They are refugees because of the Middle East crisis and the other areas of conflict we have been discussing.  These are challenging global issues, and the global response to date has not been good enough.  There must be more discussion at global level, be it between the Americans and Russians or at UN level.  Certainly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Taoiseach will be working on that in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  To return to the practical decisions regarding the refugees who will arrive here, we have set up the task force and there are a number of sub-committees dealing with the different areas that require action, such as identifying accommodation and examining the integration aspects for the children and families.  Obviously, the Department of Education and Skills has a role in that regard.  The Department of Health is involved in respect of the varying health needs, as the refugees will require a health assessment when they arrive and appropriate supports and help.  I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his suggestions on the various initiatives that should be undertaken.  We are working on a comprehensive plan and will publish the detail as soon as possible.  At this point, we have held the first meeting of the task force and everybody has been allocated their various jobs.  We will meet again shortly to review progress and to prepare for the first groups of refugees to arrive.</p>  <p>  We want the accommodation to be of the highest standard possible and we want the centres to be orientation centres for the Syrians.  We will involve the Syrians who are already here, who have formed a support group.  The big criticism of direct provision has been the length of time people have stayed in that system.  That is the key criticism.  I agree that improvements could have been made to the accommodation over the years, but the standard of accommodation, food and shelter should be seen in the context of the crisis of 10,000 asylum seekers arriving.  Direct provision dealt with that crisis but, of course, the number of appeals and the delays are a big problem.  That will be dealt with shortly.  Legislation will be introduced this month to ensure that the process can be completed in a speedier way.  That will make a key difference to the situation.</p>  <p>  However, we are proceeding with the plans.  Obviously, there will be a budget, and the budgets that are required will be part of the budgetary discussions.  I accept the point that it is not a question of either-or.  We must respond to the refugee crisis and we are doing that.  The Government has taken a principled and humanitarian decision.  I believe it was the right decision.  Equally, however, there are challenges for our citizens which we must continue to meet.  If the economy was not improving as it is at present, we would not have the money to invest in the range of services that are required both for our citizens and for the refugees who are arriving in this country.</p>  <p>  I again thank the Deputies for their support for the motion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100016#O01300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Bill will reform the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and the tax appeals system, and will ensure an enhanced and cost effective appeal mechanism for tax cases, providing transparency and increased certainty for taxpayers.  The Appeal Commissioners are responsible for carrying out the statutory duties assigned to them under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, TCA, and related legislation, principally the hearing of appeals by taxpayers against decisions of the Revenue Commissioners concerning taxes and duties. The commissioners hear appeals relating not only to income tax but also to corporation tax, value added tax or VAT, capital gains tax, stamp duties, capital acquisitions tax, customs and excise duties, vehicle registration tax and local property tax.  Most appeals relate to the amount of an appellant&rsquo;s tax liability.</p>  <p>  The Appeal Commissioners are independent in carrying out their functions, and I wish to acknowledge the valuable role that the commissioners play in the operation of a fair and efficient taxation system, and in particular the contributions, since their respective appointments in 1992, of the current Appeal Commissioners, Mr. John O&rsquo;Callaghan and Mr. Ronan Kelly.</p><p>The Irish tax appeal system has been examined over the years and the following reports or tribunals have made recommendations about the appeal commissioners in that time: the steering group on the Revenue Commissioners (2000); the D&aacute;il Committee of Public Accounts final report on the DIRT inquiry (2001); the Revenue powers group report (November 2003); the Law Reform Commission report on a fiscal prosecutor and a revenue court (2004); and the Commission on Taxation report (2009).<br/><br/>There have been proposals for changes to the appeals system from stakeholders, including the professional representative bodies, such as the Irish Tax Institute and the accountancy bodies.  Accordingly, it is timely to proceed with this reform process, which will ensure the continued provision of a cost-effective appeal mechanism for tax cases, enhanced transparency and increased certainty for taxpayers.<br/><br/>I announced in budget 2014 my intention to instigate a reform of the appeal system for tax matters, including a reform of the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, and the Bill I am introducing today is the culmination of a process which involved constructive dialogue with stakeholders on the oversight and operation of the tax appeals system towards a common objective of reform to enhance the system for all participants.<br/><br/>The reforms proposed will bring appeals through the initial stages in a more streamlined fashion, with enhanced case management procedures to facilitate a more efficient and structured flow of appeals.  The proposed reforms will end the practice of appeals being made via the Revenue Commissioners and will involve a significant change to the process for appeals by way of the &quot;case stated&quot; procedure for the High Court, and the removal of the Circuit Court rehearing stage of the appeal process.  Opportunities for redress also exist in certain circumstances by way of judicial review and appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.<br/><br/>In accordance with the agreed protocol for pre-legislative scrutiny by Oireachtas committees, the heads of Bill were sent to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which issued its report on 16 April last.  Following consideration of the report of the joint committee and concerns expressed by stakeholders prior to and during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, I decided to change the provisions in the heads of Bill regarding public hearings of tax appeal cases.  The heads of the Bill envisaged that hearings before the appeal commissioners, heretofore held privately or <i>in camera</i>, would in future he held in public session following enactment of the legislation.  While the default position will still be for public hearings, the Bill has been drafted to provide that where an appellant requests it, the hearing of his or her tax appeal will be held in private.  I consider that this provision will meet the concerns of the committee and stakeholders.  The committee considered that transparency, which had been one of the objectives of the original public hearings proposal, would be enhanced and clarity provided to taxpayers and the general public if all hearings were accompanied by written determinations, as is proposed.<br/><br/>The key elements of the Bill are as follows: the establishment and structure of the commission; the appointment and removal process for appeal commissioners; the terms and conditions of appeal commissioners; the provisions for staffing and funding of the commission and its accountability; a new Part 40A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, or TCA, providing for a wide range of amendments to the legislation governing appeals in regard to the various taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners; and a Schedule of consequential amendments to the various tax and duty Acts arising from reform measures and from the effect of the new Part 40A.  The main thrust of the reform is to strengthen the independence, and the perceived independence, of the appeal commissioners.  The measures to achieve this contained in the Bill include appropriate selection and appointment provisions involving the Public Appointments Service, fixed-term appointments, a clear statutory statement of independence, new funding and staffing arrangements and the making of appeals directly to the appeal commissioners, and not via Revenue, as currently happens.<br/><br/>The Bill is in five Parts and has two Schedules.  I will outline the provisions of Part 2 in some detail.  As the provisions of the subsequent sections are extensive and complex, I will give an overview of their essential components.  I look forward to detailed consideration of them on Committee Stage and later Stages, if the House sees fit to pass this Stage of the Bill.<br/><br/>Part 1 is preliminary and general.  It contains standard provisions comprising the Short Title and commencement provisions, together with interpretations and definitions for the Bill.<br/><br/>Part 2 deals with the tax appeals commission.  It contains provisions relating to the establishment of the tax appeals commission, its membership and functions and the appointment, terms and conditions of the individual appeal commissioners and their staff.  The more important of these provisions are described below.<br/><br/>Section 6 sets out the functions of the appeal commissioners in regard to the acceptance, refusal, adjudication and determination of appeals, the conduct of hearings, the provision and publication of determinations, the stating and signing of cases for the High Court and the establishment of efficient and effective systems and procedures for the processing of appeals.  The commissioners are required to conduct appeal proceedings in a way that is accessible and fair and as expeditious as possible.  The functions of the commissioners can be performed by any one of them acting individually, unless they have provided otherwise in their rules of procedure.<br/><br/>Section 8 deals with the appointment of appeal commissioners.  The Minister is required to have the Public Appointments Service assess and select candidates for appointment as a commissioner and to recommend suitable candidates to the Minister.  The Minister is given powers to specify requirements with which candidates must comply, such as practical experience or academic qualifications.  The Minister is permitted to appoint a serving commissioner for a second term, without recourse to the Public Appointments Service, where the commissioner&rsquo;s first term of office has expired.  A commissioner is precluded from serving for more than two consecutive seven-year terms.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides for temporary commissioners in cases where the full-time commissioners have recused themselves.  In such cases, the Minister can appoint a Circuit Court judge as a temporary commissioner.  The Minister can also appoint a person as a temporary commissioner in non-recusal situations where circumstances require such an appointment, for example, in a situation where there has been a significant increase in appeals and a temporary commissioner is required to help deal with it.<br/><br/>Section 10 establishes the independence of the tax appeals commission and its appeal commissioners in the performance of their functions.  Section 13 provides that the term of office of appeal commissioners will be seven years, with scope for the Minister for Finance to reappoint a commissioner for a second and final seven-year term.  Section 17 provides for the Minister&rsquo;s powers to remove commissioners from office for stated reasons, subject to the Minister laying a statement before the D&aacute;il giving the reasons for any such removal.<br/><br/>Section 18 provides for the cessation of a commissioner&rsquo;s tenure where she or he is adjudicated a bankrupt, makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, is convicted of an offence or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.  The section also provides for the cessation of a commissioner&rsquo;s tenure on his or her nomination or election to various public offices such as the Oireachtas, a local authority or the European Parliament.  Section 19 provides for the funding of the commission to be as determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 20 provides that staff numbers of the tax appeals commission are to be determined by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.<br/><br/>Section 21 requires the appeal commissioners to submit annual reports to the Minister for Finance, who will lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These reports are to contain specified statistical information in regard to appeals where this is required by the Minister or by any enactment.  The commissioners will also be able to report to the Minister on other matters as they consider appropriate.  The Minister may require the commissioners to report on various matters but this is subject to the commissioners not being required to include information on matters that would prejudice the performance of their functions.<br/><br/>Part 3 deals with transitional provisions.  It provides for the treatment of existing appeals when the new appeal process comes into operation.  It contains provisions relating to the arrangements for transitioning from the old appeal process to the new appeal process.  On the commencement date for the new appeal process, appeals will already have been made and will be at various stages of the old appeals process.<br/><br/>Many of the steps in the old appeals process will continue under the new process.  The general rule is that existing appeals will move on to the next analogous stage in the process.  Thus, for example, appeals that have already been made to Revenue will be transferred across to the appeal commissioners and the revised &quot;case stated&quot; procedure for appeals to the High Court will apply to appeal commissioners&rsquo; determinations made after the commencement date.  However, there are exceptions to this general rule, for example, a taxpayer whose appeal has been heard but not determined will still be entitled to a rehearing before a Circuit Court judge, should he or she lose the appeal.</p><p>There are also provisions to allow a different appeal commissioner to finalise an appeal in circumstances where the appeal commissioner who started the adjudication is unable, for example because of retirement, to finalise the appeal.</p> <p> Part 4 concerns the insertion into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 of a new Part 40A which deals with appeals to the appeal commissioners.  Part 40A contains provisions relating to the entire appeal process and to the appeal commissioner's conduct and management of that process, commencing with the making of appeals and their acceptance or refusal, progressing to adjudication, hearing, determination and publication of determinations and finishing with appeals to the courts against determinations of appeal commissioners.</p></speech>

Deputy Mick Wallace made serious allegations which the Taoiseach agreed were serious and should be taken seriously.  However, there has been deafening silence in terms of our ability to investigate these allegations and other aspects of the concerns around the purchase of the loan book in Northern Ireland.  This is a property portfolio valued at approximately &euro;1.6 billion and the integrity of the State is coming into question as allegations are being made on a continual basis.  There is no doubt there are huge competing interests in Northern Ireland, both at political level between political parties and between various property developers and others who have expressed interests in the local scene in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, this goes beyond Northern Ireland.  NAMA was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is the credibility and integrity of this House that is being brought into disrepute, because we are unable or unwilling to set up some form of investigation or to facilitate NAMA to co-operate with investigations in the North, in Belfast.  The idea that we will continue to allow drip-feed allegations to be made and go unanswered or go without investigation is not credible or tenable.  It does a disservice to NAMA, which acts as an agent of this State, and undermines that organisation's integrity.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that the allegations are serious enough to warrant investigation?  Second, should we not facilitate a proper, robust investigation?  This would mean allowing NAMA to appear before the inquiry in the North.  It has been said previously, and NAMA has said, that it is only answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but that is not good enough.  The issue goes beyond this State and is clearly important.  Stormont has set up a committee of investigation and the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice are also investigating the issue.  However, this country is doing nothing other than having the Committee of Public Accounts have a look at the matter.</p>  <p>  There is a lot at stake on this.  There are competing interests politically and in terms of property developers in Northern Ireland.  More importantly, the integrity of NAMA, which was established by this Parliament is being drawn into question.  We are obligated to ensure we do everything we can to ensure all allegations are investigated and the truth discovered.  We owe that to this Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100018#Q00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He has done so in a very helpful manner.  I do not believe there is anybody in the House who is not interested in hearing some of the responses to allegations that have been thrown around.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, is leading an all-party Committee of Public Accounts inquiry committee in regard to the position and that both Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA, and Chairman Frank Daly, have been speaking very frankly for an extended period to the members of the committee.  Those members are acting on behalf of the Oireachtas in pursuit of appropriate, straight and honest answers to questions that have been raised.</p>  <p>  We need to be very clear about what happened and what the mood in the country was at the time when NAMA was established.  The Labour Party did not support the establishment of NAMA.  We saw flaws in the set-up and expressed our reservations at the time.  Two underlining principles were put forward regarding the establishment of NAMA and as far as I am aware, all of the parties in the House at the time and the Independent Members agreed with them.  The first principle cuts to the heart of some of the current soreness, including of complaints we hear in this House.  This principle was that developers - this was the will of the people - would not be allowed to buy back their loans at heavily discounted prices through the back door.  Some people in this House who were themselves successful developers unfortunately lost out.  Everybody in the House was involved in the debate.  Deputy Michael McGrath was heavily involved in the discussions as a backbench contributor to the debates and the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister for Finance, led at the time for the Government.  Developers were not going to be offered a back door through which to buy back their loans.  </p>  <p>  The second principle, on which everybody in the House agreed, and I presume still agree, was that politicians would not be directly involved with NAMA.  This was for all the reasons we know, which I will not go into, in the history of the bubble and its development, of overly close connections between some political parties, developers and banks.</p><p>I am not going to go into that.  We have all seen the different reports, such as the Nyberg report.  Politicians were not going to be involved in the detailed line decisions on NAMA.  When NAMA was established, the Committee of Public Accounts was given an overriding authority on behalf of everybody here to be the investigating body to which NAMA could be properly and fully accountable.  I agree with the Deputy on this.  </p> <p> I have listed to Members in this House who are former developers.  I have great sympathy for some of the misfortunes that befell them.  I have heard them say, with great passion, that at the height of the bubble property values were, say, &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion and when the crash came, unfortunately those values often fell below a billion.  In fact, when I watched him on television for a short while this morning, I heard Mr. Daly say that in many cases, loan values fell by 50%.  In some cases, he said, the loan values fell to below 10%.</p> <p> What we are getting is a terrible regret on the part of developers that they did not get to buy their loans by the back door and a wish that the bubble values, which they want to keep in front of our eyes as the amounts that should have been realised and magicked up by NAMA, would actually represent what business would pay for them.  That, of course, has not happened.  We have had Deputy Wallace raise this time after time, as a man who has worked hard in development and produced good developments all his working life.  Of course he, like other developers, had a terrible fall in terms of his business.  We all sympathise with this, across the House.  However, the argument that people should be allowed to buy back their loans was a critical issue in the period around the establishment of NAMA and that is what is in the legislation.  I think it was Fianna F&aacute;il that sponsored this legislation.  That is why there has to be an arm's-length process of selling.</p></speech>

Those allegations compromise the integrity of the organisation which was to oversee the sales.  I am not saying that developers can buy back their property loans, or that politicians in the Republic are making representations to NAMA.  The legislation does not allow it to happen.</p></speech>

We need to be able to facilitate NAMA appearing in Belfast before the relevant committee in Stormont so that it can defend its integrity and stand over the sales process.  The integrity of the organisation should not be undermined.  If the sales process has gone through with probity, why would NAMA officials fear appearing before the Stormont investigation?</p>  <p>  There are many competing interests in the North that want to keep this going and keep undermining the process.  There is a lot to be gained on either side politically, and also in the context of developers.  We owe it to NAMA to facilitate its appearance before the committee so that it can vindicate and stand over the sales process. That is the core of the issue.</p>  <p>  A lot of nonsense has been expressed about the historical problems but NAMA has been established in this State for one purpose and that is to clean up the bad banking system and dispose of assets.  It is in all the primary legislation to which the T&aacute;naiste referred.  Purchasing loans back is illegal and cannot be done.  It is wrong.  The prohibitions on politicians making representations is also in the legislation.  This has nothing to do with the core issue, which is that allegations were made by Deputies in this House and elsewhere that bungs were paid to facilitate the purchase of loan books from NAMA.</p></speech>

The point is that we made a decision collectively, for good or for bad, as a Parliament.  I think it was for the good - I supported the late Mr. Brian Lenihan in his position - that politicians should be removed from the process.  Otherwise, every little developer and every big developer in the country could be involved.  I was a member of the old Dublin County Council where the developers used to pull my sleeve as I was walking along saying, "Joan, would you like to come to breakfast, dinner or tea and could you have a look at a bit of land that I have a proposition on".

Residents of such complexes have been exploited by Fianna F&aacute;il developers, like Bernard McNamara and others, in the past.  These are the same individuals who collapsed regeneration projects right across the city.  The individual in question slithered off to England to escape from bankruptcy in Ireland.  He is now back building in the city.  He is the rebuilder of the former Canada House in St. Stephen's Green, which he is building on behalf of Denis O'Brien.  There is the golden circle.  Once again, the Government is facilitating that by not introducing proper legislation.  It is interesting that Canada House may be the future headquarters of Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Why has the Government not acted on the systematic failure of government and local authorities to follow up on reports that some of the complexes in this city and elsewhere throughout the country are too dangerous to live in?  Why has no legislation been produced to address the problems with those buildings and help the victims?  It is not just a question of Priory Hall as there are many similar buildings throughout the country.  Another of which I am aware is Riverwalk Court in Ratoath.  In Newbridge, six houses burnt down.  The local authority identified that 90 houses had the same flaw, yet the onus is on the residents to fix it.  In Gallery Quay, some of the residents have been forced out but, a year and a half later, there is still no move to do the remediation work required. </p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree the public, property owners, tenants and residents need a proper audit of all the properties built during the boom, particularly the docklands developments, but also others throughout the country, to ensure they are given a clean bill of health?</p></speech>

I can imagine how worrying it is for people who have bought apartments there and who took out mortgages over a long period.  Dublin Fire Brigade, in seeking to ensure there are proper fire regulations in respect of those apartments and every other set of apartments, is performing a very important public service on behalf of the citizens of Dublin, and particularly on behalf of the residents living in and paying mortgages on the apartments in question.</p>  <p>  As this development was initially within the remit of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, and as that authority is in the process of moving over to the local authority, which is Dublin City Council, there is plenty of scope to ensure the relevant work is done.  I would like to see it done as quickly as possible.  I know people living in the complex, as I am sure does the Deputy.  Some people became residents through shared-ownership schemes while some bought on the open market.  Therefore, we are talking about a huge investment by people in their own lives and the lives of their families in order to obtain good quality accommodation.  I am familiar with the outside of the apartments.  They are in a very nice location near the River Liffey.  They appear to have serious issues concerning fire safety.  There is enormous scope for Dublin City Council and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which is moving under the remit of Dublin City Council, to address the really important issue of fire safety with the fire brigade as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  There was a similar set of circumstances with Priory Hall, as mentioned by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The developer's political movement affiliations were well known.  That case was resolved through a process of mediation which was incredibly difficult for the residents and took far too long.  I hope we have all learned from what happened there and that we can now have a resolution of a more attractive nature.</p>  <p>  The fire brigade worked very closely with the Dublin City Council authorities to address what I understand must be enormous fears among families with children and individuals over the fundamentals of fire safety in the apartments in question.  I have spoken to a number of residents and various politicians who represent those in the area and believe that with goodwill from Dublin City Council, which is taking over Dublin Docklands Development Authority, this issue can be resolved and the safety of the residents ensured.  We can actually deal with the matter in the here and now.</p></speech>

Why does the Government not take the initiative?  This case is but one in the media at present.  There are several.  I do not want to repeat the long drawn-out saga concerning Priory Hall or the many other developments, not all of which had fire safety problems but which were substandard in other ways.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that there is a need for legislation to ensure surveyors, architects, planners and, in particular, developers can be held to account over their failures?  What is the role of HomeBond?  Has the T&aacute;naiste any intention of replacing it?  Does she intend to underpin future builds with something similar?  Can she ensure that every single build in the country, not just in this city, will comply fully with fire regulations?  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Dublin City Council but this is not just a Dublin City Council problem.  That is the council identified today by me but some of the affected units are in County Meath and in Newbridge.  Will the Government commit to ensuring local authorities have the funding to employ additional planning enforcers and inspectors so they can go on-site at various stages during a build to ensure shortcuts are not taken?  </p>  <p>  Can the T&aacute;naiste ensure money is set aside for residents, such as the woman who wrote to me who has bought an affordable home in the complex under discussion?  She said she bought it in good faith in 2008 under the affordable housing schemes under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  She claims she is caught up in a mess left by Bernard McNamara, who left the building an unsafe fire-trap.  She now has to pay &euro;10,000 for his mistakes.  In fact, it may be more.  According to the woman, she does not have the money and will not be paying it.  She states the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government failed to deliver a correctly specified building because of the failures of its building control legislation and monitoring.  The key is to ensure this does not happen in the future.  There is a need to deliver immediately for the people living in the building, so they will have peace of mind if they are to be forced to continue to live in a home that is unsuitable and dangerous.</p></speech>

To be perfectly honest, I think Dublin City Council might have been better rewarded by dealing with the issue, albeit a planning infringement, by concentrating its resources on some of the issues that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has highlighted.  That is a personal view but perhaps that is something Dublin City Council should actually address.</p>  <p>  As regards what is happening to the families who have entered into a whole series of different mortgage arrangements, it is a beautiful development.  I do not know if the Deputy has been down there but it is right on the fringes of the River Liffey and externally it certainly looks wonderful.  Those families have invested their hopes and dreams in it, but it has been found to be a fire hazard by Dublin Fire Brigade.  Let me be clear that the fire brigade has a wonderful record of service to this city and the surrounding county.</p>  <p>  What is necessary in this case is for Dublin City Council to step up to the table and work with the fire authority to address the issues which are really serious.  The docklands authority was the original developer and, by the way, has had many fine developments in that area.  It revived and recreated a whole area of Dublin with many offices, a lot of housing and much employment for Dubliners and others who have come to live and work in the capital.  That is now in the process of transferral to Dublin City Council.  These are the organisations that have the competency to deal with this matter.</p>  <p>  If Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh would like to see further legislation, as he has suggested, the Government will examine any recommendations he may bring forward.  However, the immediate issue is to take the fear away from the families living there with their small children.  If there are serious fire risks, it is a matter for Dublin Fire Brigade which for many decades has been protecting all of those living in Dublin.  I trust implicitly what the fire officers are saying and I think the solution is there, rather than long-fingering through D&aacute;il legislation.  We have to bring together the city council and the docklands authority, which is moving into the city council.  This is in the hands of the city council, which should take action as a responsible city authority working with the fire brigade to solve this problem.  Everybody living in Dublin admires the fire service so much.  I have no objection to more legislation but I do not believe it is needed to address the problems that those families have now.</p></speech>

Some 3 million people are members of credit unions which have &euro;16 billion in assets.  At the moment, they are willing to invest &euro;9 billion if the Government is willing to listen to them.  The banks have left most of the smaller towns around the country.  They are either going to county towns or larger cities.  Meanwhile, small businesses and working people are moving towards the credit union as their new bank because it is local.</p>  <p>  As the Minister for Finance is sitting beside the T&aacute;naiste, I wish to refer to regulation CP88.  People involved in credit unions are afraid that if this regulation is signed into effect it will be the death knell for credit unions.  The credit unions, that did not need to be bailed out to the tune of &euro;65 billion and are not talked about in here every day like NAMA, seem currently to be getting a slap on the hand for being the best student in the class.  </p>  <p>  According to those running the credit unions, regulation CP88 is restricting the amount of money that people can have in them.  Small and medium enterprises, as well as individuals, wish to become involved in credit unions rather than banks, but they are being restricted.  Services such as debit cards and direct debits should be facilitated by the credit union sector due to the lack of banks in some areas.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the two other Ministers - the club of four who are allegedly running this country - to have a complete review of regulation CP88.  They should work with the credit unions to ensure that this facility is given to people across the country.  Credit unions deserve to have such a review undertaken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100021#T00600"><p>First, I have to declare an interest as, like most people here, I am a credit union member and have been over a long period.  I basically agree with the Deputy that credit unions are incredibly important to people across the length and breadth of this country.  They provide a mechanism for friendly financial services that people respect and enjoy.  In addition, we have specialist credit unions for teachers and civil servants, which are part of a financial powerhouse in this country.</p>  <p>  For my part as T&aacute;naiste, I can say that the Government is absolutely committed to having credit union movements in place.  There are a number of different umbrella organisations which offer people a safe and affordable way of saving money or borrowing when the necessity arises.  I think there is cross-party agreement in the House on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred specifically to regulation CP88.  My understanding is that it is about the level of deposits that credit unions can take from members.  This issue has already been addressed and, in fact, it is in the process of being worked out and refined.  The critical point is to allow members to have savings above a certain threshold and, in effect, to increase the threshold.  That is actually in train at the moment.</p>  <p>  The credit union movement provides a fantastic financial service to people, including families, up and down the country.  My Government colleagues and I are absolutely committed to ensuring that it will continue to do so.  In the context of the financial crash, however, we all know that unfortunately issues arose for some credit unions.  Through the fund established by the Minister for Finance, those issues are well on the way to being resolved for credit unions that encountered difficulties.  However, there has also been a learning process from that whereby we need robust, but not disempowering, legislation.  Such legislation would protect the ordinary man's and woman's savings, as well as providing the basis for lines of credit that many people have to avail of at different times in their lives.</p><p>I include myself in that and I am sure the Deputy is probably included as well.  Small businesses have also availed of them from time to time.  However, certain things went wrong for a small number of credit unions when the boom was at its height.  Those issues are well on their way to being resolved by the regulation system, which helps everybody, including probably the majority of Members in this House and even the members of the press who are present, to have confidence and security when they bank with their local credit unions and use their financial services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1198" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100022#U00200"><p>There was a guidance note with CP88 which stated that credit unions would not be allowed to pool resources.  They have &euro;9 billion, be it for investment social housing to help our country and its people or something else, and they are willing to talk to Government about releasing that money and getting interest on it to remain viable.</p>  <p>  Clearing houses are robbing credit unions.  AIB is owned by us.  If credit unions want to use the clearing houses, the prices they are being quoted are astronomical.  I have talked to representatives from the credit unions in Boyle, Roscommon, Ballinasloe and Tuam and I have looked at Glenamaddy.  A total of &euro;2 million has been put into a small community and this has created jobs.  It is fine talking about it here and saying we all support them.  Yes, everyone supports them but one must create an environment where direct debits can be facilitated, where one can have a debit card and where one can have more banking services.  If we want to have a vision for areas outside the Pale - a vision for reviving rural parts of Ireland - the credit unions and the post offices will be the new banking sector there for the simple reason that once the banks got the &euro;65 billion, they absconded from smaller towns.  I emphasise that we need those facilities and I ask the Minister for Finance to consider that and drive it forward for whatever period the Government remains in office because it is crucial for the revival of rural areas.  It is also crucial that credit unions are not left to stagnate because this is what will happen.  At present, it appears that other than what they lend out, the remainder of their &euro;16 billion in assets is left as liquidity at the rotten price the banks give in interest.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give an undertaking to the effect that she will ensure this facility is given to the credit unions, not for their sake but for that of the people throughout this country who will be deprived of a banking sector if it is not given to them.</p></speech>

It is the friendliness, approachability and quality of personal service that is available from credit unions that is extremely attractive to people who put their savings into credit unions and using their services, not just in rural areas but also in inner-city communities and new communities around cities.  My Department has arrangements with credit unions in a number of instances, particularly through the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service and the Citizens Information Board, by means of which we help people who may not have a particular credit record to work to become a customer of their local credit union and, ultimately, build up credit capacity, which can be very useful to them.  All of the parties in this House have no difficulty in agreeing with that.</p>  <p>  In respect of the proposal of the credit unions that they have access to a mechanism for using the funds of their members to invest directly with Government, I assure the Deputy that if the credit union movement - or any of the organisations involved with it - comes forward with a proposal, it will be very seriously examined by Government.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the banks.  He is correct in stating that banks have moved away from having direct physical branch presences in inner cities, areas with local authority housing and rural areas because of the crash and the change in the way they work.  I would be the first to acknowledge that the credit unions provide a vital personalised service relating to financial matters.  It is an absolute priority for the Government that this should continue to be facilitated.  If the credit unions have proposals they would like to see developed, particularly in respect of the issues raised by the Deputy - such as the size of deposits and the purpose for which credit union funds might be lent to Government - we would be very happy to receive them.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say that the difficulties which beset a relatively small number of credit unions in the context of the overall banking crisis are well on their way to being resolved.  We are at a point where we have a credit union movement which, even in international terms, is very well regulated so people who want to use it can be very confident that their savings will be very carefully guarded.  If there are proposals for expansion, I can say on behalf of the Government that we will be very happy to hear about them from the credit union movement.</p></speech>

In that context we should have enough time to talk about the real issue that is at the heart of Irish society at present, which is homelessness and the housing crisis in general.  It is always politicised as was seen this morning with more one-upmanship on dealing with an issue that is now at crisis point.</p>  <p>  Let us be under no illusions; it is a legacy on the Government parties' behalf.  They came into government claiming that there were too many houses in the country and they are leaving government with a shortage of houses.  We are now putting people into emergency portakabins.  By any stretch of the imagination the homelessness issue has been an unmitigated failure on the Government's behalf to address what was always going to be an issue.  People do not stop growing up, having children, growing older or forming different house formations.  All of that was politely ignored by the Government for the past four and a half years.

However, the legislation is stuck on Second Stage.  If she believes that is the mechanism by which the Government will address the needs of those who are in Longboat Quay, will the Government accelerate that so that Dublin City Council, with hopefully the support of Government and legislation, can take charge and do what the T&aacute;naiste is suggesting?  It is not the full answer.</p>  <p>  I ask about the Convention on the Constitution.  On a number of occasions I have asked for debates on the outstanding reports from the convention which I have repeatedly praised as a having been a good experiment in participatory democracy.

We have no difficulty in putting on additional time and particularly utilising Fridays and Mondays to address any of the outstanding recommendations that the Deputy feels would benefit from more detailed discussion and debate in here.  We can provide a lot of time for that and I am sure many Deputies would be anxious to avail of the time to debate that in detail in here.</p>  <p>  I understand the Dublin Docklands legislation will be in next week.</p>  <p>  If, as a Whip, the Deputy discusses having a debate on refugees with his fellow Whips, the Government would certainly be happy to facilitate that.  We have agreed in discussions with the European Union to accept a number of refugees under the European programme particularly from war-torn countries such as Syria.  If there is agreement among the Whips on that issue, we would be happy to do it.  As the Deputy knows, a number of people are already coming in and there is considerable co-ordination between the different agencies, including the Red Cross, which will provide services.  The last time we had a significant number of programme refugees coming in, it was as a result of the conflict in Bosnia.  So we have considerable experience collectively as a society of addressing these very important and significant humanitarian issues of rescuing people from what has been happening in the dreadful conflict in Syria.</p></speech>

She praised its wonderful record and said she trusts what the fire officers say, and so say all of us for all of our emergency services.  A number of years ago we tabled a Bill on the protection of emergency workers, which would have applied to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all other emergency workers.  I raise the issue in light of the increased number of attacks on members of the Garda in recent weeks and months.  The Bill was voted down by the Government pending legislation to be introduced by it.  That was in 2012 and it is now 2015.

Speaking for my Department, when I became Minister for Social Protection there were a number of urgent issues relating to the social welfare status of retained firefighters around the country.  As Minister, I gave priority to addressing the issue.  We addressed it as a government as speedily as we could.  It had been an outstanding issue for a very long period.  Once again, I express my thanks to all the people who work in the fire services around the country.  I agree with Deputy Calleary.  We have worked as a government, and I have worked as Minister for Social Protection, to ensure in particular that members of the retained services in areas outside of the big cities, whose issues were outstanding for a long time, were addressed by me.</p></speech>

For the past two years; individuals and families were allocated to them from the housing lists, only to be stopped at the last minute due to fire safety concerns.  NAMA and the receiver are in control of the apartments.  The T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers have indicated that NAMA will play a bigger role in the delivery of social housing.  With that in mind, does the Government intend to bring forward legislation to transfer properties and land from NAMA to local authorities?  There is no accountability with NAMA and if the Government were to consider that angle it would deliver a real social dividend.</p></speech>

If convicted he will be sentenced to death.  Will the Government agree to set time aside to discuss the case?  Deputy Pat Breen, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, was recently in Egypt on a visit to Ibrahim Halawa, as was Lynn Boylan, MEP.  The conditions in which he is being kept in prison are horrific.  He is sleeping on a mat.  He is supposed to get an hour for family visits but sometimes family members only get four to five minutes.  He is an Irish citizen and comes from Firhouse.  Aside from having a discussion in this House, could we agree at some stage to provide solidarity to Ibrahim and his family, in particular as they face this weekend?</p></speech>

As Deputy Crowe is aware, the difficulty has been that there have been constant delays and adjournments of the court proceedings.  The Government's objective in the case of Ibrahim Halawa is to see him released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland.  We are very conscious of the fact that he is a young man who has spent a lot of time in the Egyptian legal system.  Our ambassador in Egypt and our consular staff provide constant consular support for his welfare.</p></speech>

At the time I sent the information to the Committee of Public Accounts for review and for the committee to investigate the matter further.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who is sitting beside the T&aacute;naiste will be aware that recently the <i>Limerick Leader</i>reported on similar allegations being made by other whistleblowers, former employees of the University of Limerick.</p><p>A number of issues arise.  First, there appears to be a conflict between the protected disclosures legislation and confidentiality agreements which the University of Limerick has with some former employees who are now whistleblowers.  The University of Limerick has now issued High Court proceedings against the <i>Limerick Leader </i>and also personally against the editor of the newspaper, Mr. Alan English.  That is a very serious development because a State-funded university is using State funding to issue proceedings to gag the media, as I perceive it, on a serious issue of public interest.</p><p>I have spoken to a number of the whistleblowers and I am aware of the allegations.  It is an issue which merits proper discussion, scrutiny and investigation in this House.  A proposal has been made to introduce the university (amendment) Bill.  There is now a conflict between the protected disclosures legislation and confidentiality agreements.  We must find out in the public interest whether there is a serious issue at stake, as many allege.  One could say that given that so many whistleblowers have come forward to the <i>Limerick Leader</i>they cannot all be wrong.  The issue merits serious scrutiny either through the Higher Education Authority, the Garda or whatever other appropriate agency.  I would welcome a comment on the matter.</p></speech>

I  do not wish to comment on any court proceedings as obviously they are a matter for the court.  I have been in the University of Limerick many times and know many people who work work and many people who have studied there.  As a representative of Limerick and the region, it is important the Deputy acknowledges it is a fine university.  If there are issues to be addressed of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, ultimately, it is for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Were the Deputy to approach the Chairman of that committee and explain the urgency of the matter he has raised, the Chairman might be able to facilitate him.</p></speech>

More needs to be done to protect members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the line of duty.  The statistics relating to the ramming of Garda vehicle are shocking.  There were 244 such instances between 2010 and 2013, which equates to more than one a week.  The problem is that ramming a Garda vehicle is not a criminal offence and the Bill aims to make ramming a vehicle deliberately a specific crime.  I very much welcome the investment of &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 and a further commitment to invest &euro;46 million in same over the next five years.  This will be a major step forward but the maximum protection the State can offer to garda&iacute; in these vehicles would complement that investment.  I also welcome the &euro;1.75 million that was recently allocated for increased surveillance by the Garda air units, in particular.  However, on the ground, many garda&iacute; find that when they give chase to suspects, very often the suspects will not think twice about ramming their vehicle.  Unfortunately, there have been cases in the past where garda&iacute; have lost their lives or have been seriously injured in this manner.  A deterrent is needed to prevent the ramming of their vehicles.  My Bill proposes a custodial sentence of up to ten years for the deliberate ramming of a Garda car or a vehicle being operated by a garda in the course of his or her duties.</p><p>I hope the Bill will be taken seriously by the Minister for Justice and Equality and her Department.  I hope it can be progressed or incorporated into future legislation in the interest of protecting members of the Garda.  The figures for the ramming of Garda vehicles are shocking at more than one a week.  That is not good enough and, as a society, we cannot tolerate this.  The scumbags who perpetrate this on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be left in no doubt as to the seriousness of their actions and of the ramifications of such actions.  The State needs to respond to this problem.</p><p>In the context of rural crime, if we are to give the Garda the best opportunity to target criminals, we need to balance the scales and give the force more of an opportunity to carry out its work in a safer manner.  There is an opportunity to make it safer for garda&iacute; by introducing this deterrent.  I hope the Bill will be progressed urgently.</p></speech>

Among other things, it facilitates a more active case management approach by the Appeal Commissioners.  In straightforward cases, they will not be required to hold a hearing but can adjudicate and determine the appeal based on paper submissions, subject to the agreement of the taxpayer to this approach.  The Appeal Commissioners will be able to dismiss appeals where the taxpayer does not co-operate with them by, for example, providing information such as accounts requested by them.  Responsibility for the preparation of a "case stated" for an appeal to the High Court, subject to a time limit, is being given to the Appeal Commissioners themselves instead of the parties to the appeal.  Increased transparency and certainty will result from the requirement that all Appeal Commissioners' determinations must be published.</p>  <p>  Part 40A contains provisions relating to whether a hearing, or part of a hearing, is to be held in public or in private.  The default position is that all hearings are to be held in public, subject to exceptions relating to, for example, issues involving public order or sensitive issues.  However, the Appeal Commissioners must hold a private hearing, or a part-private hearing, where an appellant submits a request for this.</p>  <p>  Part 5 deals with consequential amendments to the Act of 1997 and certain other enactments.  The Part contains amendments to 137 separate sections and Schedules in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A consequence of the changes being made to the appeal process is the need to make a large number of consequential amendments to provisions relating to appeals in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and in various other taxation Acts contained in Schedule 2.  While there are a large number of individual amendments, given they are being made in relation to several different types of taxes and affect a wide range of provisions, most of these are of a similar nature.  For this reason, each individual amendment is not explained.  The most common amendment is that necessitated by the fact that, under the reformed system, a taxpayer will have to appeal directly to the Appeal Commissioners and not via Revenue as currently happens.  Various cross-references that are no longer relevant are being removed -  for example, references to Part 40 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which is being phased out and replaced with the new Part 40A.</p>  <p>  Another type of amendment will clarify and make more explicit a right of appeal that is currently only implicitly stated in the various tax and duty Acts.  A valid appeal under the revised appeal process will require a specific right of appeal to be given in the relevant tax and duty Act.  The opportunity presented by the reform of the appeal process is being taken to rectify any anomalies and inconsistencies that currently exist and to standardise as far as possible the appeal provisions for the various taxes and duties.  One example of such standardisation relates to the number of days allowed for the making of an appeal; 30 days is the usual time limit but this has not been standard across all of the taxes and duties.  Another example is the alignment of the preconditions for the making of an appeal against different types of Revenue assessments - for example, the requirement to have submitted outstanding returns to Revenue and to have paid the part of the tax liability not in dispute before an appeal can be made.</p>  <p>  The Appeal Commissioners are a body with a long lineage, predating the foundation of the State - in fact, dating back to the Act of Excise 1662.  The Minister for Finance appoints Appeal Commissioners by virtue of section 850 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Effectively, the Minister has had discretion as to who was appointed and on what terms, subject only to laying details of the appointment before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill proposes to change this by stipulating that appointments will be made by the Minister following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  A recruitment process for new Appeal Commissioners has been conducted by the PAS at my request as the current commissioners have reached retirement age.  This competition was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and I expect to make appointments over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Appeal Commissioners role is to act as an independent administrative tribunal in adjudicating disputes between taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation will enhance the independence of the Appeal Commissioners, increase transparency and provide a more efficient appeal system in tax disputes to the benefit of compliant taxpayers and the Exchequer alike.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100027#Z00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this important Bill.  While I would take issue with some aspects of it, I  welcome the fact that the system of tax appeals is to be reformed and modernised.  There is no doubt that a comprehensive and fair tax appeals system is required.  Figures released to me by the Minister for Finance earlier this year showed that 26% of tax appeals in 2012 and 2013 were decided in favour of the taxpayer, showing that the Revenue does get it wrong sometimes.  The current system is beset by unforgivable delays.  These are unacceptable from the perspective of individual taxpayers who seek an independent appeal of Revenue decisions but they also tie up hundreds of millions of euro of revenue for the State pending a determination by the appeal commissioners.  The Department of Finance confirmed to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that, as of last January, Revenue estimated that &euro;770 million was in question where assessments had been raised but collection could not proceed pending resolution of the disputed issues.  At any time, the total amount of tax that is in dispute is in excess of &euro;1 billion when account is taken of tax not yet assessed pending the outcome of some other case which is under appeal, as well as claims to repayment which are disputed by Revenue.</p><p>The level of delay is astonishing.  In the case of almost 600 appeals, more than five years have elapsed since the appeal was lodged, with almost 30 of these cases under appeal for more than ten years.  The joint committee was told of one incredible case involving a transaction which took place in 1991.  It is almost beyond belief that, under the current system, it took until 2011 before this case was resolved.  The case in question was eventually concluded in the Supreme Court after 20 years of working its way through the various stages of the appeal process.  While that may be an extreme example, it highlights the flaws in the existing system.  Clarity in regard to tax law is essential in a modern economy.</p><p>The Deloitte European tax survey published in 2013 sought the opinions of the heads of taxation of 1,000 companies across Europe and respondents were asked what changes to tax legislation would have the greatest positive effect on their country&rsquo;s competitiveness.  Simplification of the tax system was the preferred option of 36% of respondents.  It is interesting, however, that the most popular measure, which attracted the support of 44% of respondents, was increasing certainty about the future of the tax system.  In the context of competitiveness, certainty and simplification of the system were even more important to these respondents than a reduction in tax rates.</p><p>It is, therefore, very welcome that this legislation will require an appeal commissioner to publish on the Internet a written determination for each case within 90 days, rather than just announcing the decision in private to the parties concerned.  This is essential in bringing certainty to the tax system, as businesses will no longer be obliged to speculate on how tax law is being applied once one appeal on a particular question has been determined by the appeal commissioners as a test case.  This will also have the added benefit of potentially reducing both the workload of the appeal commissioners and ensuing backlogs.  This is because the publication of a written determination in one test case might save dozens of other appellants from having to lodge appeals of their own to revisit issues that have already been decided by the appeal commissioners, unbeknownst to them and the public at large.  Putting the principles involved in certain determinations on the public record will make the system far more efficient and prevent a number of appeals.</p><p>Publishing determinations also increases fairness in the appeals process.  If determinations are given orally by an appeal commissioner, but no determination is made available to the public, the Revenue Commissioners have the considerable advantage of knowing about that case as a precedent but taxpayers in other cases have no way of knowing about precedents which might be detrimental to Revenue&rsquo;s side of their individual case.</p><p>One development which I greatly welcome is the decision of the Government to adapt the legislation to reflect the arguments I and many others raised at the joint committee in relation to the original proposal that tax appeals would be heard in public in all cases.  While the facts of all cases should be set out in the written determinations of the appeal commissioners, identifying the individual taxpayers in question in all cases would have added nothing to the process.  It is very positive that the version of the Bill that before us allows an appellant to have his or her case dealt with <i>in camera</i>if he or she so requests.</p><p>The initial proposal to allow the public and media attend tax appeals would have forced taxpayers to divulge their most sensitive and private tax and financial information in a public forum.  This simply would have been a deterrent to many people submitting appeals.  For a great number of taxpayers, it would have been too high a price to pay for making a tax appeal and many would have been forced to choose not to appeal a decision of the Revenue Commissioners in order to protect their privacy.  This would be particularly unfair in circumstances where over a quarter of cases are decided in favour of the taxpayer.</p><p>My main concern about the current version of the Bill is that appeals to the Circuit Court would no longer be available.  I strongly favour an amendment to the Bill which would reintroduce the Circuit Court appeal route.  As matters stand, a taxpayer may appeal a finding of the appeal commissioners to the Circuit Court.  This takes place as a full rehearing of the appeal before a judge of the Circuit Court.  As an alternative, an appeal on a point of law may be taken to the High Court.  Instead of dealing with a full rehearsal of the facts of the case, an appeal on a point of law is a very specific form of appeal, limited just to consideration of a purely legal question.  The Bill removes the appeal to the Circuit Court and only allows the second form of appeal, an appeal on a point of law to the expensive forum of the High Court, and, as we all know, taking a case to the High Court can often cost &euro;100,000 or more.  No rehearing would be available on factual issues and only a purely legal question could be dealt with.</p><p>It is not open to the Government to claim that a right of appeal still exists under the Bill in circumstances where only one subset of cases could be appealed.  In reality, there is no appeal if the decision relates to factual or practical matters rather than to the interpretation of legislation.  This gives an extraordinary level of power to the appeal commissioners, who will be able to decide any factual issues without an avenue of appeal being available to a dissatisfied taxpayer.  In removing any appeal from many decisions of the appeal commissioners, the Oireachtas might place itself in difficult constitutional territory.  Our constitution only permits justice to be administered by the courts, allowing only limited functions and powers of a judicial nature to be given by law to non-judicial bodies.  I would have grave reservations as to whether the appeal commissioners could be regarded as having only limited powers of a judicial nature if they can decide on factual questions in a multi-million euro tax case, with no option to appeal to the courts available.</p><p>Two concerns that exist with the current provisions on appeals to the Circuit Court are the absence of specialist judges with expert tax knowledge and the considerable delays that exist in some Circuit Court areas.  One suggestion that may resolve these issues would be that a small number of dedicated Circuit Court judges could take responsibility for hearing tax cases locally throughout the country, with the benefit of strong case management powers and separate tax appeal lists to eliminate delays.  I remain to be convinced, however, that Circuit Court judges who deal with complex legal and factual issues on a daily basis are not eminently qualified to deal with appeals on taxation matters.  While the appeal commissioners may constitute an expert tribunal on technical taxation matters, the Circuit Court is even more of an expert tribunal in determining factual disputes and deciding cases on the merits.  Further, the evidence given to the joint committee during pre-legislative scrutiny was that Circuit Court judges have ample experience to deal with the sort of matters they would face in these appeals.</p><p>I am also uncomfortable with the attitude that has been taken to delays in the Circuit Court.  Delays have been used as an excuse to get rid of the Circuit Court process altogether.  However, the Government should have set itself the task of designing case management procedures and other structures to eliminate delays, rather than just scrapping Circuit Court appeals altogether.</p><p>The numbers of cases appealed to the Circuit Court is so small that there should be no reason such appeals could not be dealt with in a speedy manner.  The joint committee was told that only 14 cases were appealed to the Circuit Court in 2013.  Some of those cases were also settled between the taxpayer and the Revenue without a hearing being necessary.  In the five years from 2010 to 2014, the number of cases actually adjudicated by the Circuit Court appears to be a total of only 46.  In such circumstances, there is simply no reason the Circuit Court process should not be capable of being dealt with efficiently and fairly in a short period.  In the final analysis, such a small number of cases can hardly make a significant impact from the perspective of the enormous number of taxpayers dealt with by the Revenue every year.  However, from the perspective of those individual appellants who have accessed an appeal in the Circuit Court, the importance of that route of appeal could be enormous.  It could be the difference, for example, between a small business providing jobs locally either surviving or not.</p><p>While many cases have been decided by the Circuit Court in favour of Revenue, some have been decided in favour of the taxpayer.  It seems unjust to deny those taxpayers a full appeal on the merits to the Circuit Court.  In any event, the argument the current Bill would reduce delays in court appeals does not stand up to scrutiny when we look at the evidence given by the Revenue Commissioners to the joint committee.  That evidence was that a hearing in the High Court could take a minimum of two years to take place.  It is difficult to imagine why the issue of court delays could be used to justify forcing appeals into the High Court if delays are so long in that forum.<br/><br/>It is also important to note the costs of dealing with a case in the High Court can be particularly high in comparison to costs in the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court also provides a local forum for the determination of a case, whereas cases in the High Court would require a taxpayer and his or her representatives to travel to Dublin, perhaps on several occasions.  The cost of an appeal to the Appeal Commissioners itself may be beyond the reach of many taxpayers, but the considerable costs of the High Court would be many multiples of that amount.<br/><br/>If the Circuit Court appeal is reinstated, it should be on the current basis of an <i>in camera</i>appeal to remain in line with the decision to allow a taxpayer a right to have his or her appeal dealt with by the Appeal Commissioners on an <i>in camera</i>basis.  By eliminating the Circuit Court appeal, the Bill forces a person dissatisfied with a decision of the Appeal Commissioners to challenge it in the public forum of the High Court rather than in a private hearing in the Circuit Court.  For all of the reasons I have already outlined, it is not an appropriate position in which to place taxpayers.  We should not ask taxpayers to choose between having access to appeal procedures and their privacy.<br/><br/>On balance, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the idea of modernising the tax appeal system.  There are many positive elements in the Bill, including measures to increase the efficiency of the tax appeal system, the proposal in section 949U to allow a more informal appeals process with the agreement of the parties and the retention of the <i>in camera</i>rule for tax appeals.  This is an example of the pre-legislative scrutiny phase actually having an impact.  We will, however, be urging the Minister on Committee Stage to consider an amendment to provide for an appeal to the Circuit Court for those who wish to appeal factual or practical aspects of their case, rather than the narrow and purely legal appeal on a point of law to the High Court currently envisaged in the Bill.</p></speech>

The Appeal Commissioner is not a name on the lips of every citizen but it is an important office, particularly when it falls on one to appeal a decision of the Revenue Commissioners.  My party&rsquo;s approach to this Bill is about seeking transparency and fairness in the appeals system and that it is open to citizens when dealing with their tax affairs.  One of the most useful developments of political reform has been the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  In this case, it was very beneficial to my understanding of the tax appeals system, as well as informing our views on the legislation, shaping it and allowing for some of the proposals that came out of the pre-legislative process to be taken on board.  There was a long engagement between members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance officials, the Revenue Commissioners and other stakeholders, which was useful in trashing out ideas.  As a starting point, it is important that we regularly review the systems and offices we have in place.  We all recognise that this review of the tax appeals office is long overdue.  It is good we have legislation to make the appeals system more robust, fair and transparent but it could have been done a long time ago.</p>  <p>  The two most contentious aspects of the Bill are the removal of private hearings of appeals and the removal of the right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  The Minister&rsquo;s Bill is a compromise on the first issue.  As a rule now, hearings will be in public but can, on request of the appellant, be held in private.  Many who work in the tax field were alarmed at the move towards a more public system.  However, in a modern world, transparency should be a principle that is adhered to.  I tend towards the view that all such hearings should be held in public but I accept this is a genuine compromise that has been arrived at after serious and proper consultation and debate on the issue.  There are always reasons to delay the release of or redact information from the public.  In most cases, the arguments are weak and are more about protecting certain people than protecting the public themselves.  While there is a compromise that the appellant can request the appeal to be held in private, the reality is they will be held in private.  I cannot see many people appearing before the Appeal Commissioner with the option of having the hearing held in private but deciding they want a full public hearing, particularly if it is a matter they want to hide.  I am not convinced about this move and believe the original Bill had enough caveats in it to allow it to remain as is.  At the committee hearings, I gave examples of political appointments made and tax rulings.</p>  <p>  I cannot accept the refusal of the Minister to consider maintaining the right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  This is a major flaw in this legislation.  It is a pity because we seem to be moving in the right direction.  Removing the right to appeal to the Circuit Court, however, is simply wrong.  There is a policy pattern with the Government to remove the right of access to the Circuit Court for citizens.  We saw this with recent customs legislation and changes to the Financial Services Ombudsman process.  The idea people abuse the appeals system does not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>The removal of the appeal to the Circuit Court is unnecessary.  Its removal will prohibit many people from appealing due to the costs involved and the different legal requirement associated with a High Court challenge.  I believe this to be the intention behind the proposal and it is important to state that fact.  This proposal was one of probably the two most contentious issues dealt with by the committee.  The Department's explanation does not stand up to the points I have made about the additional cost and the different legal requirement associated with a High Court challenge.  The response to the committee's suggestion to maintain the Circuit Court option does not mention the very obvious implications I have mentioned.  The argument for not adopting the committee's suggestion is that retention of the Circuit Court stage would undermine the Tax Appeals Commission stage and that the Circuit Court stage allows for a complete rehearing of the case rather than being limited to appeals of issues addressed at the Tax Appeals Commission stage.  There is no reason not to have a full rehearing.  The Department also states that the reformed appeals process should render the appeal to the Circuit Court judge unnecessary, would make for a speedier resolution of appeals and that the retention of the Circuit Court stage would be anomalous in the context of the proposed reforms which, it says, will provide more flexibility, transparency and for the publication of all determinations.  The legal requirement associated with a High Court challenge instead of a Circuit Court one is not addressed, nor is the fact that the costs involved will deter many people.  This will have to be revisited on Committee Stage.  I hope we can reach an agreement on it, but it is a fundamental point and one on which my party has a strong view.  </p> <p> There is much to welcome in this legislation.  We will have a more transparent system with decisions recorded systematically for the first time.  This is a positive move.  That we are stating this fact re-emphasises my point that we should have done this a long time ago, but there is no point in looking backwards.  It is clear a record of decisions which would provide guidance is sensible.  The claim that this new process will help unlock significant funds for the Exchequer is doubtful.  In any case, such an approach is not the way to reform the appeals process.  The notion presented by the Department of Finance was credibly challenged by the Appeal Commissioners during the pre-legislative process and is probably something to which we will return.  </p> <p> Some of the moves in this legislation are cosmetic while others are more significant and enhance the independence of the commission.  That is an important step forward.  The use of the Public Appointments Service rather than the Minister in the appointment process is an important move forward which I welcome.  This Bill is also a timely reminder of the important work Revenue does.  In the comprehensive review of expenditure, Revenue identified how, with the proper resources, it could substantially increase the tax take through a small investment in staff and training.  This is something my party has called for and I hope it will be put in place.  My party will support this Bill on Second Stage but we will be examining whether we will table amendments to deal with some of the issues I have raised.  I wish, however, to put down a marker with regard to the appeal process to the Circuit Court and hope we can meet somewhere on the issue.</p> <p> I stated at the pre-legislative stage that Revenue is an agency of the State which people fear but also respect.  Many so-called pillars of society, whether financial institutions, wise economists, the Church, or politics itself, took a wild bashing over the past decade or so, but Revenue has been able to hold its head up high and has been very efficient in so doing.  It is right that we are streamlining and enhancing the process and removing the blocks that exist with regard to the appeals office, but we need to ensure additional resources are provided to Revenue.  I am conscious in that regard of the upcoming budget.  It has proven itself, however, in terms of the resources it has obtained in the past and there is much Revenue could be doing to combat the black market.</p></speech>

The Irish tax system is grossly unfair.  The poorest people are the most highly taxed in Ireland.  It is not surprising, therefore, to find we are discussing a Bill today which confines legal recourse in tax disputes to the High Court and excludes the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  This means that only the wealthiest can challenge decisions of the appeal commissioners.  Taxpayers on low and middle-incomes and small, self-employed, sole traders are effectively excluded from taking an appeal given the huge cost associated with a High Court case and the exclusion of the possibility of an appeal to the Circuit Court.</p>  <p>  The Government, Ministers, journalists and some academics are involved in systematic deception in relation to the taxation system.  Fairness or equity in taxation is based on the answer to the following question: what proportion of their own income, wealth or assets does each stratum of the population pay in tax?  Research from the Nevin Economic Research Institute shows that poorer people are paying out more of their income in tax as a result of indirect taxation such as VAT and excise duties.  The institute states that the poorest 10% of people pay a larger share of their income in tax than the richest 10%.  In other words, poorer people pay a larger share of their income than the super-rich in our society.  The poorest 10% are paying 29.93% in indirect taxation as against the figure of 5.7% paid by the richest 10% of people.  Over the past 12 months, we have had Ministers and journalists attempting to deceive the public into believing the opposite is the case.  The trick is to pretend that income tax is the only tax and to omit the huge portion of VAT and other indirect taxes paid by the poorest in our society.  There is a line of people available to spin this one, the idea and hope being the more they spin it, the more people will believe it.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, tells us we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world while the Minister of State at the Deputy of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, tells us that the top 6% are paying 44% of the entire tax take.  The Taoiseach tells us we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world while the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, tells us we have the most progressive tax system in the OECD.  It goes on and on.  The fact of the matter is this is spin.  Significantly wealthy, super-rich people are not paying their fair share of tax.  The taxpayers on low and middle-incomes and the poor pay in tax a greater share of their income than the super-rich.</p>  <p>  Income tax constitutes only approximately 41% of all taxation.</p><p>I believe the exclusion, particularly by Labour Party Ministers, of the VAT on the poor which was increased by this Government makes that party's statements absolutely misleading and shows it is part of a Government that is governing for, and on behalf of, the wealthy.<br/><br/>The reason people on large incomes pay a high proportion of all income tax, but not of their incomes, is that they have a grossly unfair proportion of all income.  In fact, in reply to a parliamentary question the Minister told me that the top 10,000 income earners had an average annual income of &euro;595,000.  That was in 2012, and it has increased since then.  The Minister gave further figures which showed that the top 10% of income recipients, 216,500, had a gross income of approximately &euro;30 billion, or an average of &euro;136,700.  Their effective rate of tax was 24%.  To add insult to injury, in the last budget the Minister gave a total of &euro;7 million in tax relief to the people on an average annual income of &euro;595,000.  He gave &euro;150 million in tax relief to the top 10% of earners in the country.  This was confirmed by the press officer of the Department of Finance in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>at the time.<br/><br/>This is all against a background where a recent report by the Central Statistics Office, the Survey on Incomes and Living Conditions, SILC,showing that there are 400,000 children living in households experiencing multiple forms of deprivation, with 135,000 children suffering daily deprivation.  The number of children living in consistent poverty, meaning that they both are living at risk of poverty and experience deprivation, doubled from 6% to just under 12% between 2008 and 2013.  What is this Government proposing to do?  It is now proposing to give even more tax relief to very wealthy people in the forthcoming budget, while fuel and heating allowances are continuing at levels that were reduced by the Labour Party leader as we face into another winter.<br/><br/>Another issue is wealth tax.  We have no wealth tax on wealthy people.  Indeed, during a recent appearance on RTE, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, made much of the introduction of the local property tax on domestic dwellings as a move towards tax fairness.  This is another spin.  Even those with negative wealth - mortgage debt, credit card debt and car loan debt - must pay the so-called property tax.  The Central Statistics Office has shown that financial assets, which exclude homes, farms and buildings, have increased by &euro;93 billion from 2008 to 2013 and are now at &euro;165 billion.  That is &euro;25 billion above the boom level.  Not a penny in wealth tax is due on these gains, while families in negative equity must pay the so-called property tax.  Of course, the distribution of wealth is grossly unfair in this county.  This has been shown again in a recent Central Bank report.  The top 10% of households, or 165,820 households, own 53.8% of all net household wealth or a total of approximately &euro;300 billion, which is almost &euro;2 million each.  The vast bulk of that wealth is free of wealth tax.<br/><br/>At this stage, there is no point in further appeals to the Labour Party to deal with this scandal.  I appeal to the trade union movement, academics and journalists to expose the scandalous deception being visited on Irish people by the Government, and particularly by Labour Party Ministers, about taxation in the service of the super-rich.  I commend Mr. Fintan O'Toole on a very good beginning in this regard in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The fact is that the poorest 10% of people in this country pay a bigger proportion of their income in tax than the wealthiest, super-rich 10%.  That must stop.  It must change, and that should start now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100030#CC00200"><p>The objective of this legislation is to establish an independent appeals process that will create an independent, efficient, clear and transparent system for appeals relating to decisions of the Revenue Commissioners, something which is not available at present.  It is positive that this legislation is being brought forward to establish this independent agency.  Such an agency should act primarily in the interests of the citizens while being fair to the tax gathering authorities of the State and tax legislation as enacted by the Oireachtas.</p><p>There are a number of positive aspects to the Bill, most notably the requirement for publication of reasoned determinations, new transparent procedures for appointment and tenure of the appeal commissioners, a better framework for progressing a case to the High Court and the proposal to publish an annual report on tax appeals.  All of these changes will help ensure more effective operation of the appeals regime.  However, there are important measures included in the Bill which I believe require further consideration, such as the ending of the <i>in camera</i>rule with proposals that all appeal hearings be held in public, the removal of the taxpayer's right to have the facts of their case re-heard at the Circuit Court, the need for clarity to be provided by the Revenue Commissioners at the time when the assessment is issued, and the importance of transitional arrangements.</p><p>The removal of the <i>in camera</i>rule will have a negative impact on the rights of Irish taxpayers and their access to the administration of justice.  Taxpayer confidentiality is enshrined in Irish tax legislation, administration and legal practice.  This has been at the heart of our tax regime for over 50 years.  Taking a case to appeal is simply an extension of this process, whereby an independent arbiter, the appeal commissioner, is seeking to determine the facts of the matter before it enters the court process.  The tax appeals system is not a court of law.  It is a fact-finding tribunal and until the facts are determined and the case moves into the courts the taxpayer is entitled to have their affairs dealt with confidentially.  In hearing an appeal the commissioners are exercising an administrative function.  They are adjudicating on the quantum of tax due from the taxpayer.  They are not addressing the interpretation of a point of law, which would have a wider application and public interest.</p><p>Confidentiality underpins our regime of voluntary compliance and has been a fundamental pillar of a successful Irish tax administration system.  Tax compliance rates here are among the highest internationally, at up to 99% for large businesses and 83% for smaller taxpayers.  While taxpayers might not always agree with the Revenue Commissioners' view on an issue, there is a widespread confidence within the tax paying community that their confidentiality will be respected when dealing with the Revenue Commissioners to resolve an issue.  This understanding has been a significant contributory factor in achieving our high rates of voluntary compliance.  We risk undoing a regime that has been working very effectively up to now by changing the rules on taxpayers' confidentiality.</p><p>The principle is that our tax appeals regime should be open and transparent, which is to be lauded.  However, transparency can be achieved by publishing details of determinations by the appeal commissioners, with the taxpayer names simply redacted.  The taxpayer does not have to be personally identified either in a public hearing or in a written determination in order to achieve transparency. <br/><br/>In its submission to the consultation on appeals reform, Revenue sought the hearing of cases in public as being in line with best international practice.  In particular, it cited the UK tribunal regime as a model.  However, there is mixed experience internationally as to whether hearings should be held in public.  New Zealand is a country with a similar size population to Ireland and its hearings are held privately.  A small society such as Ireland is no bigger than a large city in the United Kingdom and the two countries cannot be compared on this issue.  Therefore, it is very hard to draw a comparison between the Republic of Ireland and the whole mass of Great Britain, given the context for holding hearings in public is totally different.  In smaller societies, the prospect of being named in any proceedings with revenue authorities is a much greater deterrent for taxpayers.  The issue here is not the number of taxpayers who actually end up taking an appeal and having their identities published; it is the number who will be deterred from doing so because of the potential impact on their business and personal reputation, particularly in a small, insular community.<br/><br/>When a taxpayer takes a case to appeal, he or she is exercising his or her legal right to disagree with an assessment that Revenue has raised and to have the facts determined by an independent appeal commissioner.  If the taxpayer disagrees with the technical basis for Revenue&rsquo;s assessment, his or her only option is to go to appeal on the matter.  While he or she has not done anything wrong, there is a public perception that having legitimate tax arguments with Revenue means he or she has done something wrong, perhaps verging on the criminal, when this is not the case.  Perhaps this is our legacy of 20 years of reporting on the tax defaulters list or the public debate on tax avoidance versus tax evasion that is ongoing at the moment.  Whatever the reason, there is huge scope for public misunderstanding of what a tax appeal is and what it is not.  If tax appeals are held in a public forum, this will naturally attract media attention and such public analysis of the taxpayer&rsquo;s business affairs will undoubtedly and unfairly lead to difficulty for them.<br/><br/>Holding tax cases in public will mean that all aspects of a taxpayer&rsquo;s sensitive, commercial and financial affairs would be in the public domain at an appeal hearing and accessible to their competitors, suppliers, creditors and customers.  This could have serious implications for a person&rsquo;s business and for their professional reputation and good character.  A key supplier or creditor could withhold credit if they become aware that a customer has outstanding debts.  The disclosure of commercially sensitive information may detrimentally impact the future prospects of the business or a person's livelihood.<br/><br/>Section 949Y of the heads of Bill allows the appeal commissioners to give direction that a hearing be held <i>in camera</i>.  However, subsection (3) goes on to specifically exclude confidentiality of tax, financial and business affairs as grounds for a private hearing at the appeals commissioners' discretion.  The proposed exception to the public hearing rule is, therefore, of very limited application in practice.<br/><br/>The Irish and international media seem not to be subject to any similar restriction from identifying either the taxpayer or the commercially sensitive information considered at the appeal.  Therefore, the holding of hearings in public, with unlimited rights of reporting, renders meaningless the restrictions placed upon the appeal commissioners when making their own decisions in the public arena.  Removing the <i>in camera</i>rule would be a very significant change to the appeals regime - in fact, it would be one of the most significant elements of any reform.  Notwithstanding this fact, there was no mention of such a change in the public consultation document issued last October.  The matter was, therefore, not brought to the public&rsquo;s attention as one of the measures being considered for reform, yet it has now been included in the heads of Bill.  There is no doubt that the removal of the <i>in camera </i>rule will deter taxpayers from exercising their right to appeal Revenue assessments that are excessive.  In particular, it could act to disenfranchise those taxpayers who use and need the appeals system most, for example, small to medium sized business taxpayers who are such an important part of our economy.<br/><br/>Section 949AM provides that either party to the appeal - the taxpayer or Revenue - can only appeal a determination of the appeal commissioners to the High Court.  The existing right that taxpayers have to a rehearing of the facts at the Circuit Court is thus being removed as part of this reform process.  The removal of this right, combined with the prospect of hearings being played out in the public arena, compounds the deterrent for taxpayers of taking an appeal.  The option of a rehearing at the Circuit Court should certainly be open to both the taxpayer and Revenue.<br/><br/>A tax appeal is a difficult and costly step for any taxpayer to take.  In most cases, it takes time, resources and the payment of professional fees to engage in the appeals process, without any certainty of success.  It is certainly not a route that is embarked on by taxpayers in a frivolous manner.  One of the stated objectives of the appeals regime upon its establishment was to provide ease of accessibility for taxpayers.  A taxpayer may represent himself or herself before the appeal commissioners without legal counsel or professional advice, and approximately 10% of taxpayers avail of this option.  Removing the right of rehearing at the Circuit Court increases the pressure on all taxpayers to incur additional costs in engaging professional expertise, even in straightforward cases.<br/><br/>The only avenue open to a taxpayer dissatisfied with a decision of the appeal commissioners will now be an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  However, High Court costs are beyond the means of all but the wealthiest of taxpayers.  It is estimated that the minimum costs a taxpayer must budget for in taking a case to the High Court is &euro;100,000, which makes such an option inaccessible to most Irish businesses and individuals.  Revenue&rsquo;s right to appeal a decision to the Circuit Court, while limited, will also be impacted by the changes proposed.</p><p>This has the potential to increase the cost to the Exchequer of engaging in the appeals process.</p> <p> A taxpayer will now have to weigh up a range of business risks, reputational risks and compliance costs in deciding even whether to enter the first stage of the appeals process.  In many cases, taxpayers will determine that the risks or costs outweigh the benefits and will waive their right to appeal, even when they are certain Revenue's assessment is incorrect.</p> <p> In the interests of improving the efficiency of the appeals regime, I believe there is merit in appointing several Circuit Court judges with specific expertise in tax matters whose remit would be solely tax cases.  Proceedings could be centralised through the Dublin Circuit Court.  This proposal would, of course, require discussion and negotiation with the Courts Service.  This would facilitate an appropriate through-put of cases in a prompt and efficient manner.</p> <p> Section 949Q deals with the provision of information in regard to the matter under appeal.  However, I believe that the obligation to provide information on the matter under appeal rests with Revenue first at the outset of the appeals process, that is when it has issued the assessment.  Under the current assessment and appeals regime, it is difficult for the taxpayer to make an informed decision about whether to appeal an assessment, because taxpayers generally have limited information on Revenue&rsquo;s grounds for making the assessment.  This is a matter of fundamental importance that needs to be addressed as part of this reform of the tax appeals regime.</p> <p> The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires a taxpayer to outline each amount or matter in the assessment with which the taxpayer is aggrieved and to provide detailed grounds for the appeal on each matter or amount when lodging a notice to appeal.  There is no corresponding obligation on Revenue to provide information as to why the assessment was raised in the first place and how the tax sought in the assessment was calculated.  There has been a number of cases where taxpayers have not been informed of Revenue's legal grounds and reasoning for the issue of an assessment until Revenue served its legal submissions in the weeks leading up to the hearing of the appeal itself.  This places taxpayers in the impossible position of first deciding whether they should incur the time and expense of appealing a decision which has been made on an undisclosed basis and, second, or prepare for an appeal when they do not know precisely why and what they are appealing.  It is critical that sufficient information is provided to the taxpayer at the beginning of the process to enable him or her to comment on the basis of the assessment and prepare a response.  This is particularly important, as the onus of proof falls on the taxpayer to prove that the Revenue assessment is excessive.  There are some outstanding test cases but I will not go into those matters as that would prolong this debate.</p> <p> In the Irish regime, there is currently little clarity on the basis for many assessments that are issued.  Not only does this mean that taxpayers are in the dark when considering whether to appeal an assessment, but it also creates inefficiencies in the system in terms of delays and in respect of the lodging of appeals that may be inappropriate and could be settled by agreement.  The Taxes Consolidation Act should be amended so that Revenue is required to issue a full statement of reasons to accompany any assessment issued.  This statement of reasons should clearly outline the basis for the assessment.  For example, it should state the facts as Revenue understands them; the relevant statutory provisions and case law upon which Revenue relies; Revenue&rsquo;s application of the statutory provisions and case law to the facts; and the basis for its computed assessment.  This clarity would clearly assist the taxpayer in making an informed decision about whether to appeal any assessment.  I call on the Minister for these matters to be taken into consideration when the Bill is being finalised.</p></speech>

I want to use this opportunity to deal with matters relating to tax and Revenue services and the work done by Revenue.  I particularly want to refer to the concept of tax transparency.  The Minister might remember me introducing the idea of tax transparency in the D&aacute;il in 2012 during Second Stage debate on a Bill on the Government's new reform proposals.  We had a three-hour debate at which the Minister and Members from each party spoke and the Bill received all-party support to go to Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, due to the backlog, it has not got to that Stage yet.</p><p>Two years ago, I put a tax transparency calculator on my website and last year I set up the website, <i>taxtransparency.ie</i>.  Tax transparency as a concept and as an acting calculator or tool on a Government website has the support of Revenue, of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It works quite simply and Members could see this today on<i>taxtransparency.ie.  </i>A person can go to the website and calculator and fill out the appropriate fields in regard to salary and income, PAYE status, age and number of children, etc., and it will work out an approximation of the amount of tax the person pays.  For example, if a person is earning &euro;40,000 and is a PAYE worker and aged 28, he or she will pay approximately &euro;9,500 in tax.  The website then breaks this down into how the Government spends that person's money across each Department or even further, into simple euro and cent.</p><p>For example, a 28 year old man earning &euro;40,000 and paying &euro;9,500 in tax would see on the website that approximately &euro;380 of that went to jobseeker's allowance.  Is that too much or is it enough?  He could then compare that to the &euro;1,800 of his tax that is going to health and consider that in the light of the &euro;1,200 he might already be spending on private health insurance.  He would see that &euro;186 of his tax is spent on the Garda and might think this is quite low.  He would see how a similar amount, &euro;148, is spent on road maintenance and might consider whether more should be spent on that.  He would see that only &euro;11 is spent on the costs of the Oireachtas, that is all of the offices, all of the staff and all Members.  Perhaps he would consider that a small amount to pay for the strong democracy we have.  He would see that &euro;66 is spent on international co-operation, including on Irish Aid.  He might conclude that out of &euro;9,500 in tax, &euro;66 is a small price to pay to help the poorest people in the world.  This person would also see that roughly &euro;1,000 of that &euro;9,500 goes to service the national debt.  This indicates for us how important it is to close the deficit and reduce the debt burden as quickly as we can.</p><p>These figures are important, because they inform citizens in an understandable way how the Government is spending their money.  They tell the people what choices the Government is making and that information is empowering.  Good governance requires citizens to be informed and empowered.  I believe the Government has a responsibility to let people know how it is spending their money.  It is their right to know.  It is then up to the people to decide and make a judgment as to whether that is right or not.  The more informed and involved our citizens, the better the politicians we will have and the better Parliament and Government as a result.</p><p>Open government means good government.  Therefore, transparency must be at the centre of everything we do.  This ties in nicely with the proposals for an independent budgetary oversight office.  This is something many of us have sought over a number of years and is something to which the Minister is now committed.  This is about getting parliamentarians more involved in the detail of the figures and the choices facing us.  In tandem with that, we can get individual citizens involved, informed and debating also.  The United Kingdom and the United States do this.  In the United States, the tax transparency site is hosted on the White House website.  If I was a US citizen - I have tried this - I could enter a fictional amount of tax I might pay and the site would tell me, for example, how much of that money was going towards the nuclear deterrent.</p><p>That is incredible stuff, and it is very easy to do.  A simple tax transparency calculator could be put up on <i>merrionstreet.ie </i>for less than &euro;1,000 and would take less than two days' work.  That is a small amount considering the kind of information it would be giving back to citizens and how it would help us all address the choices that will face us into the future.  We should be bringing the majority of people with us regardless of what party is in power.  It is important that citizens are engaged, involved and supportive.<br/><br/>The figures are already up on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has put them up.  It is very interesting to see, but very complicated, even for people who regularly look at these things, be it on the public accounts committee or elsewhere.  We need to be proactive and provide this raw information in an intelligible and accessible form to citizens, very easily and very quickly.<br/><br/>The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, might convey my suggestion to the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  We spoke again earlier today about how he might, in his budget day speech, make a simple commitment to tax transparency by Christmas.  All it takes is the hosting of this simple calculator, which we already have online.  Other people have also done it; <i>publicpolicy.ie </i>has a version.  We should put it on <i>merrionstreet.ie</i>and give it to the citizens so they can see how the Government spends their money in euro and cents, allowing them to get involved in the debate themselves.<br/><br/>To clarify, it is a breakdown of income tax, USC and PRSI.  The principles of the calculator can be extended to VAT or anything else.  The income tax breakdown is a very simple thing to do which could have a big impact.  It will not change the world but will empower our citizens and give transparency to what the Government is doing, including everyone in the project that is our democracy.  It does not require any legislation.  Revenue supports it, as does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has already put the information online.  The D&aacute;il supported the Bill - although it is not necessary now - when it was up for Committee Stage debate.<br/><br/>I ask that the commitment be made to tax transparency in line with the budgetary oversight office.  That office will take a few months and tax transparency will take a few days but we could have it up by Christmas.  It would be a positive step.</p></speech>

Pretty much all of the speakers who have addressed it have had positive things to say.  In terms of the institutions of the State, the Revenue Commissioners do an important job very well.  However, this Bill can ensure they have an enhanced appeals mechanism for tax cases.  That is to be welcomed.  There are other technical changes included in the Bill which outline how the new appeals mechanism will work in practice.</p>  <p>  Like many previous speakers, I want to use the opportunity to say a few things in advance of the budget.  I do not think I was here when Deputy Eoghan Murphy introduced his Bill on tax transparency.  I have no difficulty supporting it.  It is primarily about taxes earned on income.  It would be more difficult for people to calculate how much indirect tax they pay in VAT at different rates for different products.  It might be more correctly termed an income tax transparency Bill, as it includes USC and PRSI.  It is a good idea that people would know where the money they contribute to the State from their incomes ends up.</p>  <p>  When it comes to income tax, Ireland has the fairest system in the world.  I heard Deputy Healy saying this was rubbish earlier.  He quoted Fintan O'Toole and others.  It is not the Government saying it; the OECD has been saying it for years.  Ourselves and Israel, of all places, are up there consistently in terms of income tax as having the fairest systems in the world.  That is an outside verified fact.</p>  <p>  Unlike Deputy Healy, I come to the question of taxation with the view that everybody, lower, middle and higher paid, should pay less tax.  I suppose he has profoundly held ideological views that certain sectors of the population, at least, should pay more tax.  I do not want to rehash everything we have gone through as a country, but in the last few years, direct and indirect tax rates have increased substantially.</p>  <p>  In last year's budget, changes were made to the top tax rate and to the universal social charge, which was welcome.  In the upcoming budget, the Government should focus its resources on substantially reducing the universal social charge and devising a road map as to how this temporary measure introduced at the height of the recession can be phased out.  In addition, the income threshold at which people go on to the top rate of tax is substantially lower here than for most of our neighbours in the European Union.  I think it is something like &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000 here that puts people into the top rate of income tax.  In Britain, it is something like &pound;60,000.  People who are earning &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000 are not well off and should not be paying tax at the top rate.  Income tax bands and USC are the two areas on which the Government should primarily focus.</p>  <p>  The reduction in VAT to 9% for the hospitality sector has been a resounding success.  I suspect it has more than paid for itself in increased employment and economic activity.  That sector is an important part of our economy and is spread right across the country.  The Government should, if resources allow, look at our VAT rates in the future.  We have quite high VAT rates.  One thing on which I do agree with Deputy Healy is that it stands to reason that people on lower incomes end up paying proportionately more in VAT and other indirect taxes than those on higher incomes.  This is something which should ultimately be addressed.</p>  <p>  We should look at capital tax rates, which have increased substantially in the last few years.  It has been borne out by our own history; when capital gains tax was halved in the late 1980s or early 1990s, the actual amounts taken in under that tax heading increased substantially because it allowed for a lot more activity.  People were prepared to sell things and move around a bit more of their capital.  The Exchequer benefited greatly from that reduction.</p>  <p>  Our levels of DIRT tax are very high and were increased substantially during the recession.  This should be addressed in the coming budget if possible, or otherwise in the next one - whoever is in government: hopefully it will be the same Government.</p><p>Perhaps it is again time to start encouraging people to save.  I can understand that at the height of the recession the Government's desire, expressed in policy, was to take in more tax revenue through DIRT and encourage people to spend money to provide some sort of economic stimulus.  We have probably reached a point where we need to at least have a discussion on encouraging people to save for the future.</p> <p> I am struck by the fact that in the past month or so I have received a fair few items of correspondence from constituents in Carlow and Kilkenny on this matter.  They are people who had modest enough incomes and who saved money for their retirement with a view to having some sort of income from those savings.  They saw the rate of DIRT charged increase substantially to the point where the part of their income that would have derived from interest on their savings has been substantially reduced.  We have probably reached a time in the recovery of the country at which we need to encourage people once more to consider the prospect of saving.  One of the ways of doing that would be by reducing the rate of tax we currently charge on people's savings, which is really too high.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100034#GG00200"><p>The Minister for Finance and I sincerely thank the Members on all sides who contributed to this debate.  As the Minister stated, the reform of the tax appeals system will positively reform the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and the tax appeals system.  The Minister and I appreciate the welcome of various Deputies for this reform process.  It will serve a dual function, first in providing transparency and increased certainty for taxpayers and, second, bringing about an enhanced and cost-effective appeal mechanism for tax cases, taxpayers and the Exchequer.  It is timely to proceed with this reform process, which will see appeals being brought through the initial stages in a more streamlined fashion, with enhanced case management procedures to facilitate a more efficient and structured flow of appeals.</p><p>I will now outline the main reforms that are being introduced.  The first is the formal confirmation of the independence of the commission and its appeal commissioners in the performance of their functions.  There will be a new focus on flexible and active case management by the appeal commissioners in order to facilitate more expeditious and efficient processing and disposal of appeals.  The appeal commissioners will now be obliged to try to conduct proceedings in as informal and flexible a manner as possible to facilitate the settlement of appeals by agreement between the parties and to avoid undue delay in dealing with appeals, except where this would be at the expense of not giving proper consideration to a matter under appeal.  The appeal commissioners will have the discretion to dispense with hearings and to make their determination based on written submissions in the case of straightforward matters, subject to the agreement of the parties to the proceedings.</p><p>While public hearings will be the default arrangement, part or all of a hearing will be held in private on application by an appellant.  I consider that this will meet the concerns of stakeholders, and particularly concerns voiced by Deputies on behalf of small business people.  Concerns were expressed that small shopkeepers, for example, could find themselves involved in a public hearing, perhaps with customers in attendance, and with material from the hearing being reported locally.  Such publicity could undermine their business, even if the appeal were upheld.  The Minister appreciates Deputy Michael McGrath&rsquo;s comments in this regard but also notes Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s views on the need for transparency.</p><p><b></b>Currently, not all determinations are published by the appeal commissioners.  Those that are published are available on the appeal commissioners' website.  However, the Revenue Commissioners, as a party to each tax appeal, would have access to all appeal commissioners' determinations, which may give rise to a perception of advantage for Revenue.  To promote transparency, a statutory obligation will now be imposed on the appeal commissioners to publish a report of their determinations in each appeal on the Internet within 90 days after notification of the parties.  Published determinations will be suitably anonymised in cases where the hearing does not take place in public.  I note Deputy Michael McGrath's support for this proposal.</p><p>Publication of determinations and of more information will provide taxpayers and tax practitioners with a valuable resource.  This body of determinations will assist in interpreting tax statutes and be available for reference.  The appeal commissioners will be able to dismiss an appeal where they consider it to be frivolous or where a taxpayer does not comply with directions given by the appeal commissioners in respect of the conduct of the proceedings.</p><p>Appeal commissioners will have a renewable fixed term of office<b></b>of seven years.  The Minister for Finance will have power to reappoint a commissioner for a second, and final, term of seven years.  However, there will be a built-in mechanism to strengthen commissioners' independence providing that, where a commissioner is not so reappointed, the Minister must lay the reason for this before the Oireachtas.  The Bill contains provisions for the removal of a commissioner from office for a variety of specified reasons.</p><p>A requirement will now lie with the appeal commissioners to submit annual reports to the Minister for Finance, who will lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Importantly, this rectifies an accountability deficit and will enable assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the office in regard to the adjudication and determination of disputes and other matters.  Importantly, decisions of the appeal commissioners will now be final and conclusive, with entitlement to appeal to the High Court where the appellant or Revenue considers that the appeal commissioners erred in their determinations on a point of law only and not in regard to the facts.  Statutory responsibility for preparation of a case stated for the opinion of the High Court will now fall to the appeal commissioners on receipt of a notice from the party seeking to appeal.</p><p>With regard to the proposed removal of the Circuit Court stage from the appeals process, which was referred to by Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty, it can be validly argued that a complete rehearing of an appeal, as if the appeal commissioners had never made their determination, has several important disadvantages.  It results in additional delay, particularly in regard to appeals outside the Dublin circuit, where it is difficult to get a case listed for hearing.  Second, it has the effect of undermining the appeal commissioners stage of the process where a taxpayer does not fully engage and uses the initial hearing as a dry run for the Circuit Court.  Moreover, the right to a rehearing can encourage taxpayers to make a second attempt at victory, even in circumstances where there are no real grounds for dissatisfaction with the appeal commissioners' determination.  This runs counter to the principle that cases should be resolved as quickly and effectively as possible and have regard to the fact that court time is a scarce resource.</p><p>The reformed appeal system will be better resourced and more efficient with, for example, more flexible and active case management by the appeal commissioners, written and published determinations and a revised case stated procedure.  There is little transparency in the current Circuit Court stage of the process in that hearings are held in private.  Written determinations are rarely given and are not generally published.  The process can also introduce delays into the overall appeal process.</p><p>There are a number of other tribunals or bodies from which there is only provision for further appeal, on a point of law, to the High Court, but not to the Circuit Court.  These include An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Office of the Information Commissioner, the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Having heard and carefully considered all the views of stakeholders and of Oireachtas Members at the pre-legislative stage, the Minister and I remain of the view that retention of the Circuit Court stage could undermine the reform of the appeal process.</p><p>Provision is made for the giving of directions by the appeal commissioners to parties - for example, requiring a party to provide specified information, consolidating multiple appeals, holding preliminary hearings and adjourning proceedings.  Time limits are streamlined and provisions are put in place, on request, for making persons other than the appellant party to the appeal, and for the dismissal of frivolous appeals.</p><p>It is fair to say many of Deputy Healy&rsquo;s comments related to tax issues rather than the appeals process itself.  The Minister for Finance will, of course, bear these views in mind in the context of the budget.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate for the Deputy to raise these matters during the budget debate and associated debates rather than in this debate.  We would obviously disagree significantly with the ideology brought to the debate by Deputy Healy but we will, I am sure, have an opportunity to debate that during the budget process.</p><p>I welcome Deputy Eoghan Murphy&rsquo;s comments regarding <i>www.taxtransparency.ie</i>.  I recall speaking on his Bill in this regard during a Friday sitting at a relatively early point in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  Second Stage was passed in the House.  I will ensure that the Deputy&rsquo;s views on making this tool available to all taxpayers, as outlined in the House this afternoon, are brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance in advance of budget 2016.</p><p>I will ensure that the views expressed by my colleague, Deputy John Paul Phelan, on the forthcoming budget, on some important matters regarding taxation and on where taxation can play an important role, not only in the redistribution of income - which seems to be the obsession of most media debates on tax - but also as a tool to create more jobs, investment and economic growth, are also brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  I am sure he will give consideration to them in the remaining days before the budget.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-01a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100035#HH01000"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 to this House.  The Bill, on which I and the Department have been working for a number of months, is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  It strengthens the provisions for refusal of bail and provides for tougher sentencing for repeat home burglars.</p><p>Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, particularly in the very distressing situations where householders may be assaulted by the criminals involved.  I am conscious of the serious impact of these offences on individuals, families and communities and I recognise the public concern at these crimes.  The importance of the home is recognised by Article 40.5 of the Constitution which states: &quot;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.&quot;  The courts have recognised that burglary of a person's home is a heinous and traumatic crime.  In its judgment in the 2006 case of DPP<i>v.</i>Barnes,<i></i>the Court of Criminal Appeal stated: &quot;The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression, an attack on the personal rights of the citizen as well as a public crime and is a violation of him or her.&quot;</p><p>The background to this Bill is that earlier this year, in response to concern about a rise in domestic burglaries, I initiated an urgent and broad review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem.  The review included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  As part of the review, I convened and chaired a high-level meeting, which was attended by the Garda Commissioner, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service to look specifically at this issue and decide what legislative action we could best take.</p><p>An important fact which emerged during the review was the finding that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service indicate that approximately 75% of property offences are committed by 25% of offenders.  I have been consistent in my view that serious offenders and serial offenders must continue to be imprisoned.  Public safety is of paramount importance and I am absolute about this.  In this regard, I firmly believe that targeting the small, hardened cohort of repeat burglars has the very real potential to significantly reduce the number of burglaries being committed.  With this in mind, the review I referred to identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation.  One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail.  The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account.</p><p>There is evidence of a high rate of recidivism for burglary.  Data from the 2013 Irish Prison Service recidivism study show a recidivism rate of over 79% among persons imprisoned for burglary and related offences.  Data from the 2008-13 Probation Service recidivism study show a recidivism rate of 49% among persons engaging with the Probation Service for burglary and related offences.  These recidivism rates are the highest rate for any offence group.  They are considerably higher than the overall recidivism rates indicated by both studies.</p><p>Tackling crime and burglaries remains a top priority for the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the policing response is effective and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences, both in rural and urban areas.</p><p>In recent times, Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been co-ordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is a national operation targeting burglary by using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.  In support of Operation Fiacla, there are burglary related operations in place in each Garda division.  Special targeted patrols have been implemented with the assistance of Garda national support services against criminal groups.  These arrangements have also targeted the use of motorways by criminal gangs and have contributed to the arrest of a number of high-priority suspects.  The sustained Garda response under Operation Fiacla has produced many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminal activity.  As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 persons charged.  I congratulate An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for this work in detecting and dealing with these crimes and bringing people to court.</p><p>Work is progressing on updating the Garda operational response to burglary.  Recently, I authorised &euro;700,000 for new specialised vehicles to support the Garda in responding to current and emerging crime threats, including burglaries committed by highly-mobile gangs.  This is being supported by the allocation of &euro;1.75 million to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft, including infra-red cameras for night-time use which will greatly enhance the capacity of garda&iacute; to monitor and track mobile gangs and tackle night-time burglars.  More generally, this Government has invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of this year.  The Government's investment in new Garda vehicles clearly supports the Garda in being mobile, responsive and visible in the community, both urban and rural, as well as being critical to supporting the work of the Traffic Corps and national units.  More particularly, in terms of rural policing, our priority has been focused on delivering highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in rural communities which are being supported by this Government's ongoing level of investment in new vehicles.</p><p>I emphasise this investment is only the start.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021, published on Tuesday, includes an unprecedented allocation of &euro;875 million in capital funding along with approval for further public-private partnership projects in the justice sector.  I welcome particularly the total allocation of &euro;46 million for Garda vehicles, which proves the Government's ongoing priority commitment to ensure that the Garda fleet is modern, effective and fit-for-purpose.  Funding will be provided for both regular Garda patrol vehicles as well as specialist, high-power vehicles for targeted operations.</p><p>On Tuesday, I announced the substantial additional investment of &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which delivers my commitment to progress important much needed reforms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on foot of last year's comprehensive report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  What will this ICT do?  The allocation will deliver new systems which will ensure a more responsive deployment of garda&iacute; in the community and improved Garda response times.  Let me give some examples of the new integrated systems to be developed through this investment.  Let us be clear we do not have these at this time because the investment has not been made previously to upgrade ICT within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it has the kind of technology it needs to respond in the most effective way.</p><p>This new investment will mean that we have a new computer-aided dispatch system to ensure more responsive and co-ordinated deployment of garda&iacute; in the community and to improve Garda response times.  This is very important to deal with changing crime trends.</p> <p> As we know, the trends in criminal activity vary all of the time.  Another example is mobile technology to give garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it while another example relates to investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations.  The latter was highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate report last year which highlighted the fact that the garda&iacute; had the technology to record the initial reporting of a crime but did not have the appropriate technology to have an investigation management system that could be shared around the country.  Given the mobility of criminals not just nationally but internationally, having an investigation management system that is up to date is essential to enable the garda&iacute; to have data that can give up-to-date information on where an investigation is at a particular moment in time.  Extending the roll-out of automated number plate recognition to enhance policing of road safety and compliance is very important and speaks for itself.  These and other new technology solutions will start immediately and some will be in place before the end of the year.  They will cut back on the amount of time involved in paperwork so that garda&iacute; can spend more time engaged in visible front-line policing in communities.  With this investment, we will consign outdated paper-based practices to the dustbin and equip our police service for the digital era.  I think everybody is agreed that this is an essential part of the investment that is needed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the next period of time.  </p> <p> In addition to the ongoing construction of three new divisional headquarters in Kevin Street in Dublin, Galway city and Wexford town, I also announced on Tuesday that &euro;18 million is being provided for the refurbishment of Garda stations throughout the country.  In addition, a new public-private partnership project will be developed to provide new Garda stations at a number of locations throughout the State as well as providing new facilities such as modem property and exhibit management stores in a number of Garda stations throughout the country so where the garda&iacute; have confiscated material of one sort or another, they will have the resources and facilities to store it appropriately.  This can only help in court when they are producing evidence and ensure that there are more convictions.  I will announce further details of all these projects in due course.</p> <p> Of course, the fight against burglaries and crime generally will be aided greatly by the Government's decision to recruit new garda&iacute;.  In September 2014, the Government re-opened the Garda College in Templemore for new recruits for the first time since 2009.  The fact that Templemore was not recruiting from 2009 until we opened its doors in 2014 had a detrimental impact on Garda resources around the country.  I am very pleased that as a Government, we were in a position to begin steady recruitment of new garda&iacute; once again.  Since we opened Templemore, four intakes of new Garda trainees have entered the Garda College giving a total intake of just under 400 recruits.  Of these, 290 have already attested and are now working in communities nationwide.  New recruits who have emerged from Templemore have been assigned.  In addition, 150 more recruits are due to enter the Garda College by the end of the year.  This will bring to 550 the total number of Garda trainees recruited under this Government between September 2014 and 2015.  It is my intention that there will be ongoing recruitment of Garda trainees throughout 2016.  This ramped-up recruitment underscores the Government's determination to deliver an effective and responsive police service to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends.</p> <p> The garda&iacute; continue to pursue a range of measures to support elderly and more vulnerable people in the community working closely with Community Alert and other schemes and groups.  Deputy Stanton, who is chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, told me earlier that Community Alert will celebrate its 30th anniversary very shortly.  Great credit is due to those people who initiated Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups.  They are essential.  I believe many communities around the country are increasingly becoming involved in a variety of these schemes and this is also an essential part of communities feeling safer and helping the garda&iacute; in their local areas.  I have met many of the groups involved.  Community partnership has been particularly evident in the success of the Garda Text Alert scheme.  Since it was launched in September 2013, this initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism.  There are over 600 local groups involving in excess of 120,000 subscribers.  This is a great example of voluntary effort, community responsibility and citizens supporting each other.  An estimated 200,000 text messages are sent each month under the scheme.  I am informed that every Garda division, rural and urban, now offers the Text Alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.  It is clear from meeting the groups involved in running this that it takes some time to begin to set it up, use it properly and develop the liaison with the local garda&iacute;.  The local garda&iacute; are there to work with the community to make sure it is working effectively.  </p> <p> I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed regarding the risk that "cash for gold" and other outlets which purchase second-hand jewellery and precious metal from the public could be used by criminal elements to dispose of stolen goods, particularly from home burglaries.  I recently announced a public consultation on the possible regulation of "cash for gold" outlets and the second-hand sale of precious metals.  A consultation document setting out a number of policy options for mitigating risks in this area is available on my Department's website.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is 30 October 2015.</p> <p> I wish to comment on the reform of bail.  Deputies will also be aware that I published the general scheme of a new bail Bill in July.  This new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail while also safeguarding the rights of the accused person.  I have outlined a range of initiatives which are being taken to confront repeat offenders and protect households and businesses around the country.  I am confident that these measures, including new legislation and targeted Garda operations, will strengthen my carefully considered approach to dealing with serial offenders and supporting improved community safety.</p> <p> I will now outline the provisions of the Bill, dealing first with bail in burglary cases.  Section 1 seeks to ensure that prolific burglars can be refused bail in appropriate cases.  At the outset, it is necessary to recall that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Prior to 1997, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Burglary offences are designated as serious offences for the purposes of the Bail Act.  However, it is clear that prolific burglars with numerous previous convictions are repeatedly granted bail despite Garda objections even when charged with a series of burglaries.  Section 1 of the Bill will deal with this issue.  We outline in the Bill how bail is to be dealt with.  We have many new sections relating to that.  </p> <p> We also deal with consecutive sentences for burglary.  Section 2 deals with that and will insert a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  The new section will require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12-month window to impose such sentences consecutively.  The new section applies only to a "relevant offence", which means a burglary or aggravated burglary.  The provisions will apply only to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for they are being sentenced.  There are a number of new subsections which outline the various circumstances where it will apply.</p></speech>
