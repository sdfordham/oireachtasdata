It is a fundamental issue that undermines our criminal justice system, the relationship between our courts and garda&iacute;, and the veracity of what they bring to the courts in terms of evidence.</p>  <p>  Second, 1 million breath tests were falsely put up on PULSE.  Essentially, in four years 1 million were actually done but garda&iacute; were saying they did 2 million.  It is a completely false figure.  It is a very serious issue for a number of reasons, a fundamental one being the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Of course, data and information of this kind informs policy, so the impression is out there that there is constant major attack on drink-driving, and that we are on top of it as we are doing 2 million breath tests, and so on.  The reality is far from that, and it is arguable it neutered a policy response in regard to drink-driving.  I can recall the former chairman of the Road Safety Authority, Gay Byrne, complaining about the lack of enforcement.  Is this the response to the lack of enforcement - to falsify the figures?</p><p>Is it to create promotion opportunities?  What is it?  We do not know.  We have not been told why the figures were falsified.  The language in all the press releases is cautious, careful and designed not to tell us.  Three years on from when this was initially told to the Garda by the Medical Bureau for Road Safety, we are told the Garda still has to try to find out what happened.  We know that the Garda wrote to the Department of Justice and Equality in June 2016.  What did the Minister do with that?  Did she intervene at any stage up to last week?  Why did the Minister for Justice and Equality not inform the D&aacute;il about this issue?  We learnt that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, apparently received correspondence from Mr. Gay Byrne again, in his capacity as chairman of the RSA, from a whistleblower outlining all of this.</p> <p> There are fundamental questions.  Why did the Garda Commissioner not inform the Policing Authority?  She met its representatives six times in the last year but did not inform them that an audit was under way nor of the scale of the revelations that were about to unfold.  Why did the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, not inform the D&aacute;il and intervene much earlier?  I ask that all correspondence that the Minister received from the Garda on this issue be published and made available to D&aacute;il Members.  How can the Taoiseach still express confidence in the Commissioner and in the shambles that has unfolded in front of our very eyes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800004#B00200"><p>A Government meeting concluded a short time ago.  For the information of the House, the Government received a very detailed briefing from the T&aacute;naiste this morning on the recent revelations regarding the Garda handling of matters relating to mandatory alcohol testing and to fixed charge notices.  We also noted the public explanation given by senior garda&iacute;, including the Garda Commissioner, over recent days.  There was a very strong consensus in that discussion this morning that these revelations have given rise to the most serious concerns not just among public representatives but among the people generally.  It is a matter of grave importance to our country that the Government, the Oireachtas and members of the public have faith and trust in the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out their duties fairly and impartially and in accordance with the laws of the land.  It is crucial that the public can believe the statistics and other information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why we are here as public representatives and as the Government.</p>  <p>  It is absolutely essential, in my view, that a process of reform is rigorously implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and be seen to be implemented, including through the close oversight of the independent Policing Authority.  People are aware that the Government has introduced a range of important reforms to policing in this State in recent years, including the establishment of the Policing Authority, additional powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, greater civilianisation, open recruitment and the provision of significant extra resources.  The Garda Commissioner has also instituted a significant programme of internal organisation and reform, which is being overseen by the Policing Authority.  However, I have to say that we continue to see a list of unacceptable revelations about the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with these two issues being the very latest.  The Government believes that the level of public concern is now so profound that it is time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root and branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I also believe that such a proposition should have widespread support from the Oireachtas.  I therefore propose that it should be the subject of consultation with the Opposition parties and, ultimately, approval by the Oireachtas.  The Government will consider these issues again next week.</p>  <p>  I should add that the Government continues to have confidence in the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>The Government also believes that there must be an external investigation into these two specific matters, not one internally conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will revert on these matters later today during the Topical Issue debate she is dealing with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800005#C00200"><p>The Taoiseach did not answer the questions I asked.  Why did the Garda Commissioner not inform the Policing Authority?  The Taoiseach spoke in his reply about the close oversight of the Policing Authority.  It appears the authority was not informed.  It is incredible.  Under this radical new reform, the body that will take politics out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not told.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, we were told this was an administrative oversight.  That is not credible.  I asked the Taoiseach whether he could defend that.  How does he explain it?  Does the Taoiseach believe it is right that the Policing Authority was not informed?</p>  <p>  I also asked the Taoiseach when the Minister for Justice and Equality was informed about all this.  This has been going on since 2014.  In 2015, Professor Cusack said that instead of 200,000 cases being recorded, the Garda had indicated that the figure was 400,000.  It is clear to all and sundry that something is seriously wrong on a large scale with the data emanating from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but nothing has happened.</p>  <p>  I am insisting that the Minister for Justice and Equality comes before the D&aacute;il today to answer questions, not during the Topical Issue debate or anything like that.  It should be done under private notice questions or some other context.  The Minister should answer questions from the House in respect of this matter.  It has been rather opaque so far in respect of the information leaking from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality.  We need far more transparency and serious accountability arising from these issues compared with what we have had up to now.</p></speech>

The audit was ongoing.  The Department was back to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on several occasions.  The deputy commissioner, Mr. Twomey, dealt with that at a press conference and apologised for it.  However, it is not good enough, as Deputy Martin points out, that the Policing Authority, which has independent oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, was not told about this.  An apology has been issued.  That is the real culture issue that needs to be dealt with.  The audit is under way as well.</p></speech>

That issue, no more than the issue of people not receiving a letter, should be the subject of an external examination.  The Government made that decision this morning.  The Government will meet again next week to look at the broader implications of where we are with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the people can have trust and confidence in a fundamental institution of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800005#C01700"><p>Over recent days we have heard of yet another controversy surrounding the management and operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have heard of 14,700 unsafe convictions for motoring offences and almost 1 million breath tests recorded on the PULSE system that were never carried out.  This is simply another episode of scandal surrounding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps we should not be surprised by the latest debacle.  It seems clear from the scale of the current controversy that malpractice was endemic.  It was happening day in and day out.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has fully acknowledged, public confidence in the management and leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now on the floor.</p><p>The refusal of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to take the required action and to call time on the rotten management culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a dereliction of their duties.  The Taoiseach knows that the Garda Commissioner has to go.  He knows that the fish rots from the head down.  Those who tuned into the Commissioner's press conference yesterday were left in absolutely no doubt that the upper echelons of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are rotten with arrogance and chronically unaccountable.  The top brass, it seems, is prepared to brazen this one out.  The Commissioner herself seems determined to brazen this one out.  The question is whether the Taoiseach will allow that to happen.  Anybody who believes that the dysfunctional culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will change while the current Commissioner remains is, frankly, living in cloud cuckoo land.</p></speech>

This is an absolute mess.  Thousands of unsafe convictions, 1 million fabricated breath tests and the serious questions that therefore arise over any data, statistics or information produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The entire controversy undermines the very integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and flies in the face of what citizens expect from their policing service.  We have had an almost casual response from a very detached Commissioner to circumstances that undermine confidence in citizens' most basic and fundamental rights.  Only in Ireland would politicians be standing here today, debating whether the person who is ultimately responsible for all of this mess should remain in her job.  The biggest mistake that the Taoiseach and the Minister could make is to leave Commissioner O'Sullivan in position.  Everybody knows that she has to go.  We have tabled a confidence motion in respect of the Garda Commissioner but the Government should not wait for that.  It should not have to wait for a motion to be tabled by the Opposition.  The Taoiseach needs to show real leadership and make that decision today.  His Government must act decisively.  Will the Taoiseach now take the first steps in restoring that vital public confidence by removing Commissioner O'Sullivan from her post?</p></speech>

For the first time, interviews were independently conducted and applicants independently sought for appointment to the post of Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

It is about the structure, about all of the men and women who serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, more importantly, about those whom they serve, the people of our country.  It does not take much to lose confidence in an institution.  There are issues here that Deputies McDonald and Miche&aacute;l Martin have rightly raised about fixed charge notices, breathalyser tests and the numbers actually carried out as against estimates and figures supplied.  The Cabinet has made a decision that the analysis and the determination of the facts in regard to these two matters should and will be conducted by an external entity.  It is much more important, in my view, that we collectively look at what it is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should become.  We should examine that, through some sort of commission or entity, for the future because the restoration of confidence and trust is so important.  Deputy McDonald knows that in so many areas around the country, outstanding work is being carried out by men and women who are so proud to serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to look beyond a personality, who happens to be the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and look at the force, its role, responsibilities, actions, culture and the trust that people now have in garda&iacute;.  That is why the Government made a decision today that the analysis of the figures in respect of breathalyser tests and fixed charge notices should and will be conducted externally.  The Government will meet again next week to consider the broader implications for the future of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach should not try to hide behind the good work of garda&iacute; on the beat right across the country.</p><p>Very clearly, what is at issue here is the management and leadership within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have heard many times the story about reform that the Taoiseach told again today.  At this stage, with yet another scandal breaking, when senior management are revealed again to be incompetent and indifferent - certainly indifferent to the view of the Government or public - and when public confidence is on the floor, people expect the Government, including the Taoiseach, to act.  This is not about an individual personality.  It is not about N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan as a woman; this is about N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan as the Commissioner, the woman who is in charge.  This is about the Commissioner failing to deliver on the reform agenda and, sadly, it is about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being at such a low ebb and enjoying such low public confidence that the people to whom we speak will have no expectation or real enthusiasm for full reform.</p> <p> The Taoiseach knows that the Commissioner has to go.  Why is he delaying?  Why does he refuse to do that which is his job?  Is it because Brian Purcell is no longer available to him?  Perhaps he does not have the bottle to do what he needs to do.  Is it that he does not now have a senior civil servant to run and have a word in the Commissioner's ear?  We have tabled a motion but the Taoiseach should not have to wait for that.  The Taoiseach should do his job and relieve N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan of her duties.</p></speech>

We will find out the truth about the discrepancies here.  We will find out what happened within the Garda traffic management system such that people did not receive letters giving them the option to accept their penalty points and pay their charge before they went to court.

The facts need repeating, although they have been mentioned time and again.  From 2006 to 2016, a total of 146,865 District Court summonses were issued in error and 14,700 of our citizens were brought before the courts and wrongly convicted.  Some of them were told they were telling lies when they said they did not actually receive a summons.  One should think of the impact that would have on their livelihood and families.  All of this now has to be undone.</p><p>If that was not bad enough, there were 1 million wrongly recorded breath tests, the data of which informed our entire policing and road traffic policies over the years but were based on falsehoods.  The chief executive of the Road Safety Authority has said the absence of credible and reliable enforcement metrics makes it almost impossible to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of road safety interventions.  That is a critical issue in saving lives.  The Road Safety Authority is not the only one concerned.  Today, Professor Denis Cusack of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety clearly said that both in 2014 and August 2015, the Garda was alerted to the significant discrepancies between the amount of equipment used and the amount of breath tests recorded.</p> <p> I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's response.  He said we are going to have another in-depth root and branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was the response of the Independent Alliance to the last crisis a few weeks ago.  That was its bolt-in to that.  Of course, we have heard nothing of it since.</p> <p> We have a Garda authority.  I agree with the Taoiseach profoundly on this.  Let us have political consensus to have fundamental reform implemented now.  Is it good that nobody takes accountability for what we know, namely, that 14,700 of our citizens were wrongly convicted, 147,000-odd summonses were wrongly issued and 1 million breath tests were wrongly recorded?  Is nobody to be accountable, responsible or answerable for that?  Is it acceptable to the Taoiseach that we are going to have a three-month period now when the people who were in charge will review their own performance and tell us what happened, although they have been seised of this in some shape or form for three years?</p></speech>

It is not acceptable that people were wrongly convicted.  It is not acceptable that people did not get a letter indicating the option of accepting the penalty points and paying their charge but were summoned to court.  In some of those cases, those charges were dismissed because they did not get the letter.  In other words, they were wrongly convicted.  The Garda has now apologised for that.  It should not have happened.</p>  <p>  When the law was changed to allow for that option to apply, that should have been known and understood by every garda throughout the country.  It was common sense that if somebody was caught for speeding or whatever the charge might be, the first thing would be that the person should receive a letter giving them the option that was open there.</p>  <p>  I am talking about a system that will restore integrity, as well as public confidence and trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not just about a cultural analysis but about a perception of the people now.  Who do we believe?  Here are the figures and here are the estimates but they are grossly out of kilter with each other.</p></speech>

Somebody has to find it out, however, and that is what the Government decided this morning.  It is not good enough that nobody is answerable here.  Can we not determine what the facts are and the truth, more importantly, about those facts?  I understand Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has summoned the Garda Commissioner to attend the justice committee at 9 a.m. on Thursday.  I also understand the Commissioner will also be meeting with the independent Policing Authority shortly.  It is open under the Act for the independent Policing Authority to contract persons to assist with its duties.  That is not an executive function, but in respect of the oversight responsibility it has for the Garda.  It is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which itself is independent under the chairmanship of Mr. Robert Olson, which conducts the investigations into issues like this.</p><p>These are matters that are under very serious consideration.  From the Government's perspective, it is to take a broader view of the nature and structure of the Garda force for the years ahead in order that we can, for once and for all, try to put in place a system that will restore pride to the uniform and the trust and confidence of the ordinary people of the country.  After all, the duty of Government is to have safety and security for the people and for the State and the Garda is a fundamental and central part of that.</p></speech>

Meanwhile the public are demoralised when it comes to understanding policing.

He is a man who has a growing family, some in college.  Michael, who is a new worker, takes home approximately &euro;450 a week, and that includes all his premiums.  He is a young man with a mortgage and children so small he is now doing picket duty in the evenings to avoid having to pay child care while he is on strike.</p>  <p>  I want the Taoiseach to answer this question directly.  Does he believe anyone could justify taking 30% of the wages of those three people I have given him as examples?  That is what is being proposed by Bus &Eacute;ireann in its attack on the pay and conditions of workers throughout the country.</p><p>There is a crisis in the company.  I will not stand here and deny there is a deficit and a crisis.  However, it is not a crisis like a volcanic eruption in Iceland or a storm hitting the west coast of Ireland.  It is not a force of nature.  It is a crisis created by this and previous Governments, and I will stand over that statement.  The National Transport Authority, for which the Taoiseach's Cabinet has responsibility, has deliberately swamped the main bus routes between the cities, such as Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Galway etc., with private operators.  It has over-licensed beyond capacity and beyond 100% of what is needed.</p> <p> At the same time, this Government and the previous one have consistently cut the subsidy to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The subsidy Bus &Eacute;ireann gets as a public transport company is 12%.  Guess how much public transport receives by way of subsidy in Belgium.  In Belgium, a subsidy of 78% is allocated to run public transport.  The figure for Holland is 49%.  Ireland gives its public transport companies a lower subsidy than do most developed European countries.  In addition, we subsidise a social function of the transport sector to allow for free travel.  I have a letter here from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, which clearly shows we give to the private operators a subsidy of 70% for that free travel and 40% to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is not a level playing field.</p> <p> The crisis in Bus &Eacute;ireann has been manufactured consistently and continually by this Government and the previous one.  Then there is the extraordinary situation of a Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is on a multiple of the wages of these people who work hard day in, day out, saying a national transport strike is nothing to do with him.  He is the Minister with responsibility for transport but says he will not intervene in a national transport strike.</p> <p> I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  I ask him to explain that last position.  How does his Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport not have anything to do with a national transport strike?  Can the Taoiseach justify a cut of 30% to the wages of the people whose earnings I have just described?</p></speech>

This is precisely why the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is still available for talks to resolve the dispute.  It will not be resolved on the streets.  It will only be resolved around the table, where all strikes are resolved.  This is exactly the opportunity to sort out the dispute which the Minister, Deputy Ross, has identified on so many occasions.</p>  <p>  I understand Deputy Smith's legitimate comment about the drivers and those who work for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Last year, the taxpayer provided &euro;230 million to Bus &Eacute;ireann across the public service obligation, PSO, scheme, the free travel scheme, the capital and the school transport funding programmes, and that is a significant amount of money which has been increasing over recent years.  Funding for the public service obligation units has increased over the past two budgets, but subvention is provided only for the PSO services.  It cannot, by law, be provided for a commercial service such as Expressway, and this is where the difficulty is.  This is a dispute within Bus &Eacute;ireann involving, among other matters, the commercial Expressway service.  One union has announced it will ballot members in other companies which are not party to this dispute.  I hope that does not happen because the opportunity remains for the unions and the management of Bus &Eacute;ireann to get together.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is playing his part-----</p></speech>

Very many people are inconvenienced by the dispute.  It is causing much stress for people who have lost access to any public transport at all in many areas of the country.  The point has been made that the resolution of and solution to the dispute is at the table of the WRC.  Both sides have admitted that there are efficiency issues to be addressed.  Both sides should have the courage to go back to the table again and attempt to resolve any differences in the consideration of these efficiencies.  That is where the solution lies.  Obviously, the Government is very interested to see that the strike should end and that people should be able again to avail of the services Bus &Eacute;ireann provides, which is what the company does best.  Those services need to be provided in such a way that the issue of the loss-making Expressway entity is dealt with.  The WRC is the place to deal with the matter.</p></speech>

The NTA has deliberately forced Bus &Eacute;ireann into an uneven playing field of competition with the private operator to drag down the wages and conditions of workers.  This will apply to Dublin Bus, DART and Irish Rail.  If the NTA and the Government manage to drag people down in Bus &Eacute;ireann, they will drag them down everywhere.  This strike is of interest to other transport workers and it is indeed of interest to the public in general who are suffering as a result of the strike but will suffer more if the Taoiseach and the Government gets its way and diminishes the jobs and conditions of public transport workers.  Will the Taoiseach come out to the gates with me at 1 p.m. tomorrow and welcome the hundreds of bus, rail and DART workers who will be there to tell the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that he cannot wipe his hands of this?  The Minister is involved, as are the Government and the NTA.  They must participate in the solution to this strike and crisis.  The power is on the streets.  It will be outside the gates at 1 p.m. tomorrow.  If the Minister does not listen to that, a national transport strike will be required and he will have to listen to DART, Dublin Bus and Luas workers, and train drivers when they down tools and say workers will not be dragged down by a race to the bottom by the policies of this Government.  The Minister must get involved.</p></speech>

The House should reflect that.  More importantly, the political accountability for the administration of justice lies with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.  The Oireachtas should be able to ask the T&aacute;naiste questions on this debacle and the crisis of confidence in the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the administration of justice.  It defies belief that the T&aacute;naiste would not come forward today to answer questions on this issue, be they private notice questions or another formula, from Members of the House.</p><p>The Taoiseach spoke earlier about the need for accountability.  Everyone is <i>ad idem </i>on the need for accountability.  What signal is the House sending if the person with political accountability for the administration of justice does not come forward to show that accountability?

It has been passed on to the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner passes it on to an assistant commissioner.  The cynicism is breathtaking.  It is beyond belief that not addressing a policing authority is just an administrative oversight.  The idea that the House can carry on nonchalantly for the next three days while the person with political responsibility and accountability does not see fit to come before the House, issue a statement on this issue and take questions is similarly beyond belief.</p></speech>

That is an intolerable situation.  The Taoiseach mentioned that the T&aacute;naiste is to take a Topical Issue matter but that is an inadequate response.  The T&aacute;naiste must present herself, make a statement to the D&aacute;il and allow for questions.  That is the least we should expect from her.  Questions have been put to the Taoiseach on these matters and in response he has been spoofing, but his spoofing is overshadowed by the evasion of the T&aacute;naiste, his Cabinet Minister for Justice and Equality.  As has been said, it is outrageous that in light of this series of scandals, we are not to have the opportunity to establish the facts, the T&aacute;naiste's state of knowledge and her proposed course of action.</p></speech>

He is not treating the House the way it should be treated, given that his Government is in a minority position and the fact that to satisfy even the basic norms of accountability the T&aacute;naiste should, at the very least, come before the House, give an account of the current situation that pertains in the Garda, and answer questions from Members on that.  If Members want to find space today as to when that could be done, I suggest there is an issue on the Order Paper that perhaps could wait for a week, namely, the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016.  I suggest that is not as pressing an issue as the scandal that has taken place in the ranks of the Garda and the silence we have from the T&aacute;naiste.  She should be here today with a statement to answer questions.</p></speech>

That was the way for many years in this House when crises happened.  Private notice questions were the order of the day when a crisis happened in any Department.  The Taoiseach knows in his heart that the raising of issues during Topical Issue debate is not a question and answer format.  Let us not try to mislead or cod the public on that.  That is not an accountability exercise.  The Order of Business was obviously organised in advance of the revelations of these issues, so therefore there is an opportunity for the House to reorder business, as we did some weeks ago about the crisis relating to the Charleton inquiry.</p></speech>

The public is outraged.  We are talking about a million breathalyser tests being lied about and people paying the price in terms of extra penalty points, wage deductions, etc.  The Minister must answer today.  It will go to a vote and I can guarantee that we will make an issue out of this because we had to make an issue to get the Taoiseach to answer questions before.  There are two solutions.  We either take Government Business during those two hours later in the evening or the Taoiseach can scrap questions to the Taoiseach.  I have two questions to the Taoiseach which I am happy to allow to be scrapped in favour of the Minister coming to the D&aacute;il, but she should answer today.

She is prepared to do that and that is in accordance with the rules for which Deputy Coppinger voted and which apply here.  The Deputy wants to change them when it suits her.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is attending here and will deal with this and give the same briefing she gave the Cabinet.  She will take questions from the Deputies who raised the Topical Issue matter.  The members of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality will deal for hours on Thursday with issues relating to this and I welcome that because it will provide an opportunity for information that we do not know to be made available directly to the Oireachtas by the Garda Commissioner.  I understand the Garda Commissioner is meeting with the chairperson of the independent Policing Authority, which has independent oversight responsibility for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Deputy Thomas Byrne asked a question about my refusal of a private notice question.  I want to be very clear that in considering a private notice question, one must consider first and foremost whether it is a matter of urgent public importance, which it is, but one must also take into account whether there are other avenues available to Members to address the particular issue.</p><p>I took into account that I received the request for a private notice question after I had made a decision to call people for a Topical Issue.  I am conscious of the fact that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will answer questions in the House on Thursday.  I am further conscious of the fact that the Garda Commissioner is to go before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the week.

Last year in particular, with the 1916 commemorations, I attended many events that were also attended by representatives from various religious groups. </p><p>As Taoiseach in the previous Government, I met with representatives from the Catholic Church, Church of Ireland, the Jewish community, the Islamic community, Atheist Ireland and the Humanist Association of Ireland as part of the structured dialogue process.  I also met an ecumenical delegation of European churches in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.</p><p>I have reported to the House on all the meetings I have held under the structured dialogue process in replies to various parliamentary questions since 2013, most recently on 2 February and 15 June of last year. </p><p>I have not held any meetings under the structured dialogue process since the formation of the current Government.</p></reply>

The whole question of how these institutions were run and so on is now a major issue.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Catholic religious congregations have only paid 13% of the costs of a redress scheme set up to help survivors.  The report states that by the end of 2015, the total cost of the commission which inquired into child abuse and the redress scheme was an estimated &euro;1.5 billion.  However, that progress has actually gone into reverse.  Some 18 religious orders have offered the equivalent of about 23% of the overall cost.  I want to ask in particular about one religious order, the Christian Brothers.  They said they were on course to honour all the voluntary pledges they made.  Of the &euro;34 million that they pledged, &euro;24 million has been paid, with the final &euro;10 million to be paid in 2017 on a phased basis, linked to property sales.  The problem is that they have tried to transfer lands that they own to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, which are their own schools.  They are trying to use this transfer as part payment of their obligations under the redress scheme.  Just so the Taoiseach knows, patronage of the most recent secondary school in Castleknock, in Dublin West, was awarded to this trust.  People are aghast that religious congregations are being awarded hospitals and schools like it is business as usual and like nothing has happened, yet those congregations have not even fulfilled their obligations.  The Sisters of Mercy are similar.  Apparently I only have a minute and a half so I do not have time to go into it.</p>  <p>  I had hoped to raise with the Taoiseach the fact that, in the 1920s and 1930s, a succession of laws were passed which gave the church control over health, education, and employment as it pertained to women.  Basically, the Taoiseach's ancestors-----</p></speech>

At such a meeting, will he raise the issue of the mother and baby homes, including the Bethany homes?</p> <p> On a question that was raised earlier, will he ask about recompense and the failure to transfer assets to the State as promised?  Given the fact there are many assets which are growing in value as we speak, not only is there a need to transfer the assets of specific orders to the State to ensure compensation is paid to those who were basically incarcerated in mother and baby homes, but those assets need to be frozen pending the outcome of any inquiry, commission of inquiry, truth commission or otherwise and pending possible criminal actions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the future, if such is intended or required when the full horrors of what we have seen emerge from Tuam in particular have been revealed.</p> <p> The Taoiseach met Pope Francis briefly last week.  I do not know whether he had enough time to mention the recent revelations or whether he suggested to Pope Francis that, when he arrives in Ireland, he comes bearing orders to the orders based in Ireland to relieve them of whatever assets they hold to ensure they pay their full dues, if they could ever do that.</p></speech>

It is only right and proper that he should be invited, as the head of the Catholic Church worldwide, to visit at least one of the 139 or 140 institutions which feature in the examination of the commission on children who were in mother and baby homes.</p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach had any recent correspondence or contact, formally or informally, with the religious orders that were the subject of a nefarious deal between the then Government, the then Minister for Education and the then Taoiseach to allow an indemnity to be given to the orders in regard to their liability for these events?  While we know there will have to be more redress for other people as a result of the current commissions of inquiry under way, following the publication more recently of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the &euro;1.5 billion cost of the redress scheme so far, has the Taoiseach approached the congregations to meet their moral and ethical liabilities, of which we have heard an awful lot in regard to the Garda in recent days?  Surely the religious bodies have moral and ethical responsibilities.  Has the Taoiseach raised this with them in terms of the further sums they are willing to pay, which they owe and are committed to?</p></speech>

The point I want to specifically zone in on relates to a case I raised last week, that of John Allen.  We are rightly talking about the horrors of the past but, right now, current Government policy is treating in an appalling manner victims of child sexual abuse in primary schools across the country.  We had the Louise O'Keeffe case, which went all the way to the European Court of Human Rights and which found in her favour.  The subsequent interpretation and application of that decision by the State has been shocking in its cynicism and is an attempt to narrow the application of the judgment in regard to the cases of people like John Allen, whose abusers have been convicted and are in jail.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this with the religious orders?  In this case it was a Christian Brother who abused Mr. Allen and was convicted.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach inadvertently misled the House last week when he said the European Court of Human Rights had decided on the idea of prior complaint.  It did not.  It is the Government that decided on prior complaint, interpreting the court decision.  I would ask the Taoiseach to, at a later date, go back over the transcripts and correct the record of the House.  I do not believe he intentionally misled the House but I think it was misled in that regard.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach there is a need to engage with the religious orders in regard to this cohort of our population right now.  They went to the Supreme Court and they were threatened with costs.  There is culpability of successive Governments on this, as I have said, but I am saying now and have been saying for the past year that we need to do right by current victims of child sexual abuse.  We can go on about the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s but it is happening right now.  These people are financially ruined, are in very difficult circumstances and are psychologically under enormous pressure.  I think it is unacceptable and it speaks very badly of the Government in terms of its lack of humanity and discretion in dealing with this.  It is not that huge numbers have been through the courts.  Even to take the cases where convictions have taken place, there is no compensation and there is no reaching out to these victims.</p></speech>

Obviously, the State will make its facilities available for the Head of State of the Vatican.  To be honest, I do not know of correspondence being received by the Department from the religious orders but there may well be.  I will check that for the Deputy and I will advise her in respect of the mother and baby homes.</p>  <p>  Deputy Coppinger raised several questions about the religious institutions and their failure to measure up.  I take a very strong view about this.  It is Government policy that the church congregations should increase their contributions towards the substantial costs of the redress scheme to achieve a 50% share, as that is only equitable and proper.  As things stand, the State and the taxpayer have met some 86% of the cost of redress.</p>  <p>  In 2009 the Christian Brothers offered to transfer its 49 school playing fields, valued at &euro;127 million, to a new joint trust between the State and the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  As the initial offer would not result in a tangible contribution towards the cost of redress, the then Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, made two counter-proposals to try to progress matters.  Unfortunately, the Christian Brothers decided to reject those counter-proposals and, in 2015, decided to proceed to transfer the fields to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  It is disappointing the Christian Brothers withdrew their offer.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, would be very happy to engage with the congregations to see if a mutually satisfactory solution could be achieved that would make a tangible contribution towards the cost of the redress response.</p></speech>

The Christian Brothers offered their 49 school playing fields at a value of &euro;127 million to be transferred to a new joint trust between the State and the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, to which the congregation's primary and secondary schools were transferred.  The then Minister, Deputy Quinn, had a counter-proposal that the playing fields would instead be transferred to the State, with guaranteed access for the schools currently using them under licence for as long as they were required.  That counter-proposal was not accepted by the Christian Brothers.  The Edmund Rice Schools Trust was also opposed to it.</p> <p> In July 2013, the Government agreed to a revised proposal by the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, under which the congregation would be asked to transfer the playing fields to the trust for the continued beneficial use of the schools subject to the legal requirement that the prior approval of the Minister be obtained for a disposal of any part of them and that, in the event of any proposed transfer, the State be entitled to receive at least 50% of the proceeds.  Under that proposal, in terms of reckoning that contribution towards the cost of redress, it was proposed that the fields and associated lands be valued on an open market value basis at the date of the transfer to the trust.  A sum of 50% of that valuation would be reckoned as a contribution towards the cost of the response.  The revised proposal was put to the congregation by the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, in a letter on 15 October 2013.</p> <p> In the context of a High Court award, the congregation then undertook a comprehensive review of its capacity to meet all of its obligations, including its outstanding redress contributions.  A final response to the Minister's proposal therefore was not received until 9 September 2015.  In a letter of that date, the congregation stated that as the initial proposal of joint ownership was not accepted by the Minister and as his counter-proposal was not acceptable to either it or to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, it was proceeding with the formal transfer of the sports fields to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  The letter stated that the transfer was to complement the transfer of school properties to the trust in 2008 at an independent valuation as of the transfer date of &euro;430 million.  The letter also stated that the congregation wished to honour its pledge of investment in education and welfare for present and future generations of children in Ireland.  There has been no further communication from the Christian Brothers since.</p></speech>

Obviously, the children and adults who were in various institutions and were the subject of the redress that we are speaking about are all parts of families.  For a long period, many of those families were not recognised.  There are broadly recognised now.  While I understand that the Taoiseach cannot, nor should he try to, dictate the Pope's itinerary in Ireland, given that he will no doubt have a chance to meet him and talk to him either one to one or with other members of the Government and senior members of the hierarchy, he might discuss the most outstanding feature of the recent history of churches in Ireland, which is what happened in the institutions that they ran and governed.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he would be seriously lacking in his responsibilities as leader of people in Ireland by not advising the Pope about what happened in this country, the efforts the Government has made to advance redress, and the lack of support that has been received for almost a decade from various religious congregations-----</p></speech>

In particular, officials in the Department of Education, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the HSE are following through on the completion of the remaining property transfers under the indemnity agreement.  I understand they are near the completion of 11 of them.  Progress is also being made on the completion of the 2009 voluntary offers of &euro;96 million, being contributed in cash and property.  The 2002 indemnity agreement is binding on the parties to it, including the State and the 18 contributing congregations.  It is not possible to open that agreement unilaterally or try to force the party to do something that is not provided for in the agreement.  Regrettably, the 2002 agreement means that the present Government does not have legal mechanisms open to it to compel the religious congregations to meet the 50-50 target or to deliver more rapidly on the voluntary offers made back in 2009.</p>  <p>  Would the State consider taking educational property off the religious?  It would be appreciated that the strong constitutional protection afforded to private property in the Constitution makes it virtually impossible to confiscate congregational property, as has been suggested by some.  Obviously, I believe that a better approach is for the congregation to enhance significantly its cash contributions and to enter into discussions with appropriate Ministers regarding the voluntary transfer of key properties in the education sector and the health sector to the State.</p>  <p>  Pope Francis is a very different kind of Pope, as Deputy Burton is aware.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.235.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800018#Q01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</p><p>The previous Government responded in the D&aacute;il to all nine reports of the Convention on the Constitution.  I will summarise the convention's main recommendations for referenda and the response to them as follows.  In its first report, the convention recommended that the age threshold for candidacy in presidential elections be reduced from 35 years.  A referendum was defeated on this on 22 May 2015.  A recommendation to reduce the voting age to 16 was accepted but a referendum was not held on this matter.  Deputies will be aware that a Private Member's Bill to reduce the voting age to 16 in local and European elections will be before the Seanad tomorrow night.</p><p>In the convention's second report, the reference in Article 41.2 of the Constitution to &quot;a woman's life within the home&quot; was considered.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to holding a referendum on this issue.</p><p>In its third report, the Convention recommended an amendment to the Constitution to provide for same-sex marriage.  A referendum on marriage equality was held on 22 May 2015 and was passed by a majority of 62.1%.</p><p>The convention's fourth report made recommendations on the electoral system.  A recommendation for a referendum to permit the appointment of people other than Oireachtas Members as Ministers was not accepted, as the Constitution already allows the Taoiseach to nominate as Ministers two persons who have not been elected to the Oireachtas but who have been nominated to the Seanad.  The recommendation that Ministers be required to resign their D&aacute;il seats on appointment to office was not accepted.  The convention did not put forward proposals on how the resultant D&aacute;il vacancies might be filled.</p><p>In respect of the fifth report, on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, Deputies will be aware that I recently announced that the Government has decided to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution to allow Irish citizens resident outside the State, including those in Northern Ireland, to vote in Irish presidential elections.  Extending the franchise in presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State gives rise to a range of legal, policy and practical issues.  To have an informed public debate on this, the Government published a detailed options paper last week to set out the range of options available to give effect to the recommendation of the Convention on the Constitution.</p><p>As regards the sixth report, on the offence of blasphemy, the Programme for a Partnership Government<b></b>says that a referendum will be held on removing the offence from the Constitution.</p><p> The seventh progress report made recommendations relating to D&aacute;il reform, some of which would have involved a referendum.  The House will be aware that Standing Orders were amended in January last year to provide for the direct election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot and the selection of the Chairs of Oireachtas committees on a proportional basis using the d'Hondt system.  These steps were in line with recommendations made by the convention and did not require a referendum.</p> <p> The programme of D&aacute;il reform in the current D&aacute;il builds on these reforms introduced by the previous Government.  It reflects many of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  Moreover, the programme for a partnership Government commits to a referendum on enhancing the reference to the Ceann Comhairle in the Constitution.</p> <p> As regards the convention's eighth report, the programme for a partnership Government states that this report, which deals with economic, social and cultural rights, will be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for consideration of the substantial questions it raises on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware that a Private Members' Bill to amend Article 45 of the Constitution and insert a provision on the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was before the House last week.</p> <p> The convention's ninth report did not make recommendations for constitutional change.</p> <p> There are no plans otherwise to implement Constitutional Convention recommendations for referendums that were not accepted by the last Government other than as set out in the programme for a partnership Government document.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800019#R00200"><p>We know that the last Government failed to implement many of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention, of which I was a member.  In fact, during a one-hour debate in this Chamber, four of the reports of the Convention were dealt with.  That was an insult to those who took part and made the recommendations.  The proposals put were dismissed out of hand.  That was a pity because of the time and effort people put in.</p>  <p>  When does the Taoiseach intend to produce the wording for the referendum on blasphemy and for the referendum on the removal of the provision relating to the position of women in the home in the Constitution?</p>  <p>  Since the current Government was formed, has the Taoiseach given consideration to looking again at some of the issues the last convention proposed that future conventions should consider?  I realise the Citizens' Assembly is dealing with the issue of repeal of the eighth amendment.  However, other issues and recommendations were raised at the time by the Constitutional Convention, which was made up of citizens as well as politicians.  It was a good mix for the purposes of informing those of us in this House and in the Seanad how people from various sectors and parts of society viewed the issues raised at the convention.  Certain outstanding issues have never been addressed and are not addressed in the Taoiseach's reply.  Specifically, what are the dates for the referendums that the Taoiseach promised when the Government was formed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800019#R00300"><p>Of all the referendums in all the world, the one the Taoiseach announced on the flight to the United States was rather funny.  The Constitutional Convention recommended that the voting age be reduced to 16 years of age and that economic social and cultural rights be enshrined in the Constitution.  I would have thought the removal of the reference to the role of women was somewhat more pressing, given its archaic and sexist connotations of the duties of women being limited to the home.  I am surprised the Government has not been taken to court over the reference to women not needing to find employment.  The same applies to the removal of blasphemy.</p>  <p>  The recommendation the Government has chosen to introduce a referendum for relates to voting rights for citizens abroad or in the North for presidential elections.  I would have thought that was not the most pressing of the recommendations listed.</p>  <p>  Of course the most obvious recommendation relates to the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  The Government has shoved that into another assembly.  The eighth amendment is a long-overdue deletion.  While the Citizens' Assembly and the Taoiseach are dithering, women are being denied access to proper treatment for their health.  Prosecutions are taking place in the North of people who have received safe medical abortion pills.  These same pills are used by women in the Republic who go to the North to get them.  Dawn raids have taken place.  I hope that will be taken on by the Northern Ireland Assembly and by Sinn F&eacute;in, which is now the largest party in the North.  That outrage must stop.  Surely the Taoiseach would agree that these are far more pressing issues than the franchise for the presidential elections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800019#R00400"><p>There are many pressing issues in this increasingly failed State.  However, there is no greater emergency than the housing and homelessness emergency.  The report of the Constitutional Convention was absolutely clear in its instruction to the Government on the issue of housing.  Fully 84% voted at the Convention for the right to housing to be inserted into the Constitution.  The Government has done nothing about that.</p>  <p>  The convention also overwhelmingly voted for all the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to be inserted into the Constitution.  Yet, this week, the Government is going to vote down Deputy Pringle's Bill on the matter.  Later today, I will bring a Bill to insert the right to housing into the Constitution by referendum.  However, the Government refuses to support the insertion of these rights into the Constitution and it intends to vote down the Bill.  This is despite the fact that the convention set up by the Taoiseach has called for it.</p>  <p>  Why on earth were the non-housing related economic, social cultural rights referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government?  It was perfectly right to refer the housing question to the committee but it gave us the disaster that is the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness document.  Why were all the other rights demanded in the report referred to the housing committee?  What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?</p></speech>

It was once accepted practice that a detailed consideration of policy implications would be published in advance of a particular referendum and a genuine political consensus was sought before proceeding.  However, we have got to the stage where little is prepared in advance.  For example, nowadays we wait until the campaign to have any formal independent impact review of the proposals.  I put it to the Taoiseach that before the next referendum, we should first agree a process to follow in preparing for a referendum.  A formal White Paper should be published in advance of a referendum on the specific implications of the proposal and a review of the potential costs.  I am unsure what is delaying the establishment of the Oireachtas budget office.  Anyway, until we establish other independent review structures, will the Taoiseach agree to publish a White Paper and a cost review of all amendments thus far proposed by the Government?  Will the Government facilitate such a review for Opposition proposals?</p></speech>

Referendums have been held on prohibition of the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the Nice treaty, the protection of human life in pregnancy, the Treaty of Lisbon, twice, the Houses of the Oireachtas inquiries, judges' remuneration and the treaty on stability.  The costs came to &euro;11 million, &euro;10.8 million, &euro;15 million, &euro;22.2 million, &euro;14.8 million and so on.  I agree that-----</p></speech>

I agree that there should be a process to set out the structure, strategy and timing for a referendum.</p>  <p>  The convention made many recommendations to the Government.  The Government did not accept all of them.  However, we are waiting for the report of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment.  This should be made before the end of June.  The Government has not discussed whether a referendum or referenda should be held this year, or, if so, which referenda should be held.</p>  <p>  A comment was made on voting by emigrants living abroad.  This issue has been around for a long time.  Philadelphia was a place many Irish emigrated to directly after the famine and in the years since then.  This issue has always been raised with the diaspora.  It might not be of interest to those who are registered here.  However, I will use the example of the Brexit referendum in Britain.  While 5.5 million people were entitled and registered to vote as expatriates, only 26,000 took up that option.</p><p>It may not be of great importance in other countries but, in terms of Irish emigrants and the Irish diaspora, when the issues are dealt with here, I believe there will be a good response.  We must define a new electoral register and the conditions and criteria for those who will apply, which will be done by 2025.  I agree with and will try to get an analysis for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin of the range involved.  I also agree that, in respect of any decision made by the Government on a referendum, a process should be set out which is clear for everyone to discuss.<br/><br/>In respect of the eighth report referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the programme for Government says the following:</p><blockquote>The eighth report of the Constitutional Convention on economic, social and cultural rights recommended that the State progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights subject to maximum available resources, that this duty be recognisable by the courts, and that specific additional rights on housing be inserted into the Constitution.  Due to the substantial questions raised on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources, we will refer this report to the new Oireachtas Committee on Housing for consideration.</blockquote><p>Obviously, it will have to consider more than housing.  It must also deal with social and cultural rights.  Inserting such provisions into the Constitution and making them recognisable by the courts would clearly raise very substantial questions and that is an issue on which we must deliberate here.</p></speech>

I offered the sympathy of the Irish Government to the British people and offered any assistance that may be required.  The Prime Minister confirmed that the injuries suffered by an Irish person were not life-threatening.  We also spoke about the ongoing negotiations at Stormont towards the re-establishment of power-sharing in Northern Ireland.</p><p>While I did see party leaders from Northern Ireland at the funeral of Martin McGuinness in Derry on 23 March, there was no opportunity for bilateral meetings with them.  It is deeply disappointing that the Northern Ireland parties were unable to reach agreement on key issues to allow for the formation of a new Executive before yesterday's 4 p.m. deadline.  This means that the people of Northern Ireland will continue to be without political leadership at this critical time as the UK prepares to commence the Brexit process tomorrow with the triggering of Article 50.  I expect to speak to the British Prime Minister again tomorrow.  The Irish and British Governments have engaged intensively with the parties over the course of the past three weeks.  I have kept in close touch throughout with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who, along with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, has made every effort to facilitate agreement.  In its role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish Government will continue to do all in its power to facilitate agreement to get the Northern Ireland institutions back up and running as soon as possible.  I would urge all of the parties to explore every possible avenue to resolution in a spirit of goodwill and compromise.</p><p>  I met the Welsh First Minister, Mr. Carwyn Jones, in Cardiff on Friday 10 March.  We discussed the close relationship between Ireland and Wales and the importance of the Holyhead and Pembroke ports for trade and travel between these islands, as well as general issues of concern arising in a Brexit context.</p><p>  The Government has a clear and comprehensive Brexit plan.  This includes a deep analysis conducted across Government covering a range of models for the future UK relationship with the EU.  Substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify the key strategic policy and operational risks and impacts.  This work is now being intensified and prioritised across all Government Departments and agencies.</p><p>  The next meeting of the Cabinet committee on Brexit is provisionally set for 11 April 2017.  I expect to speak to Prime Minister May tomorrow.  Obviously, we will respond to her letter and the European Council and Commission will respond in due course.</p></reply>

Basically, the Article 50 process will begin tomorrow and it is absolutely clear that we are not prepared for it.  I accept that there has been a lot of activity but there is no public evidence that we have detailed proposals or have made preparations for different possible outcomes.  I welcome Mr. Barnier's mention of the parity he intends to give to Northern Ireland but that is just one of many issues with which we must deal.</p>  <p>  The British Government has accepted that Brexit will involve an enormous legislative workload.  I noted last week that the UK Government is now grappling with the fact that it may not have enough personnel or capacity to deal with the huge legislative impact, particularly in terms of EU-UK agreements.  If, for example, we get a deal on the common travel area, it is inevitable that we will need legislation to copperfasten that.  If we get a reciprocal deal relating to access to education and health services, which is what the common travel area is all about, namely, a seamless interaction in services right across the board between the UK and Ireland, we will need legislation for that.  What arrangements are in place to begin preparing the relevant measures?  Given that there is already a backlog of legislation, how does the Government propose that this extra challenge be met?  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on that.</p></speech>

I will concentrate, in the short time available, on the collapse of talks yesterday in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach is well aware of the goings on in the weeks since the election and the failure by the DUP in particular to engage in a positive way in the talks.  Given that the current British Government has a specific duty to live up to the obligations and commitments to which it and previous British Governments signed up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Fresh Start agreement and so forth, does the Taoiseach believe that an indication from the UK Government that it will act on an Acht na Gaeilge or a bill of rights might dissolve the negativity that exists within the DUP and negate the obstacles to a positive outcome?  Everybody wishes to see the Assembly up and running properly again and a Northern Ireland Executive being formed but that will not happen if the current approach by the DUP continues and if that party is backed up, in terms of legacy issues, by the British Government.  Will the Taoiseach reiterate the position that Irish Governments must take and put it up to the British Government to live up to its commitments and obligations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800020#S03100"><p>The Taoiseach mentioned the fact that he passed on his sympathies and condolences to Prime Minister May after the atrocious attack in London last week.  We all condemn that attack as absolutely murderous and appalling and sympathise with the innocent victims.  I wonder how many more of these atrocities have to take place, not just close to us in London or Paris, but also those that continue every single day in Mosul, as we speak, in Syria, where hundreds have been killed in the past week, and in Afghanistan, where 1,400 people have been killed in over 1,000 airstrikes, mostly carried out by the US?  How many more of these atrocities, whether in the countries to which I refer - and which are rarely mentioned - or closer to home, as we saw last week, have to occur before somebody such as the Taoiseach says to Teresa May that the best way to stop terrorism is to stop participating in terrorism?  We are participating in terrorism by allowing US troops to go through Shannon Airport on their way to kill 1,400 people in Afghanistan, not to mention the 1 million dead in Iraq and a state that is destroyed.  The idea that this would stop atrocities in the West has been proven wrong by appalling events like the one that took place last week in London.  When is the Taoiseach going to come to the realisation that we need to stop participating in terrorism ourselves or we will continue to be appalled by the sort of atrocious attack we saw last week?</p></speech>

The UK Prime Minister will move Article 50 tomorrow.  That means sending a letter to the President of the European Council.  The Council will present its draft response &mdash; it is only a draft response &ndash; by Friday.  From our point of view, it is important that the draft would cover and refer to the main issues applicable here in Ireland, including the peace process, the Border, the common travel area, our trading relationships and our place in the European Union.  These will all be considered and, I hope, signed off in terms of the ground rules for negotiation on 29 April.  It is from then on that the real negotiation will start in respect of the issues that will arise.  The common travel area is a priority for us.  It has been in place since 1922.  I refer to the acquired rights of the Irish and English.  We will prioritise this in the negotiations with the European Union and bilaterally with Britain.</p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's question, it is imperative that the British Government lives up to its responsibility in implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement.  I point out to the Deputy that the Democratic Unionist Party was not in existence when the Good Friday Agreement was formed.  The issue of the Irish language-----</p></speech>

It is something that everybody would not find intrusive.  I have hopes regarding the options being considered by the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire.  I do not support direct rule and nobody wants more elections in the North.  Therefore, there is a period of extension which will run through the recess in the Commons over the next couple of weeks.  I hope this matter can be resolved.  I spoke briefly to the Deputy's party leader in Derry the other day about this very issue, and I also spoke briefly to the Secretary of State.  There was not much time for long discussions.  I hope that an arrangement can be put together and that the parties, principally Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party, will form an Executive and have a common set of objectives.  It is very important that the voice of Northern Ireland leaders be heard in respect of what they consider to be the important issues to be dealt with there.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's point, nobody condones the events that have led to the loss of innocent lives, whether in South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Mosul or so many other locations.</p></speech>

This was also the case in the United States.  The individual in the most recent case, in London, had travelled up from the south of the country on one of many trips to that city.  In 80 seconds of terrorist activity he carried out the mayhem that caused loss of life to innocent people.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question except to say that the geopolitical circumstances of many areas around the world are such that there are now 40 different wars or conflicts, none of which is on EU soil.  That is not to say, however, that people should not be vigilant considering what has happened in EU countries in recent times.</p></speech>

I believe that is necessary because it has often been cited that the constitutional protections regarding private property are a block to establishing a secure right to housing.  That is something of an excuse put forward by political parties of the establishment in this country, mostly Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which wish to protect the rights of landlords, developers and the property-owning class to make money out of property and housing.  Nonetheless, it is important to clarify the Constitution and insert this imperative so that it becomes an obligation and duty of any Government to secure what is the most basic right, namely, the right to a secure, dignified and appropriate roof over one's head.  This is something the current Government has singularly failed to do, as have previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.</p><p> I was not aware until recently that, at the time of the debate on the Lisbon treaty, one of the derogations the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government sought from the Charter of Fundamental Rights was, incredibly, in respect of the article on the right to housing.  This indicates the disposition of both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which we saw last week with their position on Deputy Pringle's Thirty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are absolutely resistant to establishing a right to housing in the Constitution.  This is despite the fact that 84% of those involved with the Constitutional Convention, which the Government set up, said they wanted the right to housing to be inserted into the Constitution.  Even its own body has injuncted the Government to establish this right.  We have an unprecedented housing emergency that gets worse by the day.  The Government's plans have utterly failed to address this but it still resists inserting the right to housing in the Constitution.  This is the most elementary right.  A Government which cannot secure the basic right to put a roof over the heads of our citizens does not deserve to be in office.  If it cannot do that, what the hell can it do?  It self-evidently cannot do that.  Rebuilding Ireland is an abject and utter failure.  Every day the situation gets worse.  It is all because of the Government&rsquo;s ideological commitment to private interests which make money from property.</p> <p> Last week, I raised the case of a young homeless woman, Sinead, who was told she had to travel 12 km with her young daughter to Francis Street.  In fairness, I did get a call from the Minister because he was obviously embarrassed by this.  Sinead is now self-accommodated in a hotel in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  However, she told me this morning it is only until 7 April, when she will be left insecure again.  Will she be put into squalid tenement housing, as some people are, or accommodation with chronic damp, full of drug users, as others have been?  Alternatively, will the State have a legal obligation to give her a secure roof over her head?  What about child welfare?  The homeless child is subject to all of this.</p> <p> What about the case of Antonia, a woman with two children, whose father suffers from motor neuron disease?  She has a four-bed housing need and was granted housing priority in 2012.  In the past few weeks, however, she has been given notice to quit by her landlord.  When average rents in D&uacute;n Laoghaire are &euro;2,300, housing assistance payment, HAP, offers &euro;1,900 for housing which does not exist.  This is what is going on.  This is the human suffering.</p> <p> Will the Government listen to the Constitutional Convention, take seriously the housing emergency and support this Bill to insert the right to housing into our Constitution?</p></speech>

I hope we get to Committee Stage at some point in the future, although it looks like it might the distant future in light of the many Private Members&rsquo; Bills being tabled.  However, we endeavour to try and bring forward legislation which we feel would have a meaningful impact.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to make it a legislative requirement that there would be a statutory declaration by consultants, clinicians and other medical practitioners in the context of donations or gifts made to them by pharmaceutical companies and other companies involved in the health care sector.  The purpose of this is to bring transparency to the whole issue where, at times, people may receive a gift or some other service from a company which might be providing medicines, therapies or technologies to either the clinician or to broader health sector.  This is a meaningful and purposeful Bill.  I do not believe it would put an extraordinary burden on individuals to set up a statutory declaration of gifts worth over &euro;600 which would have to be registered with the Medical Council.</p><p>In the years ahead, there will be significant advances in medical technologies, medicines, fourth-generation medicines and orphan drugs.  In that context, it is important that there is a full transparency and openness in terms of who is funding who in health care.  With this particular issue, it would be a requirement of clinicians and medical practitioners.  In some hospitals and other HSE services, certain front-line practitioners are funded by health care companies.  While we welcome the fact that they are providing the service, equally, and importantly, it must be open and transparent to ensure that there can be no perceived or actual conflicts of interest, particularly as we are talking about serious ethical issues and significant sums of public moneys in the health system.</p><p>While I am not ascribing any ethical misdemeanour to any individual clinician, who is overseeing those prescribing medicines in the context of trends relating to companies and medicines?  If there was a register whereby all clinicians and medical practitioners would be obliged to make a statutory declaration once a year for gifts over &euro;600, I believe it would bring transparency to the issue.  The term &ldquo;declarable incomings&rdquo; relates to payment or a service from a medical equipment supplier, agents of a pharmaceutical company or others.  A &ldquo;gift&rdquo; means a voluntary transfer of money grant for research, bursary service or property without compensation above a value of &euro;600.  There is a role in this legislation for the Minister to ensure the establishment of the statutory declaration with the Medical Council.  In the event of a medical practitioner failing to declare, the sanction will be referral to the Medical Council.</p><p>The reason I tabled this Bill is because some eminent clinicians came to me and expressed concern that the issue of pharmaceutical companies interacting with clinicians, and supporting them in a meaningful way, is becoming more pervasive in Ireland and across the western world.  In a previous life as a Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I always supported the collaboration of business companies, pharmaceutical companies, universities and the State.  We must also ensure, however, that there are clean lines of demarcation and that there is no overlapping or greying of the ethical barriers critical to health care.</p><p>I know this Bill will have to be taken in Private Members&rsquo; time.  To be honest, we need a lot of Private Members&rsquo; time to get through the number of Bills backing up in the system.  If we could pick out a few from time to time and give new politics an opportunity to work in a non-partisan, bipartisan, tripartisan or whatever way, Bills such as this would be meaningful.  It may annoy some people and make others uncomfortable.  For the good of health care, openness and transparency and ensuring that medical practitioners have no suspicions about how they are funded, this Bill is critically important.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

The child care regulations introduced for newly-registering preschool services on 30 June 2016, and for existing services on 31 December 2016, require all staff working directly with children to have at least a major award at level 5 on the national qualifications framework in early childhood care and education or a qualification deemed by the Minister to be equivalent.  As the Deputy will be aware, this regulation has been extensively welcomed as being in the best interests of children.</p><p>I recognise, however, the impact increased regulation is having on community settings &ndash; from my own experience, from a number of meetings I have had with providers and representative groups and from the early years forum I established to ensure that providers&rsquo; voices are heard.  In 2017, I provided for &euro;1 million of additional funding to be made available to child care providers who have been facilitating the training of community employment participants to ensure that regulatory changes do not impact on service delivery or the availability of child care places.  Officials have been working with Pobal and Childcare Committees Ireland to get funding out to services affected by the change in respect of community employment scheme participants and I understand that contracts to enable payment have now issued to services.  Funds will be disbursed without delay once these contracts are signed.  Funding will be provided in two phases, the first of which is to cover advertising and recruitment costs, while the second will follow more detailed financial analysis of services in the coming weeks.</p><p>In addition, funding of &euro;14.5 million will be made available for the first time in 2017 for non-contact time to recognise the increasing volume of work done outside of direct contact hours with children. </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The sector has taken the initiative of commissioning and completing research highlighting the challenges that they face and I am acutely aware that we need to get the funding model right for these services.  This is a complex issue and I hope that providers will appreciate that we have had to move to tackle the most urgent issues first, designing a new model of eligibility for families - the affordable childcare scheme, tackling the community employment scheme issue, and providing funding for non-contact time for the first time.  I remain committed to addressing other sustainability and quality issues, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The last two budgets delivered a 35% increase each year in funding for child care.  However, it is recognised that there is a need to continue to invest and a strong case will be put forward for more resources in 2018 and beyond.</p></speech>

I tabled this question because a number of community child care providers have contacted me.  As the Minister will be aware, a number of meetings regarding this issue have been held, particularly in the south of the country.  I asked the Minister for Social Protection a few weeks ago to indicate the number of workers participating on community employment schemes in a child care setting and he replied that at the end of December 2016, the number was 1,816 participants.  That did not include T&uacute;s workers.  While they would not be engaged in trying to get a FETAC level 5 qualification, the participants on that scheme were possibly taken in under a ratio.  A total of 800 participants were sponsored by child care providers.  The number of such participants in the rural social scheme, RSS, is 41.  As the Minister will be aware from her contact with child care providers, they have relied on those numbers.  The child care providers have not received funds.  If the &euro;1 million fund was divvied out among the more than 1,800 participants, it would not sustain a month's wages for them.  Therefore, there is a crisis in the sector.</p></speech>

I am aware of these challenges from my meetings, from the research that has been done by child care providers that has been presented to me, as well as from the work done by Childcare Committees Ireland.  I have described that two phases of sustainability responses will be put in place.  The first is the initial grant and the second is where we are getting more people to assist us in going into those services whose sustainability is challenged to analyse their finances and see what we can further do for them in regard to the &euro;1 million fund.</p></speech>

In one cr&egrave;che in Clare that has a staff of ten, it relies on community employment workers for four positions.  I would love to know if the Minister's Department has done an analysis on that.  How many such workers were close to qualifying in terms of their major award?  If they had started in 2013 or 2014, were some of them almost qualified or could a grace period have been provided to allow them finish their qualification, with support from the community child care sector?  When one is doing something like this in January, one is looking at recruitment, staffing and advertising.  It is a very difficult time with providers taking in children under the next phase of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  I welcome what the Minister has said but the community sector is really under pressure at present.</p></speech>

She will appreciate that my Department gave a substantial lead-in period to allow for most of the members within the child care and early education sector to prepare for and comply with the regulations.  I fully understand it was not possible for that to be the case, particularly with regard to some of the people who are providing in the community services context.  I am also aware that even if they had, and I have met with some services who have described some of the difficulties to me, they still would be under pressure in terms of sustainability.  One of the reasons for that, particularly in those contexts, is that they are reaching out to do effectively more beyond what child care providers are doing in other contexts, and one of the other things we are looking at is how to ensure there is enough support going into those services, perhaps from other programmes of funding, in addition to the child care provision that I am providing.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, there has been a great deal of discussion regarding recent revelations in Tuam.

My question relates to the steps the Government intends to take to ensure that any of those possible unmarked graves are not interfered with.</p></reply>

The reality is that many of the buildings and sites which accommodated mother and baby homes and county homes have evolved significantly in the intervening years.  These locations are now being used for a wide array of different activities and purposes, ranging from housing estates to private health care facilities and hotels.  In some cases nothing remains of the former institutions and the locations are not in public ownership.  In these circumstances, we would have to be clear about the exact purpose of seeking any injunction.</p>  <p>  With regard to the former home in Tuam, we know that the site which was recently excavated by the commission is owned by Galway County Council.  I have visited the site twice and it includes green spaces and children's play facilities alongside the memorial garden, which was maintained for years by local residents. The site was sealed and secured by the commission upon conclusion of its excavation.  While the commission has advised that it has now concluded its physical excavations at Tuam, it has not yet reached any formal conclusions about the site.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, the local coroner will wish to conclude his own formal processes and to decide on any further inquiries he may wish to make.  While it will take some time to address all the questions which have arisen, I want to ensure that there is a sensitive and inclusive process of engagement with the local community, survivors and other parties with personal and family connections in respect of this site.  </p>  <p>  In the case of other relevant locations, the commission continues its work to examine the reporting of deaths and burial arrangements with regard to the 14 mother and baby homes and the identified sample of county homes.  As an independent investigation, it is a matter for the commission to decide the approach it takes to these investigations.  I have no role in these decisions.  However, I am satisfied that the commission has sufficient powers, expertise and resources to progress these investigations in the public interest.  It has clearly demonstrated that it can do so.  </p></speech>

This matter was the subject of the Private Members' motion we discussed last week, the fate of which is as yet unclear.  It will be voted on on Thursday but may well be defeated.  If it is defeated, will the Minister consider some of the valuable proposals in the motion?  One proposal sought to put in place an injunction or possibly other means to ensure that these sites of possible interest are protected in order that they can be investigated.  Notwithstanding the points the Minister made that the uses of some of the sites have changed and many of them have been closed for several decades, not all of them have been.  Some of them were still open until the late 1980s and early 1990s and some remain as they were.  While I accept that the commission has a specific role in the matter, it cannot put in place any injunction or take any executive action, for want of a better term, to ensure that the sites are not interfered with.  That is purely the remit of the Government and it will have documentation from the commission of investigation to guide it in the manner in which it acts.</p></speech>

A certain amount of reflection and work is needed in order to make decisions to put in place the best response so that the whole truth is recovered.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issue of an injunction, to which the Deputy refers in the question, I am advised that such applications cannot be sought on a preventative basis and that they are temporary in nature and used to prevent an imminent action from damaging the interests of the party who makes the application.  I am not aware of specific circumstances in which such a consideration applies.</p></speech>

On 27 July last year, the Minister issued a press release that stated that the commission was to report back in September.  The Minister has committed to publishing such a report by the end of the month.  It has still not been published, to my knowledge.  I presume it will be published in the coming days.  When does she intend to publish it?  Furthermore, will the Minister outline the reason for the delay?  The second interim report has been with her and her Department for some six months.  This has caused a great deal of concern and anxiety among survivors.  It is important we get a sense of the reason for the inordinate delay in the publication of the report.  Furthermore, it has been reported that the report does not recommend an expansion of the terms of reference.  This being the case, I believe that the commission is no longer fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I will take up some of the other issues later in response to other questions.</p>  <p>  Again, regarding the question of making decisions to bring forward injunctions, the Deputy argues the Government has a responsibility to do so and that it is something we should consider.  I am saying I am not necessarily unwilling to consider it but I understand from the advice I have received that in order to do so we need to have it brought to our attention that there are some real concerns about a preventative measure in respect of different sites that may require an injunction on the basis of people who have an interest in that regard.  I am open to hearing from these people and reconsidering the issue.</p></speech>

What we are putting in place this year will benefit children and families for generations to come.  It is vital we get this right.  As the Deputy acknowledges, there is much work to do.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is well aware, as a member of the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, that the committee is involved in progressing the necessary legislation and there are business processes to be developed and data protection issues to address as well as a new and robust IT system.</p>  <p>  We will need to integrate data from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, and testing of the systems will have to be rigorous.  This system must work for all families, no matter their circumstances.  Despite the huge workload, my officials and those in other Government Departments and Pobal are determined that families will start getting extra money this autumn.  This is our top priority.  In order to guarantee these payments, some other work will take longer than expected.  For example, the fully automated system will not be ready when families start benefiting from the increased subsidies.  We are working with Pobal to ensure that our interim measures will deliver without any excessive administrative burden.</p>  <p>  I do not want to put any extra unnecessary work on parents or the dedicated providers.  I fully recognise that people need information.  In the next few weeks, I will be in a position to provide a detailed update on delivery plans.  Full information will then be made available to the public.  However, let me emphasise that this is a huge undertaking.  A rushed system which does not work would be a major setback which could take years to correct.</p></speech>

I hear what she is saying, that we will pay the price for a rushed effort in the long run.  However, many parents and child care providers are asking what will happen in the interim, how they will avail of the scheme, how they will apply for it, where they will find the time to fill out the forms and, if self-employed, whether they will apply to the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, DCYA.  Who will take ownership of the scheme in the interim?  It is clear the priority is that the parents will be able to avail of the funding; how they will access it is the question.  In the interim, it is back to paper, but who will take ownership?  I assume the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will do so, but where will the parents go?  Will they go to the child care provider again or will they have to sit at home and manually apply for the scheme?  If they apply but do not have all the information, for example, from the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners, where will the shortfall be caught from?</p></speech>

My Department is taking responsibility for the scheme and, as I have indicated, we intend within the next short while to outline our answers to all the questions the Deputy asks.  I accept, and I appreciate that she accepts, that significant and complex work must be done in respect of the IT system and that in order to do it we need more time than we had anticipated.  However, it is better to get it right because it is the basis for generations to come.  In addition to continuing this substantial work, my Department has been engaged in developing a set of interim measures which we believe will work effectively to ensure that parents and providers will receive the moneys we have promised from September 2017.  We will have a full information programme to identify the ways in which providers and parents will access this, and that delivery will be as streamlined as possible.</p></speech>

That is fantastic because hers is probably one of the hardest working Departments.</p>  <p>  She is right that the work required is significant and very complex.  However, the providers need to know when the parents come to them to ask questions and enrol in the scheme if they are to tell those parents through which office they will do so in the interim.  What are we saying to the providers?  Are we saying that funding could be found for them for extra non-contact hours?  There will be a significant workload for them.  Does the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have any plans to announce any extra little bit of funding so that they would be able to take on the extra workload that will now be put upon them?</p></speech>

I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  The focus is not only on the interim measures being clearly communicated so that everybody knows what to do and where but that they will allow the money be delivered to providers and it is there for parents in September 2017.  In addition, the focus of the work has been to ensure that the path we choose will have the smallest administrative burden possible.  The way in which providers and parents engage will be different from when we have all the bells and whistles of the fully-built information technology, IT, system but we anticipate it will have the smallest administrative burden for both parties.</p></speech>

I am also very concerned that the voices and concerns of workers are not being heard throughout this whole process of change.  What measures is the Minister implementing as part of the new affordable childcare scheme to tackle the problem of poor working conditions in the early years sector and the high turnover rate of staff and the acute staffing shortages?</p></reply>

This affects the quality of service offered to children.  Addressing these issues is a priority concern for me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  As my Department is not the employer, however, I have no direct control over wages or working conditions. </p>  <p>  Fundamentally, the problem relates to the historically low level of public investment in early years services.  In last year&rsquo;s budget, I secured an increase of 35% in funding for the early years sector and I shall keep pushing for further investment.  The total level of investment is well below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average of 0.8% of gross domestic product, GDP, and still further behind the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, recommendation of 1% of GDP to secure an early years system that is high quality, affordable and accessible for all.</p>  <p>  Within my Department several changes have been implemented to support the professionalisation of the early years sector.  For example, within the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, the higher capitation grant provides additional financial support where the preschool leader is qualified to national framework of qualifications, NFQ, level 7 or above.  It is a measure that supports the employment of more highly qualified staff, though it cannot guarantee higher wages.  To support higher qualifications, we have also recently awarded a learner fund bursary to assist attainment of level 7 and it is hoped to repeat this process for those graduating in time for the 2018 intake of children into those services.</p>  <p>  The affordable childcare scheme will significantly increase the level of public investment in the sector and it will create a framework for further future investment. </p>  <p>  To help support the future development of the affordable childcare scheme, as well as the ECCE programme, officials within the Department have commenced work on scoping the requirements to inform a tender process for the independent review of the cost of quality child care.</p></reply>

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs is preparing a report and I am its rapporteur.  We have been speaking to workers throughout the country.  The wages do not reflect the qualifications and expectations of those working in the sector.  I understand there has been an increase in capitation rates but it is not enough.  There are many young people coming through the system who want to stay in the child care profession but cannot because they are either on or under the minimum wage.  Many are signing on during the summer months and some people are caught in an anomaly because they are considered self-employed but do not enjoy any of the benefits of being self-employed.  There are many different angles on this.  One of the key points workers in the sector make is that they do not want their voices to be forgotten in this affordable childcare scheme.</p></speech>

I look forward to receiving the report because I know how committed the Deputy and her colleagues are in this regard.</p>  <p>  I have also met with a range of representative bodies from the sector regarding the issue of wages and working conditions, including representatives from the Irish Municipal, Public and Civil Trade Union, IMPACT, and the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU. </p>  <p>  I have established the National Collaborative Forum for the Early Years Care and Education Sector, the early years forum, to allow issues of relevance to be discussed with key stakeholders.  The forum has enabled consultation and engagement between me, key Department of Children and Youth Affairs officials, and key representatives of the sector.  I have personally chaired the three meetings of the forum.  At its second meeting, I requested that a section of the group's members meet up, outside the context of the forum, to discuss issues relating to wages, working conditions and the professionalisation of the sector and I look forward to hearing from them in that regard. </p></speech>

As she acknowledges, underinvestment is the elephant in the room.  Capitation rates are not high enough to subsidise an increase in pay for fair wages.  What is the Minister's view of the introduction of a fair pay scale or a living wage?  Would she and the Department support that?  Government should advocate that all contracts costed by the State should provide at least for a living wage and this should begin with the affordable childcare scheme.  Built into this should be a requirement that it is passed on to the workforce employed to deliver the service.  A part of the concern is that the increase in capitation rates will not be passed on as wages because many services are not even ticking over and cannot afford to pass on that increase.

I am aware that the average wage is only just above the minimum wage and is below the living wage.  I have done a lot of work in my political life to encourage us to move towards the living wage and would love to see the early years and education and care sector become an example of that, especially when 18% of staff are now qualified to level 7 or above on the national framework of qualifications yet they are generally receiving payments of &euro;11 per hour for room leaders, &euro;10.56 for educators and assistants and &euro;13.87 for managers.  I am not, however, directly responsible because I am not their employer but we have found very innovative ways of trying to provide investment in the people who are working there, as well as thinking of ways to ensure that somehow these can be passed on and supported by the people who are working.  There is much farther to go in that regard.</p></speech>

This is for very good reasons and I can assure the House that I have no wish whatsoever to delay it unnecessarily.  I want to publish this report as soon as possible and I briefed the Cabinet on the matter again this morning.  I expect to be able to clarify the timeframe for completion of the Government's deliberative process within the coming week.</p><p> As I have previously outlined, given the wide remit of the commission's work, it has been necessary for me to engage with Cabinet colleagues on issues in the report which extend beyond my remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I acknowledge that the process has taken longer than I initially envisaged.  I am very sensitive to the expectations of former residents and their advocates who want to see the contents of the report.</p> <p> I do not believe it would be helpful today to respond to media speculation on the contents of the report in advance of the full report being made public.  Publishing the report has been the focus of my approach since I received it from the commission.  It is open to the commission to recommend any remedies it deems appropriate in light of the findings of its final reports.</p> <p> My Department will contact representative groups to advise of developments in this regard prior to any public announcement.</p> <p> I can assure Deputies that the time being taken by Government to consider this interim report is not hindering progress in the commission's ongoing investigations.</p> <p> My Department has an information line in operation to provide factual information in regard to the commission's remit and its reports to date.  This line is open during office hours and relevant details are available on my Department's website.  There is also a telephone line available for people seeking details of the support available to those affected by these issues.</p></reply>

The Minister said in the D&aacute;il that she would be publishing the second interim report of the commission by the end of this month.  The Minister's answer indicates that will not be the case.  The report has been with the Minister for eight months, since 27 July.  Reading between the lines, there appears to be something in the recommendations that the Government is not keen to implement, such as a proposal for a redress scheme or similar.  I may be wrong about that.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to publish the interim report.  There are many people whose lives have been turned upside down by the information that came out in Tuam and who are very concerned.</p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister about the scoping exercise that she said she would carry out regarding the expansion of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation.</p></speech>

It is a great disappointment to me that I will not be able to deliver on that by the end of this month.  The extension is due to the time required to respond to some of the report's recommendations in a different way than perhaps has been done in the past.  This has proven extremely challenging.</p><p>I am very happy to say that there is significant engagement across Government Department to find that way.  I am having more meetings this week.As I said before, I hope I will soon be able to indicate when I will be ready.</p></speech>

It has probably taken more of my time in the past couple of months than anything else in the Department.  In my discernment, I have decided it is more helpful if the Government can have a little more time to formulate a plan for responding to the recommendations of the commission.

The DEIS plan aims to achieve a more robust assessment framework for identifying schools and allocating resources.  It also seeks to support best practice in schools through inter-agency collaboration.  The educational welfare service of Tusla will be very important in this regard.  The implementation of these and other key goals in the plan will lead to an improved learning experience and outcomes for pupils attending DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  The educational welfare service of Tusla, officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills will be meeting in the coming weeks to discuss the inclusion in the school completion programme of schools that have been included in the DEIS programme for the first time in 2017.  The group will also examine schools that are currently in the school completion programme but do not have DEIS status.  Following these meetings, proposals will be developed and given to me for consideration.  I anticipate that any changes that may result from this process will not come into effect until September 2018 at the earliest.  In this regard, the educational welfare service has confirmed that no changes are planned in relation to the school completion programme for the 2017-18 school year.  No new schools are entering or leaving the programme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs continues to work with the educational welfare service to implement the recommendations of the Economic and Social Research Institute report on the school completion programme and to make sure that children and young people get the best outcome possible for our investment.  Tusla has taken a number of actions to address the findings of that report and to strengthen the operation of the programme for the future.</p>  <p>  I am strongly committed to the continued support and development of the school completion programme.  I believe that the new DEIS plan will play a valuable role in that regard.</p></speech>

I note that she welcomes the delivery of the report and all the positive aspects that DEIS status can bring to a school.  It is therefore even more concerning when DEIS status is taken from a school.</p>  <p>  I recently asked the Minister about the very difficult situation in Kildare where not one school received a new status.  The Minister assured me that DEIS status would not be taken from any school there.  In early March, one of the schools in my constituency, Kildare community school, was informed by letter from the Department that its DEIS status would be taken from it.  I have tried to raise this under Topical Issues since then.  There is an anomaly that the school completion programme is with Tusla and the two cross over, which is why I only have the opportunity to raise it with the Minister.  I ask that this issue be raised when officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs meet with those of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  There are 880 students in Kildare community school.  More than 250 of them are expected to avail of various DEIS supports available.  Of the students, 60% come from DEIS primary schools.  It is a great school but it is dependent on extra supports from the DEIS scheme.</p><p>The school and the community are making great efforts in that regard.  The letter I received from the Department states that the school completion programme, as well as the home-school liaison scheme, will be taken from the school.  That is not good enough, and I want the Minister to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to reverse that decision.</p></speech>

I am saying we need to look at that again, in light of the DEIS review, its focus and its reform.  I am not saying that we will necessarily decouple but the case the Deputy has put to me, and the Minister for Education and Skills also, needs to be listened to in general.  In terms of the particular case, however, I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the Minister for Education and Skills as, clearly, it is within his remit.</p></speech>

It has been identified as a model of best practice by the European Union and the OECD as a targeted programme that increases retention rates in schools and reduces educational disadvantage.  However, I understand that its budget has been reduced and that there may be plans to reduce it further.  Is the Minister committed to reversing the resource cuts to school completion programmes across the country?  Will she instruct Tusla to restore the programme's educational focus?  There are reports that the Department intends to downgrade the programme.  I want the Minister to assure those of us in this House, and the people in the community, that this programme will be consolidated as a proactive, preventative programme rather than a reactive one.  I believe it should come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills as opposed to Tusla.  I appreciate that the Minister will make the Minister for Education and Skills aware of the argument concerning the community school in Kildare but there are wider issues around it also.</p></speech>

Tusla has confirmed that the funding this year is &euro;24.756 million and that there has been no cut in funding for the year 2016-17.  I am not sure where the Deputy is getting that information from and I am not clear on her concerns about the scaling back of this kind of programme.  The opposite is the case.  In terms of school completion, the ambition is to engage in major reform.  That is already taking place in terms of the response of the education and welfare service with a director, who I had the opportunity to meet because of my own concerns in this regard, responding line by line to the different recommendations from the ESRI report to make it even more effective.  That is the first phase with regard to our commitment to the school completion programme.</p></speech>

It is to do with the fact that the new single affordable childcare scheme will offer less support for unemployed families than for families where the parents are at work.  I know the intention is to support people going out to work and so on but it will disadvantage some of the poorest children in the country.  We engaged with the Minister on this issue in the committee.  Is further consideration being given to the concern, particularly of the community child care sector?</p></reply>

The highest rates of subsidy will go to families with the lowest incomes.  In particular, the maximum rate of subsidy will go to families with net income below &euro;22,700, which means that all families below the relative income poverty line will receive the maximum hourly rate of subsidy.  For school-age children, the maximum subsidy will be &euro;3.76 per hour, which amounts to &euro;38 per week for a two-hour per day after-school session.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure a balanced approach to eligibility: while people will qualify for a subsidy based purely on income, parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available.  When parents are engaged in work, including part-time work and labour market activation programmes, or in education or training they will be eligible for an enhanced hours subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, child care will be subsidised on a standard hours basis of up to 15 hours per week.</p>  <p>  I believe that this is a reasonable approach.  It will mean that this scheme is open, albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours, to parents who stay at home to care for their children and are not taking part in work or training but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of child care per week.  In the case of school-going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours child care applies to non-term time.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that where a parent is at home and not engaged in work or study, the family will not benefit from subsidised after-school child care.  However, I believe it is important that the scheme should actively support labour market participation through linking the number of hours of subsidy to a family&rsquo;s need for child care for the purpose of work, education or training.</p></reply>

This is a genuine concern, particularly of the community sector.  I acknowledge that labour market participation is one of the objectives of the scheme but the main objective is child-centred and child-focused.  I do not know if the Minister has met the people who are directly concerned about this issue but there is a genuine fear that in some cases community child care services would not be able to afford to continue.  An additional concern, apart from the concern around the children themselves, is that some of these services will not be viable under the new scheme.  The legislation has not been passed yet so I do not know if there is an opportunity to consider the effects of this particular element of it but the Minister might do that.</p></speech>

I support the Deputy asking the question and want to place on record again that it is an issue of concern, particularly in that it interacts with the change in regulations, which we have discussed already.  The community services particularly affected are those providing services to children aged up to three years because of the much-reduced ratio they are dealing with in the absence of community employment, CE, workers.  The change in the subsidy means that this aspect of the community sector is at particular risk, and I have spoken to the Minister previously about a number of services in both the north side and south side of my own city, but we should perhaps consider an enhanced capitation of some form for community settings in disadvantaged areas.</p></speech>

On the initial question, I referred in my answer to people who are working, in part-time work or in training versus being unemployed, and we might continue this discussion.  It is about labour market activation but also encouraging people to move into forms of training and if parents are able to do that, those subsidies will be available to them.  It is only right that we encourage that, although I am not saying that we would not necessarily look at that again.  I understand the point about the unemployed but incentivisation in terms of training is really important.  I know it couples with all of the other issues, some of which I have already addressed.</p></speech>

It would also be my concern.  As part of this debate and if we look at it in the context of the committee, we need to look at access to training and requirements in that regard and whether they have changed enough so that people can have that access because, of course, it would not be something I would wish for, as the Deputy appreciates.  At the same time, we have already said that in respect of lone parents who may be in training or education and have access to a certain level of subsidy, it will be no less as we move toward in terms of the transition to the new child care scheme to enable them to complete that training.  I have met many of the people in these services and I understand pretty well what are the issues.  My Department is committed to working with these services one by one.</p></speech>

I engage with them every week.  Last Saturday, I was delighted to join the FAI, the Shamrock Rovers Academy and their young players at the Roadstone Group Sports Club in Kingswood to open a world-class pitch.  It was a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the result of a great partnership supported by the Government which will transform young lives.  At the event, I was able to confirm funding of &euro;380,000 for FAI community initiatives, which have cut anti-social behaviour in many communities.  This will support street and night leagues and soccer leagues for young people who are homeless, as well as regional development officers.  I give this simply as a recent example of my engagement with young people.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, I have visited every province to meet children and teenagers.  The old excuse that young people are not interested in politics does not wash with me.  My experience from Cork to Roscommon and from Dublin to Mayo is that not only are they interested, they have very strong views.  I have engaged with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, Youth Work Ireland and the National Youth Council of Ireland, to name just a few groups, and also with young members of the Traveller community, young prisoners and boys being schooled at the Oberstown campus.</p><p>As Minister, I have responded in a number of ways to the issues they have raised.  Funding is being increased for youth services across the country to &euro;57 million this year, which is a 10% rise.  The first ever LGBTI+ national youth strategy is being delivered.  Young people have been brought in to help form Ireland's response to Brexit and they were directly involved in deciding a future course for the north inner city.  Engagement with young people is ongoing.  Over the Easter break, members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g will attend regional meetings and Brexit is on the agenda for every single one of them.  They alway reports back to me.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>Already we know from a national gathering I hosted at Croke Park that young people are worried Brexit could narrow college choices, jeopardise job prospects and lead to a hard Border on our island.  This is a generation which has grown up in peace and with the freedom to move across our island.  Croke Park told us above all that they do not want that to change.  They do not want a border which would limit educational choice by limiting access to Northern Ireland and British colleges and hamper commercial activity but above all for those living in Border communities, they do not want it becoming a physical reality which interferes in their everyday social lives.  I want to also acknowledge the attendance and participation of Deputies opposite on the day.  These views have been shared with Government and are being acted upon.  I assure the House that young people in all our communities have a voice and I am determined that it will be heard.</p></speech>

I am glad to note the initiatives she set out.  Could she tell me the extent to which she can continue to engage with areas of social or economic deprivation in particular with a view to identifying the issues that affect the families of young people who may be affected by the pressures around them to a greater extent than would normally be the case?  To what extent can she put in place interventions of a positive nature with which these young people can identify and from which they can benefit socially and economically along with the sporting activities that are there, which could also include their health and well-being in general?</p></speech>

I have met a number of national organisations, as the Deputy is aware, on my travels.  When I meet the adults, I always ask if the young people can come to the meetings as well so that I am not just meeting the people who are advocating for them, particularly in the context of For&oacute;ige, the National Youth Council of Ireland, Young Voices and Scouting Ireland.  Many national organisations delivering services for young people are very keen, as am I, not only for us to continue the provision of services and to increase the funding, as I have identified, but to put in place systems and processes to hear what they think we should be doing to support their development and well-being.  My Department has developed a children and young people's participation hub that is one of the best examples throughout Europe in helping us develop these processes to ensure that their voices are not only heard but heard in a way that actually influences policy and legislative change.</p></speech>

When they came together, we heard that they were worried about narrow college choices, jeopardising job prospects and putting a hard border on our island.  Above all, those living in Border communities do not want it to become a physical reality that interferes with their everyday social lives and they do not want a border that would limit their educational choice by limiting access to Northern Ireland and British colleges or that would hamper commercial activities.

One such centre in Dublin city centre closes during the day.  The young people are not put on the street or left to their own devices.  Tusla funds a dedicated service to cater for the young people during the day and afternoons at weekends.  Some of the young people attend school or training courses or have a dedicated project worker such as a youth advocacy programme worker or an Empowerment Plus worker to spend time with them during the day.  The project workers engage with all aspects of young person's needs such as bringing them to meetings, attendance at appointment and arranging meals.  This is to ensure they stay in their emergency situation for as short a period as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 who present as out of home without their parent or parents or guardian or guardians, but Tusla has responsibility for the provision of services to these children.  Tusla considers that a child who has left their family home in an emergency has a wide range of needs, including suitable accommodation.  Children under 16 who present as out of home to emergency services are taken into care.</p><p>Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care or, where their main need is that of accommodation, they may be provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  As the Deputy knows, children become out of home for many reasons, and Tusla has informed me that it is rare for there to be a single trigger event.  It is usually associated with family violence, abuse or ongoing neglect at home, or alcohol and drug addiction.  It may also be caused by a young person who is already in care, leaving their residential placement.  Ultimately, my wish is that we support children to live with their families and, where this is not possible, that we provide the best possible supports and care for children and young people in need.</p></speech>

While staff in homeless emergency accommodation are doing their best, the reality is that there are young people who are on the street and engaging with other young people who are in addiction, who may be out begging or who are engaging in anti-social behaviour.  They are exposed to that, whereas if there were a more dedicated service, they might not get into that kind of behaviour.  I know about the youth advocates, but it is my understanding from the other youth workers in the area who meet these young people that there are not enough of those youth advocates.  There are not enough services for these young people.  I believe that some of the youth advocates are meeting the young people in their cars for a few minutes just to engage with them, so I believe there is a gap there.  It would be good to find out some information on this.  How many are involved and what are these short times they are in emergency services?</p></speech>

They are good questions and I will certainly commit to getting the information identified by the Deputy.  I am very clear that the Deputy's question relates to gaps, even though there is a special project or service there, and I hear what the Deputy is saying.  The gaps may be around there not being enough people involved in that project.  If that is the case, we must ask how many more are needed.  A gap can also be in the kinds of services that are provided as distinct from just the numbers of people offering a service.  Perhaps this could also be looked at.  I think of the north inner city task force and the commitment in that part of the city for the next period of time.  Perhaps that is another area where can take a look at these problems and issues.</p></speech>

Not all these young people are from that area of Dublin.  Some of them are from outside Dublin, from other parts of Ireland, and there are some who are foreign national young people.  It would be good if they could be encouraged, helped and supported to engage with the other youth projects in the area.  Some of the projects are during the day, but others are not.  There is more that can be done with this group.  It was difficult to listen to youth workers saying that these young people are not yet into anti-social behaviour, not yet into addiction and not yet into crime.  There were, however, real fears that this is where they were heading because of the lack of engagement with them.  It would be good if we had more detailed information on this, and we could see where to take it from there.</p></speech>

If the Deputy has any suggestions or recommendations, maybe we can have a conversation or a meeting with my officials later in that regard.  I take the point that these young people are not necessarily just from the place the Deputy represents and where she resides.</p>  <p>  I hear what the Deputy says around the issue.  Whether it is an inter-agency approach or inter-services approach many people are doing lots of different things in various contexts, and yet there are still gaps and they need to take a look at that.  Perhaps it might also be the case that we could find some of the information we need by going to national and local youth organisations, who no doubt are keen on this matter and who would have a view on it.</p></speech>

A number of workers have raised some concerns and issues around AIM in respect of the best interests of the child.  Will the Minister give an update on the implementation of the access and inclusion model? Does she believe it will be accessible to all those children who are in need of extra assistance?</p></reply>

To date, 1,820 children with a disability have benefited from the supports it provides and this number will grow over time.  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Since AIM was launched in June 2016</font>, all universal elements of the model levels one to three have been implemented in line with project timelines.  Specifically, a new higher education programme for leadership for inclusion in early years settings, known as LINC, has been launched with provision for 900 students annually for four years.  The first intake of 900 students commenced the LINC programme in September 2016 and applications have been invited for the next intake of 900 students to commence in September 2017.  In addition to this, an inclusion charter and updated diversity, equality and inclusion guidelines have been published and a national programme of training supports is being rolled out.</p><p>All the targeted elements of AIM, levels four to seven, are also fully operational.  At level four, 50 early years inclusion specialists have been appointed and the special mentoring support service has been rolled out.  I recently approved an additional 18 posts for this service.</p><p>At level five, a national scheme for the provision of specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations has been developed and rolled out.  At level six, 50 additional HSE therapists have been appointed to support the delivery of the necessary therapy services, and at level seven, a national scheme for the provision of additional capitation to support additional assistance in the ECCE setting has also been developed and rolled out.  The funding allocation for AIM in 2017 is &euro;32.42 million.</p></reply>

I will pass on to her some of the concerns that were raised by the workers.  Training, for example, was done on a lottery system.  Access to training was not necessarily available to services that could have really benefited from the training, and some did not get it.  Some services could have waited another year or so for the training and they received it.  It is good to see that the figure of 900 places is an annual figure, but is there some way the training allocations could be a little bit fairer even if it was on first come first served basis rather than a lottery system? While the aim is to have all services receive the training, at the moment it is rolled out a bit unfairly.</p>  <p>  There was also concern from practitioners who previously worked in services that focused on children with additional needs that the mainstreaming into all services of children who have additional needs provides the potential for some children to fall through the system if the inclusion model does not suit them.  It is obviously a welcome measure and I understand the theory behind it, but these are the concerns.  I have run over time so I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

I will bring these concerns back to my officials, particularly on the application for and acceptance onto the LINC programme.  The Deputy wonders if the lottery system is the fairest system there could be.  It is my understanding that this was well thought out and identified.  That is a form and an approach to fairness as distinct from what the Deputy has suggested, such as the first come first served approach.  I am not so sure that this approach would necessarily be fair.  I have spoken to providers also and I am aware that there are different instances or circumstances where, within a particular area, they were willing to share a LINC person if that person was able to be accepted, other than ahead of other settings also.</p><p>Some of those issues are being looked at by my officials but I will ask them to look at them again.  It is important that we be confident that the approach in choosing is as fair as possible.  I think a lottery system is suitable, at least for now.  As I have indicated, this will go on for a number of years; hopefully that gives everyone an opportunity.</p></speech>

I understand it is difficult to pick an approach that works but a lot of people felt they were left out.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have a concern about the under threes.  While I know the access and inclusion model, AIM, pertains specifically to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, when it comes to providing supports for the under threes with additional needs, early intervention is critical in identifying issues.  Are there any schemes or proposals to roll this out further to the under threes, maybe in conjunction with the affordable child care scheme in the future?</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy.  I and my officials are certainly aware that it is a case of the earlier the better, particularly in respect of special needs or forms of disability.  There have been many discussions in that regard and I would further discussion, with the Deputy or even in the context of the committee.  The AIM model and programmes started in September 2016, so 2017 is the first full year of the roll-out and we are looking at reviewing it.  As the roll-out moves on, I think it is something that should be considered.</p></speech>

More often than not, I do not have one question in the lotto.  Today, I am having a lucky streak and I hope it continues.  From what the Minister has said previously, it is clear that she thinks the school completion programme is a success.  She mentioned plans to expand it in 2018.  She might let us know a little more about those plans in her reply.</p></reply>

I believe it is a crucial service for parents, children and schools.  The service is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.  In this regard, the programme enables local communities to develop tailored strategies to maximise participation levels of those at risk of early school leaving.  Tusla's education welfare service has a responsibility to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  It supports regular school attendance, tackles problems of absenteeism and provides a general educational welfare service.  The service receives referrals from school authorities, parents and others relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children. </p><p>As the Deputy knows, a review of the operation of the school completion programme by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, states that there has been an improvement in attendance levels and in the proportion of young people staying in school until leaving certificate.  It also concludes that the school completion programme, along with DEIS, has played an important role.  Tusla has taken a number of actions to strengthen the operation of the programme, such as improving annual retention plans and having discussions with relevant stakeholders on the review findings and on how to strengthen the core functions of the programme.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>I have met with the director of educational welfare services in Tusla to discuss the ongoing reform of the school completion programme. </p><p>The Department of Education and Skills recently published the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, plan for 2017.  I believe the goals outlined in the plan will improve educational opportunity for those who come to education at a disadvantage and will strengthen the capacity of our education and training system to support children and young people in communities with high concentrations of disadvantage.  The educational welfare service of Tusla, officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills will be meeting in the coming weeks to discuss the inclusion in the school completion programme of schools that have been included in the DEIS programme for the first time in 2017.  The group will also examine schools that are currently in the school completion programme but do not currently have DEIS status.  Following these meetings, proposals will be developed and given to me for consideration.  In the interim, my officials will continue to work with Tusla to implement the recommendations of the ESRI report on the school completion programme.</p></reply>

She has outlined clearly, comprehensively and positively the very many beneficial outcomes of the school completion programme.  There is absolutely no doubt that, no matter what political party we are in or what side of the House we are on, reducing school failure and improving educational outcomes for disadvantaged students has to be a key priority for every one of us.  It is a bit of an anomaly that this scheme lies within the Minister's Department as it is very closely related to education issues.  We need to do better to ensure that all sections of our communities can more fully reap the benefits of our education plans.  I certainly think that the school completion plan should be available to non-DEIS schools as well as DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  On the funding cuts which I mentioned earlier, while I accept they were before the Minister's time, there has been a substantial cut in funding.  In 2010, funding was &euro;30 million and it was down to &euro;24.7 million last year.  There has been &euro;5 million cut.  Will the Minister fight to get that funding back in to the school completion programme?</p></speech>

Yes I will; it is something to which I am deeply committed.  As an educator myself, I have even taught students about the issue, as well as working with many teachers and schools.  I take the point that it is, perhaps, an anomaly that the programme is located within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My understanding is that the thinking at the time was that the people working on school completion programme might be able to work closely with those in Tusla, which offers family supports.  School completion projects obviously also need to involve family supports because, as we know, families must be supported as part of the process of keeping children in school.</p>  <p>  There are a number of things they are doing right now to reform the programme and to improve their annual school retention figures.  They have a new governance structure that will be put in place at a national level to support the local projects and new school attendance guidelines have been issued to advise schools on the practical supports that are needed.  That is the kind of reform programme that is going on now, which could easily lead in to a good rationale for increased investment.</p></speech>

While there has not been a cut in funding this year, thankfully, I do understand that some of the interventions such as the summer programmes are not now available for children because of a shortage in the budget.  These are children who absolutely need this and I do think that it is regrettable.  I applaud the Minister's support for the school completion programme and welcome her vision of what can be done.  I acknowledge that it is a very targeted intervention aimed at those school communities that are identified.  At this point, it involves 124 projects and related initiatives in 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools, and about 36,000 children are supported.  These are identified by local management committees as being at risk of educational disadvantage.  This brings me back to my earlier question about the community school in County Kildare that is now at risk.  Of its 880 students, some 250 need these extra supports.  I do appreciate that the Minister will raise this with the Minister for Education and Skills and with the officials.</p></speech>

I have actually been raising some of these issues with Tusla and, of course, they have been raised to me too in the context of schools within my constituency of Dublin South-West.  That is why I requested a meeting with the director of educational welfare services, during which we discussed a number of these issues.  In the context of the reform programme that I am identifying, the independent ESRI review of the programme takes into account the ways in which different schools have had the flexibility to choose particular projects.  While I do understand that some monies may not be there for some programmes that were there in the past, it is still the same amount of money.  I would be delighted to hear more about Deputies' concerns on precisely these kinds of things as we consider how to move forward.</p></speech>

As we know that it will not be fully ready, perhaps we can concentrate on what can be done for providers and parents in terms of setting up a system that will be clear and available in time, so there will not be confusion when the time comes.</p></reply>

Since then, officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Pobal have been working intensively to plan for the implementation of this scheme.  This is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of what is involved, namely, legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new IT system.  We will need to integrate data from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so that the system can calculate every family&rsquo;s net income and affordable child care scheme subsidy.  We will need to test the IT system rigorously to make sure it works, even in complicated family circumstances.  As a result of this, the fully automated system that delivers everything will not be in place initially.  However, we are working intensively to ensure that a satisfactory interim measure is in place and that the fully automated system for the affordable child care scheme is introduced at the earliest possible time.</p>  <p>  I recognise that parents and providers urgently need detailed information about the way in which the scheme will be delivered.  I can assure the Deputy that I and my officials are fully committed to delivering on the objectives of the scheme, and we are determined to minimise any administrative burden or inconvenience.  In the next few weeks I will provide a detailed update on delivery plans.  Full information on implementation plans will then be made available to parents and child care providers, and change management supports will be provided to all participating child care services.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that I want us to get the IT systems right from the very beginning.  I would prefer to hold back on a fully automated system initially if it means that we avoid the costly and frustrating problems that other major new services have experienced elsewhere in recent times.</p></speech>

That is why I would like to concentrate on getting as much information as possible out to providers and parents as soon as possible.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has said she will update us and others whenever there is information, and I ask her to do so.</p>  <p>  One of my concerns, and I have heard this from some providers, is that they may not participate in the scheme if they feel it is going to cause them a huge amount of extra administrative work.  I do not think any of us would like to see that happen.  We want to ensure they are given whatever support they need to roll out the scheme, given some are saying it is easier for them to just put up their prices rather than participate in the scheme.  That would obviously have a serious effect on parents and children, which is why we need to ensure information is available as quickly as possible and that it is as clear as possible in terms of how it will be implemented.</p></speech>

First, we are conscious of the need to have the lowest administrative burden possible and to have a system that is not too complex and which they can get used to before moving on to the next thing.  That is why, in the Department, we have had plans A, B, C and D and we have gone through a number of options to try to identify what is best, so long as this is going to be an interim measure.  We are almost there, as the Deputy will be aware in light of her previous roles.  There are still some finishing touches to be made in regard to what we think will work, and a couple of colleagues in other Departments are asking further questions to ensure we have thought of everything.  That is almost concluded.</p>  <p>  Second, as we were working through these options, I said that what we need to do is to absolutely make sure the option we choose is the one we can communicate best.  We got somebody in specifically to work up a communications and information plan in the last week in regard to finalising the set of measures in a way that we hope will impose the least burden.</p></speech>

My Department is working closely with Tusla to ensure that the provisions of the Act can be fully implemented as quickly as possible in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Consultation is under way with all key stakeholders in order to finalise the revision of Tusla&rsquo;s aftercare policy.  The consultation process has included foster carers, young people, young adults, aftercare staff, social work staff, NGOs, private foster care and residential care providers and other Departments.  All have been invited to events and offered the opportunity to make written submissions.  Following these consultations, feedback will be considered and amendments made to the draft document, and the final draft of the aftercare documents will be presented to the national policy oversight committee of Tusla for approval.  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will be commenced as soon as practicable after approval of the revised policy.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the commencement of the new legislation, Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  It has developed dedicated aftercare teams, standardised the financial supports that it offers to those leaving care and is continuing to roll out inter-agency steering committees to strongly promote good co-ordination of these services at local level.  Tusla has also further developed the information it provides regarding aftercare services.  It is identifying gaps in aftercare service nationally and has undertaken a major recruitment campaign of social care workers to fill aftercare post vacancies.</p></reply>

The Minister has answered some of the points.  Obviously, sections 2 to 9, which are the flesh of the Child Care (Amendment) Act, are still to be brought into force.  I accept that the Minister referred to the legislation being commenced.  In some ways, we had reservations in respect of the Act, not because it was bad legislation but as a result of the fact that it contained a number of deficiencies.  An aftercare plan is one thing but the provision of aftercare - and all the resources necessary to ensure the quality of such care and to see to it that the plan is implemented - is quite another.</p>  <p>  To flag up one point, I will be publishing a Bill on this, the child care (amendment) Bill 2017, which I hope we will be able to discuss at some point.

As part of this process, what I have been identifying is the extensive consultation process that Tusla has been engaged in.  I have indicated that we hope that will be completed in time for the commencement of those sections of the Act.  I also acknowledge what the Deputy said about the implementation of the entitlement to an aftercare plan.  The commencement of that entitlement does not necessarily mean that we have all that we need in terms of aftercare provisions, but entitlement helps us to move in that direction.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800032#EE00900"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to make the necessary provision in Irish law to enable the State to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the event of Armed Conflict and the 1999 protocol that supplements it.  The 1954 convention and the 1999 protocol are instruments of international humanitarian law, which is the branch of international law that regulates armed conflict in the interests of humanity.  It has been developed over a period of more than 150 years and its principal rules are currently set out in the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 additional protocols.  It is supplemented by a range of other instruments on specific issues such as anti-personnel mines, the International Criminal Court and the protection of cultural property.</p>  <p>  International humanitarian law does not determine whether war or armed conflict in any particular case is lawful - that is a question of general international law.  Instead, it recognises that armed conflicts take place, whether lawful or not, and it has developed rules to limit the consequences of armed conflict on its victims.  Without international humanitarian law, the barbarity of war would be unmitigated.  Although humanitarian law has developed a very large and detailed body of rules, these rules can be reduced in summary to two basic concepts.  First, the means and methods that parties to armed conflict may employ are not unlimited.  Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited, for instance, and certain weapon systems are unlawful.  Second, parties to conflicts are required to protect civilians, the sick and wounded, prisoners of war and civilian property.</p>  <p>  There are regularly calls for the development of new rules imposing greater restrictions on parties to armed conflicts and Ireland has of course been prepared to join with others to develop the law where necessary.  For instance, Ireland took a leading role in the development of new rules prohibiting the use of cluster munitions, hosting and chairing the diplomatic conference in 2008 in Croke Park at which the convention on cluster munitions was adopted.  Some 100 countries are now parties to that convention and such is its success that even for those states that have refused to become parties to it, the use of cluster munitions has been so stigmatised that they will avoid or deny using them.  However, notwithstanding the need to develop new rules from time to time, the greatest challenge to protecting human life in modern armed conflicts is the frequent and often shocking failure by both the armed forces of states and non-state armed groups to respect the existing rules.  We need only look at the appalling behaviour of all sides in the conflict in Syria.</p>  <p>  Failure to respect the rules of international humanitarian law may occur for a number of reasons: a lack of knowledge of the law, an absence of political will to ensure respect for the law or, indeed, a promotion or tolerance of a culture of impunity.  In the case of Daesh, there has been a clear rejection of the law.  In addition to destroying ancient and important cultural heritage in Palmyra and elsewhere, it has been responsible for rape, enslavement and murder of civilians amongst other deplorable acts.  I share the dismay and disgust of all Members of this House at the flagrant violations of the international humanitarian law committed in Syria, in particular, and elsewhere.  Needless to say if the existing rules were respected, much of the dreadful human suffering in contemporary armed conflicts would not occur.  However, where the rules are not respected, there must also be accountability.  Successive Irish Governments have sought to ensure effective investigation and prosecution of violations of international humanitarian law.  Ireland has been a leading supporter of the International Criminal Court, ICC, and indeed the Government has consistently supported the referral of the situation in Syria to the ICC.</p>  <p>  The 1954 convention was negotiated to prevent the type of extensive destruction and loss of cultural property during the Second World War that resulted from bombardment, looting and vandalism.  Countless historic buildings and monuments were destroyed and artefacts were either lost and stolen.  This convention imposes a number of obligations on states: to make preparations in time of peace to safeguard cultural property against the foreseeable effects of armed conflict; not to use cultural property for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage during armed conflict; and to refrain from any hostile act against cultural property, except in cases of "imperative military necessity".  In addition, states are obliged to prohibit, prevent and stop theft and pillage of cultural property during armed conflict.  The convention also establishes a system allowing states to nominate specific monuments for a type of enhanced protection called "special protection", although in practice the system was essentially unworkable.  The blue shield is recognised as a distinctive emblem that can be used to identify cultural property in the event of armed conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland signed the convention in 1954 but did not proceed to ratify it immediately.  Although the convention was regarded as a welcome development in international law at the time, it is broadly recognised as having failed to provide effective protection for cultural property during the time of armed conflict.  Ultimately, this is because the key obligations it imposes on states could be set aside in circumstances of "imperative military necessity".  It did not act as an effective restraint on the extensive damage to cultural property that took place during conflicts, particularly in south-east Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, or in subsequent international conflicts around the world.  The 1954 negotiations took place not long after the end of the Second World War at a time when blanket bombing of cities was still regarded as a legitimate military tactic.  It was not until much later in 1977 that humanitarian concerns were given greater weight and agreement was reached in the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions that only military objectives could be attacked during the course of an armed conflict.  Military objectives must be more clearly defined and more carefully selected.  Parties to armed conflict were now required to take precautions in attack.  Indiscriminate attacks were prohibited and attacks against civilian property, including schools, hospitals, places of worship and cultural property, were prohibited unless they were being used for military purposes by the other side in a conflict.</p><p> The Balkan and Afghan wars in the 1990s led to a growing sense that the 1954 convention needed to be replaced or at least updated to reflect developments in the law since 1977.  A conference was, therefore, convened at The Hague in 1999.  It was decided there that rather than replace the convention, it should be supplemented by a new protocol.</p> <p> The 1999 protocol supplements the 1954 convention by making detailed provision for the steps to be taken in time of peace to protect cultural property.  It restricts the scope for action in circumstances of imperative military necessity.  It establishes a system of enhanced protection for specific monuments.  It introduces the element of individual criminal responsibility in cases of violations to the law.  To date, 71 states have become parties to the protocol, including most states in the European Union as well as New Zealand and Canada.</p> <p> The Bill has been developed in consultation with several Departments, including the Department of Defence and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as the Defence Forces.</p> <p> Many of the obligations the State will assume on becoming a party to the convention and the protocol are already met by a mixture of policy and administrative measures.  For example, the State's national cultural institutions have all developed disaster planning and emergency response plans to protect their collections.  Defence Forces doctrine and training has long reflected the rules set down by the protocol of 1999.  Legislation is required, however, to protect and regulate the use of the Blue Shield in law and to create specific criminal offences.  This is the purpose of the Bill.</p> <p> I will run through the various sections.  Section 1 defines certain terms for the purposes of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 create offences.  The protocol requires that certain acts committed during an armed conflict within the State shall be criminal offences and that criminal jurisdiction be extended over Irish nationals and members of the Defence Forces participating in armed conflicts outside the State.  The Bill creates a rule of "extradite or prosecute" in respect of offences alleged to have been committed in the territories of other states that are parties to the protocol.  Thus, if Ireland does not extradite a person present in the State for alleged offences under the protocol to another state party, it must have jurisdiction to try that person in this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, under section 2 it will be a serious offence to attack during an armed conflict in the State any cultural property under enhanced protection, use such property in support of military action or extensively destroy or appropriate any cultural property.</p> <p> Section 3 makes it an offence in Ireland for any person to commit any of these acts during an armed conflict in a state to which the 1999 protocol applies.  This means a person can be arrested and tried in Ireland for offences not committed here but offences that may have been committed in a state to which the 1999 protocol is applicable.  It will also be an offence under section 2 to attack, steal, pillage, misappropriate or vandalise any cultural property during an armed conflict in the State.  Section 3 makes it an offence for an Irish citizen, a member of the Defence Forces or a person ordinarily resident in the State to do these things during an armed conflict outside the State.  Section 3 also makes it an offence for an Irish citizen or a member of the Defence Forces to export or otherwise remove cultural property from an occupied territory.</p> <p> Section 4 provides for penalties upon conviction for an offence under sections 2, 3 or 8.  The maximum penalty, on summary conviction, will be imprisonment for a period of 12 months, a class A fine - currently at a maximum of &euro;5,000 - or both.  To reflect the potentially serious nature of these offences, for conviction on indictment, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to 30 years or a fine to be determined by the court or both.</p> <p> Section 5 provides that commanders or other superiors are criminally responsible for offences committed by their subordinates if they knew, or had reason to know, that the subordinates were about to commit or were in the course of committing such crimes and did not take all necessary and reasonable measures in their power to prevent their commission, or, if such crimes have been committed, to ensure investigation and prosecution of those responsible.  This element of the 1999 protocol was regarded as essential to ensure that military commanders respected, and ensured respect for, protected cultural property.</p> <p> Section 6 provides a defence in any proceedings under the Act where the person charged can prove that he was acting under an order which he was required by law to obey and believed the order to be lawful at the time.  Section 7, combined with section 10, applies the modern rule against double jeopardy.</p> <p> Section 8 provides for the protection in law of the Blue Shield emblem and empowers the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to authorise the use of the Blue Shield emblem in Ireland.  The Blue Shield emblem is the distinctive emblem created by the 1954 convention as a means of identifying cultural property to protect that property in the event of armed conflict, as well as personnel engaged in the protection of the property.  The conditions of the use of the Blue Shield emblem and the protection are set out in the 1954 convention.  It is important to appreciate that use of the Blue Shield is not essential for the protection of cultural property.  As such, cultural property enjoys the protection of the protocol in any event.  The main purpose of section 8 is to protect the emblem in law from misuse.  Accordingly, section 8 enables the Minister to authorise use of the emblem subject to appropriate conditions as well as to authorise its use where a person applies in writing to use it.  In addition, section 8 makes it an offence to use the emblem without authorisation or contrary to the conditions as laid down or set by the Minister.</p> <p> Section 9 enables the State to provide mutual legal assistance to another state party to the 1999 protocol in the investigation and prosecution in that state of offences under the protocol.  To enable extradition of persons sought for prosecution by another state party to the protocol, a separate order under the Extradition Acts will be necessary.</p> <p> Section 11 is a standard provision setting out the short title and providing for commencement.  The texts of the convention and the protocol are set out in the Schedules to the Act.</p> <p> Ratification of the 1954 convention and accession to the 1999 protocol would be a further demonstration of the commitment of Ireland to support and promote international humanitarian law.  The enactment of the Bill will enable the State to take that step.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope that in the coming days consideration might be given to proceeding with Second Stage.  Then, perhaps, we can give consideration to any amendments that, in the circumstances, might be proposed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-03-28a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017032800034#GG00300"><p>I welcome this opportunity to address these important and very disturbing issues.  First of all I want to stress again, as I have already and as the Taoiseach did during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, the utmost seriousness with which the Government and I as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality regard these issues.</p><p>  It is essential that the Government, the Oireachtas and all our citizens can trust members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out their duties fairly, impartially and in accordance with the law.  The public has to be able to believe statistics and all information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is essential that we get the answers we need and I am totally committed to doing so.  The issues that have been raised go to the heart of policing in the State.  They go to the heart of public confidence in our police force and the area of policing involved, that of roads and traffic, is one that affects every one of our citizens.  So many of us have been affected by tragedy on the roads, be it the death of a friend, colleague or family member.  We need to know as citizens that those charged with enforcing the laws designed to ensure our safety do so to the highest standards.</p><p>I met the Garda Commissioner yesterday and I conveyed the Government&rsquo;s very deep concern at the revelations of recent days.  The facts we now know about how breath tests were being conducted and the operation of the fixed charge system are completely unacceptable and raise very troubling questions.  The scale and detail of these issues became apparent last week at the Garda press conference and I am determined that all the facts will emerge.</p><p>An anonymous complaint was made to the Road Safety Authority in April 2014, outlining a number of issues which included the operation of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints.  This complaint was referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated in a detailed letter to my Department in May 2014 that it had looked into the claims regarding MAT checkpoints and was satisfied that correct procedures were in place to account for MAT checkpoints that ultimately did go ahead.  Every MAT checkpoint, as we know, must be authorised by an inspector.  In June of last year my Department was made aware that some discrepancies had been identified in respect of MAT and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was commencing a national audit.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated in June 2016 that no issues stemmed from this audit with regard to the performance of MAT checkpoints or prosecutions arising from same.  It also set out the new procedures it had already introduced to facilitate the accurate recording of breath tests and outlined that an IT solution had been developed and would be implemented towards the end of 2016.  </p><p>Following this preliminary notification to my Department last year, updates were sought from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by officials in my Department on a regular basis as to the progress of the audit that was then taking place.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated in February 2017 that it was anticipated that the national audit would be finalised in the second quarter of 2017.  Although that audit has not yet been finalised, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced figures at its press conference relating to the discrepancy between the number of test conducted at MAT checkpoints as per its own records compared with the records held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  No indication was given as to the scale of this issue at the time of the June 2016 letter and indeed, it is clear from what the Commissioner told me yesterday and from her public statements, that it was not known at that time to Garda management either.  It was in order to assess the scale of the problem that the national audit of MAT was launched.  I did not become aware of the huge discrepancy in the breath test figures until it was revealed at last week&rsquo;s Garda press conference.</p><p>Regarding the issue of fixed charge notices, my Department was informed in June 2016 of an error relating to summonses having been incorrectly issued to persons who should have received a fixed charge notice for the offence of not having a valid national car test, NCT, certificate, which became a fixed charge offence in December 2014.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that following on from those initial findings, further inquiries were being carried out relating to all summonses issued for other fixed charge offences.  Colleagues should note that a press statement was issued that day by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about this issue.  In that statement, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed that it had commenced a review of prosecutions relating to all fixed charge offences.  The letter set out the remedial actions already taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at that stage, which included withdrawing prosecutions in any affected cases and putting in place a short-term IT solution within four weeks while a longer-term IT solution was being developed.</p><p>  Following the preliminary notifications of these problems to my Department last year, updates were sought on a regular basis as to the progress of the review taking place into the fixed charge processing system issues covering the period referred to in the letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, from 1 January 2014 to 27 May 2016.  The results of this review were communicated to my Department in a letter received on 14 March 2017.  </p><p>The letter indicated that a total of 1,781 cases had been identified where persons had been convicted in situations where they had been incorrectly summonsed to court, either without first having been issued a fixed charge notice or having been issued and paid a fixed charge notice.  The letter also set out &ndash; this is important &ndash; that consultation remained ongoing with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, with whose office there had been ongoing consultation and the Courts Service in regard to commencing the process of setting aside the convictions in the courts.  That engagement with the DPP is ongoing.</p> <p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also advised in that letter, received recently on 14 March, that the DPP had indicated that the review should be extended to include cases before 2014 and that this process was now under way.  That, of course, is why the audit was meant to be ongoing until June of this year.  That was to be when I was to expect the final report.  That is when I had been advised I would get the final report.  I became aware of the figure of some 14,700 cases where a conviction took place after an incorrect procedure when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made that information public last week.  It is matter of great regret to me, as I know it is to everyone in this House, that anyone should be summoned to court inadvertently, with all of the consequences that follow for individuals.  It is absolutely critical now that these mistakes be resolved and that the necessary remedial actions be taken.</p> <p> As for the fixed charge penalty notice, FCPN, at my meeting with the Commissioner yesterday she assured me that arrangements are being put in place in regard to the persons affected.  All of these cases will be appealed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the courts set aside these convictions, as they have to.  All fines will, of course, be reimbursed and penalties will be removed, and all of those affected will be contacted directly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Individual letters will be sent to all the people concerned and they will begin to be issued on 3 April.</p> <p> The Commissioner also outlined to me the IT and operational solutions that have been put in place to ensure that these practices would cease.  In fact, at the ministerial meeting yesterday, which was scheduled ahead of all of this emerging, both the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and I were assured by both Professor Cusack and all the other people present that the new procedures were in place, that we could be confident about the new procedures and that there are changes being made to the machines, using GPS and further information, so the kind of mistake associated with the technical attributes of the devices can never happen again.</p> <p> In the case of mandatory alcohol tests, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper-based recording and verification processes and, in November 2016, a new specific data-recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  This, apparently, was not being done before.  It is clearly only one of the explanations for this situation.  Data from the device are now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p> <p> The focus now, however, has to be on what is being done to get to the full truth of what transpired and the accountability that must be brought to bear.  Clearly, there is a need for an investigation to hold responsible those people, at all levels of the Garda organisation, who allowed such large discrepancies in the breath-testing figures to arise.  The Commissioner announced an internal investigation yesterday, as colleagues will be aware.  Following consideration and discussion at Cabinet today, the Government has decided that there should be an independent investigation, and consultations will now take place with the Policing Authority on how to achieve that.  I met the chairman of the authority, Ms Josephine Feehily, yesterday and informed her that I was formally referring both of these matters to that body under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  The chairman informed me at that point that the authority will have an independent professional audit undertaken of the steps taken to resolve these issues.  That is an essential part of providing the necessary public reassurance.  The clear view of the Government following my briefing of its members at today's Cabinet meeting was that these revelations have given rise to the most serious concerns, not just among public representatives but also among members of the public.  The Government accepts fully that we need explanations.  That is why we are making use of the full legal mechanisms in place to ensure that we will establish the full facts and that there can be accountability in this area.</p> <p> It is absolutely essential that the process of reform be rigorously implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that it be seen to be implemented, including through close oversight by the Policing Authority.  As the Taoiseach stated earlier, the Government believes the level of public concern regarding some issues affecting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now so profound that it is time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Quite a number of colleagues have already called for this.  This is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.  As the Taoiseach said, any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition and, ultimately, approval by the Oireachtas.</p> <p> We in government accept that change is required.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have introduced the most significant reforms in policing since the foundation of the State.  Just last week we had the first assistant commissioner fully appointed by an independent body.  We have the Policing Authority, which represents a radical change in the oversight of policing in this country.  At the end of this year, its second year, it is subject to review.  The body, under the legislation, is to inform me how it is working and whether there are any changes it would like to see.  I will await its report later on this year.  Additional powers have been given to GSOC and greater civilianisation has been implemented.  We need to do more, however.  I hope that Opposition Deputies will accept the offer to work with the Government on this and contribute to achieving the policing service we all wish to see.</p></speech>

We know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducted a review and that this review established there were 14,700 wrongful convictions.  Last Thursday, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued a press statement in which it referred to this review it carried out and the 14,700 wrongful convictions recorded.  It claimed in its statement that, based on the findings and inquiries of that review, a number of solutions were identified by Garda IT to avoid, as far as possible, a recurrence of the issues highlighted.  It stated that, as of 15 July 2016, an IT solution had been designed and rolled out.  I take it from that statement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the force was aware, by 15 July 2016 at the latest, that there were 14,700 wrongful convictions.  The T&aacute;naiste said in her statement that she became aware of the scale of the number of convictions only recently.  When did she first become aware of there being any issue in respect of wrongful convictions on this issue?</p></speech>
