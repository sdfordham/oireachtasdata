We now know that three women at the centre of ten outstanding legal cases against the State relating to incorrect smear tests have died.  The State Claims Agency was apparently told by CervicalCheck during the Vicky Phelan case that the women had been told.  We now know of course that this was not the case.</p>  <p>  In the context of the forthcoming cases - this came across yesterday in a fairly frank exchange at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform involving the director general of the State Claims Agency and others - that the State may not have a liability and that, in fact, liability may lie with the US companies involved..  It seems, therefore, that no guarantees can yet be given to the women involved in those cases to the effect that they will not have to go through the same treatment as Vicky Phelan.  Has the Government considered this issue?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the steps the Government intends to take to prevent further trauma to women involved in such cases?  The director general of the agency said that in cases where the State has liability, they would be dealt with differently.  We know that in many instances we are talking about cases involving the actual screening companies.  Furthermore, at yesterday's committee meeting, the director general, in response to questions from Deputy MacSharry and others, indicated that if section 30(2)(b) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 had been commenced, then the approach adopted by the State Claims Agency could have been different.</p><p>The section relates to pre-action protocols designed to secure an early resolution in clinical negligence claims by ensuring there is disclosure of all medical and other records in the hopes of reducing the number of cases.  Why, then, has section 30(2)(b) of the 2015 Act not been commenced by the Minister for Justice and Equality?  I understand it was signed into law towards the end of 2015.  The State Claims Agency and other bodies get attacked all the time in the immediate aftermath of a crisis but we can hardly blame officials if an Act or a section has not been commenced and certain options the Oireachtas intended to provide them with are not, therefore, open to them.  Were there consultations between health and justice officials on that issue?</p> <p> The Taoiseach said yesterday in the House that there were approximately 1,600 cases.  These are the 1,600 cases announced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, last Tuesday night which had been notified to the National Cancer Registry but which had not been notified to CervicalCheck.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that the vast majority of those 1,600 cases would not need to be part of the audit for reasons he set out.  Can the Taoiseach state categorically that there are no issues relating to those 1,600 cases?  Deputy Kelly made a number of observations last evening in terms of the level of knowledge of the Department of Health on issues between the cancer registry and the CervicalCheck programme in the context of data interchange and all of that.  Are the Taoiseach and the Minister aware of such issues?  Has the Department been aware of such issues down through the years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050900004#B00200"><p>As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, new information and revelations continue to become available on this issue.  That is exactly why we have established this inquiry, namely, to get to the bottom of this and establish the facts in order that we can put things right to restore confidence in cancer screening.  Like other Members, members of the Government are often hearing information that is new.  That is why it is right for us to set up the inquiry, which will be able to get to the bottom of all these facts and give people the answers they need.</p>  <p>  I understand there are nine outstanding court cases with perhaps one further case where a letter of claim has issued but proceedings have not yet begun.  Nobody wants to see sick people or terminally ill women dragged through the courts.  The public does not want that and it is in nobody's interest.  It is certainly not in the interests of the taxpayer in the longer run, of confidence in our health service or of patients or citizens.  I have asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency to examine the different cases with a view to settling them, albeit it takes two sides to do so, or resolving them by way of mediation as soon as possible in order that they do not have to go to court.  I made that request to the Attorney General last week.  It may turn out that one or more of these cases is similar or identical to that of Ms Vicky Phelan but it may also be the case that some are very different.  We cannot assume that all of these cases are the same.  In each case, a medical expert will have to look at the smear or slide and determine what category it falls into.  Certainly, the Government's intention is to settle these cases as soon as possible or deal with them by way of mediation if possible.  I have asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency to do exactly that in the short period ahead.</p>  <p>  The best thing we can do in the longer term is to avoid these cases going to court in the first instance.  That can be done in a number of ways.  A whole reform programme has been initiated by the Government over the past couple of years to reduce the number of cases ending up in court or requiring lengthy legal proceedings.  The House will be aware of what we have done already around open disclosure by way of putting voluntary open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, which was passed last year and which will be enacted in law by June.</p><p>We have also announced this week that we will put in place mandatory open disclosure through the patient safety Bill in cases of serious incidents.</p> <p> There has also been a programme of law reform.  For example, the Mediation Act has been enacted and is now a reality.  The Act will allow mediation to occur in more circumstances.  In the past couple of weeks, some cases have already been settled through mediation.  We would like to see more.  There are also periodic payment orders.  The legislation for those has been passed in order to ensure that we do not have the same situation we have had for years in the context of very big settlements of &euro;10 million or &euro;13 million being made when it would be better to have settlements over a period that could be increased as needs be.  Other new legislation we introduced is the Legal Services Regulation Act, which the Deputy mentioned.  It provides for pre-action protocols to speed up cases so that they are not continually being referred.  That has not been commenced yet because the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which is the body that will deal with it, has only been established in the past few months.</p></speech>

That was in December 2015.  We can keep announcing and passing laws in the Chamber and saying that we will do great things next month or the month after.  When we pass such laws, however, they are not commenced and nothing changes.  We need a satisfactory explanation as to why section 32(b) of that Act, which was designed to prevent the trauma people have experienced in taking on the State, has not been commenced.  We particularly need that explanation given that the Taoiseach referred to the Act at the end of his long reply.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that he has asked the Attorney General to talk to the State Claims Agency.  The agency said yesterday that in cases involving the State and in which the State has liability, it would prevent any trauma.  I am referring to the majority of cases which could be against the US companies involved.  How does the Taoiseach propose to prevent trauma in those cases?  Has the Government considered that point?  That is what I asked originally.  Can the Taoiseach give a specific answer on that?  Has he considered it at all?</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach respond to the third question I asked regarding the level of knowledge in the Department of Health in respect of potential issues between the National Cancer Registry and the CervicalCheck programme and reconciliation of their respective numbers regarding people who have died from cancer?</p></speech>

While Mr. O'Brien was making that declaration, I received a call from Emma N&iacute; Mhath&uacute;na from Kerry.  She asked me to raise her case with the Taoiseach.  Emma is 37 years old and is the mother of five children aged between two and 15 years of age.  She received a clear result from a smear test in 2013 but she now knows that the result was, in fact, a false negative.  She received a diagnosis of cervical cancer after a routine smear test in 2016.  She only learned of the false negative for the previous test as this scandal has unfolded.</p><p>She wants the Taoiseach to know that she is terminally ill, that she will present on Friday for a medical assessment at which she expects she will be given an estimate of how long she is expected to live.  Emma wants the Taoiseach to know that she has been told to get her affairs in order and to make provision for her five children.  Emma is extremely angry.  She says her faith has been shaken to its core.  She tells me that her anger outweighs even her fear of dying.  She wants the Taoiseach to know that she wants accountability.  She has asked me to tell him that she cannot understand why he is sitting on his hands.  She cannot wrap her head around why he has not done the very first thing that is needed to ensure the start of accountability.  I told the Taoiseach yesterday, as I have said before, that people outside of this place see two Irelands: they see a well-paid senior public executive sitting in a committee room brazening things out and then they see a terminally ill woman in her living room who knows she does not have much time left, who knows - or at least suspects - that it could have been very different and who is left wondering how her children will cope.</p> <p> I could make all the political reform arguments in the world as to why Tony O'Brien must go; I have made some of them previously.  I could make all the good governance and public policy arguments as to why this man needs to go.  We could go back and forth on that all day long.  However, that all pales into absolute insignificance when one compares it with what a woman like Emma is feeling and articulating today.  The buck must stop somewhere and accountability must start somewhere.  Emma has no confidence in Tony O'Brien, the public and the women and families affected have no confidence in Tony O'Brien, the Opposition has no confidence in Tony O'Brien and three of the Taoiseach's own Cabinet members have said he should stand down, yet the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health refuse to act.</p> <p> When the Taoiseach gets to his feet, I do not want him to answer me; I would like him to speak to Emma.  I want him to answer Emma N&iacute; Mhath&uacute;na.  I want him to explain to her why he is allowing Tony O'Brien to continue as usual, why he refuses to hold him to account and why he is ignoring her voice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-09a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050900006#D00200"><p>The most egregious aspect of this whole affair is that important information about women's health was withheld from them, and that was absolutely wrong.  We all know that the audit did not commence until these women had already been diagnosed with cancer and were being treated, so providing them with that information would not have impacted on their treatment.  However, they should have been told anyway.  People have a right to know information about their healthcare.  Doctors, officials and anyone else involved in managing their cases or looking after them have no basis on which not to pass on that information.  As Deputies will know, this has been HSE policy for all staff since 2013 and is in the Medical Council guidelines.  Part of the inquiry that is now under way must get to the bottom of why this information was not passed on to women in the way it should have been as they ought to have known.  This is absolutely the most inexplicable and egregious aspect of this whole affair.</p>  <p>  As I said yesterday, people want accountability.  The Government wants accountability as much as the Opposition does.  People are annoyed, and I am annoyed, about the way this has been handled in recent weeks, the drip-drip of information and the misinformation from some quarters.  We, as politicians, need to ensure we are never part of putting across misinformation because that does a terrible disservice to the women affected.  We have seen at least a degree of personal accountability so far, the clinical director of CervicalCheck having resigned and the manager of CervicalCheck being moved aside and replaced by Damien McCallion, head of the serious incident management team.  We have an inquiry that is under way and can get to the facts and assess whether more needs to be done and whether more individuals need to be held to account.  As I said yesterday, more heads may well yet roll but it is important they are the right heads and that people who are dismissed are dismissed because of something they actually did wrong or failed to do, having known about it.  That is something we cannot say with certainty at present.</p><p>As I said yesterday, for me and for some of those affected, this is not primarily about looking for a head; it is about establishing the facts, getting to the bottom of the matter and putting it right, restoring faith in our cancer screening system and ensuring it does not happen again.  </p> <p> Mr. O'Brien has approximately eight weeks left before he finishes his term of office, at which point an interim HSE director will be appointed by the Minister for Health.  We are already in the process of appointing a new person to take over the leadership of our health service as the chief executive officer, CEO, of the HSE.  We will also put a board in place to ensure an additional layer of accountability between the Minister and the HSE.</p></speech>

I do not believe the Taoiseach's response, to be blunt.  What I see is a person who leads the Government and who knows well what needs to happen and what is the right thing to do.  I do not dispute the sequence of events and share the Taoiseach's view that the most egregious offence was the withholding of information.  We cannot with all certainty state whether in each case the withholding of that information had a material affect in diagnosis and subsequent treatment.  Let others decide on that.  What Emma told me is that she sees is the Taoiseach, the leader of Government, fail her.  Has it occurred to the Taoiseach that women like Emma might not be around to hear the results of these inquiries?  Mr. O'Brien has eight or 12 weeks left, depending on when he takes his leave, but who is to say how long Emma has?  She has a very simple request of the Taoiseach, and it is a challenge to him as Head of Government because it is something that we do not do in this jurisdiction.  The Tony O'Briens of this world do not stand down, and Governments here do not sack them or tell them to clear their desks.  She wants to see the start of accountability now.  That means the departure of the man in charge of the HSE, the director general with whom the buck stops.  It is as simple and clear cut as that.</p></speech>

I do not think it is right for any politician to appoint him or herself as the sole spokesperson for all these people.  I have been in contact with some of them too.  They have different views but many concerns and the main thing they want is answers.  They want the truth, which is why we have established a scoping inquiry in order that we can get as many answers as quickly as possible for the women affected and their families.  We will move on to a statutory commission of investigation after that to answer any unanswered questions.  We have gone for a scoping inquiry in order that we can get answers quickly.  I appeal to Deputy McDonald and all Members of this House to avoid saying things that may not be factually correct or putting out misinformation.  It is not fair to the 209 women who were subject to this audit to have additional fears and concerns.  They have enough to worry about as it is without misinformation being propagated.</p></speech>

This follows Facebook's announcement that it will only accept advertisements from Ireland on its platform, although this will simply mean that linked organisations will be exposed in Ireland and organisations will have to register here and may then continue to advertise.</p><p>There are no spending limits in respect of the referendum anyway, so it will make little real difference.  However, it is imperative that we as politicians act to regulate the information included on posters and in online advertisements to ensure that the information given out to the public is based on facts and not on outright lies, myths or emotive untruths.  We have all seen cases around the country where posters have been placed near schools and outside churches.  These posters use imagery and information that is clearly wrong, that cannot be checked and that is not verifiable at all.  We must act to ensure that the use of such posters cannot continue.  It is vitally important for both sides of the campaign, the yes side and the no side, to put out accurate images and information in order that people can make a decision based on what they feel themselves.</p> <p> We have seen the posters held up outside the hospitals.  We have seen all that.  We have seen the fake statistics and factually incorrect responses that also have been used in respect of the campaign.  This is all wrong.  These are things on which we can act and make a decision.  The announcements from Google and Facebook are welcome but we can also be proactive and ensure that posters carry respectful images and images which will sway the argument one way or the other rather than those which are just used as a shock tactic.  That is vitally important.  I know it is probably too late to do it for this campaign, but what are the Taoiseach's plan to do this in order to ensure that referendum campaigns will be carried out in a proper manner and that proper images will be used on posters?  This is something which we in this House can directly control.  We do not have to rely on Facebook or Google or anybody else to do it for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-09a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050900008#F00200"><p>First, I join with others in welcoming the decision taken by Facebook not to allow advertisements relating to the referendum that are paid for by foreign bodies or foreign entities.  That is a welcome measure on its part.  While Google has gone a bit further and is not accepting advertisements to do with the referendum altogether, I think Facebook has made the right decision to not accept advertisements paid for by bodies from other countries.  Whether advertisements are for a yes vote or a no vote, we all hold by the principle that foreign money should not be used to influence elections and referendums in this country.  The decision Facebook has made in that regard is very welcome.  Perhaps it could have come sooner but it has come and is very welcome.</p>  <p>  I share Deputy Pringle's concerns about some of the posters we have seen around the country, some of which are extraordinarily inaccurate in the claims made on them and some of which are, frankly, quite grotesque.  I have often spoken to parents on the campaign trail whose children have asked them to explain the images on the posters and what the posters mean.  For people who purport to be concerned about children, putting parents in a position where they have to explain these things to children based on the images on the posters says a lot about their true motivations and hearts.</p>  <p>  It has never been the case in Ireland that we have regulated people's posters.  If we were to regulate people's posters we might also argue in favour of regulating literature because the same kind of images that appear on posters can also be put on literature put through doors.  We need some consideration of the issue, perhaps on an all-party basis, but it would be a big move to give any authority to ourselves, or even to an electoral commission or referendum commission when established, to decide what sorts of posters and literature are allowed and what sorts are not.  It could start from very good intentions but move on to become a restriction on democracy and freedom of speech.  If we do anything like that we would need to do it on an all-party basis.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, which covers electoral matters, could give some consideration to the issue after this referendum.</p></speech>

I note there is already regulation of posters in certain areas in this country.  For example, Dublin City Council regulates politicians' posters.  They have to be submitted to Dublin City Council so that it can have a look at them.  It then decides whether they can be put up or not.  They cannot be offensive or anything else like that.</p><p>It is possible to regulate posters and this begs the question as to why the posters in question have not been regulated.  That may be a separate question.  It is not enough, however, to share the annoyance and upset of people in respect of this issue.  It has to be addressed.  Doing so is vital.</p> <p> The matter is probably more stark in the run-up to the forthcoming referendum.  It is a referendum campaign that is dividing people and generating strong opinions on both sides.  That is different from what happens during most elections.  In most elections, our faces are on the posters.  People might find them offensive but that is a different story.  We really should be capable of dealing with the images used on posters.  If Facebook and Google can do it in respect online patterns, why can we not do it with postering in this country?</p></speech>

My local authority in Fingal requires that permission be obtained if one wants to put up a poster advertising a public meeting or such an event outside election time.  I had thought it was different during election and referendum campaigns, however, and that all local authorities can do is prescribe where posters could not be located, as on roundabouts or in locations where they obscure road signs.  Regulating where posters may be placed for reasons of road safety is different from regulating the content of posters, be it the words or images.  This is not something we can resolve over the next couple weeks.  We could definitely ask the committee to examine it, however.  I will certainly ask the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy Phelan, to determine, after the referendum, what measures could be put in place for future contests.</p></speech>

All attempts by the Taoiseach and the Government to convince the people that what he is proposing is a restrictive abortion regime are being exposed as the complete falsehoods that they are.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, would know that if he displayed even one ounce of political courage and responded to the numerous requests made to him, by the Save the Eighth campaign and others, to conduct an open debate on this matter.  Unfortunately, he is in hiding on this issue.</p><p>Despite that fact, we have a health service that is almost in total paralysis.  It is in total paralysis as far as I am concerned, yet the Minister takes no responsibility.  He is the head appointed to office by the Taoiseach to deal with these issues but he lacks courage and will not take responsibility in this area.  Instead, he chooses to spend his time campaigning with individuals and organisations that are in open defiance of Irish electoral law.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach some time ago and he said he had no issue with this.  I find that staggering.  The Taoiseach has no issue with the fact that the Minister campaigns with people operating outside the law.  Where are the Taoiseach standards?  A senior Minister in the Government is championing a group that made clear and illegal use of &euro;120,000 but the Taoiseach believes that is perfectly fine.  No wonder there is no accountability in the HSE or anywhere else.  Not only has the Taoiseach undermined the integrity of his own campaign, he has also insulted the independence and integrity of the Standards in Public Office Commission, which made the judgment against Amnesty International Ireland.</p><p>That said, I ask the Taoiseach to clarify some issues that have arisen following comments made by the Minister in <i>The Sunday Times</i>last weekend.  The Minister mentioned that the general scheme of the Bill, which I have to hand, provides for early delivery and specifically prohibits the possibility of late-term abortions.  Where in the heads of the Bill is the prohibition on late-term abortion to be found?  I ask the Taoiseach to explain.  I have read the Bill, as have others, and we cannot see it anywhere.  I ask the Taoiseach to take some accountability for his Ministers.  He has appointed them, under seal from the President, yet they can campaign with people who have acted outside the law and blatantly told everyone that they would keep the money and would not pay it back.  Everybody in here operates under the Standards in Public Office Commission, and rightly so, and every elected official throughout the country must do so.  Will Amnesty Ireland get away with this?  Is it okay for the Taoiseach's Ministers to champion this organisation on the streets?</p></speech>

He seems to be assuming that the referendum is over and that the proposition will be defeated.  I believe that the referendum and campaign are ongoing.  I was on the doors in Clonsilla in my constituency as part of a cross-party canvass, listening to people, hearing their views and answering some of their questions.  I believe that this referendum will carry.  The people have not spoken yet.  When they have spoken, we will count the votes and determine what they have said.  It is somewhat arrogant for anyone to assume the outcome of this referendum already.  At the start of this campaign, I said something that I really believe, which is that this campaign should always be respectful and should never be personalised.  By and large, I am glad that has been the case so far.  Unlike previous abortion referendums, this campaign has largely been respectful and has rarely been personalised but I regret the extent to which some people, including Deputy Mattie McGrath, have sought to personalise this against the Minister, Deputy Harris.  That is absolutely wrong.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is putting forward a proposal that the Government is making following an all-party committee, following a Citizens' Assembly.  The people will have their say on that.  I do not think he, or anyone on any side of this referendum, should be targeted personally in any way, whether through posters, demands for one-to-one debates, or anything of that nature.  It is wrong and it is not what people want.</p>  <p>  Amnesty International's current campaign is registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  It is above board and I do not believe anyone has produced any evidence to the contrary.  The Deputy is referring to a different campaign it ran maybe a year or two ago, against which SIPO has made some negative findings.  That matter is now before the courts.  Its current campaign on this referendum is registered with SIPO just like any NGO campaign of this nature.  It is wrong to confuse the two.  Perhaps it is deliberate but it is wrong either way.</p>  <p>  On the legislation before us, the legislation that the Government has produced allows for a woman to decide to end her pregnancy if she decides she does not want to go ahead with that pregnancy up to 12 weeks into it.  That is ten weeks from conception.  It allows for the termination of pregnancies after that on the grounds that there may be a serious risk to her life or health, or in the case where the baby she is carrying will not survive as a result of a fatal foetal abnormality.  It does not provide for the termination of pregnancies beyond viability and that is in the heads.  There is an important point that we need to make and understand, which is that if there is not a yes vote, there will be no legislation at all.  If there is not a Yes vote, things will remain exactly as they are now.  There will be no legislation.  Women who are victims of rape, who are pregnant as a result of incest or who are just children themselves will not be able to get the help they need in this country.  Those who are advocating a No vote need to explain why they would turn their backs on those women and give them the cold shoulder.  That is what a No vote would mean.</p></speech>

Excuse me, listen.  I mentioned Amnesty Ireland.  It is fine for the Taoiseach.  The Minister wants to hide.  This is not a personal attack at all but a Minister in the Government proposing this legislation will not debate it.  He chose not to answer me on that and I did not assume at all that the referendum was over.  While head 4 of the general scheme says that the life of the unborn child cannot be ended once it has reached viability, there is no evidence of where this will be set.  To understand that, I suggest that the Taoiseach reads the definitions contained in the general scheme.  Even more disturbing is the fact that, directly following head 4, provision is made in head 5 to nullify or cancel out the prohibitions contained in head 4.  There is utter confusion.  This clearly demonstrates that all of the claims the Taoiseach and his Ministers are making about protecting the child once it reaches viability are an absolute nonsense and are not worth the paper they are written on.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, know that.  The Taoiseach and I know that it is simply one more tactic that is being used by this Government to disguise the extreme nature of the proposal.  Will the Taoiseach be honest with the people for once in this debate and admit that post repeal, if it happens, absolutely no guarantees can be given on prohibition of abortion in either six, seven, eight or nine months?  That is the fact.</p></speech>

Taking those three things into account, the two doctors - there must be two doctors, both of whom are on the specialist register, to certify a termination beyond 12 weeks - will make the judgment as to whether or not the pregnancy has reached viability.  A pregnancy can only be terminated after 12 weeks if two doctors, both of whom are on the specialist register, determine that there is a serious risk to the life or health of the mother and that the pregnancy is not viable.  If it has reached the point of viability, a compassionate early delivery occurs and every effort is made to save the life of the baby at that point as well as the life of the mother.</p> <p> The legislation being put forward by the Government is not extreme.  It is considerably more conservative than the situation in the UK or the Netherlands.  It is very similar to the law in Germany.  One individual I met on the doorstep last night was a woman from Germany who explained to me how it works there.  It is very similar to what we have proposed where there is a cooling-off period of 72 hours, which gives the woman concerned a crucial period in which to consider other options and avail of counselling.  This is a much better situation than the current one where people acquire the pills over the Internet without medical support or counselling.</p></speech>

I think the Taoiseach indicated that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has not been established but it has been established.  It was announced to have been established in 2016.  Section 32B is not dependent on the authority.  The section concerns how to deal with clinical negligence issues.  The very heart of the Vicky Phelan case and the cases before the State Claims Agency were cases against the State.  The idea around section 32B was to prevent that kind of trauma and to give tools to the State Claims Agency to settle early, to provide for disclosure of medical and all other records and to work towards an early resolution.  The Minister is obliged to work with other Ministers and other agencies to bring about pre-action protocols.  This has not happened.  It was suggested yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that if this section had been commenced, things might have been different.  I am not saying definitively that they would have been different but they might have been different and a different approach might have been taken to these cases - from the State's perspective at any rate.  We are good at empathy and rhetoric but very poor at seeing through what we have committed to in legislation.  The Act was signed into law in December 2015.  It is now May 2018.  That key section dealing with how the State deals with people who have cases against it has not been commenced.  Does that not go to the heart of the problem and cut across all the rhetoric we have heard in the past two weeks?  We and the public need and are entitled to some explanation as to why that section has not been commenced.  The programme for Government promised mandatory disclosure.  That did not happen.  I understand why people become sceptical about commitments that are made when the evidence is that the follow through leaves an awful lot to be desired even in respect of legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

This is part of a major reform of our civil liability law in respect of personal injuries.  The Legal Services Regulation Act is coming into force on a progressive basis.  The section to which the Deputy referred is Part 15 of that Act.  I accept that it has not yet been commenced but it is one of a number of reforms that are being progressively rolled out.  It will involve a major change in the manner in which these actions are dealt with.

The collapse of Carillion has had a negative effect on these commitments on two fronts.  First, schools building projects awarded to the Carillion consortium face indefinite delay, despite some work being near completion.  These are not the only projects stalled as a result of the company's collapse.  Projects awarded to Sammon are also in jeopardy.  In my constituency our local GAA club, Naomh Fionnbarra, was directly affected with subcontractors walking off site in January due to non-payment.  There is less than two weeks' work left to complete with just a pitch to be laid - a pitch which is sitting in the subcontractor's warehouse - and minor fencing and lighting work to be completed.  It was hoped that with Sammon, the main contractor, now in examinership a speedy resolution could be found.  However, I learned yesterday that the Minister for Education and Skills has, in effect, fired Sammon and now intends to retender for this minor work, delaying its completion for at least another four months.  That work would take literally days to complete.  I ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Education and Skills can reconsider this decision to retender and instead find a more reasonable, more proportionate and timelier solution.</p></speech>

My Department is working with all the interests involved to try to secure the quickest completion of those buildings possible.  In some cases, we obviously need to sit down with the examiner to see if the latter can make a commitment to complete the work.  The Department will take a decision based on the best interests of the school in dealing with the examiner and with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.</p>  <p>  Carillion is involved through a public private partnership.  Under the terms of that partnership, it is not the State that has the obligation to complete the works, it is the Dutch Investment Fund, DIF, the contracting party.  It is for the latter to issue the tenders.  It has made a call for tenders and has yet to make a decision.  The State's financial position is protected.  We have to work the authorities in both cases - the examiner appointed by the courts or the remaining shareholder in Carillion - to try to secure the best interests for children.  That is what we are doing.</p></speech>

I think there is consensus in the House on modernising our harassment laws, which have not been updated since the era of the text message.  I refer to issues such as stalking, cyberbullying and revenge porn.  I understand the Cabinet discussed the matter this week and has agreed to proceed with a Bill I introduced and which passed Second Stage last year.  These matters are cause of grave concern in the broader community, particularly in respect of young victims of cyberbullying, which is a really serious issue.  How is it envisaged that this Bill will be progressed?  Is it intended to go to committee speedily?  My office has already been in touch with the Department of Justice and Equality and we would be delighted to facilitate the early passage of the Bill.</p></speech>

A mother was jailed on Friday last for alleged contempt of court for failing to surrender her family home.  This is day six and she is refusing food.  The receiver's actions came at the end of last week when, by agreement, the valuers for the vulture fund, Grant Thornton receivers and the owner were in discussions to resolve the issue.  Late last Friday evening the High Court ordered the retention of the woman in the detention centre in Mountjoy Prison.  This is day six and the woman is refusing food.

The decision of the Supreme Court is awaited.  What is going on?  In the meantime, this person is still in jail.  She has two teenage daughters at home, being minded by family.

Each company is doing it a different way and, as the Taoiseach stated earlier, while it is too late, it is still welcome that it is being done.  It is clear these companies are making these decisions because there is a legislative gap in that our electoral Acts do not set out in clear terms what the rules are around electronic and digital advertising in comparison to some of the other regulations we have put in place.  On that basis, does the Government plan to introduce legislation which will set out what the rules could and should be?  Will Fine Gael lead the way?  I believe that, to date, the Government has refused to answer the question I asked a number of months ago as to what each party here spends on Facebook advertising, in a spirit of transparency and honesty regarding political advertising, of which we are all in support.  Will the Government provide those figures and will it legislate to regulate online advertising in political elections and referendums?</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach intervene and ensure that funding is forthcoming?  In the aftermath of the CFRAM report, no funding has been allocated to Burnfoot.

These people have been denied compensation in respect of the awful abuse inflicted on them by their teacher, who has been convicted in court, due to the prior complaint requirement imposed by this Government's interpretation, or misinterpretation, of the Louise O'Keeffe judgment.  Will the Government now drop that unfair requirement and allow these people to access compensation for the awful abuse they suffered while attending these schools?</p></speech>

Juvenile arthritis is holding back up to 1,500 young Irish people from leaving full and vibrant lives.  I understand that the World Health Organization recommends six rheumatologists for a population of 4.7 million but in Ireland, we only have two.  The Irish Children's Arthritis Network is a volunteer charity supporting children who are living with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and their families in Ireland.  The charity informs me there were 793 children waiting to see a consultant rheumatologist as 2017 drew to a close.  It also revealed that the national average waiting time in 2014 was 125 days, which had increased by 2016 to 169 days.  I understand that some children have had to wait for up to three years for service.  By international averages we should have six rheumatologists for 4.7 million, but we only have two.  We should have at least six.  </p></speech>

They have been relieved of their duties to look after adult patients in order that they can now concentrate full-time on paediatric patients.  The Deputy is quite correct.  The international guidelines suggest that we should have six full-time consultant paediatric rheumatologists.  We now only have two.  It is intended as part of the HSE service plan for next year to approve the appointment of a third and then move on from there.  We will not get four in a year, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Many constituents call to my constituency office to complain that they cannot get planning permission to build their dream house because of local needs.  If one looks at the advertising in newspapers, the first thing one sees is "subject to planing permission" and then the dreaded words "local needs".  I do not think it is fair to stop people living in the countryside.  People nowadays will commute to the nearby towns and cities.  I live in County Louth, where a home house has to be within a certain radius of the site.  In my neighbouring county, County Monaghan, they cannot wait to get people to come and live in the countryside.  My questions to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, are whether we can get rid of local needs provisions and whether we are breaking European law by using the words "local needs".</p></speech>

While there, the manager told me about the recruitment of senior staff.  It is an issue all over the country.  It can take up to nine months for public hospitals because of the recruitment process and the various stages they have to go through with the HSE, whereas a voluntary hospital can carry out exactly the same recruitment of a senior consultant in nine weeks.  There is a serious problem here.  I was told of a case where a similar post was advertised by a public hospital and by a voluntary hospital.  The voluntary hospital had the staff member in place in just over two months, whereas the public hospital took almost a year to do the same.  The problem was not that the staff were not available, it was the process and the length of time it takes.  Can the Minister for Health look at that and come up with a solution, so that when we have staff shortages in our hospitals we can actually fulfil them quickly?</p></speech>

It is worth saying, however, that despite the recruitment challenges, we have more doctors and nurses working in the health services this year than last year and had more last year than the year before.  We are always looking at ways to further streamline the process.</p></speech>

As I have previously stated, that does not necessarily mean a doubling of agencies, embassies, staff or budget &ndash; though we are and will be expanding these where appropriate.  It means taking the steps necessary to double our impact around the world.  The exercise will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s visibility globally, extending our international influence.  It will position us for trade and investment growth in new and existing markets.  This is especially important as the UK leaves the European Union.</p>  <p>  It will also benefit our citizens when travelling or living abroad and will support deeper engagement with our diaspora, including through new and creative platforms.</p>  <p>  It will help showcase our culture to the world, and better communicate the benefits of living, working and studying in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of important steps to deliver this goal, including through the decision to open new embassies in Chile, Colombia, Jordan and New Zealand, as well as consulates general in Vancouver and Mumbai. </p>  <p>  In support of a strategic approach to deepening engagement with Germany, the T&aacute;naiste recently published a review entitled &ldquo;Ireland in Germany: A Wider and Deeper Footprint&rdquo;, making important recommendations, including opening a new consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of the eurozone. </p>  <p>  In addition, during my visit to the United States for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, I indicated our intention to expand and reinforce our footprint there, including through advancing our economic and other interests on the west coast.  I also announced Global Ireland, an initiative to help us communicate in a more coherent, compelling and streamlined way to an international audience.</p><p>The Government has also provided additional resources to our enterprise agencies, including to enhance the support they offer to Irish businesses impacted by Brexit.  Work on the initiative, which involves all relevant Departments and agencies with an international presence or dimension to their work, is continuing and I expect that the Government will announce further steps towards its delivery in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Having seen close at hand the work of our diplomats and international agencies, I have always supported the significant extension of our international reach and, indeed, during more straitened times, managed to do so as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  When we open new embassies and representative offices, there is a direct and continuous benefit to Ireland and our people.  What is missing in the plan to increase our international reach is a strategic approach to achieving this.  We must have focused priorities and be clear in setting out what we are trying to achieve.  Previous expansions in China and Asia, in particular during the late 1990s when we developed the first Asia strategy, have borne much fruit.  I recall as a former Minister with responsibility for enterprise putting pressure on a reluctant IDA to set up an office in China as we have to put roots down and may not get a return for a significant period afterwards.  Those expansions were accompanied by cross-governmental strategies which set out specific targets and ongoing objectives from agriculture to industry as well as political objectives.</p>  <p>  Immediately after the Brexit referendum, we were promised a detailed study of its staffing implications for the Civil Service and public service generally.  What is the status of this study?  Given the fact that there must be a training and development period before new recruits can operate at a high level, the obvious question is whether current recruitment is at a high enough level to fill the positions being created in time to deal with Brexit.  What specific international models is the Government seeking to follow?  Is it a case of expanding what we do or is there an intention to try new models, for example the way Scandinavian states frequently share facilities to reduce the cost of consular activities and support services?  Has an assessment been undertaken on staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach who are now required to work on Brexit?  Have staff numbers already been increased and is the Taoiseach satisfied that the expertise required is available?  Are there plans to increase staff in the Brexit area in the near future?</p></speech>

That did not happen.  The T&aacute;naiste then said in January that it would be launched over the course of the St. Patrick's Day events in the USA.  That did not happen either.  Nobody here will argue with the intended outcomes, which we are told are to attract greater investment to Ireland, build tourism and trade, build stronger links with the diaspora and increase cultural exchange.  Those are all very good aims which Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  An increased diplomatic presence around the world will no doubt increase the likelihood of delivering on those very goals.  Does the Taoiseach now have a definitive timeframe in mind to put the details of the plan in place and for its rolling-out?  What additional supports will agencies like the IDA and F&aacute;ilte Ireland receive?  These are particularly important and appropriate in the context of Brexit.  When will the planned new embassies in Chile, Colombia, Jordan and New Zealand be up and running?</p></speech>

Is it specifically looking at regions we need to invest in, beefing up existing embassies and-or establishing the embassies which have been announced?  As Deputy McDonald said, the Taoiseach announced new embassies for Wellington in New Zealand, Santiago in Chile, Bogota in Colombia and Oman in Jordan, none of which has actually opened yet.  When is it envisaged that they will open?  The Taoiseach has indicated that a new consulate general will open in Frankfurt and that our footprint on the west coast of the USA will be increased.  In the latter stages of the previous Government, of which we were both members, we increased our footprint in Asia.  Looking at China, we opened a consulate general in Hong Kong to supplement the consulate already established in Shanghai and the embassy in Beijing.  We also opened a new embassy in Jakarta and a consulate in Austin, Texas.</p>  <p>  Strategically, what is the Taoiseach's intention?  It would be interesting to have a view on that.  Is it the general view that new and existing embassies should migrate to the "Ireland House" structure where Bord Bia, the IDA and other bespoke Irish agencies are housed in a single centre?</p></speech>

He is seeking to isolate Iran, impose sanctions and escalate a dangerous conflict in the Middle East.  Many countries which are signatories of the nuclear deal with Iran are, rightly, rejecting what President Trump is saying and contending that the deal should be maintained.  It is important in this context for Ireland to nail its colours to the mast on this.  One way of doing so would be to restore an Irish embassy to Iran.  There have been calls to do so independently of the current situation by the Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers' Association and the Iranians are very keen on it also.  They have even offered to provide the building in Tehran.  All they want is diplomats to be sent over.  Iran has very many questions to answer about its policies in Syria and other parts of the Middle East, but we have embassies with many questionable regimes, including, for example, the Saudis and Israel, which has refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty while Iran has.  It is important, as this conflict is being escalated by Trump, that we send a message that we are not engaging in a confrontation with Iran.  Reestablishing an Irish embassy in Tehran would be one way to do so and it would also have economic benefits for this country.</p></speech>

Our new target is to publish it before the summer recess.  The idea behind this is to expand our embassy and agency presence around the world according to a plan rather than in the <i>ad hoc</i>way it has happened in more recent years.  Draft versions of the document exist but I am not entirely happy with them.  I am happy with what has been put forward by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the different agencies, but the existing draft is a bit weak when it comes to the permanent representation.  We will have to increase our presence in Brussels to a considerable extent in the absence of the support and alliance of the UK there.  We will be the only common law country in the EU and will have to build up new alliances.  As such, we will have to increase the permanent representation.  We will also have to look at the UK itself.  When it is outside the EU, we will need to find new ways to maintain the bilateral relationship.  The possibility exists of opening consulates in regional cities.  For example, we may reopen the consulate in Cardiff.</p><p>Having read the draft, it occurred to me that it was not strong enough on areas like culture, education and connectivity.  Our culture, arts, dance, music and literature are often the window through which a lot of people see Ireland for the first time, in particular in Asia and Africa.  It is an area which needs to be strengthened.  We can also be more ambitious around international education to encourage more international students to study here.  There is also an opportunity to build on the success we have had to date on connectivity.  Only a couple of years ago, there were no direct flights to the west coast of the USA whereas we now have flights to Seattle, San Francisco and LA.  Direct flights to two cities in China will also commence this summer.</p><p>The draft is strong on embassies and agencies but, as already noted, perhaps it is not strong enough in the context of the other aspects relating to expanding our global footprint, namely, culture, education and connectivity.  However, I believe we will get there over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p> A staff census of the different agencies and Departments is done as part of the document.  In terms of the models we have been examining, we have been looking at other small countries such as Denmark, which is a similar size to ours but which has many more suits and boots on the ground for what it does through its diplomats and agencies.  Interestingly, Denmark is paring that back whereas we are going in the other direction and expanding.  We have not planned to share with other countries.  I had not even thought of that but it is not part of the plan at present.</p> <p> It is intended to have more Ireland House establishments but that depends on where they should be.  For example, one of the potential locations for a new Ireland House would be Tokyo in Japan.  However, that would not make sense in countries such as Germany where the political capital is Berlin but where the economic activity is in Frankfurt.  It does not make sense to put an Ireland House in Berlin.  Similarly, in Australia, the political capital is Canberra but the business, tourism and other markets are in Sydney and Melbourne.  It makes sense in some countries but not in others.</p> <p> On Brexit, I am satisfied that we have adequate staff in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade and across the various agencies.  However, we must keep a watching brief on that because, as matters develop, we might need to respond to Brexit in different ways.</p> <p> The new embassies in Chile, New Zealand, Jordan and Colombia and the consulates in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Mumbai will all open either this year or next year.  We are also going to upgrade the existing office in Liberia to embassy status and expanding in Austin from one person to two.  All of this is under way.  In Chile, an ambassador-designate has already been appointed.</p> <p> Doubling our global footprint means doubling our impact.  It is done through a combination of measures and does not mean necessarily doubling offices, budgets and staff.  It means doubling our impact by a combination of increases in staff, budgets and offices and things such as education and culture.</p> <p> The Government supports the Iran nuclear agreement.  We believe it has helped to stabilise that region and has slowed down, if not stopped, Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.  We are aligned with our EU allies, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in their support for the agreement.  The Trump Administration has made a policy mistake in resiling from the agreement.  I expect we will discuss it next week in Bulgaria at the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government.  The Tehran embassy is under consideration again.  We had an embassy there for a long time but it was one of the embassies shut during the financial crisis.  As it is an expanding economy with a big population and it is an expanding regional power it is definitely on the list for consideration for an embassy in the future.</p></speech>

Yesterday, he again refused to acknowledge, let alone answer, some direct questions put to him about major departmental initiatives since he became Taoiseach.  Other Members have been accused of filibustering in respect of legislative measures but the record shows that the Taoiseach is filibustering in the context of replying to questions in order to avoid tough topics.  However, that is progress from last week, when he just went on the attack to avoid the question.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach say why contracts for &euro;2.5 million were signed in opposition to the concrete finding that the strategic communications unit activity should be set by the public, not politicians?  In other words, we were told there would be public research and that would inform investment in research.  That did not turn out to be the case.  Can he confirm that he was not looking for savings in the communications budget of &euro;174 million across the Government because most of that budget had been excluded from the unit's remit?  Will he accept that once and for all?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been saying for some time that he is to be congratulated for reducing his Department's budget.  Can he outline the policy changes that have generated these savings?  Are they substantive policy changes or simply variations in the usual annual changes in allocations for tribunals, for example, and for other matters which he does not actually control?  Will he outline the transfer of staff back to Iveagh House from the European Union division or has there been such a transfer?  What savings are reflected in his budget as a result of that transfer?</p>  <p>  Last July, the Taoiseach announced that he was reviewing the work of his Department and that he would make his intentions clear once this review had been completed.  What is the status of this review and is it near completion?</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach provide a breakdown of how many staff are assigned to each strand of this work in the division?  How many people are assigned to the EU-Brexit responsibility and how many are assigned to work on matters pertaining to the North?  Will he also indicate what the division of responsibility is within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of both of these areas?</p>  <p>  We touched on issues pertaining to the institutions in the North yesterday and the Taoiseach made some remarks in that regard.  I wish to raise a couple of issues with him on foot of what was said.  First, Sinn F&eacute;in is absolutely committed to getting the institutions back up and running.  We have met the Government and the British Government in recent weeks and emphasised that point to both.  The fact remains, however, that, after 14 months of negotiation and having reaching a draft agreement or accommodation, the DUP balked at dealing with language rights, marriage equality and implementing agreements on legacy issues.  It has, in effect, checked out of power-sharing.  This is due to its pact with the Tories, which is now the greatest obstacle to the restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions.</p>  <p>  The British Government fails to confront the DUP's anti-rights agenda in order to protect its own narrow interests.  The British Government has a responsibility under the Good Friday Agreement to deal with the rights issues at the heart of this political impasse.  These issues are not going away and they must be addressed.  In that context, it is incumbent on both Governments to convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to provide a framework for the resolution of these outstanding issues and for the honouring of agreements.  I acknowledge the efforts of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in requesting that this happen.  The time for the British Government stalling because of its pact with the DUP is over.  It must act.</p>  <p>  What conversations has the Taoiseach had with the British Government and the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, in respect of convening the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference?  That must happen as a matter of urgency.  For all of us who are committed to the re-establishment of power-sharing and the institutions, I need not state the urgency and necessity for the intergovernmental conference to meet without delay.</p></speech>

I wish to ask just three questions of the Taoiseach, if I may.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been hearing a more pessimistic tone coming from me in respect of what is happening with Brexit.  For my own information as much as anything, he might indicate with some clarity the structure of the Brexit team.  As I understand it, the team is headed up by a very fine public servant from his Department, Mr. John Callinan, who is the sherpa dealing with these matters in Brussels and reporting directly to the Taoiseach.  Will he outline the structure of the team under him and tell me how many are in it?</p>  <p>  Economics is obviously a strategic part of the work of the Department of the Taoiseach and across all Departments.  As far as I can recall, the Taoiseach does not currently have a specific economics adviser.  I think he is the first Taoiseach for some time not to have one.  Is it his intention to appoint such an adviser?  I think it is a position that will become increasingly important.</p>  <p>  The entire reform agenda was clearly a matter with which I grappled when in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not say this in any way to be critical of the current incumbent but it seems that the merger in political responsibility of the Ministries of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform means, in essence, that the reform agenda has slipped back.  That is a mistake.  Driving reform on a permanent basis is really important.  There are big issues emerging such as, for example, Sl&aacute;intecare.  The latter obviously falls primarily within the remit of the Department of Health.  However, the Department of the Taoiseach needs to drive the agenda in order to ensure that matters of this nature are deal with.  Is there a component part within his Department in this regard?  Is it the economics division or some other part of the strands he has outlined that is seized of and driving a reform agenda to set specific goals across the Government and the public service and to measure accountability?</p></speech>

However, I think any reasonable person would agree that it takes longer to answer a question than it does to ask it, so there is a substantial imbalance in the time allowed to ask questions and the time provided to answer them.  I must admit that I do not always know the answer to the question, particularly when it comes to issues such as staffing or administration, which, in general, are not dealt with by me but by the Secretary General.  However, I do endeavour to provide answers in writing to questions.  One of the questions that has come up recently concerns the reduction in staff numbers as a consequence of the winding down of the strategic communications unit.  As I have indicated today, three staff have already been reassigned.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked the same question Deputy McDonald has just asked about the breakdown within the international section between Northern Ireland, EU, Brexit and international affairs.  I gave a detailed breakdown in writing to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in recent days.  I am not sure whether he received the reply yet but, if I remember correctly-----</p></speech>

We do not need a survey to tell us that people need to know more about the benefits of good health or that they would benefit from good health.  However, there are areas of information deficits, and part of the citizens' survey, whenever it is carried out, will be to identify where there are such deficits and where people are not aware of Government policies and programmes.  If we repeat that survey every six or 12 months, we will be able to assess whether the campaigns are making a difference in increasing public awareness of these policies and programmes.</p>  <p>  I am still very much looking for savings in cross-governmental communications.  Even though the strategic communications unit is being wound down, the policy objective of seeking savings across spending on communications by Government and its agencies remains.  This is, of course, a matter of different circumstances on different occasions.  Semi-State agencies, for example, operate very differently from Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  Again, I would very much welcome the convening of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I have spoken to Prime Minister May about this, both by telephone and in person.  I am making arrangements to meet her in Sofia in Bulgaria next week, if she attends.  I do not have confirmation yet as to whether she will be in attendance but convening of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference is certainly one of the matters I would wish to discuss with her.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, as the House will be aware, is one of the structures established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It provides a mechanism by which the Irish and British Governments may discuss matters relating to the agreement and to Northern Ireland.  However, it is wrong to suggest that the intergovernmental conference is a silver bullet.  It is not a body that has any authority or executive powers.  Merely convening it will not add any further dimension to it that cannot be achieved from a bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and me, a meeting between the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland or other meetings that happen all the time.  I think to convene in this format would be beneficial but it would be wrong to think that merely convening it will produce a result or an outcome as it does not have decision-making powers.</p>  <p>  Regarding my advisers, I do not propose to appoint a specific economic adviser at present.  I know the appointment of such an adviser has been the practice in the past, so it may be something I do into the future.  However, my best economic adviser is Deputy Donohoe, the person I appointed to the roles of Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We meet almost every week to discuss-----</p></speech>

For example, my chief of staff, who is also one of my policy advisers, covers areas involving the economy, finance and infrastructure.  It is a case of getting the balance right.  The role of the Taoiseach is to drive Government, drive the implementation of the programme for Government, bring Departments together and ensure there is a cross-Government approach to matters.  However, one needs to get the balance right between driving Departments and micromanaging them.  That can be difficult.  I notice that the criticisms being made of me have shifted from my being too presidential and too overbearing and trying to dominate my Ministers a few months ago to now being accused of the opposite, namely, that I am not overbearing and not managing or not second-guessing them enough.  I think people will appreciate why it is never quite possible to get this balance exactly right to everyone's satisfaction.</p></speech>

This is one of the integrated education secondary schools in Northern Ireland.  During my visit, I met staff and students, including those from both of the main communities in Northern Ireland but also from the new communities there.  Often the new communities in Northern Ireland are forgotten or passed over.  It was good to see so many people, including so many children, from non-traditional communities attending the school and even working there.</p>  <p>  I also visited the Jethro Centre in Lurgan, which is run by the Shankill Parish Caring Association.  The centre provides facilities and services on a cross-community basis in the Lurgan area and has received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I met a group - including children, teachers and community workers - involved in cross-community work and I was given an overview of the work being done by the wide range of projects run from the centre.</p><p>I also paid a visit to Warrenpoint Harbour where I met business people who are customers of the port and listened to their concerns about the impact and challenges and uncertainties of Brexit for their business.<br/><br/>Overall, my visit proved to be very informative and worthwhile.  All the people that I met, from all sides of the community, were very welcoming and I was pleased to have the opportunity to engage with them.<br/><br/>I did not have any meetings with representatives of the political parties in Northern Ireland during my visit.  The Northern Ireland Office was notified of my visit in advance, as is standard practice. </p></reply>

However, what was surprising is the lack of any urgency in what he said, and there being a significant step away from the strength of calls for actions by the parties which the Taoiseach made earlier this year.  Perhaps this is merely a reflection of the Taoiseach's new support base, it is important to look after one's voters.</p>  <p>  The absence of the anti-Brexit majority in Northern Ireland from any major discussions happening between the devolved administrations and London causes damage every day.  That is something that was made clear by the leaked documents which Sinn F&eacute;in published in Brussels last week.  Given the scale of the threat posed by the non-functioning institutions and the British Government's refusal to establish the former consultation processes with Dublin used during previous suspensions, it was very surprising that yesterday the Taoiseach said that he has had no conversation with the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, in the past six weeks.  Did he seek a conversation that was rejected by London or is it really the case that in the midst of the twin crises of Brexit and the suspended Belfast institutions, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister see nothing wrong with failing to speak for six weeks?</p>  <p>  I am perfectly willing to believe that a combination of chaos and disinterest in London is the cause but I do not think the Taoiseach will find a period in the past 25 years when a Taoiseach and a Prime Minister went for so long without talking, especially during such a crisis as that of the suspension of Northern institutions or of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I note the Taoiseach's earlier comments but I think an intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now.  The maximum utilisation of the agreement is imperative.  Otherwise elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance.  That ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute.  </p></speech>

That is remarkable.  At the same time the Taoiseach was visiting communities in the North, and I welcome the details of the visit, the Oireachtas had its session in Dundalk with Michel Barnier.  If one looks at what was said there and couples it with what we have seen and heard from London in the last week, it is clear that we are on course for a crash-out Brexit rather than a deal.  That is my assessment of where it seems to be going, not what I would want it.  That is of huge consequence for everyone and should be our political focus, including communications with the British Government.  It also calls into question North-South communications and our need to maintain good relations with all parties, representatives and all people on this island during what will be a difficult and bumpy period.</p>  <p>  I have one suggestion for the Taoiseach.  I understand that on the same day he visited those schools and the people in Warrenpoint, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was meeting my colleague, the leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland for the first time.  It had proved difficult to set up that meeting.  It took time.  Worse still is that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland refuses to meet parties such as our own.  The Taoiseach once responded to me that there are two tiers of parties in the North, there are the big five to whom the Taoiseach speaks and then the smaller parties.  We must get through this incredibly difficult time in Irish history and avoid a continuation of sectarian divisive politics.  One of the paths back to talking to unionist and nationalist communities and moving away from the sectarian divide is to start talking to all parties and engaging them in the process.  Relying on the big two, or nationalists and unionists and the sectarian divide as the inevitable outcome of the Good Friday Agreement, is not clever at this time.  Engaging with people such as my colleague, Steven Agnew and others will allow us to start breaking down those sectarian barriers and start connecting with the nationalist and unionist community in the North during what could be a very rocky moment in Irish and British history.</p></speech>

I thank him for his report on the visit.  I take it that Warrenpoint was chosen specifically with the Brexit dynamic in mind.  The significance of the port in Warrenpoint cannot be overstated.  It has a growing reputation.  Its location is halfway between Dublin and Belfast, and is at the centre of growing trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  It is a healthy thing and it would be welcome for the Taoiseach to visit the North as regularly as he can.  Unlike others, I do not believe that the Taoiseach must meet party political people all the time, it is not necessary although it is necessary that all the parties are met, including Mr. Agnew and the Green Party, and I see no reason why that should not happen.  However, I should say that the reason the institutions are down is not because of a sectarian divide, <i>per se</i>, although the North is a State which was created and defined on the basis of a sectarian headcount and the Good Friday Agreement is the vehicle for moving beyond that.  The reason the institutions are down is because of a failure by the DUP to really buy into and sign up for power sharing.</p><p>We have a set of issues that need to be resolved.  We had them resolved in February, to be fair.  The accommodation was not perfect from a nationalist perspective but we were convinced that it was enough to move on; the DUP took a different view.  That is why I raise the issue of the intergovernmental conference once again.  I know there is no silver bullet and nobody has a magic wand in this scenario but I also know that we need a forum, a mechanism and a momentum within which we can sort these matters out and provide a roadmap and the resources necessary for so doing.  I also believe that such a mechanism must be within the architecture and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which is why the intergovernmental conference is so important.  I also believe that it should have been convened by this stage.  It is very dangerous to allow this to drift.  I understand there are tensions from Dublin to London, as well as an obvious and perhaps unavoidable tension, given the broader Brexit politics.  I am fully <i>au fait </i>with the dynamics of between the DUP and the Tories, which are most unhelpful, but we need to sort these issues out and we can.  However, if the Taoiseach is not prepared to force the pace on these matters, the Tories will very happily sit back.  Some of their leading lights, their hard Brexiteers, would be more than happy to put the Good Friday Agreement through the shredder and I know this because they have stated that very publicly, and when they said it, they meant it.  We should take them at their word.  I urge the Taoiseach to press this matter very hard with Theresa May and the British Government, namely, that we convene this intergovernmental conference without further delay.</p></speech>

A meeting is under consideration for next week, if we are both able to be in Sofia at the same time.  I will also travel to Romania on the way to Bulgaria to meet the Romanian President as part of the contacts we are building up in the EU on Brexit and other matters.  That also will be subject to confirmation.  Prime Minister May and I have each other's mobile phone numbers and it is possible for us to contact each other whenever we need to but currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and the various Cabinet meetings taking place in the UK to determine their position on the customs union or the customs union partnership and how that might evolve.</p><p>Currently the focus has been on the negotiations in Brussels and on the various Cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union or a customs union partnership and how that position might evolve.  The most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British Government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement.  Absent that, it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment.  There are, of course, many other contacts at official level through the ambassador.  In recent weeks the Minister for Finance met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the T&aacute;naiste met with David Lidington.  Of course we compare notes on what happens at those meetings and what messages are coming across from London to Dublin with regard to where things might go and what the British Cabinet might decide on the customs dilemma, which seems to be taking up a lot of its time.</p> <p> On the Green Party in Northern Ireland, I certainly regret that it took so long to organise a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste.  I am very much of the view that we should engage with all parties in Northern Ireland and I welcome the fact that there are forces in Northern Ireland other than unionist and nationalist forces, including the Alliance Party, the Green Party and also some socialist groups.  However, in scheduling meetings we obviously have to have regard to the respective mandate of each party and, whether we like it or not, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are very much the largest parties in Northern Ireland and represent the majority of each community respectively.  That is a reality of politics in the North.</p> <p> I was very keen to visit Warrenpoint, particularly because of Brexit as it is, in many ways, a cross-Border port.  Some 40% of its trade goes to or comes from south of the Border.  It was very interesting to talk to the people who use the port about how they believe customs controls could impact on their businesses, not necessarily or even particularly in the case of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but in the case of customs controls between the UK and other parts of the European Union, which could also have a real impact on people's businesses.  I also have a personal interest in ports given my happy period as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I have now visited every port in Ireland bar one.  That is one off the list.  There is a number of reasons as to why it has not been possible-----</p></speech>

Obviously there is the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in dynamic.  There is a real trust issue there.  There is mistrust between those two parties which is making it extremely difficult to come to an agreement.  I am not sure what the two Governments can do to engender trust between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in but we will certainly do anything we can.  The lack of trust is one of the fundamental problems and one of the fundamental reasons why those two parties have not been able to come to agreement, or at least not to an agreement that could stick.</p>  <p>  There is obviously also the atmosphere of Brexit, which creates enormous difficulties.  It is going to be difficult to get the Assembly and Executive back up and running until we have a clearer idea of the shape of Brexit, of the new relationship between the UK and the European Union, and of how Northern Ireland and the Executive and Assembly fit into it.  It is going to be difficult to get the institutions up and running in the next couple of months for that reason.  The ongoing renewable heat incentive, RHI, investigation is also part of the backdrop to this.  I am, however, confident that it will be possible to have the Executive and the Assembly functioning again.  It is very much in the interests of Northern Ireland.  All the time when I meet people from Northern Ireland they are so frustrated and so disappointed with the political parties.  It is now even a case of a plague on all your houses when talking to many people because they are so disappointed that the institutions are not up and running.  As co-guarantor of the agreement, the Government will continue to strive until things are working again.</p></speech>

The report has recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra should be a national cultural institution in its own right or within the National Concert Hall and that the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra should continue to be part of RT&Eacute;, functioning as a classic radio orchestra.  This is based on researching the model of symphonic music provision around Europe and the changing environment in which public sector broadcasting now exists.</p><p>Both the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I have welcomed the recommendations of the report and in particular that recommendation dealing with the status of the National Symphony Orchestra.

I expect to bring an early report to Government to chart a way forward which will include the steps needed to address the recommendations.</p><p>This is an exciting time for orchestral music in Ireland with the proposed redevelopment of the National Concert Hall and the Government&rsquo;s ambition under the Creative Ireland programme.  Since it opened, the National Concert Hall has been the home of the National Symphony Orchestra and there is now an opportunity for it to play an even stronger role as part of these wider developments.  The proposals in this report should be of long-term benefit to the musicians in both orchestras and should help address long-standing concerns about orchestral provision in Ireland.</p></reply>

I would say that it is a scary time for those involved in the orchestras.  They have seen the orchestras starved of cash by RT&Eacute;.  Has the Minister discussed with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the failure of RT&Eacute; to fulfil its statutory obligations to establish and maintain orchestras, choirs and other cultural performing groups as laid down in the Broadcasting Act 2009 in recent years?  Is she concerned that RT&Eacute; has been starving the orchestras with the hope that the people would have to double-fund them?  We will have to fund them through the Minister's Department while already having funded them through the licence fee.  Is she concerned that RT&Eacute; is doing this as a trick in order to increase its funding rather than for any other reason?</p></speech>

The report confirms this view while also recognising RT&Eacute;'s overall funding position as it plans for the future.  These recommendations offer a solution which protects and supports both orchestras while also recognising the balance between RT&Eacute;'s financial constraints and its public service role in promoting music, arts and culture.  RT&Eacute; is going to give the recommendations full consideration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, RT&Eacute; is funded by the licence fee in addition to commercial income.  Licence fee payers are members of the public, as are taxpayers, and therefore it is the public that pays for orchestral provision and our public service broadcasting.  It is now proposed that the Government would fund part of the cost of the National Symphony Orchestra totalling &euro;4 million, with RT&Eacute; continuing to fund the balance.</p><p>It is also recommended that the National Symphony Orchestra become a stand-alone entity or become part of the National Concert Hall.  I am already on record as supporting these recommendations, which will ensure that orchestral music is allowed to grow and flourish once again in Ireland.</p></speech>

They have allowed them to become run down.  Their funding has been decreased dramatically in recent years.  It seems to me that the Government does not exercise any control over agencies that have statutory obligations laid down by this House.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister telling me that, as well as paying our licence fees to fund the two orchestras, we will actually have to pay more taxes, amounting to &euro;4 million in general taxation, to pay for them again?  If RT&Eacute; cuts its funding to the orchestra in the future, will we then have to pay again?  Is this just a mechanism by RT&Eacute; to get more funding?  The Minister should remember that RT&Eacute; will get a bonanza of cash in the next ten years when we start to provide houses for the people.  Every house virtually means a television licence, and every commercial property means a television licence.  We know we are very short of houses.  When we eventually get around to building the houses the people need, RT&Eacute; will see a massive increase in its income.  The Minister is still letting it off the hook.  Can she tell me that if she does what she is doing, she will not be asked time and again to get us to double-fund these orchestras?  Is it her intention to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to rescind the Broadcasting Act 2009?</p></speech>

This issue will also be considered by officials.  I do not want to prejudge, however, what proposals might be generated in this regard.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Deputy note that the valuation will cover the optimum model for the National Symphony Orchestra, either as a stand-alone agency or as part of the National Concert Hall.  It will also examine opportunities for growth and development within any new governance structures.  It will also examine legal requirements for any new governance structure, including any changes to legislation, any issues in respect of the transfer of employment rights of employees, short and medium-term funding arrangements and governance arrangements.  Following consideration of these proposals, I plan to bring a memo to the Government with a view to implementing a programme of action in this regard.</p></speech>

Therefore, the GPO is a national monument.  It has never been officially declared one but, if it came under threat, it would be the moral and legal duty of the Minister to issue a preservation order to protect it.  Her Department has stated clearly and officially that the Moore Street battlefield site is a national monument, yet she has refused to date to identify a large number of buildings in that space as comprising a national monument and to issue a preservation order.  Is the Minister not derelict in her duty regarding these buildings, given that they are under pressure owing to a very large planning permission application, if she does not issue a preservation order?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-09a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050900023#V00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  Under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, a preservation order may be made where it appears to the Minister that a monument, which in the Minister's opinion is a national monument, &quot;is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured or removed or is falling into decay through neglect&quot;.  Apart from any question of whether each and every building referred to by the Deputy would appropriately be regarded as a national monument, I am not advised that they are subject to any immediate threat.  On the contrary, as the Deputy is aware from his membership of the Moore Street advisory forum, the owner is advancing plans to preserve and conserve many of these buildings, and in particular those with a direct connection to the events of Easter Week 1916.  Consequently, the conditions do not exist in which the making of a preservation order would be warranted in any event.</p><p>As the Deputy knows, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street comprise a national monument owned by the State.  It forms a unique and coherent streetscape of substantially intact mid-18th-century structures.  Collectively, Nos. 14 to 17 represent the most significant, original, complete, discrete and continuous section of substantially intact pre-1916 buildings on the street, most of the remainder being post-1916 buildings.  Today all of these houses retain significant 18th-century elements, including staircases, partitions, plasterwork, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures. </p><p>The 18th-century building form and profiles also survive.  More important, so too does the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they made their way up the street.  The Deputy has been privileged to see these at first hand.</p><p>By contrast, I note that No. 25 Moore Street, in respect of which the Deputy's question is seeking to have a preservation order made on grounds that it is a 1916 building, was actually constructed entirely anew from the ground up in the mid-1990s as a dedicated facility for Dublin City Council's street-cleansing operations. </p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>As a member of the Moore Street advisory group, and as noted earlier, the Deputy is aware of the meeting some weeks ago where agreement was reached on the modalities of engagement between the owners of the Moore Street development site and the advisory group to secure a way forward for the revitalisation of the area in a manner that will recognise the views of all stakeholders and reflect its historical and cultural significance and its employment and economic value to the north inner city - and all in a manner consonant with the recommendations of the previous Moore Street consultative group's work &quot;The Moore Street Report - Securing History&quot;.</p><p>The Deputy will recall that the key recommendation of this report was the establishment of the Moore Street advisory group, of which he is a member and which has the task of devising an agreed plan among the key stakeholders that will take account of the needs of the area in a way that also respects and acknowledges its importance in the context of the 1916 Rising and ultimately the foundation of the State.  Fundamental to this objective is the dialogue that is now taking place with the owners of the site that extends from Moore Street to the Carlton cinema in O'Connell Street.</p><p>I was very pleased to hear from the chairperson of the advisory group of the constructive engagement between group, including the Deputy, and the owners.  I believe that this is the appropriate way in which to address the issues relating to the site and its wider environs.  I am pleased that a foundation and framework has now been laid for positive and fruitful co-operation, dialogue and interaction between all the key interests in Moore Street under the aegis of the Moore Street advisory group.  I encourage the Deputy again to continue to engage and contribute to that process through his membership of the group, which I believe is best placed to deliver a satisfactory outcome for all stakeholders.</p></speech>

The White Cottage, Henry Place, was occupied and held under fire by Michael Collins.  The Bottling Stores, Moore Street, were occupied and held by Captain Frank Henderson, and were the location of the killing of Michael Mulvihill and Henry Coyle.  No. 10 Moore Street was the point of entry to the terrace, the leaders' refuge, the location of the field hospital set up by Nurse Elizabeth O'Farrell and Julia Grenan, and the location of the killing of Paddy Shortis.  Nos. 20 and 21 were the location of the acceptance by the Volunteers of the surrender order after consultation with Clarke, Plunkett, Collins and Mac Diarmada.  No. 25 Moore Street was the location of the killing of The O'Rahilly, Charles Corrigan and Francis Macken.</p>  <p>  Does a live planning application that details the destruction of buildings and streets not constitute a danger?  It is a planning application that could be proceeded with at any time.  The buildings I note here are of major heritage importance.  The recent court cases have made it abundantly clear that it is not up to the Judiciary to issue protective notices.  The Judiciary has actually kicked the ball back into the court of the Minister and said it is her responsibility to do so.</p></speech>

It clarified that it is the Minister, and not the courts, who is charged with determining what constitutes a national monument.  The Minister does not require planning permission for works to a national monument provided there is consent in place under section 14 of the National Monuments Act.</p>  <p>  I mentioned why there is no necessity for a preservation order in the cases the Deputy mentions.  It would only be a distraction from the more important objective, which is to secure a viable future for the Moore Street area.  A far better approach is for all concerned to engage in meaningful discussions under the aegis of Moore Street advisory group, come up with a solution for the street that everyone can support, and do so as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the main property owner on Moore Street is Hammerson, whose portfolio extends as far as the former Carlton cinema on O'Connell Street.  I am pleased with the new vision Hammerson has presented, which now recognises the need to reflect history, community and culture in the way this area is to be revitalised.</p></speech>

The ministerial forum, therefore, is in no way negatively disposed towards the idea of the Minister issuing a preservation order.</p>  <p>  Anyone who goes to Moore Street will see it is frozen in dereliction.  It is frozen because of the hiatus the Government has created in the area.  I am asking the Minister to break that hiatus with a simple decision, namely, to turn Moore Street into the vibrant cultural and historic quarter it could be.  The traders on the street are prisoners of the Minister's policy.  The inertia of the Government is putting them into a sterile area where it is really difficult to earn a living.  I will introduce in the Oireachtas next week a Bill seeking that the Oireachtas identify Moore Street as a national monument.</p><p>The responsibility is the Minister's.  The planning application is live.  Nothing is stopping that planning application from proceeding.  I urge the Minister to do the right thing and issue a preservation order.</p></speech>

He mentioned the trade affair.  I believe that the advisory group met with Dublin City Council and discussed a range of issues.  A submission was made by the group on behalf of the traders to the review currently taking place with regard to the casual trading by-laws.  I believe that Dublin City Council is currently examining all submissions in this regard.</p></speech>

The cases in question relate to the removal of the Maser mural from the Project Arts Centre under threat of the centre losing charitable status from the Charities Regulator and the withdrawal of an event entitled "The Question of the Eighth" from the International Literature Festival in Dublin under threat of the withdrawal of funding by Dublin City Council.</p></reply>

They challenge us to think outside of our comfort zone and to understand the rationale for debate or change by engaging us interactively.</p>  <p>  By their very nature, arts and culture organisations lead and reflect societal change.  As we work together to ensure that people are heard and listened to, we will see that the stories we tell, the work we make and the society we share begin to change shape for the better.  The voices of the excluded, the less powerful and the marginalised, are amplified and broadcast.  This change is inherently powerful.  Artistic freedom must be recognised and valued.</p>  <p>  Historically, artists and writers around the world have played a major part in effecting societal and political change.  I think particularly of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Mexico, the work of a particular favourite of mine, Maya Angelou, during the civil rights struggle in 1960s America and that of our own Seamus Heaney during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Their writings prompted debate, which ultimately brought about change.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Arts Council is the primary body that allocates funding to artists and arts organisations.  Although funded by my Department, the council is statutorily independent in its funding allocations and I, as Minister, cannot influence this funding.</p>  <p>  I presume the Deputy is raising the matter in the context of the current referendum.  In this instance, public bodies are also obliged to act with impartiality and are all subject to the clear guidance from the Referendum Commission that any information disseminated by Government or its agencies or bodies involving the use of public funds must be equal, fair, impartial and neutral.  That is a separate obligation which falls on public bodies.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of arts and culture to societal well-being.  It is an opportunity to prompt debate.</p></speech>

Toni Morrison famously said, &quot;All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS.  What are these people talking about?&quot;  She also stated:</p><blockquote>All good art is political!  There is none that isn't.  And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, &quot;We love the status quo.&quot;</blockquote><p>I am not sure whether there is any good art that is not political but I certainly think that attempting to rule out or censor art on the basis of it being political is extremely troublesome.  Does the Minister agree with the Charities Regulator's move to say that unless the Maser mural was removed from the Project Arts Centre, the centre could lose its charitable status?  Does the Minister agree with Dublin City Council's decision to threaten the withdrawal of funding from the International Literature Festival in Dublin unless a particular event, which was about the eighth amendment and which was not a campaigning or repeal event, was removed.  Does the Minister agree with the decision to threaten to withdraw funding with the result that a particular event was cancelled?</p></speech>

Dublin City Council cited the guidance from the Referendum Commission, which, in turn, restates the guidance from the Attorney General that public funds, as I said earlier, should not be used to promote either side of the debate during a referendum.  The mural referred to by the Deputy included the words &quot;Repeal the Eighth&quot; with a heart around them and was on the outside wall of the Project Arts Centre.  The mural was created by Maser, an artist originally from Ireland who now lives in the US.  Unfortunately, the mural ran contrary to the Charities Regulator's views on this.  I know the Taoiseach made comments in the D&aacute;il about it previously in response to a question from Deputy Coppinger.  He said:</p><blockquote>I understand this decision was made by the Charities Regulator, not the Government, and I assume the Charities Regulator would have taken the same approach or attitude had it been a pro-life or anti-abortion mural.  I have no doubt but that the mural will appear elsewhere.  Someone who owns a private building may wish to make the space available for the mural to be reinstated.  Perhaps even the fact that it has been removed means more people saw it than might have otherwise seen it had it not been removed.  While one can paint over a mural, one certainly cannot paint over an issue.  The issue is that nine women every day in Ireland are forced to travel overseas to end their pregnancies and three women in Ireland every day - the number will only rise into the future - import pills online and take them without medical supervision and guidance, often in their own homes.</blockquote></speech>

Censorship of art is happening under the banner that a referendum is due to take place.  How far does it go?  What will be censored next?  Una Mullaly wrote about her event and stated:</p><blockquote>My event was about a book.  It was not a campaigning event.  It was not a rally or a demonstration or a hustings.  If I am said to be &quot;taking a side&quot;, then what does shutting down an event about a book look like?</blockquote><p>That one cannot hold an event that touches on an issue that is being discussed in a referendum seems to be an extremely over-zealous interpretation on the part of Dublin City Council around the question of the use of public funds.  Again, with regard to the Charities Regulator, the interpretation is being used in such a way that the Catholic Church, which has charitable status, can campaign fully for retention of the eighth amendment, as is its right, with no threat to its charitable status because it is said to be linked to its core purpose.  Yet an arts centre cannot have a piece of art that refers to and has a slogan about the repeal of the eighth amendment on it because it does not relate to its core purpose, but it is art.  It is not campaigning; it is art.  The Government can have an opinion on it.  It can disagree with the Charities Regulator and have different regulations and a different interpretation of the law or, if necessary, there could be an amendment to the Charities Act.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that he did not find the mural in any way offensive but he did not think it would be murals or posters that would change people's minds or convince them regarding this issue.</p><p>What we need is proper independent information such as we are getting from the Referendum Commission, which just started its work in recent days, and those of us who wish to advocate change going out there and speaking to people one-to-one, not berating them or preaching to them, but listening to their concerns and answering their questions.  I think the Deputy is aware of my views about wishing to have the eighth amendment repealed, but we still have to obey the law and the guidelines of the Referendum Commission on both sides of this debate.  I also point out that the Project Arts Centre received &euro;718,000 from my Department in 2018.  Art has always had the potential to stimulate conversation and be a driver for social change.  I hope it will continue to do so.</p></speech>

These crafts and skills are transmitted from generation to generation and constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history.  They contribute to our sense of identity and continuity, respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.  Heritage crafts include practices from traditional building skills in thatching, stonework and boat building, to lace-making and making hurleys and musical instruments such as harps and uilleann pipes.  Heritage crafts also include textile work such as spinning fleece, weaving and felting, rush and straw craft, rope making, traditional woodwork and heritage gardening.</p>  <p>  My Department protects and promotes heritage crafts through a number of avenues.  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the national heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council's heritage in schools scheme also promotes children's engagement with heritage crafts.  This scheme makes available to primary schools a current panel of 160 heritage experts, including experts in traditional crafts who visit primary schools to work directly with the pupils.  The scheme currently reaches nearly 100,000 primary school pupils over the course of 2,000 school visits each year.  The value of the scheme is in the richness and depth of knowledge it makes available to children and teachers, engaging children in a direct experience of their heritage, preferably outside the classroom, where possible and appropriate.  Practitioners of crafts are themselves part of the living heritage.</p></speech>

I agree it is hugely important to retain these crafts, which are there since time immemorial.  As generations pass on, it is very important that whatever residual information there is in regard to these crafts is protected, and I welcome that.</p>  <p>  I point out there was a ceardlann or craft centre at the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta centre outside Dingle.  Such places are very important, particularly as sources of employment and tourism.  I urge the Minister to continue her work in this area.  Perhaps she might comment on the making of craft beer, which is returning on a huge scale throughout the country.  It is a renewal of old skills.  If we have a plan or a model, we should try to follow it.  I welcome the work the Heritage Council is doing.</p></speech>

I thank him for his contribution.  Active practitioners of crafts throughout the country who are carrying on any type of tradition that I delineated, and who wish for it to be recognised as part of our national cultural heritage, may wish to consider submitting an expression of interest to my Department's national inventory of intangible cultural heritage, an open call for which is currently under way.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that Deputy Heydon's wife is otherwise engaged at the moment and that is why he is not here today.  We hope there will be good news over the next couple of days for them and I wish them all the best.  I had some details in regard to Kildare for Deputy Heydon.  Kathleen McCormick is a fantastic willow basket maker in County Kildare.  She grows and harvests the willow herself and is involved in several exhibitions in Kildare, and I wanted to mention her.</p></speech>

Now in its 66th year, the organisation has a growing international network and contributes significantly to our reputation abroad as a culturally rich nation.  Its work in Ireland has undoubtedly sustained and grown participation and enjoyment of Irish music, dance and the Irish language.  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann is central to all these endeavours.</p>  <p>  Recognising the critical role which Comhaltas plays in supporting our traditional heritage, my Department provides ongoing financial support to the organisation.  In 2018, my Department has allocated &euro;1.6 million to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann towards operational costs and onward support of regional branches and county boards.  Typically, regional branches organise their local fleadhanna cheoil and Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann is organised by the ard-chomhairle of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  This represents significant ongoing support in regard to all activities organised by Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann at both national and local level and to the benefit of any town chosen to host Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann.  As we will see this year in Drogheda, and in recent years in towns including Sligo, Ennis and Derry in Northern Ireland, the scale of the fleadh requires significant engagement and support from the relevant local authority.  I know this is willingly given by local authorities as they are aware of the prestige and other benefits which hosting the fleadh brings to the local area.  In this regard, I see the role of my Department, in addition to the major funding provided to Comhaltas itself, as supporting local authority capacity to develop cultural engagement and creativity locally.  This is in keeping with pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland programme, Enabling Creativity in Every Community, in which all local authorities are important partners.</p></reply>

The Minister is right that the work it does internationally in promoting our rich heritage and culture of music, dance and the Irish language is second to none.  When it comes to a town, the national fleadh is magnificent.  It attracts 400,000 attendees and brings some &euro;40 million to the region.  Of the 400,000 attendees, 25% are international visitors coming to our island.  It is second after St. Patrick's weekend in terms of the level of festivities involved.</p>  <p>  The Minister confirmed that the Department funds Comhaltas annually.  Given the huge significance of the fleadh to Ireland nationally and on the international stage, will she consider making specific departmental funding available to towns?  Despite working in partnership with the local authority, it still involves a large cost to host the all-Ireland fleadh in any town.</p></speech>

The fleadh is coming to Drogheda this year and, as the Deputy rightly points out, there will be more than 400,000 visitors.  The &euro;1.6 million for Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is very welcome.</p></speech>
