    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800003#A00600"><p>The introduction of universal GP care for all children aged under six years represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees.  The new enhanced service will involve age-based preventative checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children with asthma under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child diagnosed.</p>  <p>  The contract for the under sixes was issued to GPs by the HSE at the end of April following the conclusion of contractual discussions and the approval of fee rates by Ministers.  GPs are self-employed contractors and it will be up to each individual GP to decide whether he or she wants to sign up and provide this new enhanced service.  A substantial number of GPs have signed the contract to date.  As of 27 May, some 830 doctors had returned signed contracts to the HSE.  The executive anticipates the receipt of further signed contracts in the coming days.  I am confident that there will be sufficient numbers of GPs participating to introduce the new service as planned.</p>  <p>  The HSE plans to begin patient registration for the under sixes service on schedule in early June so that the service can commence in early July.  In order for a doctor's details to be included in the HSE's online database when patient registration begins, signed contracts must be returned by 5 June at the latest.  The HSE will continue to accept signed contracts after that date and will add the details of the doctors concerned to its database on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  This service will be of great benefit to young children and their families.  It involves significant new elements that support the Government's policy of keeping people well.  It is tangible evidence of our commitment to the goals and objectives of the Healthy Ireland framework.  I welcome the fact that this important new service will commence in July.</p></reply>

We tabled our question because this is a key platform in the delivery of health care and the roll-out of universal access to GPs.  It is also a stated policy of Government that feeds into the move towards primary care.  The contract is important.  The negotiation of the broader General Medical Services, GMS, contract is, conveniently, to conclude next April.</p>  <p>  Let us be honest - free GP care for the under sixes does not appear to be getting off to a great start.  Why has there not been a large uptake?  Why are GPs not clamouring at the Minister of State's door to sign contracts?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State clarify whether contracts are being offered to GPs who have not undergone the vetting process?  This issue was reported at the weekend.</p></speech>

They are all on it.  The contract is not available unless a GP is on the specialist register.  This reassurance needs to be made.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant uptake.  In the coming days, there will be more.  It is not as if we will have a cut-off point on 5 June.  Rather, that is the point at which we will start putting details online so as that young families can see who is available in their areas.</p>  <p>  Delays resulted from the court case that was taken by an individual.  The courts determined to give the HSE two weeks.  However, there is no delay in registration or access.  That process is going ahead.  As we speak, more contracts are arriving.  Deputy Kelleher will agree that GPs, by their nature, are cautious people, and so they should be, as they are dealing with the health of the nation.  They want to consider what is available to them.  In the main, though, they are signing up and we are receiving new contracts every day.</p></speech>

The register will be published on 6 June and families will be able to see which GPs are partaking in the scheme.  Geographical access will be important.  The rate of uptake is one matter, but if large geographical areas see no uptake by GPs, has the Government a plan B?</p></speech>

He has known me for long enough.  Even before this process began, we experienced difficulties with GP coverage in certain areas.  Workforce planning in terms of what needs to be delivered in a primary care service in the community will always be a challenge for us.</p>  <p>  As to what number I would consider a success, I would prefer 100%, but we will never get that.  Certain practices do not have a large cohort of under sixes.  Therefore, it will not be an issue for them.  Whether the rate of uptake is 80% or 60%, as long as there is coverage in the country and options for young families, it will be a success.  However, the real success was getting the commitment of a Government to introduce this scheme.  I do not doubt that Fianna F&aacute;il will support it as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800004#B00100"><p>I am strongly of the view that any new patient advocacy service should be set up independently of the HSE from the outset.  For this reason, the HSE removed reference to the establishment of an interim patient advocacy agency from its service plan for 2015.  My view has been supported by the recent recommendation made in the HIQA investigation report on services at Portlaoise hospital on the need to establish an independent patient advocacy service.  HIQA's recommendation is that an independent patient advocacy service should be in place by May 2016.  I fully agree with the recommendation and intend to see it implemented in advance of the timeline provided by HIQA.</p>  <p>  The scope, role and functions of the independent advocacy service will be considered, with the appropriate structural, governance and funding arrangements that need to be put in place.  My Department will be consulting widely on the best way to get the service up and running in the shortest possible timeframe.  The role of the independent patient advocacy service will be to support and advocate for patients in their dealings with the health service.  Regrettably, the health service has not been as responsive to patients who have had bad experiences as is required.  A patient advocacy service can assist in redressing the balance in the relationship between patients and service providers. </p>  <p>  Enforcement and implementation of HIQA recommendations are also essential.  Creation of a further body, with a potentially overlapping role with existing statutory bodies such as HIQA, is not my preferred solution.  In many ways, HIQA is already a patient advocacy agency and has very strong powers to monitor service providers' compliance with national standards, conduct targeted inspections and make recommendations.  As part of my 2015 priorities, I committed to developing a new mechanism for demonstrating that HIQA's recommendations were being implemented by the HSE.  Discussions are under way between my Department, HIQA and the HSE to finalise this mechanism which will see action plans to implement HIQA's recommendations transparently reported on and monitored.  In the meantime, I have put in place a specific oversight mechanism for the implementation of the recommendations made in the Portlaoise hospital report.  This process will be chaired by the Chief Medical Officer and will submit monthly reports to me which I will publish on a quarterly basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800004#B00200"><p>The Minister did not address my question at all.  I understand he is not the author of what he has just read, but, not only in the question I posed to him but also in the brief introduction I delivered orally, I asked why a key component of the plan announced by the former Minister in respect of the Government's policy on health, namely, the patient safety authority, had been dropped.  It was announced by the Taoiseach in October 2014 that there were no plans to proceed to introduce a patient safety authority.  Surely it should not be a case of either-or between a patient safety authority and a patient advocacy agency.  When the matter of patient health and safety is involved, one should complement the other.  It is interesting that within two months of Deputy James Reilly's removal as Minister of Health this was the position articulated.  I note this followed a statement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on new structures, including the patient safety authority, describing them as being part of the proliferation of quangos.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not known for its caring nature, let alone its knowledge and appreciation of the reforms necessary in the health service.  Did the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, play a role in influencing the decision not to proceed with the establishment of a patient safety authority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800004#B00300"><p>No.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had no role to play in the decision, rather it was a policy decision taken by me.  The plan before I took office was to establish a patient safety agency as a sub-agency of the HSE and the post of CEO of that sub-agency was advertised.  The CEO would have been an employee of the HSE.  I decided, however, that the original plan was wrong on two counts.  First, a patient advocacy function should be independent of the HSE from day one.  Staff should not be employed by the HSE; its budget should not be controlled by the HSE and it should be a separate entity, funded by my Department, for obvious reasons to avoid conflicts of interest.  Second, the previous plan was to establish a patient safety agency that would, in fact, duplicate the functions of HIQA.  HIQA has extensive patient safety agency functions.  It is a patient safety agency which will have additional functions, including licensing, to enforce its recommendations in the future.  Therefore, something different was needed.  We did not need a duplicate HIQA as a sub-agency of the HSE but a totally independent patient advocacy service.  That was my thinking, which has now been confirmed by the recommendations made by HIQA.  My understanding is that the Deputy accepts HIQA's recommendations and supports the establishment of a patient advocacy service.  Therefore, we agree on that point.  Perhaps the Deputy might tell me what a separate and additional patient advocacy agency would add that is not already provided for.</p></speech>

He should play back what he has just said.  I fully accept that a patient advocacy agency is a requirement and the subject of one of the recommendations made in the Portlaoise hospital report.  I also agree that it should be independent of the HSE.  The current position where Patient Focus has performed this role and performed it well for many years is that it is directly funded by the HSE, which is inappropriate.  We are <i>ad idem</i>in that respect.  However, a patient safety authority is an entirely separate proposition.</p></speech>

The point is - the Minister knows it as well as any other voice in this House - that HIQA's reports, findings and recommendations are continuously ignored by the HSE.  The Minister's Department is not playing the role it should have been in insisting on recommendations being acted on and implemented.  We have report after report from HIQA with recommendations that have been ignored.  We need a patient safety authority, acting not only on HIQA's recommendations but also the findings of reviews commissioned by the HSE, many of which have been completely ignored.  We need a body with the power to act and ensure health and safety are always the critical factors, rather than budgetary considerations at the expense of people's lives.</p></speech>

It is not the case that HIQA's recommendations are ignored, as significant numbers are implemented.  That has been the case, particularly in matters around hospital hygiene.  The reports show that we now have the lowest MRSA rates in years.  For example the rates for Clostridium difficile are falling.  We have put an extra &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million into the ambulance service this year in response to HIQA's recommendations.  However, not all of HIQA's recommendations can be implemented immediately.  Some require spending, for which we do not have the capacity, while others are unlawful.  For example, HIQA made a recommendation regarding the ambulance service, the implementation of which would have been unlawful.  We would have had to change European law to implement it.  It is not the case that HIQA is right about everything.  If the Deputy talks to people who run nursing homes or nurses who work on a ward, they will give him chapter and verse.  I agree with him, however, that we need to make HIQA's recommendations more enforceable.  The way to do that is to give it the power to license hospitals.  It would then have an added licensing function, to license hospitals to do X, Y and Z and if hospitals did not implement its recommendations, they would lose their licences.  There is already that power in the case of nursing homes and care facilities, where HIQA can go to court to have them deregistered.  I want to give it that power in the case of hospitals also.  We do not need an extra agency to do this.</p></speech>

The target is that 90% of patients be seen within 20 days of receipt of a referral.</p><p>A number of actions have been taken by the hospital to improve the timelines of access for patients to prostate cancer services.  These have included the referral of 37 new patients to St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin in February and the referral of 47 new patients to the Mater Private Hospital in November 2014.</p> <p> Additional consultant urologists are required in University Hospital Waterford and the hospital has prioritised these appointments.  One new consultant urologist commenced work in April and a second is due to commence work next month.  When both consultants are in place, University Hospital Waterford will be better positioned to achieve the national access standards for prostate cancer services.</p> <p> In February 2015 there were 24 new attendances at Waterford&rsquo;s prostate clinic and, of these, four patients or 17% not 50%, have had a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer.  In total in February, 12 patients received a prostate cancer diagnosis but it is important to say that some of these were not new attendances and they were not seen for the first time in February.</p> <p> In conclusion, the development of prostate cancer services in Waterford has been identified as a priority and because of that significant service enhancements are now under way and the private sector is being used in the interim.</p></speech>

Only one in eight men nationally were seen within the recommended deadline of 20 days of referral.  The clinic is supposed to provide rapid access yet delays in filling staffing shortages in Waterford University Hospital have resulted in the longest delays.  That is very worrying because according to the HSE's own figures, half of the men referred to the Waterford clinic were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.  I do not need to remind the Minister that early diagnosis is key to the survival rate of patients with prostate cancer.</p>  <p>  We were promised additional consultant urologists.  Could the Minister confirm whether he said a urologist who was appointed in April is now working in Waterford and that ancillary staff are in place?</p></speech>

Approximately one in six new patients are diagnosed with cancer on referral, not half.  What Deputy Halligan is including there are people who were already diagnosed previously and are returning to clinics.</p></speech>

It is not that half of people referred have prostate cancer.  That would never be the case for a cancer clinic.</p>  <p>  What has happened is University Hospital Waterford needed more staff and it was hard to get the staff.  The private sector has had to be used in the interim and will be used if needs be.  I do not like doing that but I have no qualms doing it if it is necessary for patients to get timely treatment.  Recruitment for consultants is difficult.  Deputy Halligan will know that the socialist high tax, low pay policies he supports would make it much harder to recruit the necessary staff.  If he honestly believes that it would be easier to recruit consultants to Waterford by increasing income tax on those who are well paid, he does not have the interests of his constituents at heart.</p></speech>

First, internationally, Ireland ranks among the lowest in Europe for urologists <i>per capita</i>.  A recent European survey stated that there were only 23 urologists in Ireland representing a rate of 3.2 specialists per 100,000 males aged 40 and over.  In Spain, the rate is 19 specialists per 100,000 of similarly aged males.</p><p>Hospital workers told me during the week that we could double the amount of urologists in Waterford and we would still not have enough to address the referrals.  Does the Minister acknowledge that?  I also understand that many patients who were on elective urology waiting lists had appointments cancelled because we simply did not have additional beds or theatre space.  That has nothing to do with the cost of appointing a urologist.  I am telling the Minister what staff in the hospital told me.  Anytime I am in the hospital I speak to consultants and others about the relevant issues.  They told me that the prime concerns are space, beds and ancillary staff.  Therefore, even if we were to appoint urologists we do not have the facilities in place.</p></speech>

In view of the growing population and the fact that there will be more older men every year for the next 20 years or 30 years - I will get there at some point - we will need to increase the number of urologists every year.  It may well be the case that we need to double the number of urologists in the next five to ten years.  It is not an easy thing to do.  It costs money.  We need to be competitive with other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Canada and America, which is the reason it is important that people do not vote for candidates who would impose high taxes on people who we are trying to recruit back home.  That is why it is very much in the interests of people in Waterford who may have a cancer diagnosis that they do not vote for Deputy Halligan's politics at the next election.  That is very important.  It is not just consultants who are hard to recruit, we are also having difficulty recruiting theatre nurses.  There is theatre space in Waterford but it is difficult to recruit theatre nurses as well.  We are embarking on a campaign overseas and in the UK over the summer to try to improve the situation.</p></speech>

The objective of the question is to find out what plans the Minister of State has to invest in services where there are deficits across the country, in order to ensure that people with disabilities on waiting lists can have a fulfilled opportunity to play an active role in society.</p></reply>

As a matter of fact there has been an increase.</p><p>The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the disability services programme through the Health Service Executive's national service plan for 2015.  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  However, it is acknowledged that current waiting lists for some therapeutic supports are high.  We are coming from a very low base.</p><p>In 2013, additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided to strengthen primary care services.  This comprised &euro;18.5 million for the recruitment of more than 260 primary care team posts and more than &euro;1.4 million to support community intervention team development.  In 2014, the roll-out of the<i></i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme entailed targeted investment of &euro;4 million and the provision of 80 additional therapy posts, to improve services for children with all disabilities.  As of 30 April 2015, a total of 47 of the 2014 posts have been filled, a further 20 are at the stage of &quot;post accepted&quot; and the process is ongoing for the remaining posts.  A further &euro;4 million allocation was announced in 2015 to continue work on this programme.  I am confident that the additional resources being invested in both primary care and disability services will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services to all children with disabilities, including those who may currently be on waiting lists to access therapy inputs.</p><p>Deputy Keaveney probably knows better than I that we are coming from a low base.  The difficulty is that we are building up a system in order to ensure that people do not have to wait more than 12 months.</p></reply>

I thank the Minister for the response on the specific area of investment in waiting list reduction.  Currently, more than 400 people with disabilities are on a waiting list for speech and language therapy.  A total of 1,000 people are waiting for physiotherapy.  In particular, I am concerned about the growing waiting list for personal assistants.  More than 520 people with disabilities are waiting for personal assistants and 680 are waiting for home help hours.</p>  <p>  I welcome the renewed focus to address those waiting lists, as opposed to the cuts that have taken place with respect to mainstream services such as cuts in disability allowances, fuel allowances, drug payment schemes and the increase in prescription costs, among others.  I am separating the issues in the response.  I am particularly interested in the focus of investment on tackling waiting times with a greater urgency.  The issue is critically important.  Waiting times are of concern, and I am particularly alarmed at the volume and number of people who are waiting.</p></speech>

The initiatives will continue to be funded this year.  Given that we have provided additional resources of &euro;20 million, plus &euro;4 million for those aged up to 18 years, it is unacceptable that waiting lists continue to be as they are.  I agree with the Deputy that the focus needs to remain on waiting lists for speech therapy and physiotherapy, in particular.</p></speech>

In the light of the slightly unedifying spectacle on the last Priority Question about taxation, we need to see greater urgency.  I would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister of State spoke to the senior Minister in that Department to secure greater resources.  This issue needs greater urgency and focus and there also has to be greater political will.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State has that political will, but perhaps the Minister needs to reflect on the scale of investment required to tackle the spiralling waiting lists.</p></speech>

In fact, both the project and the system should be well thought out and managed.  We are building a system that will respond, but the building of the system will take time because, as the Minister rightly said in his last reply, it is quite difficult to get people through the recruitment process.  We are having the same difficulties in disability services as in acute hospitals.  In fairness to my parliamentary colleagues, there has never been resistance to the budget for the delivery of services.  While I do not have responsibility for the social protection element, as the Deputy knows, in the case of the element for I have responsibility, I have received nothing other than complete support.</p></speech>

Last January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I directed the HSE to ensure maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment, or a first consultant-led outpatient appointment, of 18 months by mid-year and 15 months by year end.  In February, shortly after the 18 month maximum waiting time was announced, the number of inpatient and day case patients requiring treatment by the end of June to achieve that requirement was 4,995.  As of last Friday, 22 May, this number had reduced by about half to 2,693.  The HSE, in conjunction with hospital groups, is focused on delivering treatment targets through maximising the use of existing capacity within and across hospital groups in the first instance.  However, there are key limiting factors, primarily in terms of theatre nursing staff and consultant manpower in particular specialties.  Consequently, it has been determined that up to 1,500 inpatient and day case procedures may need to be outsourced.  A notice to tender for the provision of these services was issued on Friday, 15 May by the HSE, with a view to contracting with service providers this week.  It is anticipated that the outsourcing of treatment to private facilities will commence shortly and conclude by the end of June.  The HSE has advised that the number of inpatient and day case patients waiting over 18 months will have been reduced by 98% between the announcement of the maximum permissible waiting time in January and the end of June.</p>  <p>  As regards outpatient appointments, the number at risk of breaching the 18 month maximum waiting time by the end of June has reduced by 7,773 within the past seven weeks.  As well as initiatives similar to those for inpatient and day case treatment, regular intensive waiting list validation and additional clinics will be used to further reduce waiting times for outpatient appointments.</p></speech>

Does he agree that a system where such referrals are allowed is open to abuse and presents a potential conflict of interest, at the very least?  Given that practitioners are being paid in these instances a second time for work they are already contracted to do and handsomely paid to carry it out, does the Minister not believe a very serious scrutiny of the practice is required, if he has not already embarked on such?  In case he is not aware, I refer him to a parliamentary question for witten reply which I submitted earlier this week which draws his attention to the fact - I repeat it is a fact - that this double jobbing, double pay abuse, is not confined to front-line practitioners within hospital services but applies also, apparently, to some managers and directors of services at hospitals and other settings within the HSE.  Will he act to root out all such potential conflicts of interest across the health service?</p></speech>

If the Deputy wants to write to me with the details and evidence, I will certainly have the matter investigated, as is always the case.  As this initiative has only started in the past couple of weeks, it is too soon, obviously, to have it audited.  It is necessary.  Having people waiting so long for outpatient appointments and treatment is a huge risk.  Frankly, I do not think waiting periods of 15 months and 18 months are particularly ambitious targets, as the figure should be a lot less than that and closer to three or six months.  However, we are doing what we can within available resources.</p>  <p>  I accept that there is certainly potential for conflicts of interest.  There is also potential for moral hazard because, when one pursues waiting list initiatives such as this, one sometimes ends up rewarding those who are not performing and those who are not keeping their waiting lists down and there are, of course, other risks.  However, in this case, we really had to put patient safety and patient outcomes first, ahead of all those legitimate concerns about initiatives such as this.</p>  <p>  One thing that is very different between what is being done and what was done by the NTPF is that it is not a case of people self-referring.  What is happening is that somebody is going through the waiting lists, validating them, finding the people who are waiting for very long periods of time and offering them treatment.  Where it is possible, we are using existing public facilities, but, sometimes, that is not possible.  To give one simple example, there is just not enough theatre space in Crumlin hospital to undertake the number of scoliosis operations that need to be performed on young children.  As a result, a number of cases have been dealt with in Blackrock, Temple Street and Cappagh hospitals, as well as in other public and private hospitals, and more will be dealt with because that is what is required.</p></speech>

At the same time, however, they are being pushed into the private system, with the same consultant in the same hospital, if they furnish five figure sums - fact - and it is then a case of, "We can see you in the next two to three weeks."  This puts those families in financial distress as they are not the people with ready cash to pay for it.  They are already struggling in life and this is a hugely important moment, a challenge to either the man or the woman, in the case about which I speak, and his or her family.  This is an absolute outrage and it has fed an ever-growing view in society that there is an abuse involved, whereby waiting lists are being created to put further pressure on those who are waiting to drive them towards "pay up and pay out" to line the pockets of those in this mode in front-line practice.</p><p>They bring only shame on their profession in my view.</p></speech>

Health insurance does not cover pre-existing conditions, so it would not cover it anyway in such cases.  Quite frankly, waiting lists sometimes are badly managed.  One has to drill down into them to really understand them.  When I looked at some recently, I noted when it came to surgical procedures and day cases, people being seen within three months were being seen quicker.  So, there were more people being seen quicker but then at the tail-end, there were people being put on the long finger for longer.

It has been raised with the Minister at the health committee at which it has been suggested it be dealt with by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, some other assistance from elsewhere or the provision of additional resources to the public system.  Something has to be done.  The pretence we are getting on top of waiting lists needs to stop.  People are now awaiting alarming lengths of time to see a consultant on an outpatient basis.</p></reply>

To comply with the commitment which I announced in late January of a maximum permissible waiting time of 18 months by the end of June and 15 months by year end, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with acute hospitals, the special delivery unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The effect of these measures is already evident.  In early February, a total of 4,995 patients required treatment to achieve that measure.  As of Friday, 22 May, this number had reduced to 2,693.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with hospital groups, is focused on delivering on this requirement through maximising the use of internal capacity within and across hospital groups in the first instance.  However, there are key limiting factors, primarily in terms of theatre nursing staff and consultant manpower in particular specialties.  Consequently, it is recognised that judicious outsourcing is also required and this is being managed through a public tendering process.</p>  <p>  The elimination of the longest waiting periods for treatment is a key performance objective for 2015.  Its achievement will allow for progressive improvement in access to treatments throughout the year.</p></reply>

In Waterford, for example, 27,156 people are waiting for an outpatient appointment, of which 11,127 have been waiting 12 months or longer.  That is up almost 2,000 people since January 2015 and up 8,935 in a year.  That is the way the trend is going.  While there may be dips from time to time, the overall trend is in one direction and it is an alarming problem.</p>  <p>  In Cork, the figures reveal 52,000 are on outpatient waiting lists at Cork University Hospital, the Mercy and South Infirmary Victoria.  Almost 13,000 people are waiting longer than 12 months for an outpatient appointment.  This is not for an inpatient appointment but someone&rsquo;s first contact with a consultant.  It is quite alarming.</p>  <p>  Whether the Minister has to admit defeat or otherwise, I do not mind how he does it.  However, he has to do something to ensure that these people can access treatments and additional capacity is provided.  If it requires using the private sector, so be it.  Something must be done and quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800007#E01300"><p>It is important to understand the figures.  The higher figure will always be high.  It is anyone who is waiting for an outpatient appointment for any period.  That includes people who are waiting two weeks or two days.  As health services expand, more consultants are appointed and more clinics are established, that number will always be high.  That is the way it works.</p>  <p>  What we do need to address is people waiting too long.  The figures the Deputy used are for people waiting for over a year which is a patient safety risk.  Anyone who is currently waiting over a year will have their appointment by the end of the year.  We will use whatever additional finance is necessary to do that.  Unfortunately, in a number of subspecialties, the relevant specialists just do not exist.  We will either have to offer people appointments abroad or, in some cases, may not be able to offer them an appointment as I would so wish.  It will not be financial constraint, however, that prevents that from happening.</p>  <p>  There is a bigger picture too.  Waiting lists need to be better managed.  Significant numbers of people do not turn up for the appointments for which they have been waiting ages.  Significant numbers of people on waiting lists are not really on them at all as they already have been seen by a different consultant or may have subsequently gone private.  We also have a problem with referral rates.  The numbers referred is increasing more than it should be.  Often people wait for a long time to see a consultant, only to be told that they did not need to see the consultant at all or need to see a different consultant.  We need to improve the quality of referrals from general practice into secondary care.  The e-referral programme is a big part of that.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about referrals.  At the same time, GPs, general practitioners, are unnecessarily referring more people to the acute hospital system and to consultants due to lack of resourcing in primary care.  GPs are effectively looking at the number of people outside their surgery doors.  The Minister is one himself, so he should know how it works.  Any condition that is complex or needs further analysis will often be referred on because the GP does not have the time, resources or systems and is under pressure.  That is one reason  there are more people going on to the waiting lists.</p>  <p>  There is no point in us pretending but there has been a massive increase in the number of people waiting over a year.  In Cork, it is almost a 600% increase.  I accept the more consultants and lists one has, the bigger the headline figure will be.  The one underneath that, namely people waiting a year, does not lie.  That is simply because there is no capacity in the system.</p></speech>

There are inappropriate referrals.  Ask any speech and language therapist, any physiotherapist or any consultant and they will tell one about inappropriate referrals, namely people who should not have been sent to them in the first place.  This happens, unfortunately, and needs to be better addressed.  I hope the e-referral system over the next several years will allow us to tackle this well.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that there are issues in general practice.  People have been referred to consultants and hospitals for 24-hour holter monitoring or minor surgical procedures, all of which could be done in general practice if it were properly funded and GPs were remunerated accordingly.  That is one of the items that is now in discussion as part of the new GMS, general medical services, contract, namely better remuneration for GPs and encouraging them to do 24-hour monitoring, suturing and other minor procedures.  The minor surgery pilot is already funded for this year to cover some of these.</p>  <p>  There is a mix of issues involved.  However as I said earlier, anyone who is waiting a year or more for an outpatient appointment should have that by the end of the year with the exception of a few small specialties where the specialists do not exist.</p></speech>

When A Vision for Change, a good document, was published in 2006, it looked away from locking up people behind walls and drugging them to their eyeballs.  The plan, however, was that the acute bed units would not be done away with until there was enough support and facilities in the community to replace them.  This has not really happened and A Vision for Change has remained just that, a vision.</p></reply>

The executive is continuing its approach to develop integrated mental health care across both counties.</p>  <p>  The significant funding provided by this Government is enabling Waterford-Wexford mental health services to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change, to move from a traditional hospital-based model to a more patient-centred and community-based care. </p>  <p>  In 2010, the acute mental health unit in St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy, County Wexford was amalgamated with Waterford mental health services to provide a 44-bed acute inpatient mental health unit in University Hospital, Waterford.  In addition, arrangements are in place whereby service users who live in north Wexford, and who attend Tara House mental health services in Gorey and require acute inpatient admission, have access to Newcastle Hospital, County Wicklow.  Overall, 49 acute inpatient beds are available in the area which meets the requirements set out in A Vision for Change.  Development of community mental health services include day hospitals and associated services at Wexford, New Ross, Enniscorthy and Gorey. </p>  <p>  In addition, mental health services covering Wexford include Tara House in Gorey, Carn House in  Enniscorthy, Summerhill in Wexford, Maryville in New Ross and a suicide crisis assessment nurse service available in Wexford.  The latter provides a skilled mental health nursing service for those in suicidal or self-harm situations.  This is based at the emergency department in Wexford General Hospital where there is a liaison nurse-led, seven-day service.  In July 2014, a new purpose built crisis respite unit opened in Enniscorthy, providing ten respite beds for service users referred through a community mental health team, for respite care. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at local level, and that any new service or capital development proposals can only be considered and prioritised in the context of the annual HSE national service plan, and the multi-annual health capital budget.  I understand that the HSE has already supplied the Deputy with a more detailed response on 28 April 2015 to his recent parliamentary question on this matter. </p></speech>

To gain access to those services people need a referral letter from their general practitioner.  What is a family supposed to do if a family member is in acute crisis and suicidal?  The person has to go to an accident and emergency department and sit in a corridor or on a trolley waiting to be accessed.  As there is no consultant psychiatrist in Wexford General Hospital, the psychiatric liaison nurse will have to ring Waterford hospital to consult a psychiatrist there.  If it is decided that the person in crisis needs to go to an acute bed in Waterford, they are sent off and will have to go through the accident and emergency department in that hospital also.  Therefore, a Wexford patient will have to go through two accident and emergency departments.  It has happened in the past that people sent to Waterford hospital from Wexford General Hospital were sent home, having travelling all the way there while in acute distress.  It is all a bit mad.  It is not a good service.</p>  <p>  Back in 2009, Susan Lynch, the HSE manager of mental health and elderly services, said that an acute ward in Wexford General Hospital was more than a proposal, that it was in the HSE's south capital plan, but it never happened.  It fell off the lorry.  Why did it not happen?</p></speech>

I speak not only to HSE people but to the people who deliver the service on the ground and I speak to one person in particular in Wexford on a regular basis.  An investment of more than &euro;18 million has been made in Wexford.  A Vision for Change was published in 2006 and I believe it needs to be updated, but I have to say that if I listened to every request for an acute hospital I would reopen every psychiatric hospital in the country.  On the other hand, I have a magnificent new unit in Cork in which people will not work, which is illogical in regard to psychiatric services.  Wexford is well served with day hospitals, as the Deputy rightly said.  There is a respite unit, crisis houses and an assessment nurse which many other places do not have.  Also the ECD who runs the service in Waterford is an incredible man.  When I ask him questions such as the one the Deputy has asked, and I will inquire about it with him, he tells me there has never been a case where somebody needed to be admitted who was not admitted.  There may be instances where people need to be assessed and returned to their own community and I have no doubt that happens.  I will make further inquiries on foot of the Deputy's parliamentary question.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has said that Wexford and Waterford are well served, but, according to the HSE's mental health division plan for 2015, spending per capita in the mental health area in the region is &euro;148.  That compares to &euro;223 in Carlow-Kilkenny, &euro;198 in south Tipperary and &euro;206 in Mayo.  The average number of acute beds per thousand of population across the country is 0.21 and it is 0.16 in Waterford-Wexford.  People in Wexford who have to go through two accident and emergency departments are at a disadvantage to people in Waterford who only have to go through one accident and emergency department.  Also, people in Wexford have to travel to Waterford and Wexford is one of the poorest served areas.  This area has a suicide rate of double the national average and an unemployment rate as of today of more than 23%.  That is incredible.</p></speech>

I was of the opinion that a person should not go through an accident and emergency department but because of the  difficulties in regard to self-harm and possible self-harming, the accident and emergency department is the appropriate place, and I am convinced of that now, but the service would also include the suicide assessment nurse-led team.  People who have a difficulty with their mental health and are in crisis would be assessed both for their mental health and for their physical well-being.  I will make further inquiries on foot of the Deputy's parliamentary question.  I am setting up a new group to examine what is beyond A Vision for Change and if it reports back to me with a recommendation that we should have an acute unit in every single town, I will take a serious look at that but as of now I am not convinced of that.</p></speech>

In view of the HIQA report into the infant deaths in Portlaoise hospital and its recommendations and the testimony given to us at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in recent weeks, there is an urgent need for us to address that failed commitment and ensure we have a patient safety authority of standing.</p></reply>

For this reason I removed reference to the establishment of an interim patient advocacy agency from the service plan for 2015.</p>  <p>  My view has been supported by the recent recommendation made in the HIQA investigation report on services at Portlaoise hospital on the need to establish an independent patient advocacy service.  The HIQA recommendation is that an independent patient advocacy service should be in place by May 2016.  I fully agree with the recommendation and intend to see it implemented well in advance of the timeline provided by HIQA.  </p>  <p>  The scope, role and functions of the independent advocacy service will be considered along with the appropriate structural, governance and funding arrangements that need to be put in place.  My Department will be consulting widely on the best way to get the service up and running in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>  <p>  The role of the independent patient advocacy service will be to support and advocate for patients in their dealings with the health service.  Regrettably, the health service has not been as responsive to patients who have had bad experiences as is required.  I believe the patient advocacy service can assist in redressing the balance in the relationship between patients and service providers. </p>  <p>  The proposed establishment of a number of new statutory bodies is something that I have given consideration to in the context of the immediate priorities associated with the overall health reform programme.  I believe there are some functions associated with the patient safety agency that are currently carried out to an independent high standard already by HIQA.  I do not propose at this stage to interfere with these arrangements and instead intend to address the major gap in advocacy and support to patients through the new independent service.</p>  <p>  I also intend to improve the advice available to me on patient safety through the enhancement of my own Department's patient safety function under the leadership of the chief medical officer.</p><p>This will allow such advice to be incorporated within the existing accountability arrangements between the Minister for Health and the HSE, HIQA and other regulators and health bodies.</p></speech>

The best way we can address the issue of advocacy for patients and those who use the heath service is to try to ensure we have accountability.  The best form of accountability is to have information available to the public, including on the performance of hospitals and individuals within hospitals in terms of outcomes, assessments and comparators across health services, in order that people can scrutinise hospitals and see how good their performance is.  While HIQA is very much into the quality side, there is a gap evolving in the information flow in ensuring full information and accountability across the health service.  The patient safety authority should have a role in ensuring people are aware of the performance of hospitals in orer that they can make informed choices.</p></speech>

Information that is available, provided it is collected accurately, should be made public in order that patients can see it and if there are discrepancies between hospitals and services, they can at least ask probing questions as to why.  That is why a few months ago, for the first time, my Department published data by hospital for all sorts of issues, including caesarean section rates in maternity services and in-hospital mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes.  This was replicated at community level.  We intend to expand the report next year and include more information into it, including perinatal mortality statistics.  Information on certain complications is already included.  It will be produced by my Department and published annually.  It is very important that we include patient experience data.  An external survey will be conducted of patients' experiences of hospitals and it will be reported on.  A satisfaction survey was conducted in the past and will be carried out again and will be published annually.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy does not do this, others abuse the statistics.  Medical statistics are produced within competence intervals and have a margin of error, plus or minus 5% or even 25%, particularly when dealing with low numbers.  We all need to stand together against vested interests and some in the media who turn data into league tables that are not statistically significant.  We need to be united against that misinformation and sensationalism.</p></speech>

Some days ago I referred to the perinatal pathology services in the context of the debate on Portlaoise hospital.  It is critically important that people have confidence in the statistics and that the statistics cannot be massaged and manipulated for various, sometimes nefarious, reasons such as when it is tried to suggest there is a deficiency in a service when it is just a statistical blip due to small numbers.  I understand all of this. </p>  <p>  On the issue of MRSA in hospitals and trying to get hospitals to be cleaner, only when the information was being published did hospitals across the service become motivated and concentrate on making an effort to encourage staff, clinicians and management to work together to address it.  When information is available, people can make informed decisions on whether a hospital is run well and whether the clinical outcomes are correct.  It should be part and parcel of the agency if HIQA is unable or incapable of doing it.</p></speech>

However, it is important that the data are reliable.  Unreliable data are no good to anybody and can be harmful.  The role of the patient advocacy service will be to advocate for patients generally and individually.  I do not intend it to gather and publish statistics, which can best be done by the patient safety unit in my Department or HIQA.  We do not need to duplicate another agency to collect and publish statistics.  We should just do it.  It does not require a statutory agency to do something that can already be done.  The patient advocacy service will do something that is done by NGOs but is not resourced and supported to the extent it should be.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the personal tragedies of the families at the centre of these sad incidents and do not want to intrude on their privacy.  I offer my sincerest sympathy to the families involved who have suffered such a sad loss.  As Minister for Health, I do not have access to any patient's medical records, report or medical information which is confidential and should not be discussed on the floor of the House, even if I had access to it.  The HSE incident management policy is being followed and reviews of the circumstances of the cases are being undertaken.</p>  <p>  Regarding the incident which occurred in November 2012 and referred to by the Deputy, the first clinical incident review was undertaken and completed in July 2014.  However, a second clinical review was commissioned in September 2014 following a legal challenge which saw the first review quashed.  A draft report from the second  review team is due shortly.  A second review of a case which occurred in April 2014 is also under way and a draft report is being finalised.  A review of a third infant death in Cavan General Hospital in May 2014 is also under way.  A fourth infant death occurred earlier this month and the process of establishing a review team in line with HSE's national incident management policy is under way and should happen forthwith.  There should be no further delay.</p>  <p>  Pending the outcome of the reviews of the incidents referred to and in view of the need to respect the privacy of the families concerned, I am not in a position to make available any further information on the investigations at this time.  I have been assured that HIQA will conduct a focused programme of monitoring of compliance with the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare across maternity services nationally.  This programme will include the maternity unit at Cavan General Hospital.  HIQA has commenced this work which will be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Separately, the HSE is taking steps to commence a quality, risk and patient safety assurance review to assess the current governance arrangements in place in selected HSE-run maternity units.  Cavan General Hospital and South Tipperary General Hospital are to be included in this review.  If immediate patient safety concerns are identified during this review I expect them to be acted on immediately.</p></reply>

Although I do not know who has been given responsibility for the 2014 reviews, I know the four names of those entrusted with the second investigation review of the tragic loss of baby Jamie Flynn.  The information has been publicised.  Will the Minister tell us who is conducting the further reviews of the May tragedies and if the offer of responsibility has issued in the most recent tragic loss?  I can comment on the list of those who have been asked to investigate a second time the tragic death of baby Jamie Flynn.  They are eminent practitioners and professionals.  My concern is the length of time it takes.  They are very busy people in their respective areas of responsibility and, as a result, the time they can invest in carrying out these investigations may be limited.</p><p>Is the Minister is considering making future appointments to such positions on as near to a full-time basis as possible to ensure the speediest possible reporting, publication of findings and implementation of recommendations?</p></speech>

I hope the Deputy understands why.  In regard to the fourth case, the review team has not yet been established.  We have been in contact with the hospital to impress on it the importance of beginning that review expeditiously.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that individual case reviews in Cavan, Portlaoise and elsewhere are taking far too long.  If we assign people to work on them on a full-time basis, that would mean moving them from front-line activities.  Perhaps that is something we need to do or alternatively we should use people who have retired from clinical practice.  There are consequences for other patients when people are reassigned from their front-line activities to carry out reviews.</p></speech>

We need an expeditious review and a report at the earliest opportunity so that we can act on the recommendations.  That is crucial for re-establishing public confidence.  It is in the interest not only of the families who have been bereaved and the wider catchment of the maternity unit in Cavan General Hospital but also of those who are first class in their roles within that hospital and who feel their abilities are being questioned by virtue of the fact these tragedies have occurred without actions or conclusions necessarily being undertaken.  It is important for all concerned that the review is completed expeditiously.  I again ask the Minister to ensure that will be the practice in the future.</p></speech>

Sometimes that can take time but the fact that they can continue for several months and, in some cases, more than a year is difficult for the patients and families concerned.  They want to find out what happened and to be assured it will not happen to somebody else.  That should be doable in weeks or months rather than taking six months or a year.  The Deputy is correct that it casts a shadow of doubt over the clinicians who looked after the patients.  That can cause stress for the clinicians even though it is found in the vast majority of cases that they did the best they could in the circumstances.  The issue also arises in respect of Portlaoise.  I will put in place measures to assist those involved to complete the case reviews much more quickly.</p></speech>

It was originally estimated that 350 women would apply to the scheme but 576 applications were accepted.  Applications are being assessed by the former High Court justice, Maureen Harding Clark.  The scheme has in the region of &euro;34 million available and participants will receive awards at three levels, namely, &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000.  The scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and it aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned.  It was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was established to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative simple and non-adversarial option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy irrespective of whether negligence is proven.</p><p>Ms Justice Clark has informed my officials that 206 offers have been made to women as of 22 May 2015, including one offer that was rejected.  Some 194 of those offers had been accepted and 11 offers are awaiting a response.  Of the 194 offers accepted by applicants, 118 were assessed at &euro;50,000, 71 at &euro;100,000 and five at &euro;150,000.A large number of  applications have been made without medical records or evidence of symphysiotomy and this information is being sought by Ms Justice Clark in order to progress the applications.  Where there was a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, applications were accepted by the scheme provided the application was received within the time period set out in the scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. </p><p>The scheme is voluntary and women do not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in it.  Women may opt out of the scheme at any stage in the process up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.  Deputy Daly may be aware of a High Court judgment delivered on 1 May 2015, where the judge dismissed the claim for damages by a 74 year old woman who had a symphysiotomy 12 days before the birth of her baby in the Coombe Hospital in 1963.  The judge ruled that even though the woman has suffered since the operation, the practice of prophylactic symphysiotomy &ldquo;was not a practice without justification&rdquo; in 1963.  The judge also stated in his judgment that &quot;Though I would in the words of Sir Ranulph Crewe, Chief Justice of England, 'take hold of a twig or twine-thread' to uphold the plaintiff&rsquo;s case, I must find that this remarkable lady whose story indeed deserves to be told must fail in her case against the defendants&quot;.</p><p>While the Government is aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, it believes that the provision of the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme, together with the ongoing provision of support services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a fair and appropriate response to this issue.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable that elderly women who were butchered in their youth, who lost connections with their children and relationships with their husbands, and who continue to live in pain are being forced to participate in this scheme.  As the Minister pointed out, the overwhelming majority of these women were offered a paltry payment of &euro;50,000.  That is one third of the amount the judge administrating the scheme will be paid in a year.  The five people who got the maximum payment because of a lifetime of agony are still getting less than what the judge is paid in one year.  That exposes the severe limitations to the scheme.  I am aware of the recent court case but the criticisms made by the UN committee about the fact that people were being exonerated and that nobody took responsibility will be taken further.  The Minister will have to revisit the matter on human rights grounds because his response is not good enough.</p></speech>

We are an independent sovereign State.  It is up to the women individually to decide whether to apply for the scheme and to accept the award.  The vast majority have accepted their awards.  They do not have to prove negligence in any case.  With the exception of symphiosotomy on the way out, those who have gone to court were not able to prove that the practice was not without justification at the time it was done.</p></speech>

Deputy Martin wants to make some important points on the Nyras report, so I will confine myself to highlighting a few points.</p><p>Any objective observer looking at the events that have transpired in this House and outside it in the past few days would be forced to conclude that there is collusion between IAG, Aer Lingus and the Government to bypass the public and the Oireachtas on this important decision.  </p><p>The Minister will be aware that his own members and the Labour Party members of the Committee on Transport and Communications insisted that the committee should consider this matter in detail before the final decision was taken.  They have renegued on that, however, and there is not a tweet about it.</p><p>I cannot understand why at this particular time the Government would decide to hive off its 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus, which is well on the way to being one of the most successful small aviation companies in the world, to a foreign multinational.  It is certainly an excellent deal from IAG's point of view.  What IAG is getting will exceed by several hundred million euro, perhaps half a billion euro or more, what it is paying.  If the Minister does not take my word for it let him look to the ultimate authority, the London stock exchange.  IAG shares rose sharply on the London stock market as soon as this deal was announced.  The market has taken the view that whatever about Aer Lingus, the Irish taxpayer and connectivity, it is an outstanding deal for the multinational.  </p><p>The Minister will also be aware that connectivity is of central importance in my region where a high percentage of people are employed by multinationals.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have told us repeatedly that this deal, in so far as we know anything about it, protects connectivity more than the deal that was entered into by the previous Government in 2006.  In other words, they are essentially saying that the State will now have more influence on what happens in Aer Lingus when it holds a single share and has nobody on the board, than it had when it held 25.1% of the shares and had two directors on the board.  That is a totally unsustainable proposition.</p><p>I can well remember the events of 2007 when the board of Aer Lingus decided to reallocate the Heathrow slots at Shannon to Belfast.  I can recall the battle that went on over that, as well as how the decision was reversed literally within a year.  As someone who was centrally involved in the fight to get those slots back, I can state that it was of enormous benefit to us that we had two State directors on that board.  Without their presence on the board it probably would not have happened.  </p><p>In substitution for two directors and a 25.1% shareholding, we are told that the golden share will protect connectivity in a more substantial way.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said the golden share gives the Minister for Finance the right to object to or challenge a disposal of the slots.  Somebody else said it was a veto, but which is it?  In any case it is a moot point.  These golden share deals have been found to be illegal under European law in a number of other jurisdictions.  In addition, even if the golden share did provide the protection that the Government claims, it expires after seven years.  As far as workers and businesses in the mid-west are concerned, there is not a great difference between five and seven years.</p><p>As I understand them, these terms which are supposed to keep the question of connectivity within the remit of the Government, will be put into the company's articles of association.  The Minister should be aware that any public company can change its articles of association by special resolution, which is a 75% vote, at any time.  This is set out in statute law on all the model articles of association.  In addition, there is a great deal of case law surrounding the legislative provisions, beginning in 1903 in the case of Punt <i>v</i>. Symons &amp;amp; Co. Limited, followed by the case of Southern Foundries (1926) <i>v</i>. Shirlaw in 1940.  Those cases are cited with approval by the superior courts in Ireland and Britain right to this day.</p><p>They have established a simple proposition that if a company wants to change its articles of association, and that change results in breaking a deal on which the present format of the articles of association depend, then there is no right to seek an injunction to prevent the articles of association from being changed.  The State can presumably sue for some level of damages, but that is cold comfort for people in my area who are worried about connectivity and whose jobs depend on it.  There is therefore no absolute guarantee and, in effect, it does not matter whether disposal includes sale or leasing.</p><p>The Minister talked about the protection of employment, but the only guarantee we have of that is the statement by the chief executive that he does not envisage compulsory redundancies or further outsourcing.  The registered employment agreements, REAs, are then dragged in to give the illusion that something wonderful is being done.  We are told that the REAs are being reintroduced and will be extended to categories of workers not already covered.  The fact of the matter, however, is that according to the Government's own Industrial Relations Bill, which has just been published, REAs only deal with terms and conditions of employment.  They will not save one job.</p><p>In addition, section 20 of the Industrial Relations Bill 2015 allows the employer, in this case it will be Aer Lingus as owned by IAG, to apply to the court at any time to get out of its commitments under an REA.  Therefore the so-called protections and guarantees are illusory rather than real.  IAG is not a charity and its primary focus is not the protection of connectivity or jobs in the mid-west or elsewhere - it is to drive shareholder value.  All the decisions will be driven by that alone.</p><p>At this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to suspend the vote on this matter.  As his own Deputies demanded, he should allow the Committee on Transport and Communications to discuss the matter at length next week so that we can at least know what we are getting into.  At the moment we are in the same position as someone who gets a phone call from their solicitor saying: &quot;We haven't got the papers on this and have not got sight of the deal, but I am signing a very important contract on your behalf at 11 o'clock this morning.  You can't see the contracts or the powers, but I'm signing it on your behalf and you'll have plenty of time to study it afterwards.&quot;  Effectively, that is the position we are in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800011#J00900"><p>I have yet to hear from the Government a compelling rationale for the sale of the State's 25.1% share in Aer Lingus.  The manner in which the Government has handled the D&aacute;il in this debate has been shameful and shocking, given the fact that there has been a lack of any transparency and honesty in the presentation of the facts, particularly as they relate to workers.  Given the revelations in the Nyras report, it is now imperative for the Government to suspend today's debate and vote, and allow Deputies to tease these issues out properly at the Committee on Transport and Communications.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the Government always prefers spin more than substance.  It is always about telling a good news story as opposed to the realities that are inevitably down the line following the sale of this 25.1% share.  That is revealed in the Nyras report.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he was not aware of that report and had no knowledge of it.  Did the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, have any knowledge of it?  Did the executives in Aer Lingus show him this report?  Did the Minister taken the decision to recommend the sale of Aer Lingus without any inkling or knowledge of this report?</p><p>Was he aware of it?  It is quite significant.  Despite what was said this morning on the radio by the chief executive officer of Aer Lingus, it is about staff and cost-cutting.  It is not just cost-cutting agreements with outsourcing companies and so on.  The report compares Aer Lingus with Vueling and EasyJet and it is all around costs.  With regard to seasonality and legacy staff, it states:<blockquote>Aer Lingus self-handles at Dublin, Cork and Shannon at an average cost of &euro;1,326 per turnaround.  However, the relatively inflexible labour agreements increase this cost to &euro;1,432 in the winter, thus adding &euro;2.3 million to the cost base.</blockquote>The Minister knows what that means.  In referring to &quot;inflexible&quot; labour agreements, we are going to change that.  The report continues, &quot;In addition, the legacy staff costs, compared to EasyJet's market rates, adds &euro;12 million of costs.&quot;  The report continues and refers to how reviewing each of these in collaboration with the commercial team &quot;could be a profit improvement opportunity.&quot;<br/><br/>There are other comparisons.  The report indicates that the ground handling costs of Aer Lingus are higher than both EasyJet and Vueling by 30% and 45%, respectively, for each turnaround.  The report indicates that Aer Lingus self-handles at its Dublin, Cork and Shannon stations, whereas EasyJet and Vueling are outsourced.  There is a clear implication in that.  The report indicates that the main challenge for Aer Lingus is to review clearly its desired product offering and define a new lean model, which can form the basis for &quot;restructuring&quot; labour agreements to provide seasonal and daily flexibility.  No wonder the letter from IAG is so meaningless and no wonder it is a classic of its kind in seeking to camouflage what will really happen.  IAG cannot give the commitments that the Government wanted and which it is trumpeting to unions.  It is in black and white in the report where this is heading.<br/><br/>The report continues by stating that a leaner structure will help to reduce self-handling costs and provide a basis for renegotiating with third-party handlers and so on.  Vueling, the company that Aer Lingus is being compared with, is known for having very aggressive employment contracts; they are the lowest in Europe, alongside Wizz Air and Ryanair.  EasyJet use Vueling's pilot contract as a template for its Lisbon operations.  Vueling deliberately pays cabin crew low salaries to encourage staff turnover.  Average turnover is 40%, with ideal tenure at six to 12 months.  The report argues that Vueling seems to be very good at dealing with extreme seasonality in this way.  The report analyses per-seat pilot costs.  Aer Lingus utilisation is 715 hours per pilot whereas EasyJet's is nearer 850 hours.  The Aer Lingus pay structure, particularly for long-service staff, is responsible for part of the cost gap, according to the report.<br/><br/>I am listing all these elements as it is very clear where we are heading.  Nevertheless, the Government is painting a totally different picture and is not telling the truth.  There should be a wider debate about this.  I expect there will be a wider debate.  In agreeing the sale of 25% of Aer Lingus, we are being asked, on the Government's recommendation, that we collude and go along with the process without question or even having the decency to tell people as it is in real terms.<br/><br/>EasyJet, for example, has fewer pilot crews per aircraft, according to the report, and it achieves a higher level of overall productivity in how it utilises pilots and so on.  It has 2,000 pilots working an average of 850 hours per annum, compared with Aer Lingus pilots working 715 hours per annum.  The implications of that are very clear with respect to pilot and staff conditions but there has been no discussion about that.  Crew costs also loom large.  The report indicates that EasyJet addresses line maintenance seasonality by outsourcing but Aer Lingus has a fixed line maintenance cost with additional inter-check work in the winter season.  It states that Aer Lingus employs 100% licensed engineers, so what does that mean?  What is the implication of that?  This morning, we were told this report was only about costs relating to outsourcing and how better deals can be achieved with different companies.  The clear implication is that Aer Lingus should outsource more operations and get rid of permanent and longer-term staff.  That is coming right through this report.  The idea is that the younger the staff, the lower the cost and so on.  That is the nature of the report.<br/><br/>There is an onus on the Government and the board of Aer Lingus in making its presentation to the Government to make available this report.  Is that what we want?  There is no point having low pay commissions etc. if we are just going along and nobody is shouting &quot;Stop&quot;.  Piketty writes in his major tome about the growing gap between worker pay and corporations and this is a big issue in society.  I have been reflecting on this and it is something we must debate.<br/><br/>The report indicates that the administrative staff support costs in Aer Lingus are too high, as the basic salary costs for managerial and support staff in Vueling is low.  It goes through its administrative head count and compares it with Aer Lingus.  We all know, thanks to the publication of the Nyras report, where all this is heading.  The report states with respect to staff count that &quot;Aer Lingus's ground-based operational and administrative head count equates to 55 full-time equivalents per aircraft, five times as high as EasyJet's 11 full-time equivalents per aircraft.&quot;  It indicates that after adjusting for the fact that ground handling and catering are outsourced by EasyJet and there is no cargo operation, Aer Lingus has 40% more staff per aircraft than EasyJet, with the cost advantage to EasyJet at &euro;13 million.  This implies that Aer Lingus is heading in the same trajectory as the Vuelings and EasyJets of this world, which has serious implications for staff working in Aer Lingus.

It is a colloquial expression.  The Government is pretending everything is rosy in the garden and everything is going to be all right but it is very clear that this is not the real story.  It is quite shocking.  The Taoiseach would not tell us about this the other day in the D&aacute;il.  He had to have an orchestrated and managed public relations exercise on Tuesday night before coming in yesterday morning to ram this through the House.  I now know why.  If this was left hanging around for a couple of days, God knows what else would come out.  People would find out the truth.</p><p>There is a long list in the report.  It states that Aer Lingus's main cost disadvantage is in cabin crew fixed overheads.  One can imagine if a company is going to buy the company, it can see the bottom line for profit.  Workers would be seen as just numbers, with terms and conditions being immaterial and inconsequential, it seems.  We have had no discussion about that.  In summing up, the report concludes:<blockquote>We believe that the airline should set aggressive but achievable targets for short-haul cost efficiency at a minimum of &euro;60 million or &euro;5 to &euro;6 per seat.  This should in turn be co-ordinated with the CORE programme initiatives.</blockquote>It also lists the various reductions in a table of minimum potential savings.  The figures are &euro;2.9 million for ground handling and &euro;5 million for overseas bases.  There is a comment, &quot;Can we drive better pilot utilisation?&quot;, with &euro;1.8 million pencilled in.  The cost base for cabin crew would be down another &euro;1.1 million.  There is a suggestion of hangar efficiency and heavy maintenance going to eastern Europe.  The report mentions a detailed review of IT accommodation staff and so on.</p><p>I do not believe the Minister has been up-front about this.  Maybe he did not know about this report, and if he did not, it is an even more serious matter.  That is why the issue should not be rammed through.  The Government rammed through legislation for Irish Water and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, and now we have the same issue with Aer Lingus.  There has been no proper assessment or analysis; there has been spin over substance.  Above all, the workers deserved to have been told the truth about the implications of this sale and where Aer Lingus is heading.</p></speech>

In that context I question the timing of this motion and the haste with which it is being moved.  I understand that market takeovers require movement but, ultimately, the permission of the House is required for the Minister to dispose of the shares.  We are a long way off that yet.</p><p>We are at least six months if not a year off that.  I do not know why, therefore, we are giving a <i>carte blanche</i>at this stage.  Nevertheless, I welcome the contribution the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made to yesterday's debate in which he acknowledged the importance of connectivity to and from the island of Ireland.  He said it was crucial for economic growth across the country, not just in Dublin.  I recall the recent announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerard Nash, of jobs in Shannon.  One of the key factors he attributed to being able attract American companies to Shannon was its connectivity to the USA and Heathrow.  Shannon Airport was established to be the driver of growth in the mid-west and it had achieved that up to the time Fianna F&aacute;il in its wisdom decided to abandon it in favour of Dublin.  Nevertheless, for a long period in its history, it was the driver of growth in the mid-west and it is again, largely because of decisions this Government has taken and which I have supported.<br/><br/>The Minister for Finance said that long-term investment decisions such as foreign direct investment into Ireland are much easier to make in an environment of certainty.  He said the level of certainty provided by this transaction as part of our broader efforts is supportive of economic growth.  I welcome his acknowledgement of the importance of connectivity and certainty in that regard.  The Minister went on to spend some time explaining how these commitments regarding connectivity were to be secured.  They were to be secured by providing certain rights to the Minister for Finance and his successors through the retention of one share in Aer Lingus, which will be designated a &quot;B&quot; share.  The Minister said the benefit of the commitments were that the rights attaching to the &quot;B&quot; share will be enshrined in the articles of Aer Lingus to allow the holder of the share to object to any proposals deemed contrary to the national interest such as the disposal of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots or a proposed cessation of the operation of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots on certain Irish routes for five years and up to seven in the event that airports do not unduly raise their prices.<br/><br/>While this is welcome, those who have been around the House a lot longer than me will recall that when Greencore was privatised in 1991 a similar golden or &quot;B&quot; share scenario was put in place to give the Government a veto over the sale of the sugar division where that was deemed not to be in the national interest.  A few years later, doubts were cast on that golden share agreement in a ruling of the European Court of Justice in 2003 to the effect that Britain and Spain broke EU law by holding golden shares allowing them to maintain a degree of control over privatised companies.  The EU's highest court ruled that controls on the privatised British Airports Authority, which owned Heathrow, and five Spanish companies breached the EU treaty by restricting the free movement of capital.  At the time, <i>The Irish Times</i>wrote, &quot;This ruling could also have interesting implications for the Government if it decides to privatise other State assets such as Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta&quot;.  As such, I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if the slots at Heathrow are capital assets.</p></speech>

Where is the sugar division?  When I was canvassing for the Labour Party recently, I saw its rusting remains on the outskirts of Carlow town.  In fairness to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I appreciate that he took time very late last night to meet with me with his officials to seek to allay my concerns.  I thank him for that courtesy.  I understand the Minister has been in extensive negotiations with the European Commission's Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union in the run up to this announcement and that it has no objection to the proposal.  In fact, it may have indicated that it is willing to accept it.  However, the deal has yet to be examined by the Directorate General for Competition, which took the cases against the UK and Spain to which I have referred.</p><p>I assume that a letter of comfort will be sought, but even if it is obtained, it is only a letter from one Commissioner for the duration of one Commission.  That is all.  Letters of comfort have been delivered in the past notwithstanding which infringement proceedings have been taken.  Furthermore, I am not so concerned about Commission proceedings given that the Commission has ultimately accepted the <i>status quo</i>which gives the Government a degree of control over slots.  My greater concern is on the enforceability of the &quot;B&quot; share mechanism and whether a Minister could in future enforce it against IAG.  If a British or Spanish court or the ECJ were to find it contrary to EU competition law or a domestic court were to find it contrary to domestic competition law, it would not be possible to enforce the &quot;B&quot; share rights.  I mention the UK's Competition and Markets Authority in particular because Heathrow is located in Britain and has the experience of having its own golden share held by the British Government struck down as being unlawful.  Furthermore, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has shown considerable teeth in its dealings with Ryanair.  It has shown more teeth than the Irish Competition Authority generally demonstrates unless, of course, it is raiding the IFA offices on foot of concerns about below-cost selling by multiples.</p><p>Turning to the deal itself, it is undoubtedly very good news for Dublin Airport.  I have studied IAG's 34 page indicative offer in detail and it has a lot of specifics for Dublin Airport, which is set unambiguously to become Ireland's gateway hub for international traffic.  Mr. Willie Walsh, the CEO of IAG, which is one of the largest aviation companies in the world, was clear about this at the joint committee.  It would be churlish at this stage to fail to acknowledge that Mr. Walsh is one of the greatest Irish businessmen of his generation.  His negotiation of this deal has been masterful, but his only duty is to his shareholders.  For him to have any other considerations would be unlawful.  Looking at the deal, one thing is clear, namely, Dublin Airport is approaching capacity and will soon need a new runway.  Passenger numbers last year stood at 21.7 million and this year numbers are expected to exceed 24 million.  IAG alone is projecting an increase in passenger numbers of 2.4 million as a result of this and other airlines are also seeking to increase their passenger numbers.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation has stated that a new runway will be allowed when passenger numbers reach 25 million.  That is next year, but where is the runway?  Is it going to be allowed?  Who is going to fund it?</p><p>When a second terminal was to be funded at Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta International was brought into the Dublin Airport Authority group by Fianna F&aacute;il to fund it.  This, of course, is the same Fianna F&aacute;il that objected to Aer Rianta International being in Dublin Airport after having brought it into the Dublin Airport Authority group.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not have a great deal of credibility on this issue when it objects to the sale of a 25% shareholding, having sold a 75% shareholding.  It is not so much warning that we should close the stable door after the horse has bolted, rather it galloped the horse out the stable door and is now looking back over its shoulder having had an unfortunate demise.  In now warning that the stable door should be closed, it is a little bit late.</p></speech>

I presume a new runway in Dublin will attract the same controversy and difficulty as the proposal for a new runway at Heathrow.  The fact that there is no new runway at Heathrow is one of the main reasons IAG is interested in Dublin in the first place.  While it may well offer opportunities for Shannon and Cork, and I certainly hope it does, that is only if IAG is interested in Dublin and Shannon.  It is not that clear.  There is very scant and aspirational information contained in the indicative offer about Shannon.  It says IAG will "aspire to enhance".  The document says that growth opportunities with tourism and business interests will be pursued and that future support will be provided for existing airlines.  It is a lot shorter on detail in respect of Shannon than in respect of Dublin.  Aer Lingus does not have a history of any commitment to Shannon except where it has been forced by the Government through the Government shareholding.</p>  <p>  It is one thing to have a golden share if one can enforce it, but we have great confidence generally in free markets.  Free markets are a very good thing and I am not advocating state control of the economy or anything like it, but when Fianna F&aacute;il privatised Eircom, we were told it would be a wonderful thing.  It was going to be able to attract the finance necessary to develop a world-class telecommunications network.  At the time of the privatisation, we had a world-class telecommunications network in this country, but now one cannot get broadband in the largest town in my constituency.</p><p>Companies and offices cannot get broadband to grow their businesses.  Throughout the rest of rural Clare, there is no broadband.  I appreciate the efforts of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, in that regard.  It is announcement after announcement and strategy after strategy but he is effectively powerless.  All he can do is telephone the companies and ask them what they would like to do.  Without a shareholding in the company, it is not possible to direct them to do anything. </p> <p> Delegates from Eircom come in here regularly with briefings for Deputies and tell us when certain exchanges will be upgraded.  The following year they come in and say they got it wrong but that they will be upgraded. That is all we can do because it is a private company.  I do not think the privatisation of Eircom has affected Dublin, Cork or perhaps Limerick, but it is affecting Ireland and its economic development.  We remain an island nation.  I do not need to point that out.  It is one thing to privatise an airline on mainland Europe when it is possible to get a train from, say, Paris to Moscow overnight, but we are uniquely dependent on our connectivity and that is a major concern for me.</p> <p> When Willie Walsh attended the transport committee he had very little concrete information on Shannon but he did say that Aer Lingus was in the business of selling seats.  He said that it was able to profitably sell seats from Shannon to north America and Heathrow and that it would therefore continue.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said something similar yesterday when he said, "Everybody in Aer Lingus knows that jobs and profitability, which are connected, are ultimately determined by the sale of seats.  That is the only constant in the airline business".  In Shannon we know that is not enough.  Notwithstanding full flights leaving Shannon for London Heathrow, the flights were pulled.  Almost like a dog who saw a bone in the water and went for it, Aer Lingus opted to operate out of Belfast.  It thought it would make a bit more money in Belfast and Shannon was left high and dry.  That had a detrimental impact.  I have no doubt, regardless of the bona fides of Willie Walsh or Mr. Kavanagh, that profit and profit alone will drive this.  That is what the markets are about, which I welcome, but connectivity is key to the future of this State.</p> <p> I welcome the commitment by Aer Lingus to enter into registered employment agreements with its workers, even if the legislation which will underpin them is not yet in place.  I look forward to supporting the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, when he brings the necessary legislation through the House.  I also have confidence in the last-minute commitment by Aer Lingus this morning that there would not be compulsory redundancies.  I understand the CEO said that on the airwaves.  I welcome that statement and I have no doubt it has been made because of the work of the Labour Party in government.  However, I hope the CEO has in turn received the same guarantees from his employers, his future employers and their future employers, and that he will be in a position to honour what he said today.  We know that there are no certainties in the shifting world of aviation consolidation.  Indeed, from the time it first mooted its interest in Aer Lingus to now, there has been a suggestion that IAG itself might be subject to a takeover bid.  </p> <p> I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for the courtesy he has shown me and the work that has been done to meet the Labour Party's concerns.  However, many questions remain outstanding.  I have questions which remain unanswered and, in that context, I am not prepared to gamble with what I believe is key to the economic development of this State, all of this State.  As we enter 2016 with talk of developing all parts of the country equally, connectivity is key, particularly connectivity to the mid-west.  I do not have confidence in the guarantees as they currently stand.  On that basis I regret that I will not be able to support the Minister in the motion this afternoon.</p></speech>

I will focus on a small number of issues.  To confine myself to the two-day debate on IAG's second offer, I have noticed a tendency for many Deputies on the opposition benches to give, for want of a better word, the impression we are talking about a State asset.  We are not talking about a State asset.  We are talking about one private company going into enterprise with another private company, IAG.  If Aer Lingus were a State company, I would have a different view on the issue.  However, Aer Lingus is no longer a State company but rather a public limited company with the State, on behalf of the taxpayer, holding a 25% share in it.</p>  <p>  There has been an attempt to create an argument based on Aer Lingus's image since its foundation in 1936 and the attachment to it.  However, all of that changed when Aer Lingus was floated on the stock exchange in October 2006 by those in the benches opposite.  That is its history.  I am not one to rush to the defence of Fianna F&aacute;il but, interestingly, the Irish people clearly have an affinity with free enterprise and capitalism because following the flotation of Aer Lingus on the stock exchange, Fianna F&aacute;il scarcely lost any support in the 2007 general election.  Some of those who sit behind Deputies Martin and O'Dea and condemn Fianna F&aacute;il for privatising Aer Lingus should have used the opportunity, if they had such a hang-up about Aer Lingus being privatised, to move a motion to bring it back under State control but there was no such motion.</p></speech>

I joined a trade union at the age of 16.  I have been a member of unions all my adult life and a shop steward for most of it.  The principal concerns for people on this side of the House are redundancies and outsourcing.  These were foremost on the minds of SIPTU and IMPACT when they spoke to probably all of us.  In thrashing out a deal to protect those who currently work in Aer Lingus and those who will work there in the future, unions do what unions are supposed to do.  They try to get the best deal for the people they represent.  That is why unions exist.  No negotiations end up with workers getting everything.  It has never happened.  Perhaps someone has an example of it happening-----</p></speech>

As Deputy Michael McNamara said, the Labour Party as a minor party in this Government has used its influence as best it possibly could in dealing with a marriage between a private company, Aer Lingus, and another private company, IAG.</p><p>I will keep my word and finish on time.</p></speech>

He hit on the crucial issue - connectivity.  I do not need to tell the Minister that, as an island nation, connectivity is essential to us for our economic development, the tourism industry, exports and imports and our overall prosperity.  This is a very small island on the periphery of Europe and the economy needs to be consistent and secure.  Connectivity is a crucial part of this and we should not jeopardise it by removing the links Aer Lingus provides.  There is consensus among the experts who have spoken about IAG's offer that Aer Lingus is crucial to that connectivity as it controls many of the sought after slots at Heathrow Airport, which are the envy of many airlines throughout the world.  The slots are crucial to Ireland's interests.  The CEO of IAG is on the record as saying the company needs extra slots to serve the very profitable and expanding Asian and South American markets from Heathrow Airport.  Any proposal by IAG to ensure extended access on Irish routes from Heathrow Airport will only delay the inevitable loss of these slots, whether in five or seven years.  In the future the slots will be used to provide services on the more profitable Asian and South American routes because ultimately that is what it is all about.  It is about profit at the end of the day.  IAG does not have the interests of Ireland as its driving force in this offer.  Its interests, rightly so, are its shareholders and profitability.</p>  <p>  There are also very real concerns for the workers about potential job losses.  We received some assurances today that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  That is to be welcomed, but an assurance and a guarantee are two different things.  The publication of the Nyras report raises a lot of concerns about potential job losses.  One only has to look at the record of IAG where it has taken over other airlines.  Many Deputies will have spoken about Iberia, in which nearly 4,500 jobs were lost after the takeover, prompting the Spanish tourism Minister to say in 2013 that the sale, two years previously, had actually proved detrimental to the Spanish economy.  I have also not seen any resolution of the issues faced by workers regarding the Aer Lingus pension scheme and the cuts in entitlements that they are facing need to be discussed.  </p>  <p>  I do not understand why this issue could not have been sent to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for at least one week in order that it could study the proposal in full and tease out the details of the Nyras report, which has now become available but which the Taoiseach has said he has not read to date.  I do not know whether the Minister had the chance to read it before he brought the proposal to the Cabinet yesterday.  If he did not, has it changed his opinion on the haste with which the D&aacute;il is trying to rush this motion through this afternoon?  Taking a week out and leaving the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to do a job of work in analysing all aspects of this offer would be a prudent move.  The outcome might very well be the same this time next week and we might still be voting on it, but we would at least be doing so in the knowledge that everything had been examined by a committee made up of members of all political parties and none in this Chamber.  Questions Deputy Michael McNamara who raised some genuine concerns and other Deputies may have could be addressed at the committee.  The Minister knows that committees do some very good work.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications should be given such an opportunity in this case.</p>  <p>  The short-term commitments from IAG will be of no use to Ireland in the future if we lose the slots held by Aer Lingus.  The commitment to maintain jobs will ring very hollow when one looks at the thousands of jobs cut from Iberia.  I do not think the guarantees are sufficient or that a two-day debate is sufficient.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the proposal puts a great focus on and stresses the potential of Dublin Airport.  Deputy Michael McNamara spoke about Shannon Airport and I want to speak briefly about Cork Airport, on which there is not much detail in the report.  There is some mention of the possible expansion of routes, but in reality there is very little detail about Cork Airport.  It is suffering enough as it is and the proposal could have a detrimental impact in the long term on regional airports, including Cork and Shannon.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the sale would do great things for Knock airport and would expand the routes out of it, but we have not received any assurance in Cork that routes will be expanded.  One of the biggest impediments to Cork Airport is that the runway is not long enough to take international flights.  Cork is the second largest city in the Twenty-six Counties and if we want to build economic hubs and attract foreign direct investment, surely Cork Airport needs to be expanded to enable it to compete on that front with Dublin and Shannon airports.</p>  <p>  I have concerns about this proposal, as many other Opposition Deputies do.  I know that the Labour Party raised many concerns when the deal was first mooted, but all of its Deputies bar one, to my knowledge, have now accepted the assurances given by IAG and the Government.  Deputy Michael McNamara has indicated that he is unable to support the proposal at this time.  The Minister may not believe it is possible to build a consensus across the Chamber because this is politics.  The Government proposes something which the Opposition opposes.  However, if he wants to build a consensus on an issue such as this which is of strategic economic importance to the long-term interests of Ireland, we need to get into the committee to discuss all aspects, including the Nyras report, and come to an informed decision.  I implore the Minister to consider suspending the vote today, referring the matter to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for three days next week and awaiting the outcome of its deliberations.</p></speech>

I would rather we were not here this morning discussing the sale of what is left of Aer Lingus after the Fianna F&aacute;il sale of the century.  That party sold off three quarters of the company.  The sale of the remaining shares in this company is bad for workers, customers and the economy.  It is not only Sinn F&eacute;in that is saying that because the late Garret FitzGerald said it many times.  I heard him speak at length about this.  Many economists on the right, left and centre have outlined their position on and concerns about this in the recent and not-so-distant past.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I know the guarantees are not worth the paper they are written on.  I will tell him why they are not.  All one has to do is look at the Irish Constitution and EU competition laws.  The solicitors and barristers will have a field day.  If any future Government, union or other body ever has the liathr&oacute;id&iacute; to stand up to the international company IAG, take it on and try to challenge it over this, it will not be able to do so.  IAG will rule the roost as it will own the company.  When one sells something, it is gone.  The conditions will not stand up to international, European or Irish law, and that is the fact of the matter.  The guarantees are simply letters of comfort.  All too often, we have seen where letters of comfort lead one; they lead one into a false comfort zone that brings one nowhere.</p>  <p>  I heard Fianna F&aacute;il having a go at the Government over this deal.  It is correct to outline the problems with it but it was sickening listening to Fianna F&aacute;il criticising the Government for selling off the remaining 25% share when Fianna F&aacute;il itself sold three quarters of the company.  Fianna F&aacute;il is criticising the Government for selling a quarter of the company although it sold off three quarters of it for a fraction of what the Minister is supposed to be getting for one quarter.  Deputies Se&aacute;n Fleming and Timmy Dooley outlined their great concerns over this deal on the airwaves over the past few days.  One could fall around the place laughing at the good of it but we want some consistency.  It will be a bad day for Ireland, workers and the economy and the customers of Aer Lingus if this sale goes ahead.</p>  <p>  I heard Labour Party Members claim they were persuaded to support the sale on the basis that jobs would be secured for existing staff.  SIPTU has said that the company has told Minister of State Deputy Gerald Nash that it will establish registered employment agreements that will ensure there will be no compulsory redundancies or outsourcing.  SIPTU is right on insisting that this be achieved before the sale is signed off on, bearing in mind that we do not want it to go ahead.</p>  <p>  Why was the guarantee for the Aer Lingus workers written into the articles of agreement?  The new industrial relations legislation, which the Government has said will embody the protections that were contained in the registered employment agreements, has been published and will be before the House later today.  As matters stand, however, it will not be in place prior to the sale.  Therefore, all the workers have been promised is the threadbare letter.</p>  <p>  In general, Labour Party support for the sale further underlines the shift that party has made.  It is now fully on board with Fine Gael, and in accord with the position of Fianna F&aacute;il when it was in power, in respect of the privatisation of State assets.  It refuses to support calls from Sinn F&eacute;in and others to support constitutional protection against the privatisation of other key State assets, such as Irish Water.  We saw that earlier.  The Labour Party will argue that other privatisations that have been recommended, such as that of Coillte, were not proceeded with.  However, they were agreed in principle.  The only reason for not going ahead with the sale of Coillte was that the Government was not offered enough money.  As the report of Coillte showed, the economics of such a sale made no sense.  It makes no sense to sell off key assets for a fraction of what they are really worth considering the cost of building them up over many years - almost 80 years in the case of Aer Lingus.  This logic applies as much to Aer Lingus as to Coillte or any other public company.  It would be absolutely outrageous for the sale to happen.</p>  <p>  For Fianna F&aacute;il to accuse the Government of being unpatriotic for proposing to sell off the remaining State share in Aer Lingus is very ironic.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the same party that, in 2006, decided to make the biggest move towards privatisation.  A total of 75% of the total company stock of shares was put up for sale.  It is generally agreed that this was a disaster.  Fianna F&aacute;il's sale of 75% was an absolute firesale and it was outrageous that it happened in the middle of a boom.  Events at Aer Lingus since 2006 have demonstrated this.  Over recent days, we have heard a lot about the fact that the company, being small, cannot survive in the global market but I have heard some experts say in recent days that because of our strategic location in the north Atlantic, we are strategically positioned for Aer Lingus business to grow as it is.  Aer Lingus had plans to go ahead with the expansion of its business.  Its balance sheet over the past couple of years, particularly last year, shows that the company is highly profitable.</p>  <p>  If I have a choice between flying with Ryanair and Aer Lingus, I prefer to fly with Aer Lingus.  It sometimes costs a bit more but I am prepared to pay a bit extra because of loyalty.  If the company were sold off, I would not have any loyalty to an international company.  I am sure there are many people like me throughout the State.  I prefer to fly with Aer Lingus when I can, not that I do a lot of flying.  On the one or two occasions per year that I get out of the place, I go with Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il also planned the wholesale privatisation of other companies before it was defeated and lost power in 2011.  When it was in power, it privatised the very successful company Irish Sugar.  In 2006, it let go the last share in Greencore and facilitated the closure of the Irish sugar sector.  This should not have happened.  It was a prelude to a property deal.  Hundreds of jobs were lost in Laois, Carlow and other counties.  As a consequence, the workers, growers and contractors were left with a pittance in compensation at that stage.  Of course, we discovered later that the EU rules showed that what occurred was not necessary.  It was not necessary to close the sugar industry, despite the claim of the then Minister, Mary Coughlan, and other Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons.  I remember attending meetings at which I learned that the bulk of the compensation paid out under Fianna F&aacute;il went to Greencore, not the workers, contractors or growers in Laois, Carlow and the surrounding counties.  There is absolute hypocrisy.</p>  <p>  Today, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are in the driving seat.  The Minister must ensure the deal does not go ahead.  It is not worth the paper it is written on.  The documents and letters that have been issued to the Minister are not worth the paper they are written on because they will simply not stand up to future scrutiny.</p>  <p>  We cannot continue with the troika of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party that is in favour of privatisation.  I am asking the Minister to hold off on this and refer the matter to the transport committee so it can tease out all the issues in full next week.  To proceed with this deal after two short debates in this Chamber over the past couple days would be outrageous.  It must stop.  The Minister must refer the matter to the transport committee so all these issues can be teased out fully and he should press the pause button on this sale.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the Labour eight.  I am among the Fine Gael ten who have equal and genuine concerns about the future of Aer Lingus.  In fact, we have aired these concerns and brought them to the attention of the Minister, as have my colleagues in the Labour Party.  We were correct to do so.  This is a major issue and concerns us all.  It concerns the workforce in Aer Lingus and the future of the company.  It concerns Irish aeronautics and the possibility of this country expanding as a major international aviation hub.  That opportunity does arise but does not arise other than through this particular route, although it was much talked about in the past.</p><p>That was one of the measures I identified by way of parliamentary question as being desirable in the context of the disposal of the Government's share in Aer Lingus.  <br/><br/>I am impressed by the genuine concerns expressed by Members in the House in the past 24 hours or so.  They have a genuine reason for expressing these views and have the best interests of the company, the workforce and the country at heart.  This applies to those affected in Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports.  An important point to come out of the debate is that we will continue to have the shamrock flying internationally across the globe.  That is positive.  We have received a clear indication that extra jobs will be created.  There are genuine concerns about the possibility of job losses, but we must take the agreements on their merits and at face value.  It is not a good idea to enter into negotiations presuming the outcome will be negative.  It is not a good idea to sign an agreement or have somebody else sign one and say we are signing it but we do not think the other party will stick to it.  That is a recipe for disaster.  <br/><br/>What really takes me to the fair is the tear-jerking concern expressed in the past two days by the quarter of the House that expresses genuine concern and sympathy for the Labour Party.  It could not care less.  There is only one thing those Members have in mind and that is how they can cause a crisis and drag it out over the next fortnight or three weeks and to disturb something in the woodwork.  That is what they are hoping for.  They have no concern for the country or the future of Aer Lingus, which is the most important aspect.  It was particularly cynical of the Leader of the Opposition to chase after the genuinely held concerns of a member of the Labour Party to try to push him over the edge because that is what it was all about.  There are genuine concerns in the minds of many here and they have every right to express them.  The issue is serious because we do not have much to play with.  We must remember that we have a 25% shareholding, the legacy of those sitting in on the Opposition benches, as Deputy Brian Stanley rightly pointed out.  The criticism being levelled in this direction falls flat when one thinks of what happened in the case of Greencore.  Not only was no attempt made to do anything about it, every attempt was made to facilitate the closure of the sugar industry to supposedly improve the lot of genuine sugar producers elsewhere in the world.  That was proved to be a load of rubbish.  <br/><br/>What really takes me to the fair is the degree to which the Members on the other side of the House divest themselves of all responsibility for selling 75% of the shareholding in Aer Lingus without anybody telling them that it was a good thing to do.  They thought they had to get rid of it quickly because it might drop in value, which would have been terrible.  It could have been politically embarrassing.  That was the only reason it was done; there was no other reason.  The people who took the decisions had no concern whatsoever for the workforce in Aer Lingus.  The only time they expressed concern about them was at election time.  That was the end of it.  <br/><br/>The deal on the table is as good as what can be achieved.  It offers great potential for the expansion of Aer Lingus and an increase in the workforce in the future and I expect it to deliver.  This is the genuine concern expressed by those near the coal face.  <br/><br/>I am concerned about the health of some Members who have spoken in the past 12 or 14 hours.  I have seen many Pauline conversions in the House, but last night I saw a Member speak as if he was a recent convert to Marxism.  In fact, Karl Marx himself would not have expressed greater concern about this proposal.  To make matters worse, I am sure it was a genuine mid-life political crisis.  It could not have been anything else because some of the Members concerned have been known hard-line right-wing promoters of a completely different ideology during my time in the House and for a considerably longer time.  I am genuinely concerned about them as they are experiencing a crisis which I know has everything to do with politics and nothing to do with expressing a genuine concern for people.  It has nothing to do either with the future of Aer Lingus, other than using it as a political football for the sake of opportunism.  <br/><br/>There is a genuine possibility for the development of this country as an international aviation hub.  It has huge prospects and there is all to play for.  If it cannot be done, it will not be for the lack of effort.  That commitment should be across the board and on all sides of the House.  The nationalism and patriotism in which we take so much pride and we will see next year behove all of us to recognise that the national interest is at stake.  I am sorry for the gang on the other side of the House, with their hand-wringing, knee-jerking, tear-jerking, tearing out of hair and beating of breasts.  I can recommend to them a good practitioner who could deal with that problem because there is grave danger that they will begin to believe what they are saying themselves.  What is most dangerous about political propaganda is when those who express it are so committed to it that they begin to believe it.  It is when they begin to believe it that a serious problem emerges.  <br/><br/>I can assure Members on the other side of the House that the agreement reached is the best that can be achieved.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister for State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, on their efforts in bringing the ship ashore.  Flights will continue to land as a result of this agreement and the airlines involved will expand their facilities and services to incude far more regions than have been envisaged so far.  We expect this to happen and have a right to expect it to happen as a result of the agreement.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on sticking with it.  We should remember that we were treated to a series of crises in the past two months about whether the Government would sell and Labour Party backbenchers would be able to stand for it.  We know that Fine Gael always believes in selling everything.  I could write the script.  Members opposite should cease making telephone calls in the middle of night to those whom they think might be wobbling on this side of the House.  We are not for wobbling.  <br/><br/>We wish all those involved in the agreement every success and expect it to deliver.  We are concerned about the sorrow expressed and the disappointment of Members on the opposite side of the House.  We know that they are disappointed, but the agreement is a manifestation of a quote from George Bernard Shaw:<blockquote>You see things; and you say &quot;Why?&quot;  But I dream things that never were; and I say &quot;Why not?</blockquote></p></speech>

Durkan said.  I cannot think of anyone who could put it better.  When this debate was initiated, I did not know whether I should speak in it.  After all, I come from County Donegal and people might wonder what the issue has to do with me.  It has something to do with every Irish man and woman because Aer Lingus has been a part of what we are for many years and generations.  We are very proud of its record and the standards it has achieved.  When one comes home, it is great to pass through the terminal and see the shamrock and the signs of the national airline.  It has set a standard in air travel that has been rarely been met.  I, therefore, acknowledge what it has done for us.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge the excellent work that has been done by the Minister.  He has been very patient and did not rush into this.  He took his time and has secured an excellent deal.  <br/><br/>We should not look a gift horse in the mouth.  First, the price per share at &euro;2.50 could not be bettered.  The deal ticks all the boxes.  It will maintain employment as well as creating an estimated 635 new jobs between now and 2020.</p></speech>

That allowed for the modernisation of the fleet and investment in the company.  Since that decision nine years ago, the airline has flourished.  Passenger numbers are up, the company is highly profitable and growing and it has a very healthy balance sheet.  Aer Lingus is in a strong financial position to weather any potential storm or any perceived risk within the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  A decision was made at the time of the sale by the then Government to keep a strategic 25.1% shareholding in the company which had legal and contractual conditions attached to protect the strategic interests of this State.  At the end of the day, Aer Lingus is an airline, Ireland is an island and the two are inextricably linked.  The company is uniquely Irish and still holds a strong bond with the Irish people.  At the time we retained two public interest directors to sit on the board to protect Ireland's interests.  </p>  <p>  However, later today this House will be voting on a motion to sell the remainder of the State's share holding in Aer Lingus for a consideration of approximately &euro;335 million.  The announcement on Tuesday night by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe and the way this debate has been handled shows that the Government is determined to get this decision rammed through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible and without any due consideration or appropriate debate.  Has the T&aacute;naiste learned anything from the Irish Water debacle?  Has it not dawned on her that if the Government allows for debate in this House unexpected events might be avoided and perhaps Members on the Government backbenches or on the Opposition benches might express opinions that would be helpful in the development of policy overall?</p>  <p>  The leaking of the Nyras report proves the point I am making.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe indicated yesterday that they had not seen it, were not aware of it, did not know its contents and were not aware of its significance.  I have read sections of that report, which is daunting.  It outlines the potential for a further &euro;60 million in cuts to the cost base of Aer Lingus by allowing for low pay and by forcing a higher turnover of staff, as is the case with Vueling.  It sets out clearly that companies can retain staff for a relatively short period of time because staff will leave if one forces their pay down.  That allows for a move away from long-term contracts of employment and all that goes with them.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste is not aware of the report but I would have thought that she would allow for a broader debate so that she could become aware of the facts and the kind of vision that IAG and Aer Lingus have for the future.</p></speech>

Both companies have highly aggressive industrial relations practices and I would have thought that would raise concerns for the T&aacute;naiste.  Since this report has been highlighted, there has been a desperate attempt to mollify, appease and console some of her party's backbenchers.  We understand there are letters flying between the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash and the CEO of Aer Lingus on an almost hourly basis.  An issue is forgotten, a letter is updated and more information is supplied to help to get somebody else through the gap and so forth.  I was on a radio programme this morning with a member of the national executive of the Labour Party, the president of SIPTU, Mr. Jack O' Connor who said that he accepted that the vote was gong to go through this evening.  However, he added that if the agreements that were outlined in a letter between the Minister of State, Deputy Nash and the CEO of Aer Lingus are not respected he will prevail upon the T&aacute;naiste and the other Labour Party members of Government to block the deal at a later stage.</p></speech>

As Deputy Dooley will be aware, this is particularly important in areas like the mid-west and we expect to see continued strong growth in tourism into Ireland.  It is vitally important that we get more aviation capacity into Ireland right now.  At the core of the proposal for Aer Lingus is to expand business, have more flights and honour commitments on existing flights and services, not just with regard to Dublin but also to Shannon and Cork airports.  All of this provides a strong basis for further growth in employment directly in Aer Lingus, as has been indicated by the chief executive.</p><p>The report to which the Deputy referred is an internal report in a company that he just acknowledged his party privatised.  It is a private company.  It would not be common that Departments or even the Cabinet would get detailed ongoing management reports in private companies.  The key issue in that report from the extracts I have seen is that 90% of the business referenced in the report is business that is already contracted by Aer Lingus abroad and not in this country.  So it has no impact on or inference for employment in Aer Lingus in Ireland.</p> <p> As the company has committed, it plans to have significant additional employment next year.  Nyras is a consultancy company, as I understand it, engaged by Aer Lingus to carry out a confidential analysis of the airline's cost structure.  I listened to Mr. Kavanagh, I think on RTE, this morning.  He pointed out that the items that were being examined in the report to which the Deputy referred relate to business of the company that is already provided by providers outside Ireland.</p> <p> I reiterate that there are no implications in this report other than that the company, Aer Lingus, as the Deputy said himself, must like all companies in the aviation business strive constantly for efficiency.  One particular individual who has been forgotten in all this is the consumer and customer of airline services based in Ireland.</p></speech>

We are now clear that the Government is putting all its stock on the sale on the basis of growth projections for Aer Lingus.  Those growth projections were already there.  Aer Lingus's corporate strategy proposed the addition of one wide-bodied aircraft per year for the next five years.  So it was going to generate those jobs anyway.  Mr. Willie Walsh made it very clear when he came before the committee that there was nothing additional other than being able to utilise the services that were there and it might be able to assist in generating some passengers as they would travel through.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said she had seen some aspects of the Nyras report.  I bring to her attention one aspect of which it appears she was not aware.  It sets out that Aer Lingus's crew costs are much higher than Vueling's.  Vueling deliberately pays cabin crew low salaries to encourage staff turnover.  It states the average turnover is 40% and the ideal tenure is six to 12 months.  Vueling is very good at dealing with its extreme seasonality in this way.  It continues to do the comparison with Aer Lingus and states that pay structures, particularly for long-service staff, are responsible for part of the pay gap.  The report continues to state there needs to be an aggressive approach by the management to reduce the cost base of the company by &euro;60 million.</p>  <p>  The report identifies ways in which to achieve the cost savings and it is on the backs of workers.  It is not those elements of the business that are subcontracted outside the State.  It states that Aer Lingus ground handling costs are higher than those of both easyJet, by 30%, and of Vueling, by 45%, for each turnaround.  If the T&aacute;naiste was not aware of this she should have been.  It also states that Aer Lingus self-handles at Dublin, Cork and Shannon stations, whereas easyJet and Vueling are outsourced.</p></speech>

She must have been drinking the Kool-Aid that was presented on "Morning Ireland" by the chief executive of Aer Lingus where he commented on procurement: "Ah, don't worry about it.  It's all stuff outside the State."  Ground handling is not a procured service at the three bases in Ireland.  I doubt if the people who service aircraft and do the turnaround at Dublin, Shannon and Cork will thank the T&aacute;naiste for believing that is the case.  Deputy McNamara certainly believes that it is not.</p></speech>

Later today the Government intends to railroad through the House the sale of a strategic State asset, the State's 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  It wants us to agree to the sale of our interest in what is a profitable company which has cash reserves and other assets, the value of which exceed the proposed sale price.  The T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged the current plans of Aer Lingus to expand business and increase the numbers of flights and jobs.  She has also acknowledged not only the viability but also the rude good health of Aer Lingus, in which the State has a 25% strategic stake, yet the Government wants to go in with a wrecking ball and subvert the influence the State and the people have in what is a strategic piece of infrastructure.</p>  <p>  That Fine Gael advances his approach is no surprise.  After all, it desperately wants to have an election slush fund to buy votes with more tax cuts for the wealthy, but for the Labour Party to sign up to this fire sale is truly incredible.  When Fianna F&aacute;il sold off 75% of Aer Lingus, the Labour Party vigorously opposed the move.</p></speech>

How will the Government ever convince people that we are in a stronger position without a share in Aer Lingus as opposed to having a strategic 25% share?  The T&aacute;naiste has claimed that the B share represents a veto - she used the word "veto" very deliberately - for the Minister for Finance.  This is the first time the B share which, according to many, is legally dubious has been described as a veto.  Will the T&aacute;naiste set out her rationale for making that assertion?</p></speech>

In regard to Aer Lingus, what is important to people in terms of airline services in and out of the country, provided proudly by Aer Lingus as a carrier during the decades, not only is being maintained and secured in this agreement but also advanced.  I confidently expect, given, for example, the improvement in sterling and the dollar <i>vis-a-vis</i>the euro, that we will be ready for a further influx of tourists, which means that we will need more capacity for growth in Aer Lingus.  Also, the Aer Lingus name and logo which many Irish people, including me, hold dear and the fact that Aer Lingus has its headquarters in Ireland-----</p></speech>

We will bring legislation before the House in regard to the protection of workers' rights, conditions and terms of employment.  An undertaking has been given in negotiation that there will be no compulsory redundancies and that registered employment agreements, which operate on a significant scale in Aer Lingus, will be extended to groups of workers currently not covered by these agreements.  The company has undertaken to do this and to register these agreements in accordance with the law.

Fianna F&aacute;il changed pensions legislation in 2009 and this significantly disimproved the position for pensioners and deferred members in various companies, including Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  In the context of the negotiation which was undertaken in regard to saving the pension fund and to rescuing the pensions of the current workers, the retired and deferred workers of Aer Lingus, whom Sinn F&eacute;in seems indifferent to, a &euro;60 million package has been agreed specifically for deferred members.</p></speech>

The main item on the agenda was the national strategy report for carers and the slow progress being made on the report which was first planned and published in 2012.  There are some 42 actions recommended in the strategy, but many of them remain untouched.  Several Departments are involved in the implementation of the strategy, including the Departments of Social Protection, Health, Justice and Equality, the Environment, etc.  Departments across the board are involved.</p>  <p>  The report is now entering its third year.</p><p>The recent assessment highlighted the slow rate of progress of this plan.  It also indicated that it has produced mixed results to date, with some Departments making good progress, others making none and some taking regressive actions.</p> <p> Some of the issues highlighted included the transition arrangements for carers who are exiting their caring role.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has yet to engage with the strategy in terms of how it treats people leaving the role of carer and supports them in returning to the workforce.</p> <p> The limit on the number of hours recipients of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant are permitted to engage in training is currently set at 15 hours per week.  That must be extended to at least 20 hours.</p></speech>

The solution offered, namely, asking family carers to apply for an exceptional needs payment at a distressing time in their lives where there is a personal loss and they are vulnerable, shows a lack of understanding of their emotions.  That lack of understanding is at odds with the goals of the strategy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800022#U00500"><p>I stress the importance of providing affordable options for families to provide care to their loved ones and allow them live in their own homes.  A typical example is the housing grant scheme, which is administered by county councils.  The mobility aid grant is an essential piece of the jigsaw in allowing people to live in their own homes but funding for that grant has been halved from &euro;79 million in 2011 to just &euro;38 million in 2014.  Further changes to the scheme announced in January 2014 will mean that even fewer people are now eligible.</p>  <p>  The 19% cut to the respite care grant imposed in the budget of 2014 was regressive.  That payment is given to allow family carers take a much needed break from their round the clock caring but in reality it is also used for respite from financial worries and a number of other hidden costs such as medical, electricity and ancillary costs.  The failure to reverse the 19% cut in the budget for 2015 was most disappointing.</p></speech>

All of us at one stage or another have been carers.  It is vitally important work, particularly in some cases where people have lifelong disabilities.  I refer to children in particular but also in other cases when people we know and love are coming to the end of their lives or getting through a serious illness.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that I had a lengthy discussion with both the Carers Association and Age Action Ireland yesterday morning in my office.  A number of the issues the Deputy touched upon were discussed by myself and the senior officials dealing with these matters in the Department of Social Protection and with representatives and leadership of the Carers Association and of Age Action Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned a number of issues, one of which is something we are very aware of, namely, what happens to somebody who has been a carer but the person they were caring for either no longer requires care or, in many cases, may have passed on.  As the Minister I am anxious to begin to put in place a framework that would assist carers in that position.  Already, as the Deputy knows, many organisations, not just the Carers Association but also an organisation that is prominent in his county of Kerry, the Alzheimer's Association, provide a good deal of training and information to people who are caring to help them care for themselves.  It is important that carers care for themselves.</p>  <p>  I said yesterday that I propose to examine the establishment of an after carers package that would allow people who have come out of caring hold on to the carer's allowance for six weeks following which they would be able, as they wish, to begin to access the different schemes and opportunities in education and training available from my Department.  I invited the Carers Association representatives to come back to me with specific proposals they might have in that area.  For instance, we might consider a number of pilot schemes, which is something in which I have long been interested.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the issue of the hours spent caring in a week, which was raised yesterday also.  I undertook to have my officials examine that because I would be anxious about a situation where somebody is spending a lot of time caring, including in the evening and at night.  The Deputy's suggestion is that people would be encouraged to take up more part-time work, but I would like to examine that.  It may make sense in particular cases but I would be concerned about somebody taking up a lot of work and then coming home to care for someone who requires a very high level of care because it is a condition of the carer's allowance that people have to undertake care over and above the norm.  I would be concerned that people would not over burden themselves because the carer's allowance is meant to provide people with some income support.  However, I undertook to examine it and both organisations said they would come back to us.  I will await that response.</p>  <p>  Regarding this year's budget, I am happy to say that the carers would have benefited from the improvement in the Christmas bonus and the people they are caring for, who in many cases are family members, would also have benefited from the Christmas bonus.  People being cared for who are disabled and live alone would also have benefited from the first increase in the living alone allowance in a very long time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800022#U00900"><p>The number of carers estimated by the Carers Association is 187,000, which I believe is a conservative figure.  At least another 100,000 are indirectly engaged in caring in some capacity or another.  That brings the figure up to almost 300,000 people engaged in caring.  That is a huge resource that we cannot underestimate, and the cost-benefit savings to the State from that resource are enormous; it is worth millions of euro.</p>  <p>  Allied to that is the people in the voluntary sector engaged in running day care centres who play an active role in that regard.  That is essential for the provision of care to infirm and disabled people who can live in their own homes, among their families and communities, which is when they are happiest.  It prevents them having to seek long-term care in residential homes, for instance.  We need to prioritise many of these issues, which have been forgotten.  There should be proper funding from the HSE and other Departments for day care centres.</p><p> There are not enough home help hours in the quota of hours allowed by the southern region.  In my county, Kerry, thousands of letters have been sent to homes stating that home help hours are being drastically reduced in some cases, and it is wrong.  I recently received a letter from the Taoiseach and the HSE stating that the same amount is available as in 2014.  In response, I raised the matter earlier.  It is not adequate or sufficient, given that extra people are coming on the list for home help.  Although it is a wonderful service provided by great people, there is no point in providing half an hour in the morning and three quarters of an hour in the evening.  The Government is providing smaller cuts of the cake.  It needs to enlarge the cake, given that more people are coming on board.  The answer I received, that the same funding is available as last year, is not good enough.  It is not satisfactory.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to go to the Cabinet, the Minister for Health and the HSE and seriously examine and address the matter.</p></speech>

Although they are for the most part full-time carers, some time ago we introduced the half-rate carer's allowance so that people who are already in receipt of another social welfare payment can get an additional payment in recognition of the major job that carers do in providing care for people.</p>  <p>  The provision of day care services is very important, particularly for families with children who are in need of care.  For older people, we have community centres around the country, many of which are significantly assisted by the social programmes of the Department of Social Protection and schemes such as community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s.  I have had the privilege of going around the country and visiting centres.  It is good that whether one is in Kerry or Leitrim, one can get transport and go to many of the very good local centres a couple of times a week, perhaps have lunch, meet one's friends, play cards and have a bit of entertainment, play bingo.  All of it is incredibly important to people's quality of life, particularly older people.  As the economy recovers and as we have less budgetary pressure, I would like to prioritise carers.</p>  <p>  This morning, I met members of the Carers Association at length and I will meet them again shortly, along with all the other care organisations, and we will examine innovations.  We are using the community support programme and budget of the Department to help many people who need support and to give the carers a break when people use the services.  Shortly, we will pay the respite care grant to carers around the country.</p></speech>

We should not be holding a vote on the issue today because it has become abundantly clear that the debate in the past 24 hours is not supported by information, documents or the letters of comfort and assurance the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tells us he possesses.  Where else have we heard about letters of comfort and assurance?  The motion is being rushed through to prevent the communities, workers and families of Aer Lingus staff from putting pressure on Labour Party Deputies, in particular.  Those Deputies are breaking a promise they made nine years ago when their then leader, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, jumped up and down to object to the sale of 75% of Aer Lingus.  They are now saying Fianna F&aacute;il put two bullets into the horse and even though the Labour Party is going to shoot the final bullet, they will not be the murderers.  I am sorry to tell them that they will.  They are putting the final nail into the coffin of public control over Aer Lingus.  Will they, please, not confuse the issue?  They could have sought to increase Government ownership of Aer Lingus by buying shares in the company, as recommended by the economist Paul Sweeney.  It is a very important company for the country and one of the top 20 indigenous companies.  This is treachery on the part of the Labour Party and we should not vote on the issue until the communities of Dublin West, Dublin North, Cork and Shannon have had a chance to ask their Deputies about it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800027#Z00200"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 in order to make an addition to the First Schedule, to expand the areas under which an examination under section 9 may be conducted, and to provide for related matters.</blockquote>The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill 2015 proposes to extend the functions and powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to cover IBRC.  It was the Taoiseach who first suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor General review the Siteserv sale process at which time it was pointed out to him that the IBRC does not come within the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit.  With this Bill, I am attempting to address that problem by broadening the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The reason I anticipate the need to involve the Comptroller and Auditor General, if not a full commission of inquiry which latter might well be a better option, is that the Government has got this matter badly wrong.  That is not least because most of the key players in the Siteserv saga have links with KPMG and the eventual purchaser and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a web of connections and conflicts that requires outside eyes to unravel.</p><p>I have no doubt that the special liquidator is more than capable of carrying out such a review, but his direct involvement in the sale process, his relationship with the eventual purchaser of Siteserv and his current actions in the High Court in supporting Mr. Denis O'Brien against RTE place him in a position where there is, at the very least, a perceived if not an actual conflict of interest.  The review is not confined to Siteserv, but that is the transaction that prompted a review in the first instance.  I worry about the transactions that have been excluded from the review given what that we now know that in the final months before prom night, the relationship between the Department and IBRC had completely broken down.  If deals were being done without the knowledge or input of the Minister, we must know what those were.  We are now aware, for example, that the former CEO of IBRC made verbal agreements with Denis O'Brien to allow him to extend the terms of his already expired loans.  We also know that the verbal agreement was never escalated to the credit committee for approval.  I am led to believe and would welcome clarification by the Minister that the rates applicable to the extension were extremely favourable.  I understand that Mr. O'Brien was enjoying a rate of approximately 1.25% when IBRC could, and arguably should, have been charging 7.5%.  Given that we are talking about outstanding sums of upwards of &euro;500 million, the interest rate applied is not an insignificant issue for the public interest.  We also know that Denis O'Brien felt confident enough in his dealings with IBRC that he could write to Kieran Wallace, the special liquidator, to demand that the same favourable terms extended to him by way of a verbal agreement be continued.  We now have Kieran Wallace, who has been appointed by the Government to conduct the IBRC review, joining with IBRC and Denis O'Brien in the High Court to seek to injunct the information I have outlined from coming into the public domain.  Surely, that alone represents a conflict.</p><p>In documents released to me under freedom of information, the Minister, his officials, the Central Bank and even the troika acknowledge that IBRC - the former Anglo Irish Bank - is no ordinary bank and that there is a significant public interest as the bank was fully nationalised and was in wind-down mode.  They all accept that this is the people's money we are dealing with and that there can be no dispute regarding the public interest in this.  The same materials obtained under freedom of information detail instances where the Minister can specifically intervene and issue a ministerial order that material matters have a significant public interest.  Included in these material matters are instances that are outside the ordinary course of business.  I argue that what I have outlined here regarding verbal deals and extensions etc. are outside the normal course of business and ask the Minister to exercise his right to intervene in the current proceedings to defend the public interest.</p><p>I have a motion on the Order Paper signed by the majority of Opposition Members calling for a debate on the proposed review.  I note that 45 Members have signed and more are welcome to.  When I tried to raise the matter on the Order of Business, I was silenced and told to take it up with my Whip.  I am the Whip of the Technical Group and I had raised the matter at the weekly Whips' meeting.  The Government Chief Whip told me that the Government would not be altering the KPMG review and that it would not provide time to debate this issue.  He suggested that we use Private Members' time.  This is not just an Opposition issue; it is an issue for the whole House.  It is an issue of serious public concern involving public money.  If the Minister opposite, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, got his hands on an extra &euro;20 million, he would not have to think too hard about how to spend it.  I urge the Government to reconsider this matter and to give the Bill and the motion the time they deserve.  It is in the public interest to do so.</p></speech>

When this motion came before the House, I considered whether I should speak to it or not, but I decided I should because even in Donegal we have close associations with Aer Lingus.  We have Stobart Air, which operates the regional franchise for Aer Lingus as far as Donegal is concerned.  I do not know what the situation is in Kerry, but perhaps it is the same there although I am not sure.  I acknowledge the decision of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport towards the end of last year to extend the public service obligation, PSO, scheme to Donegal Airport for another three years.  It will be a great help to the people of Donegal from a business, industry and commerce point of view.  It is an excellent service.  It was operated by Flybe but it was taken over by Stobart Air in February.  As a regular user, I must compliment it on the service.  It provides a good service twice a day from Donegal to Dublin.  It saves a person four hours by road and the trip can be managed in about 40 or 45 minutes.  It is providing an excellent service and it is so important from the point of view of the economy of Donegal.  I admit I am being parochial and regional, but this ought to be acknowledged for the people of Donegal.  I see the effect regularly.  Every morning people come up to Dublin on the eight o'clock flight.  They may have business in Dublin or are going to hospital.  They get the flight back at seven o'clock in the evening at a reasonable price.  I acknowledge the Minister's decision to approve that scheme for another three years.  </p>  <p>  There is one little thing I wish to bring to the Minister's attention, and I suppose the best of services do have glitches.  This happened on 21 May and I have had a number of e-mails about it.  Perhaps the Minister was informed, I think he was.  A passenger on the particular flight went to Donegal.  It was not possible to land that evening.  An attempt was made but they had to come back to Dublin and they arrived about nine or ten o'clock.  They were quite a number of passengers, some of whom had been discharged from hospital that evening.  They arrived in Dublin about nine or ten o'clock and they were told they had two options.  They could take a bus or a coach or some such transport by road that would be arranged that evening to bring them back to Donegal.  Some of them availed of it and arrived in Donegal about 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. the following morning.  Those who were in hospital or had been discharged that day found it difficult.  After being discharged from hospital and an operation or some other procedure, it may not be the best thing to tell people to go on a bus to travel for three or four or five hours to west Donegal.  I would have thought, as my constituent said, that perhaps, in a case such as that, arrangements should be made to give them overnight accommodation in Dublin adjacent to the airport so that they could avail of the following day's flight, but that was not available.  Not alone was it not available, but there was no one there from Stobart Air at that particular time to arrange anything for them, except the staff of Aer Lingus.  Perhaps this point could be considered in such cases.  </p>  <p>  As I say, this deal is an excellent arrangement and it is significant that all the other airports such as Shannon and Cork airports have welcomed this particular agreement with IAG.  It will allow Aer Lingus to do what it has been doing for many years and it will provide extra connectivity.  A person can leave Donegal, put his or her case on board, and retrieve it in Los Angeles, California, San Francisco or elsewhere without handling it.  When the association with IAG is formalised, as I hope it will be, a person will be able to go to probably any part of the world without having to handle baggage and going through different securities and so on.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work the Minister has put into this deal.  He has been very patient.  It is to the good of Aer Lingus and its continuation and to the good of the country.  I remember the first time I ever flew with Aer Lingus.  It was late in my life.  I remember coming to Dublin Airport.  I was just going to London, but an ordinary flight to London at that time cost me &pound;154.  That was in 1982, 1983 or 1984.  In present day money, that would probably be near &euro;1,000.  Things have changed a lot since then.  Efficiencies have been introduced in Aer Lingus and Ryanair is on the scene as well.  We should acknowledge what it has done to bring in competition.  At that time it was the preserve of the very wealthy to travel to London by aeroplane but it is available to everyone now.  It is a good thing and I compliment the Minister on it and thank him for the PSO scheme in Donegal airport.  I hope this deal goes through; it is only good for Aer Lingus and this country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800028#AA01600"><p>That is perfect.  I may not take the full 15 minutes.  The first point I wish to make is on the incredible method the Government has chosen to debate this extremely important issue.  The so-called democratic revolution is now so covered with dust that no one could possibly see it.  This is a most cynical attempt to rush through the full and complete privatisation of Aer Lingus.  We had a Government decision on Tuesday night, following stonewalling during Leaders' Questions earlier that day, and the whole thing is to be done and dusted by mid-afternoon today.</p><p>It is patently a transparent and cynical attempt to get the sale through before the pressure mounts, on the Labour Party Deputies, in particular.  One also has to raise the question of its timing and relationship to the successful and marvellous referendum result at the weekend.  The Labour Party thinks it has got a boost from it and now has some political capital that it feels able to quickly rush this deal through on the back of it.  Seven of the so-called &quot;Aer Lingus Eight&quot; in the Labour Party dissolved when faced with what was just a repetition of the same empty guarantees, the same empty promises and non-existent vetos.  This is just an attempt to prevent the pressure from building up on them to vote in line with their promises and what is meant to be their political position, rather than with Fine Gael and the neoliberal position driving to full privatisation.  <br/><br/>The guarantees, promises and commitments mean nothing - they are worthless.  The Aer Lingus workers and pensioners will not need to be convinced of this, having had multiple examples of the same thing in their own history such as the related case of the Team Aer Lingus workers, whose company was privatised in 1997 and handed over to SR Technics, a profitable business, only to be closed with 1,300 jobs lost in 2013 and moved to Zurich where more profits could be made.  There has also been a sell-out of Aer Lingus pensioners, a collection of workers who are used to being sold out.  In this case, the Government is not even selling them out for 30 pieces of silver - it is effectively getting nothing.  It is entering into a sale at a knock-down price.  A company with cash reserves and Heathrow Airiport slots, with a combined value of approximately &euro;1.5 billion, is being sold off for &euro;1.4 billion.  The taxpayer will receive slightly more than &euro;300 million of this, which is a drop in the ocean in terms of the Government's finances and all that is being given up, while the executives between them will receive an estimated &euro;30 million.  No wonder they are in favour of and advocating the sale.<br/><br/>The embarrassing reality for the Government is exposed by the Nyras report which indicates that the logic of privatisation is a race to the bottom in competition with other companies.  It includes a mention of the need for &euro;60 million worth of cuts in order to be competitive.  It recommends cutting jobs among pilots and cabin crew by 10% and among catering staff by 25%, brutal cuts, but that is what will follow when IAG assumes ownership.  The fact that Aer Lingus is compared to Easyjet and Vueling is an indication of precisely how the logic of the race to the bottom works - it only pushes downwards.<br/><br/>Now that we have the report, if the Government had any shame, it would delay the vote until everybody had sight of it and its implications could be digested.  It will not do this because it does not have any shame.  We should not be surprised by what is contained in the report.  IAG is made up of shareholders such as Blackrock, the world's largest asset management company, and hedge funds such as Lansdowne Partners which are only interested in profit.  They are not interested in connectivity, jobs or the conditions of those at work.  They are only interested in shareholder value, which means short-term profitability and whatever they need to do to get it.  This is not an abstract debate about what might happen if IAG were to take over a major national airline.  We only have to look at the example of Iberia where the same thing happened and 4,500 jobs were lost - the equivalent of between 1,000 and 1,200 jobs in Aer Lingus.<br/><br/>The Government, including the T&aacute;naiste during Leaders' Questions, has made a lot of the B share.  It has used the word &quot;veto&quot; repeatedly and stated the share will give the State the right to veto the sale of the slots at any future stage.  That is on extremely shaky territory and I do not think the B share will be worth the paper on which it is written.  There is extensive European Court of Justice case law dealing with the question of golden shares, including the sale of airlines such as British Airways.  In general, the European Court of Justice has ruled against golden shares, stating they threaten the free movement of capital.  If it came before the court, it is likely that the same ruling would be made.  Government Deputies do not have to believe me about this; they can believe the Deputy Pat Rabbitte of old.  To be precise, when dealing with the privatisation of 75% of Aer Lingus under Fianna F&aacute;il in April 2006, he said:<blockquote>The second deception relates to the pretence that the Minister for Transport is retaining a golden share.  The Minister and the Taoiseach know the European Court of Justice rejected as illegal the ownership of a minority golden share which would protect strategic interests.  In the case of the UK Government&rsquo;s golden share in the airport operator, BAA, it was ruled illegal under EU law in May 2003.  The golden share had special voting rights attached to it and sought to give Ministers the final say in major decisions such as selling the airport.  The European Court of Justice ruled on this matter that it is illegal to use the golden share for protection of strategic interests.  The Taoiseach is so confident about the decision made, but it is a surprise to most people that the Progressive Democrats has pushed Fianna F&aacute;il so far to the right that it would be unthinkable even a decade ago that Fianna F&aacute;il would have sold off the national airline in a country that has the strategic requirements of an island nation.</blockquote>That is damning.  It is damning of the argument of the Government about the B share and means that the Labour Party knows full well that it is entirely worthless and there is not the veto about which they speak.  It also knows that even if the European Court of Justice were to state formally that we could use the argument to say Aer Lingus has to hold onto it for the protection of a strategic interest, there is nothing a future Government could do to prevent the slots from being leased to a subsidiary of IAG.  It is also damning in terms of the Labour Party.  It would have been unthinkable, even a decade ago when Deputy Pat Rabbitte was speaking, that the Labour Party would have completed the sell-off of the national airline in a country that had the strategic requirements of an island nation.  Unfortunately, it would not have been so unthinkable because the road the Labour Party had travelled to the right towards the embrace of neoliberalism was quite clear at that stage.  <br/><br/>The essential excuse of the Labour Party is that 75% is gone and 25% is somewhat worthless and we may as well go the whole way.  It is the same logic used by somebody who beats someone to within a few inches of his or her life and then justifies killing him or her because he or she was nearly dead.  It does not hold any water to say that, because Fianna F&aacute;il got rid of 75% of the airline, we have no choice but to get rid of the rest of it.<br/><br/>The Labour Party seems determined not just to dig its own grave but aslo to climb into it by going along with this right-wing agenda of privatisation while dressing it up, as the T&aacute;naiste did, as being somehow to do with the interests of consumers.  It is the same right-wing Thatcherite logic that says only private business can provide for consumers, whereas state ownership is always inefficient.  Those trade unions which still fund the Labour Party with their members' money in order to put the boot into their own members' interests should draw the conclusions of this.  They should read the writing on the wall and follow through on the the words of Mr. Jack O'Connor of SIPTU by withdrawing funding from and support for a Labour Party which is determined to act against the interests of working people and the tradition on which it was built.<br/><br/>What is the alternative?  The argument put forward is that there are two options.  We can retain 25%, which is worth something but is not a decisive stake in the company as Aer Lingus is now run as a private company on a for-profit basis, or we can get rid of the 25% and have the company  consolidated into IAG.  There is, however, a third option which was well expressed by Mr. Paul Sweeney of TASC, the financial adviser of the trade union group within Aer Lingus.  If, in 2006, the Labour Party was opposed to the sell-off of 75% and the loss of a majority stake, it should reverse the process and strive to at least have an ownership figure of 50.1% by buying up the Ryanair shares, ultimately leading us back to full public ownership of Aer Lingus.</p><p>That is the real choice.  The first choice involves Aer Lingus becoming a minor subsidiary of a huge multinational corporation driven by short-term shareholder value, that is, short-term profits, and the State losing out in terms of jobs, connectivity and the strategic interests of the Irish economy as a whole.  The other choice is public ownership.  With public ownership, one can bring the workers to the fore in decision-making in the company, in addition to the interests of the passengers on Aer Lingus flights.  Most important, one could bring the strategic, long-term interests of the economy and society as a whole to the fore.  Otherwise, it is just a game of short-term profit-making.  The shareholders of IAG have no interest in or concern for the long-term strategic interests of Ireland in terms of investment and everything else.  The only way to guarantee these is to return to full public and democratic ownership of Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

The Government has handled this issue very badly.  I am totally against the sale of this State asset.  The Government had an opportunity today to act by accepting Deputy Dooley's proposal to defer the vote on this matter.  The deal is being rushed.  It is too serious to begin talking about it on Tuesday and rush a vote on it this evening before the House rises.  It is a mistake.  It is a serious matter that could have very long-term implications for Ireland, the workers and the future of travel to and from the country.  To ask Deputies to discuss and vote on the issue within a couple of days without being in possession of all the facts on what exactly is on the table is wrong.  As with other Deputies, I believe this has more to do with the Labour Party and the way the Government is holding together than anything else.  The Minister is not doing the country a good service by rushing the vote on the sale of this very valuable State asset.</p>  <p>  Let me return to a point already made by Deputy Paul Murphy on what exactly is being got for the sale.  In the future, people will look back and ask what was wrong with the current Government to make it sell its share in the airline for the sum of money in question.  I believe this question will be asked in the future, if not now.</p>  <p>  With regard to the way in which the deal will affect the workers in the future, reports suggest that maintenance will be outsourced outside this country.  How much money will we lose if such actions are to take place?  We are trying at all times to keep work in this country for the people who are born and bred here.  We want to keep our own people working ahead of anybody else and do not see anything wrong with saying that.  The sale of this asset will not help in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am worried about the implications for jobs, business and tourism.  Aer Lingus served us well over the years.  It is our flagship carrier and we are all so proud of it.  In 1979, for instance, the Pope was brought to Ireland on an Aer Lingus flight.  The Irish soccer team was brought home by Aer Lingus.  We were all proud on those occasions.  To lose the State's stake in our national  airline is wrong.</p>  <p>  Everybody will have suggestions about what should be done with the small amount of money to be derived from the sale.  If the Government is to get its way and rush through this sale, the money should be used to build, as a matter of urgency, our new children's hospital in the interest of looking after sick young children.  If the Government wants to put money to good purpose, that would be a good one to put some of it towards.  People would certainly appreciate that.</p>  <p>  Let me refer to our small regional airports, such as Kerry Airport, and to connectivity and the importance of having regional airports.  They provide a great service and have affordable flights.  I, too, acknowledge the work of Michael O'Leary and Ryanair over many years in reducing the cost of air travel.  Mr. O'Leary, his colleagues and those who work for them deserve great credit for building up a great business over the years.  That people can fly affordably is in no small way due to Michael O'Leary and Ryanair.  This must be acknowledged in the House.  We often hear Deputies criticising people who do well for themselves in business but I hold the opposite view.  I like to acknowledge the contribution businesspeople make to society, the wealth and work they create, and the service they give.  It is not right for politicians to knock continuously some of the bigger players in this country.  I do not agree with their doing so.  If we had more such bigger players, the country might not be in the state it is in.</p>  <p>  Again, I thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of its time.</p></speech>

I listened earlier to Deputy Dooley's contribution.  It is interesting to note that not a single member of either of the two main Opposition parties in the House is present for this debate.  Deputy Dooley made an observation on the strength of the Aer Lingus balance sheet and the company's current economic status.  He said the company was in a position to weather any potential storm.  This was an unusual statement because the industry, by its nature, is subject to economic cycles.  It may well be on an upward trajectory at present but we do not need to cast our minds back too far to recall the consequences for the aviation industry globally of the economic crash in 2008 or the crash of 11 September 2001.  Just because we are currently in growth mode and fuel prices are relatively low does not mean the trend is likely to last forever.</p><p>We need to be conscious of the fact that the global trend in the aviation industry is for mergers or closer co-operation between various stand-alone brands.  In a way, that is what the IAG offer is about.  It allows for the ability of Aer Lingus to continue with its own management, operations and clearly well-established management team.  I have had the privilege of meeting some members of that team in recent days and I was quite impressed by them.</p><p>To quote S. H. Payer, &quot;the moment of absolute certainty never arrives&quot; with regard to making a decision of this nature.  However, on the balance of probability, this is probably the right decision and the right time to make it.  Strange bedfellows are thrown up by this debate.  For example, Independent Newspapers is facilitating Deputy Clare Daly with an op-ed in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The question that really needs to be asked of Deputy Daly and others who oppose this deal is whether they can be certain that over the next seven years, the connectivity secured under the present arrangement can be guaranteed by Aer Lingus on a stand-alone basis.  Can they be certain that the disposal of the slots, in respect of which the agreement has legally binding guarantees, could never be contemplated by Aer Lingus as it stands?</p><p>Given the fact that the shareholder register of Aer Lingus will inevitably change because of the court decision in the UK that Ryanair must divest itself of at least 25% of its 30% shareholding, can Deputy Daly and others be sure that in the event of that shareholding being made available to the market, it would not be acquired by somebody who would not be as favourably disposed towards the issues that were clearly raised in the context of the original IAG offer in so far as we have secured arrangements around that?  </p> <p> People say this is rushed.  When this came out of the blue last December, critical issues such as connectivity, regional development, job security and the slots were raised.  Almost six months later, substantial progress has been made in respect of those issues.  If the Government was trying to sell the minority shareholding in Aer Lingus against the wishes of its management and board; the chambers of commerce in Limerick, Shannon, Cork and Dublin; and very significant economic commentators, we would rightly stand back and ask whether we were doing the right thing.  However, when all these people are on board, we must question whether the opposition to this deal is naked political opportunism, primarily from a party that originally sold the 75% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  </p> <p> I think that on balance, it is the right thing to sell the shareholding and it is the right time to do it.  Insofar as we can be sure of anything, we have secured guarantees about connectivity, the slots and job security.  The motives of those who oppose this deal for what appears to be nothing more than naked political opportunism dressed up as concern for the national interest or employees who have given great service to the national carrier will be seen for what they are.  I commend the Minister for the patience and diligence with which he went about dealing with a particularly difficult issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800031#DD00200"><p>I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this very important topic for the country.  It is worth restating that the State only owns 25% of Aer Lingus.  This leaves us with a minority shareholding with little control over the activities of the company.  The 25% shareholding is the only thing we are selling.  To put that 25% shareholding in context, much of the debate has been about the Heathrow slots.  Our 25% shareholding alone does not control those slots.  We would need to persuade another 5% of the ownership to support us in any attempt to protect the Heathrow slots.  We are not making a decision on the entire airline.  That decision was made by Fianna F&aacute;il when it sold 75% in 2006 and privatised Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  It is also accepted by most commentators that the existing ownership structures of Aer Lingus are not sustainable or practical in the long term so changes are inevitable.  Ryanair must sell 25 % of its 30% stake due to a recent court ruling.  Etihad has signalled its intention to sell its 5% stake.  This shows that the ownership structure was going to change anyway.  It is much better that this be done on our terms where we can leverage the best possible deal rather than a potential hostile takeover occurring or a deal being done at a time when the aviation industry is in a worse position and Aer Lingus might not be in as strong a position as it is at present.  I am cognisant of the fact that the aviation sector is very cyclical.  Given these circumstances, the Minister and the Government sought to achieve the best deal they could in agreeing to sell a 25% minority stake in an international airline.  I believe they have done a good job and I commend the Minister for his work since the initial bid came in.  </p>  <p>  Aer Lingus management and staff have done a great job in recent years in turning the company around and making it successful.  This has made it an attractive investment proposition for an international group like IAG.  The aviation industry is notoriously volatile, cyclical and ever-evolving and this opportunity may not be available to the company in the future.  All it takes is another ash cloud, oil price fluctuation or terrorist threat to turn the cycle.  The progress that has been made from the initial bid should be noted when we look at the benefits of the deal.  It includes real guarantees and will bring huge benefits to Ireland in terms of jobs and connectivity.  There is potential for growth and development at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  The deal will see new routes added which benefit all citizens and regions.</p>  <p>  Stephen Kavanagh has confirmed that Aer Lingus with IAG want to grow direct employment.  A total of 150 net new jobs will be created by 2016 and 635 jobs will be created by 2020.  IAG also expects that new indirect jobs are likely to be created in the airport and airline support activities as well in the tourism sector.  Aer Lingus staff are synonymous with the company and its exemplary image.  Anybody who has been aware for a while knows that it is lovely to get on that Aer Lingus flight on the way back home and see the friendly smile and familiar accent.  Therefore, I am particularly pleased that IAG has confirmed that the existing employment rights of Aer Lingus employees will be safeguarded fully and that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  </p>  <p>  The Government has secured a number of legally binding connectivity commitments in the offer.  The commitment that the Heathrow slots will continue to be held by Aer Lingus indefinitely and the commitment to retain current schedule frequencies between Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon for seven years post-acquisition is very positive.  It will allow the airports the certainty to build on them.  Those commitments do not exist at the moment so we have seven years during which commitments that do not exist at the moment will apply.  </p>  <p>  We must look at the possibilities and not just the negative elements.  We could see a situation with investment and development, Dublin could become a hub in itself.  We spend all the time talking about the slots at Heathrow and how Heathrow is such a key hub but we have pre-clearance in Dublin and Shannon for access to the US.  This leaves us in a very strong position to grow our transatlantic trade.  I do not see why Dublin Airport and even our regional airports cannot look to be hubs themselves, rival Heathrow in some ways and grow our tourism and business interests.  </p>  <p>  Other commitments that have been secured also improve on our current situation.  Securing the Aer Lingus name and head office in Ireland is very important.  The creation of the new "B" share will give control over these commitments and subject to the approval of Aer Lingus shareholders, they will be enshrined in the articles of association of the company.  IAG believes that together with Aer Lingus, it could deliver 2.4 million more passengers, four additional destinations in North America and eight additional aircraft for its fleet.  These new transatlantic services could be added by summer 2016.  This will have a really direct impact on the country.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, many of the speeches in this House referred to an Aer Lingus that no longer exists, an Aer Lingus that was in full State ownership.  This is no longer the case.  I have heard speeches that praised Ryanair and Michael O'Leary for what he has done.  I would ask those who are opposed to this deal whether they believe the growth of Ryanair and the activities of Michael O'Leary would have been possible under State ownership or with State intervention - something that possibly stifled Aer Lingus in the past.  Considering all the factors before us, including the potential for growth that the current ownership structure does not provide, this deal is in the best interests of the country and I commend the Minister for his work on it to date.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800031#DD00300"><p>I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate.  I commend the Minister for all the hard work he has done in this area.  I will speak as a Deputy who represents Limerick city and the mid-west and in that context, Shannon Airport.  Shannon Airport has been a vital driver of economic growth in the region for a long period of time.  To put it in context, a person could fly from Shannon to Heathrow with Aer Lingus for the past 50 years.</p>  <p>  This new improved offer from IAG brings about certainty for Shannon Airport, the mid-west and Limerick in two main areas.  For the first time, we are getting a guarantee that the Heathrow slots and, more particularly, the daily flights from Shannon to Heathrow will be kept and will not be diminished over the next seven years.  This is to be welcomed.  There is a commitment from IAG in this improved bid that it will look to maintain and grow the transatlantic routes that currently operate out of Shannon, namely, those to Boston and New York.  I very much welcome this.  In respect of Aer Lingus workers based on Shannon, I recognise that Aer Lingus has stated today that there will be no compulsory redundancies and I welcome this.  We should be looking to grow the numbers at Shannon and other airports.</p><p>Before I speak specifically about Shannon Airport, I would like to welcome the fact that the Aer Lingus brand is being retained because it is synonymous with Ireland.   The airline flies the shamrock which is a hugely important ambassador for the country all over the world.</p> <p> In terms of the impact of this offer for Shannon Airport, it brings certainty on the Heathrow and transatlantic routes, both of which are extremely important to the airport.  Connectivity through Heathrow and the year-round direct connectivity to Boston and New York are hugely important because we have a very large multinational base in the mid-west and along the western seaboard.  One of the key reasons for that is the connectivity at Shannon Airport, as various employers have testified, including Regeneron in Limerick.  Representatives of that company are on record as saying that one of the key reasons the company located in Limerick was the direct connectivity on the north Atlantic routes.  Viagogo, a relatively new company which set up in Castletroy, has stated that it chose Castletroy because of the connectivity to Heathrow at Shannon Airport.  When we boil it down to economics, the connectivity in the mid-west through Shannon Airport equals jobs.  </p> <p> One of the key successes of this Government in recent times has been its decision to make Shannon Airport independent.  The airport has thrived across a range of areas since gaining independence.  In the last year alone we have seen 17% growth in passenger numbers.  Anyone who drives by Shannon Airport will be heartened to see that the car parks are full and that the nearby hotels are doing well, which are very positive signs.  When IAG first announced its bid, I was eager to ensure that nothing was done that would undermine the success, to date, of Shannon Airport.  The Heathrow slots were a key issue and we now have a seven year guarantee in that regard, which I very much welcome.  That will encourage businesses to locate in the region and enable those already based there to know that direct connectivity is guaranteed with the flights that are currently in place for the next seven years at least and, no doubt, long beyond that.  </p> <p> Shannon Airport has significant capacity, with one of the longest runways in Europe.  It has enormous capacity to grow further and a key element of that is the transatlantic routes.  Apart from Aer Lingus there are other airlines operating transatlantic flights into and out of Shannon Airport although Aer Lingus is very much the flag carrier in that regard.  We have seen the return of year-round schedules recently which shows how successful the airport has been.  Those looking at Shannon Airport from the outside often miss the fact that it is boxing way above its weight.  The airport is a key ingredient for economic development and tourism in the region.  It brings tourists into the region all year round, but particularly in the summer period.  It also brings key business executives to businesses based all along the western seaboard, from Sligo all the way down to Kerry.  We are continually talking about balanced regional development and having an international airport functioning along the western seaboard ensures that we have a strong counterpoint to the eastern region and Dublin in particular.  I am not taking from the great work that is happening in Dublin but we must have balanced regional development and Shannon Airport is key in that regard.</p> <p> As with everything, we must look at the positives.  In the context of this deal, the positives include the seven year guarantee on the Heathrow slots and the promised growth in transatlantic traffic and I take the word of IAG on the latter.  The Shannon Airport Authority has a new board and new management in place who are doing a fantastic job and they are very supportive of this deal.  Their track record speaks for itself.  As a public representative based in the mid-west, I would like to see the details of IAG's growth targets and plans for the transatlantic routes out of Shannon Airport.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be speaking to Willie Walsh at some stage in the near future and I would urge him to pass on the message that he should not be afraid to send passengers into Shannon Airport for onward transatlantic travel.  The airport has the capacity, structures and staff in place to deal with additional passengers and it operates very efficiently.  Anyone who has used Shannon Airport will testify that it is very easy to get around it and that parking there is relatively easy.  The airport now has full pre-clearance for the United States which is hugely significant.  IAG is using the pre-clearance facility for British Airways executive flights, which is very welcome.</p> <p> Shannon Airport is hugely important to the surrounding region.  Many of the staff who work at the airport live in Limerick city.  The airport is an integral part of the economic fabric of the mid-west.  The fact that it has become independent and has been successful is testament to the policy focus of this Government which is based on enabling regions to develop for themselves.  The mid-west, western seaboard and Limerick bring an international dimension to economic development.  Companies from all over North America are based in the region, as are many European companies which use the Heathrow routes at Shannon Airport.   There is also enormous connectivity to the Asian markets in the mid-west region.  </p> <p> I welcome this measure and am fully supportive of it.  It brings certainty to Shannon Airport with regard to the Heathrow slots for seven years, as well as assurances with regard to growth in transatlantic routes.  I look forward to seeing IAG's plans in that regard; it has made a public commitment to grow transatlantic traffic.  I also welcome its strategic alliance with American Airlines.  I would like to see the details of the company's plan, including the period of time involved and the number of passengers it hopes to put through Shannon Airport.  I am confident that we will continue to see success at Shannon Airport and in the region more generally and that a rising tide will lift all boats.  I cannot overstate the importance of Shannon Airport to Limerick and the entire mid-west region.  I welcome this measure and look forward to seeing how IAG and Aer Lingus will improve the potential of Shannon Airport.  </p></speech>

This issue is very important and we must have a proper debate on all aspects of the sale of the State's share in Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is our national airline and most Irish people had their first flight on an Aer Lingus plane.  I had mine in the 1980s when I flew to the United States of America on one of the old 747s out of Shannon Airport.  We all remember the advertising slogan, "Look up, it's Aer Lingus" and everyone would like that to continue.  I wish to compliment the staff who have worked for Aer Lingus over the years.  They have always been friendly and proud to work for our national carrier.  The Aer Lingus emblem was the first thing that many people saw when they came to our country many years ago because it was the only airline that flew in and out of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I do not know why we have to railroad this decision through and vote on it today.  We need a fuller debate on the sale of the airline.  There has been no committee debate on this issue.  The prospect of a sale has been in the public domain since December, when Willie Walsh made his initial offer but Willie Walsh will not always be with IAG.  What will happen in seven years' time if there is a new chief executive at IAG?  Will the guarantees with regard to Aer Lingus still stand?</p><p> Stobart Air operates under the Aer Lingus Regional brand.  It started off in Galway as a small airline servicing the Aran Islands.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh took it over and built it up as Aer Arann with flights between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  More than 400 people work in Stobart Air and this is proposed to increase to possibly 500 people.  What commitment has been given to them?  What job security do those who work in Aer Lingus Regional and Stobart Air have?  Did the Minister have any discussions with Stobart Air on the implications of this sale on Aer Lingus Regional?  Stobart Air relies 100% technically on Aer Lingus.  It provides a great service regionally between Ireland and Britain.  When Mr. Noel Dempsey was Minister for Transport, I worked with him to get Aer Lingus to work with Aer Arann because it did not make economic sense to have a big jet taking off in Dublin and landing in Manchester or Liverpool.  It was better to use turboprop aircraft.</p> <p> Has the Minister had any discussions with Stobart Air?  Has any commitment been given to Aer Lingus Regional over the 400 jobs?  What is to prevent Mr. Willie Walsh in two or three years time downsizing Aer Lingus to provide a regional service?  He can do that because with the jobs commitment he has given to Aer Lingus he has to keep people employed there.  In his reply I would like the Minister to outline to the House the guarantees that have been given to the employees of Aer Lingus Regional.  Can the same guarantees that have been given to Aer Lingus staff be given to the staff of Aer Lingus Regional?  Those 400 employees of a small regional airline are very concerned about what is happening.  No one has mentioned this in the past two days of debate in the House.  I raise the matter because the airline started in my constituency.  Before the debate finishes, I would like a commitment from the Minister that there will be job security for the staff at Stobart Air.</p> <p> I will be voting against the motion this evening simply because we are not having a proper debate on it.  It is a huge issue to sell our national carrier.  We are an island nation.  Aer Lingus has done exceptionally well over the years, through recessions and wars.  It has provided a great service and it is an airline that will survive.  The IAG takeover comes down to one issue, which is to get at the Heathrow slots for the long-haul flights to Australia and Asia.  That is the motive behind it.</p> <p> In his reply I ask the Minister to give some sort of comfort to the 400 staff in Aer Lingus Regional, the vast majority of whom are based in Ireland.  It flies out of Shannon and Dublin airports.  It is important to give a commitment to the employees of Stobart Air and give them the same guarantees that have been given to Aer Lingus employees.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1186" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800033#FF00200"><p>I do not agree with much of what Deputy Noel Grealish has said, but I am in complete agreement about the contempt that has been shown to the House in how this matter has been handled over the past couple of days.  It is unfortunate that there is no opportunity to engage in a proper and full question and answer session with the Minister.  The matter should go to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.</p>  <p>  I never enjoy the nonsense that goes on here about D&aacute;il sitting days and whether we should sit.  However, I find it hard to understand why we are not sitting next week.  I do not believe it would cause anybody too much concern if we were to sit in order that this matter could receive proper and full attention by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications if only to provide comfort and answer some of the questions that have been legitimately raised by a number of Deputies.  This is yet another example of how the Government is deliberately downplaying and reducing the impact and relevance of this House, the elected Chamber of Deputies, which is unfortunate particularly given that the Government has such a large majority.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I wholeheartedly favour the sale of the Government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus.  I do not believe nostalgia is a substitute for good business decisions.  In recent months I have heard a considerable amount of misty-eyed tales about flying transatlantic, the green uniforms and so on.  We live in a globalised economy and we live in the real world.  Aer Lingus is not the largest carrier in this island, that fall to Ryanair.  Ryanair has a business model that thrives on competition and on offering choice to consumers.  Ryanair has singlehandedly transformed the opportunities for Irish customers.  It has made air transport accessible to people who otherwise would not be able to afford it.  It has opened up the world to Irish citizens.  It means that the many tens of thousands of Irish emigrants who live in other parts of Europe and the world are able to afford to travel to come home to see their families and their families are able to travel to see them.  Competition is to be welcomed and we do not have anything to fear.</p>  <p>  We must remember that we are not discussing the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  That happened in 2006 when it was floated on the stock market.  The Government's 25% shareholding is quite meaningless and the days of Ministers dictating commercial policy to the board of Aer Lingus are rightly over.  It is not the business of the Government to dictate to an airline company.</p>  <p>  As a nation we need to prioritise securing the future of Aer Lingus and the future of air travel for our citizens.  In the debate so far there has been an absence of concern for Irish air travel customers.  The focus of the debate, certainly from the Government benches has been far more about protecting the electoral concerns of certain, primarily Labour Party, Deputies, rather than discussing the best interest of the State and its citizens.  That is unfortunate.  Aer Lingus should not be the plaything of parties that are concerned about their potential performance or otherwise in the next general election.  It is misguided and misses the point of what this is all about.  Certain Government Deputies have not showered themselves in glory in recent weeks and months.</p>  <p>  This represents a reality check for us.  We live in a global economy in which cumbersome state companies that do not evolve and are resistant to change fail because there is always a more nimble, efficient and dynamic alternative ready to replace them.  We have already seen that with Ryanair.  The risk is that if Aer Lingus refuses or is not allowed to evolve, adapt, compete and modernise in order to secure its future, it will be under severe threat in the future.</p>  <p>  Concerns that IAG has some kind of mischievous goal to somehow reduce or downgrade Aer Lingus are nonsensical.  It wants to purchase Aer Lingus because it is a viable company that has huge potential to grow and with the right investment it can grow.  However, it needs that investment and that is where IAG comes in.  Given that IAG is a major player, it can invest in aircraft and open up new routes.  That is good for Ireland.  It is good for Aer Lingus.  It is good for Irish consumers.  It is good for Irish air traffic customers.  It is good for everybody concerned.  It is good for the people who work in Aer Lingus and for the people who want to work in Aer Lingus in the future.</p><p>It makes sense.  IAG has the resources to invest in stock and aircraft to which Aer Lingus otherwise would not have access.  Companies that cannot invest and renew die.  IAG has access to strategic alliances with other airlines across the world, something Aer Lingus has not had.  As a customer of Aer Lingus, I find it frustrating that it does not have partnerships and alliances with airlines in other parts of the world.  Alliances open up new opportunities, opportunities that should be embraced rather than resisted or rejected.</p> <p> The only question that we, as parliamentarians, should be asking is: what is best for Ireland?  What is best for Aer Lingus, as a company, to help it to innovate and grow and be dynamic in order that it can secure its future?  What is best for Irish customers?  The many people who lined up in the past to resist Ryanair and reduce its influence because they believed it would threaten Aer Lingus and so on have been proved wrong.  Ryanair is the best thing that has happened to Irish aviation.  We need to learn from the lessons of the past.  We need to open our eyes to what is happening in the global economy and the global aviation sector and embrace it.  I will be voting in favour of the motion, notwithstanding my genuine annoyance at how the Government has handled the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800034#GG00200"><p>The document relating to the motion on which we will be voting later this evening contains an outline of principles set out over two pages.  To use an appropriate metaphor, Members are alerted to the announcement of the Order of Business by the ringing of a bell, which is similar to what happens at an airport when information on a flight is being announced.  The boarding gate for flight IAG 999 is due to close at 4.42 p.m. today, but we have not packed properly.</p>  <p>  The Government's minority shareholding - 25%, at a price of &euro;2.50 per share - amounts to &euro;335 million, which is a better price than the price per share obtained in respect of the 75% shareholding sold some years ago.  The opportunity should have been taken to have the pensioners who built the company to what it is today exit fairly for their lifetime's work.  The Minister should revisit that price and add, at least, a &euro;150 million infusion into the pension fund.  Ryanair would support this because of its potential exposure should the pension wound in respect of the deferred pensioners of Aer Lingus be reopened and it knows this.  The Government has leverage with the proposed buyers.  The saving of &euro;40 million to &euro;60 million per year in costs, as set out in the Nyras report, in the context of a ten year view, represents a figure of between &euro;400 million and &euro;600 million in super-expectation capital for the buyers.  That is why, at a minimum, the Government owes it to the people who built the airline and presented it in its present form to do what is right and fair.  For the Government which has the largest ever majority in the history of the State to bring this proposal before the House without considering this issue is pretty limp.  It is gutless and not right.</p>  <p>  The document before us should have been presented on the basis of E&amp;OE, errors and omissions excepted.  The shortest sentence in the document is: "The offer price is a cash payment of at least &euro;2.50 per Aer Lingus share", which is shamefully raw and bald.  Of course, the buyers would be prepared to pay an extra &euro;150 million which is only 10% above the overall price to all shareholders.  As stated yesterday by Deputy Sean Fleming, Aer Lingus is owned by a composite of Irish residents, Ryanair, the pilots' pension fund and the State.  As the shareholding amounts to 60%, there is great cohesive negotiating strength, as IAG knows.  </p>  <p>  There is a propensity among Departments, ministerial offices and Cabinets to go around in circles, talking in hypothetical rather than business terms.  The buyers will assuredly digest another &euro;150 million.  Did the Minister put forward as an opening requirement that the pension fund be uplifted by not less than &euro;150 million?  Had he done so, everything that would have followed would have been meaningful.  One cannot move forward from the unresolved legacy issues, that are an open sore to past employees and their families, without tidying up the past.  The potential buyers know this, too.  </p>  <p>  Those backbenchers who will be required to put on blindfolds and insert their ear plugs when the boarding gate closes at 4.42 p.m. will have missed the opportunity to board with safety on an airline which Deputy Lucinda Creighton fairly described as requiring the resources of a wider network of allegiances and alliances to deliver to the people the air transport service needed into and out of Ireland.  Into the future, the aircraft will mostly be landing and staying in Dublin and other places and the staff will be largely Irish.  As possession is nine-tenths of the law, we will be able to bring forward whatever regulations and legislation is required to keep it safe.  If the Government does not roll up its sleeves, put its shoulders back and, with some steel in its spine, try to right the wrong of the pension raid on past employees and current and deferred pensioners, it will have done a dark day's business.  The 166 Members of this House should not allow that to happen.  IAG would respect us for it and would pay the price which would be only 10% of the overall price.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-05-28a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1013" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052800034#GG00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  When the initial offer from IAG was made in January, it was deemed unacceptable to the Government.  Acting with my Labour Party colleagues, I played a key role in ensuring the initial offer which was bad was not accepted.  From the very beginning, we have been criticised from all sides, including right-wing media commentators for being parish pump politicians only interested in grandstanding and seat-saving gestures and the far left for not folding the tent of the Government and calling an election on the grounds of State assets.  Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of being able to act in a space without consequences.</p><p>Once a bid was made for Aer Lingus, we had to respond in the world as it was, not the world those in Sinn F&eacute;in or the far left pretended it was.  Unlike the ESB and Ervia, Aer Lingus is not a commercial semi-State company.  It is a private company with shareholders, of which the State is one.  The company has always been subject to a takeover bid.  We saw such a bid previously from the low cost airline Ryanair and this bid has come from IAG.</p> <p> The Opposition would have the public believe a dismissal of any offer, on the grounds that the State's 25% share is not for sale, would have no effect on the company at all.  That is simply not true.  If we had dismissed the bid on the grounds of well meaning ideology, that in this case the Government's stake in a private company was not for sale, there would have been consequences.  The company's value is set by the market's view of how much the company is worth.  If a company is not for sale, in essence, its value will plummet.  These are not rules created by the Labour Party.  Unfortunately, that is the reality in the world in which we all live and no amount of roaring or screaming to the contrary will change it.  Therefore, it was not an option to dismiss the offer out of hand.  If the company's value had plummeted, the company would have been vulnerable to further cost saving measures.</p> <p> The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in the Seanad said Labour Party Deputies, including me, had said, "we would not sell under any circumstances".  That was never our position.  We never said anything of the sort.  Our position was that should a sale take place, certain conditions would have to be met, concerning connectivity, independent valuation, workers' terms and conditions and a plan for the regions.  This was included in our motion at our party conference and is a matter of record.  The misquoting is another example of what we have gone through in the past four years, in being pulled between the left, the right and populist and enduring criticism of our attempts to do the right thing to get the country back on track and create jobs.</p> <p> By the end of next year, IAG expects to create approximately 150 net new jobs in Aer Lingus.  By 2020 the plan is to have created 635 high quality jobs, including pilots, cabin crew and engineers.  This takes into account the approximate 50 job losses as a result of the takeover, none of which will be compulsory.  There are up to 487 applications in the pipeline for voluntary severance packages.  It is also important to note that all of the airports have come out strongly in favour of the takeover, including Shannon and Cork.  The regions are happy with it.  Unlike the Opposition, politicians in the regions see potential in the deal to achieve further growth in terms of job creation and tourism, which is welcome.  The Opposition is stoking up fear, among the workers in particular, that the deal is a Trojan horse which will serve to bring a great airline into ruin.</p> <p> The company has committed to entering into registered employment agreements under the framework enshrined in the Industrial Relations Bill 2015, as introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, to protect the terms and conditions of Aer Lingus employees.  Does any of us have a crystal ball through which we can gaze into the future?  No, we do not.  We all need to act on the best advice and information we have available at a particular time.   As I mentioned, taking the option to reject any offer out of hand would have had a detrimental impact on the company.  What would happen if the offer was rejected and followed by a hostile offer down the road?  If an offer had not been accepted, it would have offered no surety on the employees' terms of employment, connectivity or a plan for the regions. </p> <p> It has been said before and is worth restating, Aer Lingus is a private company, having been privatised by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The State's share was retained solely to ensure guarantees in respect of connectivity and the Heathrow Airport slots.  We have received that guarantee in the making of this offer.  The Minister for Finance will have the ability to block any proposed disposal by Aer Lingus of any of its Heathrow Airport slots indefinitely.  This provides stronger protection for the State than the current arrangement, under which the State cannot prevent a reallocation, reassignment or cessation of use of the Heathrow Airport slots.  The Minister for Finance will also be able to block a proposal by Aer Lingus to change its company name, brand and head office location and place of incorporation from Ireland.  This commitment is unlimited in time and provides protection that, again, is not available under the current arrangement. </p> <p> Instead of using the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt, the Labour Party has ensured the proceeds from the sale will be reinvested, through the strategic investment fund, in transport and other connectivity projects only.  Questions have been raised about proceeds from the sale being used for other purposes such as for IASS pensions.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was clear that, legally, funds from the sale could only be used through the the strategic investment fund for specific connectivity purposes.</p> <p> We acknowledge and share an emotional position from which one is reluctant to divest State ownership, but it would be very wounding if funds from divesting the State's share in Aer Lingus were used to write down Fianna F&aacute;il's legacy debt.  It is welcome that funds from the sale will be reinvested in much needed infrastructure.  This infrastructure is sorely needed, owing to years of Fianna F&aacute;il waste and over six years of budget deficits which have stifled our ability to grow and invest.  </p> <p> In summary, being in government is about making decisions and choices.  In its time Fianna F&aacute;il made poor decisions.  Sinn Fein makes populist soundbites.  Those on the far left never want to make a decision.  We chose to go into government in the knowledge that we would be making tough decisions.  This is one such decision.  If we had accepted the initial offer, it would have been a bad decision for the airline and the country.  If we had dismissed it out of hand, it would have been a populist gesture.  Most populist decisions have consequences and these consequences would have had a negative impact on the company and its workforce.  We had to make a decision.  Our decision was not to sell to a vulture capital fund, which is what ultimately happened when Fianna F&aacute;il privatised eircom.  Neither did we roll out the red carpet to a low cost airline.  We have considered an offer from one of the major players in the global airline industry, an industry which is going through a period of consolidation.  Was it an easy decision?  No, it was not.  Are we certain everything will be rosy in the garden in the future?  No, we are not.  How could we?  However, this is a good offer which has the potential to be of major benefit to Aer Lingus, the country, current Aer Lingus workers and the many new workers who will take up the high quality jobs that will come on stream.</p> <p> I want to refer briefly to the dynamic of the debate in the past couple of days.  I arrived quite late at a Labour Party briefing on Tuesday afternoon - it had started at 4.30 p.m. - to discuss what might be agreed at the resumed Cabinet meeting later.  I looked at a letter from Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, CEO of Aer Lingus, to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, which had been provided as evidence that the REA requirement included in our Labour Party conference motion had been delivered on.  I stated immediately that it had not delivered on it and that the letter did not go far enough.  It was woolly and not specific enough.  It got into the public domain later on Tuesday.  Our discussion on the matter continued into the evening.  An important phrase in the press release from me and my seven colleagues late on Tuesday largely went unnoticed, but it indicated that we had unfinished business in regard to REAs.  That phrase read: "Between now and the formal completion of the sale, we will continue to work towards ensuring that the REAs deliver the best possible outcome for the workers involved".  This was not just padding but a considered inclusion.  Work on that unfinished business resumed the next morning at a further scheduled briefing with the Minister and, importantly, Mr. Kavanagh who was questioned by a number of people about the meaning of the letter and what could be taken from its contents.  I told him directly that a revised letter to the Labour Party chairman, Deputy Jack Wall, with more specific commitments around REAs would be required to secure all of the votes on the deal on Thursday.  There was agreement that efforts would be made by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, and Mr. Kavanagh in the time before the vote to come up with the revised letter requested.  I am happy to say the commitments given in the new letter from Mr Kavanagh, negotiated and signed off on by the Minister of State last night on behalf of the Labour Party and the Government, address the REA element of the Labour Party conference motion.  I understand unions at Aer Lingus recognise the progress made and I am now more comfortable with how I will cast my vote later today.  I am quite certain that the improved offer from IAG is due in no small part to a group of backbench Labour Party Deputies working together in a focused way to secure the best possible deal to secure the future of Aer Lingus and its workforce in the interests of the country as a whole and the regions.</p> <p> I want to read a paragraph from the letter we received from Mr. Kavanagh to the Minister of State which was copied to Deputy Jack Wall.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph he states:<blockquote>I am also committed to the principle that Aer Lingus would not utilise compulsory redundancy or a movement to non-direct employment in a scenario where the changes and efficiencies that the business requires can be achieved through flexibility and mobility internally delivered by staff and their trade union representatives.  We would now envisage engaging with the trade unions in this regard.  This engagement would be designed to agree a formal approach to enshrine this principle and the method of its implementation in a collective agreement or agreements.  The company is prepared to undertake to register these agreements under the terms of the enabling legislation.</blockquote>That is a major move forward in terms of providing security of employment for the current workforce and new workers in the future.</p></speech>

I welcome the decision made by the Minister and the Government on the disposal of the minority shareholding of 25.1% because it has been made after careful consideration.  It is in the best interests of the country, Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus employees and the economy as a whole.</p><p>It is interesting to note that no member of the two major Opposition parties and most of the Independents are not present for the debate, despite their protestations, grandstanding and turning this issue into a political football.  Their negativity is appalling.  This morning the acting leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Timmy Dooley, said he had been taken unawares by the unexpected decision announced on Tuesday evening.  I found that amazing.  In view of what is happening and the publicity this issue has generated in the media and the entire country in recent months, everybody was expecting that it would be brought to a conclusion.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it to a conclusion without further delay.  A decision was urgently needed because the longer it went on, the more likely it was it would have a negative impact on Aer Lingus and the air industry.</p><p>I compliment the Minister on making himself available for discussions.  My colleagues in RENUA Ireland may not be aware of this, but he was very disposed to meefing us and met us on numerous occasions to clarify and deal with issues raised.  Of all Ministers, he briefed us extremely well on it.</p><p>I also welcome the decision as a rural Deputy for County Tipperary.  One might wonder why we would be bothered about airports, but we are as concerned about connectivity as anybody else.  Mr. Tony Ryan who founded Ryanair probably got inspiration from Thomas Davis, the editor of <i>The Nation</i>in the 1840s, who described Tipperary as the Premier County.  He said this because &quot;where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows.&quot;  That is certainly the case in the aviation industry.</p><p>Now that the issue of the shareholding is out of the way - Ryanair spent a lot of time concentrating on putting pressure on Aer Lingus - Aer Lingus can get on with managing its core business.  In the future some entrepreneur - there may be one in our midst - might set up another airline, now that Aer Lingus has been consolidated as part of a larger group.  That larger group will afford an opportunity to provide much greater connectivity to Ireland and fly to many more cities, particularly in the United States and Europe.  With pre-clearance facilities at Shannon Airport for travellers to the United States, many people from elsewhere in Europe will be able to fly to Shannon Airports and onwards to the United States where they will not face delays.  The agreement which I welcome has tremendous potential.  </p><p>Deputy Peter Mathews was concerned about the departure time of 3.45 p.m.</p></speech>

That will provide a great opportunity for airports such as Shannon which has the required capacity and facilities.  This will certainly be of benefit to all of us in the mid-west, particularly in north Tipperary.  I always take the view that the glass is half full, which is the case in this instance.</p></speech>

Change brings uncertainty, concern and, to an extent, fear to many, but the constant negativity from Opposition Members who see nothing positive in this deal is galling.  A few years ago when they were in charge, the country was broke.  They called in the IMF and we had to be baled out because within days.  What would have happened to Aer Lingus at that stage?  It would have been liquidated and we would have had no say in the matter, yet crocodile tears are being shed by the Opposition, including by Deputy Peter Mathews who said he was not afforded an opportunity to discuss the matter.  I commend the Government for its actions and wish the Minister well.</p></speech>

We are, therefore, spending seven hours debating something that was agreed last night when hands were shook - it was deal done.  I want to ask the Minister one question before I continue my contribution.  Can I or anybody else on these benches say anything that will change the deal struck last night?</p></speech>
