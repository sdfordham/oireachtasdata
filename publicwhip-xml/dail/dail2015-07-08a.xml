The funding provided by Atlantic Philanthropies is due to expire later this year and I would welcome a statement from the Minister today in regard to how he plans to ensure this critical early intervention programme is maintained and strengthened in the years ahead.</p></reply>

It consists of committed funding for an area based approach to improve outcomes for children and thereby reduce child poverty.  The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme 2007-2013, which was co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.</p>  <p>  The ABC programme involves joint investment from my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies of &euro;29.7 million in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in disadvantaged areas.  It aims to break the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged through integrated and effective services and interventions in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The ABC programme is time bound and the co-funding arrangement between the Government and Atlantic Philanthropies is in place until 2017.   A key purpose of the ABC programme is to identify the learning in, and across, the ABC sites and to transfer this learning into existing and established services.  Adopting such a systems focus, rather than merely a site or geographic specific focus, is the intention so that we can ensure a greater reach and sustained impact in services across the country.  What I want to ensure is that, rather than creating parallel provision, the learning from this programme informs the ongoing reform of established services and supports for children and young people.  Mainstreaming the learning in this way will bring improvements, not only in specific areas, but across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas of disadvantage.  A task group has been established to explore how best to mainstream the learning where programmes and activities have proven more effective than existing provision.</p></reply>

However, people are concerned about the Minister's and the Government's commitment towards maintaining critical investment in this area into the future.  This is the reason the group Hands Up for Children has formed.  Its aim is to ensure there is a universal response on early intervention.  In some instances, there is a need for additional resources and targeted initiatives.  The ABC programme has proved very effective and I would like a clear commitment that it will be continued in the future.</p></speech>

Evidence based interventions are critical and because of constraints on our budget, we want to ensure the money we spend delivers the results we seek.  What we are looking for here are better outcomes for children and to address the issue of those who face disadvantage, particularly educationally.</p>  <p>  The ABC programme - the second of its type following the programmes implementation platform, PIP - is currently being evaluated under the guidance of an expert advisory group.  The evaluation adopts a shared measurement framework across all ABC programme sites.  The evaluation will consider the implementation and cost of programmes and, crucially, how the outcomes for children and families in area based childhood areas have changed during the course of the programme.  This evaluation will be crucial for indicating the impact of the ABC programme, along with the work of the task group.  It will be a key factor in informing considerations regarding the mainstreaming of the learning from the programme.</p>  <p>  The key point is that these programmes are used to identify improved ways of delivering a service and getting better outcomes and then mainstreaming the learning so that the improvement is not just in the specific areas where the programme has been tried out, but can be applied across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas.</p></speech>

The ABC programme provides a range of services, addressing child development, child well-being, parenting, educational disadvantage and more.  Therefore, it is important it is rolled out on a wider scale.  However, this will require greater resources.</p>  <p>  The current funding is time limited, because Atlantic Philanthropies is about to pull out.  The Minister has said an evaluation is in progress.  When will that evaluation be completed and when complete will it form part of the interdepartmental group's current study on the accessibility and affordability of child care?  Will it feed into that?  What are the Minister's plans in terms of ensuring prevention and early intervention measures are rolled out nationally in the future?  The Minister is correct that it is about getting value for money.  As I said earlier, when we consider that it costs between &euro;300,000 and &euro;350,000 to keep one child in detention facilities, the money spent on prevention and early intervention is money better spent.</p></speech>

It will also inform what new programmes should be put in place to continue the process of evaluating, learning and reforming.  This is critical.  </p><p>The Deputy has rightly touched on the need for strong, evidence-based policy so that this can be put to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance during the Estimates process, when more funding is sought for programmes that we can show will yield the dividend we seek.</p></speech>

Childminders play a very important role in the care and protection of children.  At present, childminders who mind four or more unrelated preschool children must notify Tusla and are inspected by the agency.  The statutory notification process is set out in the 2006 child care regulations.  As of April 2015, just 154 childminders had been notified to the Child and Family Agency.  I am preparing revised child care regulations which, when commenced, will replace this notification system with a new registration system.  This will cover childminders with four or more unrelated preschool children.</p>  <p>  Childminders who mind three children or fewer are not currently required to notify or register with Tusla.  However, they are encouraged to register their service voluntarily with their local city or county child care committee, CCC.  According to Pobal, the number of childminders who are not subject to the regulations but who voluntarily notified their service to the CCCs in 2014 was 749.</p>  <p>  A range of supports are currently in place for childminders.  For example, my Department provides annual funding of &euro;340,000 to Childminding Ireland.  It also funds childminding development grants, amounting to &euro;250,000 in total, which are distributed annually by the county child care committees, CCCs.  In addition, childminders taking care of three or fewer children under the age of 18 may be entitled to avail of the child care services relief from the Revenue Commissioners, provided their annual childminding income comes to no more than &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  It is likely that the interdepartmental group on future investment in early years and after-school care and education, which I established in February this year, will consider further supports for childminders as part of its work.  This interdepartmental group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility of provision and build the quality of provision of early years and school-age care and education.  The group is expected to submit a series of recommendations shortly.</p></speech>

It is estimated that approximately 50,000 young children are being cared for by paid non-relative childminders.  Of the estimated 19,000 childminders, less than 1% are registered with the HSE or Tusla.  We need to be moving towards a system of registration, inspection and support so that childminders are supported in their work.  Currently, the voluntary notification system asks that childminders who mind three children or fewer are not required to notify the HSE and be inspected but may notify their local city or country child care committee or childminder adviser of their service.  This is a voluntary notification process as set out in the 2008 national guidelines for childminders.  Voluntary notification states that childminders benefit by gaining access to a range of services and supports through their local city or county child care committee and childminder advisers, including information networking and training, as outlined by the Minister.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe that voluntary registration by childminders is a realistic and reasonable requirement, in light of the cutbacks in support for childminders?  Does he agree that this voluntary system creates a two-tier system of regulation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800004#B00600"><p>As I said in my reply, it is accurate to say that childminders who are looking after three or fewer unrelated children do not have to register, but they are encouraged to do so voluntarily.  We will need to take an incremental approach.  Childminding is governed by the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.  The national guidelines for childminders were published to assist childminders by providing guidance for good practice in the area.  Considerable sums have been made available to support childminders.  There is a also a grant for childminding development.  This grant provided funding of &euro;1,000 to childminders to assist them with the purchase of materials to help them improve the quality of services available to children in their care.  The national childminder initiative provides support for childminders and people interested in becoming childminders and it is implemented locally by the city and county child care committees.  A first step for any person who wishes to become a childminder is to contact the local child care committee, CCC, to avail of its quality awareness programme.</p></speech>

The Bill addresses the issue of childminders, and this was debated on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether sanctions will be imposed on professionals who fail to comply with the Bill.  Are monitoring mechanisms in place for reports to be received and how will these be dealt with?  Will there be demands for audits of child safety statements?  Childminders are still exempt from having to report, as only those providing an early years service under the meaning of the Child Care Act 1991 are included.  Will the Minister comment on these points and indicate the anticipated commencement of the Children First Bill?</p></speech>

I reassure her that Report and Final Stages of the Children First Bill will be taken in the House tomorrow and this will provide an opportunity to discuss these matters, which were discussed at some length.  I note the concerns expressed by the Deputy and her party colleagues about childminders and I have addressed those concerns previously.  The auditing of facilities would represent a huge volume of work and would be a draw on resources for the agency.  In our view, that money would be better spent on providing services to children.  We have made provision in the Bill to have registration and the right for Tusla to inspect pre-registration.  If there is a failure to allow a pre-registration inspection then the premises would not be registered.  I thank the Deputy for allowing me this opportunity to state that when this provision is enacted, an advertising campaign will advise parents that there should be a child safety statement in place, and if this is not available then it is not a facility to which parents should send their child, and they should report it to Tusla.</p></speech>

I wish to challenge some of the points made in the reply.  I am not saying that funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland should be reinstated but rather that we must remember the role of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, which has been crucial in collating data which has driven policy over the last 40 years.  As the Minister has said, it is evidence-based.  This is top-of-the-range information, as is recognised internationally.  For that information not to be put to further use is very serious.  I do not think Tusla can play that role.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800004#B01100"><p>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to Rape Crisis Network Ireland, and I am responding on this basis.  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of sexual and domestic violence services in consultation with service providers.  The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and to set out a roadmap for the future delivery of these services.  It is seeking through this process to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of front-line services nationally.  Tusla considers that there is scope for more co-ordinated and more equitable provision of these services across the country.  One of the concerns identified by Tusla, and by Deputy Collins, relates to the completeness and availability of data to plan and deliver services.</p><p>For the first time domestic and sexual violence services are being developed as a specialist national service with a single line of accountability so as to enable better outcomes for both children and adults who are survivors of sexual violence.  A roadmap for the future of service delivery has been approved by Tusla&rsquo;s board. </p> <p> Funding provided to RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in rape crisis centres.  Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 rape crisis centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the network. </p> <p> In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sectors.  Consequently, Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.</p></speech>

It is not necessary for every centre to be involved in supplying the information, although at one stage all 16 centres were involved.  The type of information they gathered did not need full representation.  It was not designed as an operational administrative tool but can easily deliver that small area of data.  It is not representative of the population as the service users are self-selecting and rape crisis centres are <i>ad hoc</i>.  Therefore, full participation by all centres, while desirable, is not critical to the validity of the data.  RCNI data have provided ground-breaking research findings which have been used to inform responses to different types of survivors and to form prevention strategies.</p><p>I challenge the Minister's statement that &quot;Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected&quot;.  According to the RCNI, over two years only one deadline was missed by three days due to illness.  In every other instance, Tusla received timely information. </p></speech>

I am mindful of the need to ensure that we have comprehensive and timely national data across the system to assist in monitoring and evaluating existing services and to help in planning for the future delivery and development of these services.  I have raised with the board and the executive of Tusla the issue of how the quality of data can be improved as a priority for 2015.  I understand that the development of information systems to capture and analyse data on sexual violence and domestic violence services is a priority for Tusla and I support its efforts to address shortfalls in this area.  Funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the agency.</p></speech>

Why bring it into a bigger organisation that does not have, but would like to have, the expertise that RCNI has?  Why was RCNI not brought into the system to give and maintain that information in a proper way?</p>  <p>  Since January, Tusla has not collected the information as set up by the RCNI, which is recognised internationally.  The European gender equality groupings are considering how the data are processed, collected and used.  I cannot understand why this has happened.  Maybe the Minister can intervene and meet up with the RCNI and Tusla.  No one has even seen the review the Minister talks about.  RCNI did not have an opportunity to respond to, challenge, raise issues around or expand on, it.  Tusla has always received information it required from the RCNI on time, except once.  I hate when there is one side saying one thing and another saying something else.  There is an opportunity here to bring the groups together and examine comprehensively how the information will continue into the future to design policies for this important area.</p></speech>

I do not have the full list with me.  Tusla is not the only provider of funding for the RCNI although it provides a substantial part of its funding.  We maintained, and I issued an instruction, that front-line services should be protected.  Although we are coming out of an economic recession and the Department's budget was increased, there is still huge pressure on that budget.  We have to make choices and the choice Tusla has made, which I support, is to support the front-line services.  Each of the rape crisis centres that delivers care and services to the victims of sexual and domestic violence received its funding this year, as last year, to a total of approximately &euro;4 million.  My job is to protect the service to the front line.  In respect of the reorganisation of information being collected Tusla believes it can get more complete information in a much more timely fashion by going about it in a different way.  The important point from the Deputy's point of view, and certainly from my point of view, is that front-line services are protected and that victims and survivors of sexual and domestic violence receive the service when they need it.</p></speech>

I would appreciate if he could inform the House what measures the Department, which has been in existence for four and a half years, is putting in place to ensure these children, who need additional supports, will get those supports, starting from next term.</p></reply>

Approximately 65,000 children are availing of this programme in the current school year.</p><p>The issue of access to the free preschool year for children with special needs was considered when the ECCE programme was launched and a number of measures were introduced to make the programme more accessible for these children.  The measures in place include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a <i>pro rata</i>basis, for example, availing of the programme for two days a week in the first year and for three days a week in the second year. </p><p>Many children with special needs participate in the free preschool year without seeking these exemptions, so while there are 544 children with special needs availing of these exemptions for the current school year, the number of children with special needs availing of the ECCE programme would be far in excess of this.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, works in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special preschools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream preschools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. </p><p>The Government recognises that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for preschool children with special needs must be improved.  Accordingly, when I established the interdepartmental group on future investment in early years and school age care and education I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within the ECCE programme.</p><p>To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and Health are working together to develop a new model of supports for preschool children with special needs.  A group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin city childcare committee has started its work.  This group aims to have an agreed model by early September, with a view to making a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process.</p></speech>

Early education should start before the free preschool year, particularly for children with special educational needs.  While the programme is welcome, the Minister mentioned a leniency in its application for children with special educational needs.  The number of people on a split year or availing of the upper age threshold is only in the region of 500 but various reports indicate there is in excess of 6,000 children with special educational needs.  Can the Minister's Department confirm the number of children under the age of five who have been diagnosed with special educational needs and the number of children currently awaiting assessment?</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I met a parents group which was set up to fight for greater supports for their children.  One mother told me that for a parent of a young child with special educational needs, everything is a fight and that she feels beaten down.  This is a direct consequence of the lack of inclusion policies the Minister's Government has presided over for the past four years.</p></speech>

The number will be in the region of 600.  As part of that conversation, I made a strong case for the need for special assistants  who would provide special assistance to children in the preschool years.  This would not necessarily follow an SNA-type model.</p>  <p>  Deputy Troy asked a number of questions which relate to other Departments.  My Department would not have that information.  In particular, those awaiting assessment would be a matter for the HSE.  Nonetheless, this group is doing its work.  It will look at how best to address these issues and how best to support children with special needs.  I wish to put it on the record of this House that I believe that had we had a proper system in respect of this area, the later necessity for much of the support in the primary school system would have been obviated and children of two to five years, and younger even, would be getting the special additional support they need.  Much of that, however, is beyond my remit in terms of speech and language therapy and other therapies.  </p></speech>

He should know, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with responsibility for early childhood care and education, how many children under the age of five have special educational needs.  The announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, on the increase in the number of special needs assistants for primary school is welcome, but what is the Minister doing for children in early education?  He is doing nothing.  He has established another interdepartmental group which will report at some time in the future.  He put forward an amendment to our committee a number of weeks ago which confirmed that between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, no one wanted to be the lead agency to pursue policy to ensure children with special needs would get additional supports.</p>  <p>  After four and a half years in office, there should be a national policy to support children with additional needs in the early needs sector, but there is not.  At best, it is disjointed and inconsistent and at worst there are no supports in certain areas.  Only yesterday I received a phone call from a constituent whose child was refused entry to a preschool.  If the preschool were to take the child, the parents would have to pay out of their own pockets for the special needs assistant.  Not only that, they were being asked to pay for the increase in public liability insurance as well, which is scandalous.  </p></speech>

He stands there pontificating from the far side of this Chamber about the scandalous state of the services his party left us to deal with.  He speaks of our lack of action when I have outlined clearly to him that serious action is being taken and that this group will report in September, which will be in time for the Estimates process.  He chooses to ignore that and goes off on a rant.  The bottom line, as everyone in this Chamber well knows, is that we were left with no money and a totally dysfunctional HSE when we arrived into Government.  A lot of progress has been made since then.  His party had 14 years in Government before that with unprecedented wealth to deal with this issue and one can only say it made a bags of it.</p></speech>

Tusla's accounts for 2014 show total expenditure of &euro;627 million.  In accordance with the establishing legislation for the agency, I will be laying its full 2014 accounts before both Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In 2015, Tusla has a total budget of &euro;643 million, which accounts for 63% of the Department's total Vote allocation and includes &euro;631 million in current funding and &euro;12 million in capital.  This represents an increase of &euro;34 million and is a 5.6% increase on the allocation to Tusla's in budget 2014.  This funding increase demonstrates that, despite the budgetary constraints, the Government remains strongly committed to delivering the critically important support and reforms needed to support Ireland&rsquo;s children and families.  This additional funding is helping drive key priorities in the reform of services and assists Tusla to deliver on its mandate from Government. </p>  <p>  Like all State agencies, Tusla has reviewed the scope to make savings across various areas of expenditure and to ensure that services are developed where possible.  It has identified areas where resources need to be provided and it has also identified areas where available funding can be used to better effect to support service delivery.  The key focus has been on ensuring that services are streamlined and rationalised where necessary, with any overlap in service provision and duplication of costs eliminated.  I have specified to Tusla that it should do everything to defend front-line services to children.  I am very supportive of the approach Tusla is adopting in terms of the reform of services, the targeting of funding at front-line services and the work being done in developing a new approach to the commissioning of services.</p></reply>

Our recent crisis in child protection, the lack of social workers and misappropriation of case files all point to a system that is not adequately funded.  If so, there are serious flaws in the system.  Changes in our child protection regime will take time and will require resources.  All children stakeholders and many of those working with children today will attest to an acute lack of resources for social work, mental health and family support and early intervention services for children in this State.  As stated recently by the ISPCC, the lack of a countrywide, funded, 24-hour social work service is a national scandal.  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that a child presenting with urgent child protection needs on a Friday afternoon will, in the vast majority of cases, have to wait three nights to have his or her case passed to a social worker, as outlined by the ISPCC?</p></speech>

Officials in my Department are working closely with the board and senior management of the agency to ensure the continued provision, within the significant resource provided, of high quality and responsive services to vulnerable children and families.  A key component of this engagement is associated with the 2016 Estimates process and it is to determine the resources required to ensure the agency can continue to provide and develop the important supports and services to children and young people.</p>  <p>  I take issue with the Deputy if she believes what happened in Laois-Offaly is purely a resource issue.  It certainly is not.  A number of issues have been identified there concerning how protocols were followed and the lack of uniformity in how reporting is carried out through the ranks.  There is no question or doubt but that there is further support required for social workers in terms of staffing levels, staff supports and IT.  All these matters are being addressed through a business case by Tusla, which will report shortly.</p>  <p>  On the issue itself, the chief operating officer, Mr. McBride, has taken personal control of the matter and was in the area regularly to offer support.  He brought in a team to address the backlog.  A similar operation has taken place in Louth and Meath.</p></speech>

These are children in acute need.  The ISPCC reports that in some parts of the country, a child in need must wait 18 months to see a psychologist.  This is not a picture of a well-resourced child protection and child welfare regime.</p>  <p>  Despite the resource constraints, Tusla has begun preparations for the Children First law but the professionals working with children, including my colleagues in the ISPCC, are more than a little frustrated over the lack of momentum in the D&aacute;il.  I refer again to my points made during my priority question alluding to the Children First Bill.  There is concern that the Bill will be passed but not enacted for some time due to the lack of resources being allocated to Tusla.  We believe Tusla should be sufficiently supported to cope with current demands and the extra workload likely to arise with the passing of the Bill.  Can the Minister guarantee sufficient resources will be provided?</p></speech>

They would not be left over the weekend.  If a child is at serious risk, the matter is dealt with.  If a teacher is worried about a child in the morning, a social worker will have arrived by the afternoon.  That is not to say there are not problems in the system and in respect of other priority cases at different levels of priority.  It is not to say there are not substantial numbers of children who have an unallocated social worker.  While Tusla is recruiting aggressively, this still remains an issue.  It is for the Estimates process to deal with this problem by having a proper business plan put together to help us address it.  Tusla received increased funding, as I pointed out in my initial answer, but there is no doubt that further resources will be required.  There is a real need for the reorganisation of some of our services, as previous questions indicated, so we will be able to spend the money in the places where we can get the outcomes we need and so we will look after those most at risk in the first instance.  However, I must remind the House that I am the Minister for all children and all youth affairs and that there is a broad remit involved, with many needs to be met and priorities to be recognised.</p></speech>

This high level of investment has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary circumstances that prevailed in recent years.</p>  <p>  The rate of 0.2% of GDP, quoted by the Deputy, only represents my Department's expenditure on the free preschool year provided under the early childhood care and education programme, amounting to &euro;175 million.  This figure does not include my Department's expenditure on the community child care subvention programme and the training and education child care programmes, which amounts to an additional &euro;70 million per year.</p>  <p>  Further, the OECD, in drawing international comparisons on public expenditure on early years services, adjusts for cross-national differences in the compulsory age of entry into primary school.  Therefore, for countries where children enter school at age five, such as Ireland, expenditure on early years services is adjusted by adding up the expenditure corresponding to children aged five who are enrolled in primary school.  When Ireland's expenditure is adjusted in this way, the OECD reports that Ireland actually spends 0.5% of GDP on early years services compared to the OECD average of 0.8% of GDP.</p>  <p>  I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in early years services to be more in line with the OECD average.  This will take time as the benefits of economic growth generate the required resources.  However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence and co-ordinated strategically so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children.  To this end, I established the interdepartmental group to develop a coherent whole-of-government approach to investment in early years and after school care and education.  This group will report shortly and will present the Government with costed options for increased investment in quality services over a period of years.</p></speech>

It will show that the early childhood and after school care and education system offers too little too late in a child's life to have any real impact.  Since the introduction of the early childhood care and education programme, child poverty has not decreased.  It has almost doubled, from 6.3% in 2008 to 11.7% in 2013, the year for which the most recent data are available.  A further 17.9% of children are at risk of property.  Children are 1.4 times more likely than adults to live in consistent poverty.  These are shocking figures to feature under the current Government's watch.  Even during a recession, governments have choices.  The choices made in one or two other countries in Europe have been to protect the most vulnerable but the Irish Government has failed to do that.  Irrespective of the Government's interdepartmental review, these issues must be dealt with very quickly and very seriously.</p></speech>

The early childhood care and education programme has helped considerably and there is a lot of evidence to support that.  However, there is a need for further assistance and support, and that is why the interdepartmental group is so important.  As with many steps taken in government, there is a need for cross-departmental involvement to achieve a coherent approach so we do not end up with silos of activity that sometimes do not complement one another.  I believe the report will be good.  It is currently in its final drafting stage and I hope to have it very soon.  It will add greatly to our ability to plan in a more complete way for meeting the needs of young children under the age of six.</p></speech>

At that stage, I believe approximately 70 people were awaiting scoliosis treatment in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  However, under the present Administration, 174 children are waiting for those services four years on from 2011.  In certain areas things have got worse for children and that money urgently needs to be put into early years services across the board. </p></speech>

Hitherto we have not had the resources to address this issue in any meaningful way, but the resources are becoming available.  I am not saying we can cure this problem overnight.  It is very hard to undo a situation that grew up over many years.  I will not get into political point scoring about the state of the country's finances, but we have to be realistic.  Many different things need to be done, not just with children, but in the health services, in education infrastructure and many other areas.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I believe in children being the future of our nation.  I believe in their right to a present, not just a future, that should be safe.  It is a priority for me that they can learn to their fullest ability and feel connected and respected.  Across Government we need to examine further how to address the issues of child poverty in a way that will address it completely and in a fashion that is sustainable.</p></speech>

That process involves states submitting periodic reports to the committee and appearing before it for the purposes of discussing the report submitted.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s most recent attendance before the committee was in 2006 and its most recent consolidated third and fourth report was submitted to the committee in July 2013.  Ireland is scheduled to appear before the committee again in January 2016.  While the actual meeting date has yet to be notified, it will occur between 11 and 29 January.</p>  <p>  Before meeting individual state parties, the committee receives reports from, and meets, civil society interests and national rights monitoring bodies.  These contacts inform the identification of issues the committee intends to discuss with the state party concerned.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case the committee met such interested parties, including a meeting with young people as facilitated by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, last month.</p>  <p>  To my Department's knowledge, the committee also received three parallel reports, from the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, from young people with the support of the alliance and from the Ombudsman for Children.  The information gained from these sources has culminated in the recent receipt of a list of issues from the committee, regarding the combined third and fourth report of Ireland, to which the committee is seeking a written response by 15 October 2015.  The committee has made clear that the list of issues is not intended to be exhaustive and it should not be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing the type and range of questions which members of the committee might wish to pose in January.</p>  <p>  Given the breadth of the UN Convention, the committee&rsquo;s scope of interest is very extensive and essentially covers the responsibilities and activities of most, if not all, Departments and many State agencies.  Consequently, engagement with the committee involves a very considerable exercise of cross-government liaison and consultation around issues that are relevant to particular Departments or to a number of Departments.  The co-ordination work is the responsibility of my Department.  In that regard, it has established liaison arrangements with all Departments to process issues identified in the run-up to meeting the committee on which input from the individual Departments would be required.  The current position is that my Department is preparing to communicate shortly with other Departments on the contents of the list of issues recently received from the committee.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade liaises closely with my Department to facilitate communications to and from the committee.</p></speech>

On 28 June, 1,122 children were in emergency accommodation.  I represent dozens of families in that situation, as would the Minister and other Deputies present today.  We know from meeting the children of homeless families that they are often very insecure and sometimes distressed.  They are unable to get easily to school, to recreation and to other basic facilities.  As the Minister will be aware from his constituency, living in hotels and guesthouses often makes it very difficult to have an ordinary child's life.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the parallel reports.  Two of the organisations, including the Children's Rights Alliance, are focusing on the impact of homelessness on children.  Along with some of my staff, I recently met Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, to discuss the impact of homelessness on children.  His report states, "The State must address delays in the provision of social housing and ensure that emergency housing support provided to families who are experiencing homelessness is appropriate to children&rsquo;s needs."</p></speech>

The Government's homeless policy statement was published on 21 February 2013 and makes explicit the Government's commitment to a housing-led approach to end long-term involuntary homelessness by the end of 2016.  Significant measures are being taken, under the Dublin region homeless pilot scheme, including the homeless assistance payment, the Department of Social Protection's tenancy sustainment protocol and the purchase of NAMA properties.  There are also a range of other measures relating to the allocation of local authority tenancies.  Under these measures, key local authorities are required to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control.  The four Dublin local authorities have been directed to allocate 50% of available dwellings to this cohort, while the local authorities in Counties Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have been directed to allocate 30%.  It is expected that as a result of this initiative at least 500 homes will be provided to prioritised households in the Dublin region, with a similar total for the other areas combined.  These measures were identified in the Government's implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness in May 2014 and the action plan to address homelessness last December.</p></speech>

Measures have been put in place to cut its data collection role and its funding.  Bearing in mind that 80% of victims of sexual violence and rape do not contact a State body, how does the Minister envisage that Tusla, a new organisation, will be able to fulfil the role the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland has had for 40 years?</p></reply>

It seeks to address any identified gaps in services, avoid duplication and support effective delivery.  It is in this context that Tusla has decided to cease funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, and to take direct responsibility for the development and maintenance of a database of information recorded on behalf of the rape crisis centres.  Tusla will create a comprehensive national dataset, including information from all funded sexual violence services.</p>  <p>  Tusla was concerned that the existing database did not capture information from all 16 rape crisis centres, as only 11 centres are affiliated to the network.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs access to complete and reliable information, and it did not always have timely access to the data collected by RCNI.  Consequently, Tusla decided to establish a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  I am very mindful of the importance of comprehensive and timely national data for planning the delivery of these services and evaluating outcomes.  I have raised with Tusla the need for an improvement in the quality of data as a priority for 2015.  I support Tusla&rsquo;s efforts to address shortfalls in this area.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Tusla is funding 60 non-statutory specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services, including 44 domestic violence services and 16 sexual violence and rape crisis services.  These will provide information to Tusla on the services they provide, including those provided to survivors of sexual violence.  This information is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure we provide the best possible response to survivors of sexual violence.  I want to emphasise that in my discussions this year with Tusla I asked that particular priority be given to protecting front-line services.  In this context, I am pleased that funding for the 16 rape crisis centres nationwide, which provide services directly to rape survivors, has been protected in 2015, with funding of almost &euro;4 million allocated to them.</p></speech>

Rape Crisis Network Ireland has been doing this work for 40 years.  It has been an advocate and an independent voice for rape victims from a time when the State did not care about rape victims, when there were mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries and control over women was in full swing in this country.  Now Tusla has cut core funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland, using the excuse that its data collection was not of the requisite standard.  Its data collection is considered groundbreaking and a model of best practice by the European Institute for Gender Equality.  The excuse is that funding will be maintained for the front line.  If funds are cut, rape crisis centres will have to close.  It is not for the Minister to decide about the autonomy and independence of an organisation that has been doing this work, and for him to tell it where to put its money and where to take it out.  He has employed eight new people but he has cut the funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  Why is he doing so?</p></speech>

I am not instructing anybody or interfering in with Rape Crisis Network Ireland regarding how it spends its money or what it does with itself.  That is its business.  What is the business of a Minister and an agency representing the needs of those who have been victims of sexual or domestic violence is to ensure they have a front-line service.  In her question the Deputy asserted that front-line services would close.  They will not close, because they have been given the funding to stay open.  Their funding has been protected.  Funding has been removed from an element of RCNI relating to data collection.  This is clearly very much incomplete, when only 11 of 16 rape crisis centres are affiliated to it.  Those I remember straight off which are not affiliated to it are the centres in Dublin and Galway, which are two of the biggest.  The decision of Tusla's board is correct.  One would love, in an ideal world, to have the money to do everything, but one does not, and therefore choices must be made.  When it comes to a choice between a front-line service and a data collection service I will stay with the front-line service, particularly if I am assured by the board of Tusla and its management that it can do the data collection itself in a more complete and efficient fashion.</p></speech>

That is four out of five rape victims.  They will not go to Tusla, but they will contact rape crisis centres, at least on the phone.  The information being gathered by Rape Crisis Network Ireland is very important.  In Ireland, one in five girls will be sexually abused over their lifetimes, as well as one in six boys.  One in ten women will be raped in their lifetimes.  This is how the Minister is treating women in this country.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland has much more experience of dealing with this than Tusla.  Tusla is a child agency, by the way, and it is not equipped to deal with sexual violence.  The Minister should just admit this is a cut.  Tusla cannot do what Rape Crisis Network Ireland has done.  The Minister is interfering by telling it to manage with less and keep its front-line services open.  Front-line services need back-up and independent information.  Of course rape crisis centres will close.  When refuges for victims of domestic violence closed last year, the Minister did not care and councils had to step in.  The Minister said he expects centres to remain open even though their funding has been cut, but he has employed people in a new quango.  First we had the HSE and now we have a sub-quango of the HSE being used to cut funding to rape crisis centres and women.</p></speech>

The Adoption Act 2010 provides for intercountry adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Currently, adoptions are taking place with countries that have ratified the convention, having agreed to adhere to the standards of the convention.  The Russian Federation has not ratified the convention and therefore a bilateral agreement involving both governments is necessary.  This make the process of agreeing an intercountry adoption system much more difficult and time-consuming.  Efforts have been ongoing on a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation for a number of years.  There has been a number of meetings with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and a delegation from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation regarding a draft bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation.  The Office of the Attorney General has also provided advice to the Department on the draft agreement.</p>  <p>  I know there are difficulties for parents.  The Russian authorities have sought assurances about post-adoption reporting that raise legal difficulties for Ireland.  In this context, the Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and, once adopted in Ireland, the child is treated as if he or she is the natural child of the adoptive parents.  People in this House would agree with that process.  This means there is limited scope for the State to intervene in a family when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised.  In these instances, the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with legal or other commitments to provide post-placement reports given by Irish families to the Russian authorities.  This and a number of additional issues require further clarification, which must be addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.  Efforts are ongoing in my Department in progressing this work and I will do everything possible to advance this matter.  However, the difficulties raised by the issues outstanding should not be underestimated.  I will keep continued contact with the Russian Irish Adoption Group to keep the group informed of developments.</p></speech>

It remains the case that thousands of children remain in Russia in questionable care who could greatly benefit from a second chance in life.  There are certainly hundreds of parents in Ireland who are willing to give a child a second chance in life with a loving home.  Everything must be done to make this a reality.  There is a concern that this is not a priority of the Minister or his Department.</p>  <p>  The Russian Irish Adoption Group has held extensive consultations with the Irish Embassy in Russia and the Russian Embassy here but every time, there seems to be a different excuse.  A previous excuse was a concern relating to the equality referendum, despite the fact that marriage equality is in place in France and there is a bilateral agreement between France and Russia.  We have been told today that post-adoption reporting is being requested.  When was that request made?  When was the last time the Minister engaged with his Russian counterpart?  The Minister stated that he will continue consultation with the Russian Irish Adoption Group but will he give a commitment on that today?  A representative of the group was recently on the "This Week" programme on RTE indicating that the Minister had failed to meet the group.  Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that he will meet the group and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to iron out what outstanding issues need to be resolved in order to progress this?  Will the Minister confirm this is a priority?</p></speech>

The bottom line, as the Deputy knows, is the issue with Russia has been ongoing since at least 2008 and, subsequent to the Adoption Act 2010, these discussions have been predicated on Ireland's legislative requirement for a bilateral agreement, as I stated earlier, on intercountry adoption with non-Hague Convention countries.  However, recent indications are that the Russian authorities are seeking bilateral agreements with all countries where adoptions take place from Russia.  Those authorities have just ratified one with Spain.  Our constitutional elements relating to the family and the Russian requirement for post-adoption reporting are immutable issues that do not seem to be resolvable.</p>  <p>  There is no reluctance on our part in this process and I will do everything in my power to move this forward.  I want what is best for children and to facilitate what is best for them, no matter what nation they come from.  I am particularly aware of families that already have a Russian adopted child and would love to have a sibling of the same nationality.  I fully support such a concept and wish but I am bound by law and the Attorney General's advice.  I can only negotiate so far with the Russians.</p></speech>

When did the Minister last meet representatives of the Russian Irish Adoption Group?  If he has no problem with further consultation, will he confirm that he will meet the group, along with the Adoption Authority of Ireland, to hammer out the outstanding issues?  Is it possible to resolve those issues?  If that is not possible, the group just wants to know the truth.  They have been in limbo, which has caused unnecessary anxiety for the past number of years.  The Minister should be truthful for the group.  Will he confirm today whether the process can be advanced?  Will he meet the group and the Adoption Authority of Ireland and tell them how this stands?</p></speech>

It is a negotiation.  We have explained our difficulty under the Constitution and they have a certain requirement.  The nature of negotiation means that other issues may be identified that could help get around the requirement or some other means could be found.  That is not the current state of play.  I have no problem confirming that we will continue to try this and negotiate with the Russian people.  As long as they remain in this rock-hard place and it goes against another rock-hard issue - our Constitution - there can be no movement.  That is as honest as I can be.</p></speech>

Yesterday evening we had quite a wide-ranging debate.  Much of it went well beyond the amendment, but it was closely related to housing issues and regeneration.  It is unfortunate that some Deputies are taking a cynical view of the Government's efforts with regard to the social housing strategy and the Construction 2020 strategy, of which this Bill is very much a part.  Some Deputies have outlined their views on the lack of social housing in local authority areas, but it would be nice to see some acknowledgement of the efforts made to see local authorities getting back into direct building and provision of social housing for the first time in many years.  As I have said on many occasions, the allocations announced a few months ago were mainly for shovel-ready projects that local authorities have prioritised to the Department.  There will be further allocations to local authorities shortly.  These are ambitious targets and there is a challenge for local authorities to respond.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ellis said the local authority does not have the money.  Over 2,000 voids have been turned back into beneficial use in the past year and we expect another 1,000 to be put back into beneficial use in the coming year.  That is progress.  It is still not enough, but it is strong progress from where we were.  That has happened because additional funds have been provided to local authorities to turn these vacant and void units back into use.  As I said already, the allocation for direct build has been notified to local authorities, many of which are getting them under way.  Tendering for contractors has to go through the process.  Some of them must go through Part VIII of the planning process, which is as it should be, but I expect to see much more activity with regard to the direct provision of housing, as do local authorities.  However, that is not enough, as has been acknowledged.  Despite some objections to the involvement of the private sector, we simply will not meet the demand unless we have strong involvement by the private sector and we are relying on it, to a large degree, because of the legacy of lack of investment in social housing over the last few years.  There is an interim period in which we must do everything in our power to stimulate activity in construction, refurbishment and regeneration to provide housing units, especially in areas of high demand.  That is essentially what this Bill is about.</p>  <p>  The amendment itself refers to exempting or excluding lands owned by local authorities and housing bodies or housing authorities.  We oppose these amendments as they propose to amend section 4 to provide that land owned by a local authority or housing body would be exempted from the application of the vacant site levy on residential or regeneration land.  To remind Deputies, the vacant site levy is being introduced to stimulate activity on sites of high potential that are already serviced by public services in areas of high demand for housing.  Strict criteria are laid down in this Bill.  Sites cannot be designated willy-nilly based on the feelings of councillors.  It must be shown and proven that there is a strong demand for housing in that area.  These sites will have to go through a process.</p>  <p> The Government amendment introduced on Committee Stage means that all residential or regeneration land, regardless of whether it is owned publicly or privately, will be subject to the levy if it meets the criteria for a vacant site, as provided for in section 5 of the Bill.  This will ensure that all owners of vacant sites will be treated equally.  For example, local authorities will have the same responsibilities under this legislation as private landowners.  It will also encourage local authorities that may be in possession of suitable sites for the provision of housing to develop those sites.  I think it was Deputy Stanley who said in the D&aacute;il yesterday that the local authorities did not have these sites and if they had them, they would be developed.  If they do not, they have nothing to worry about.  If they have sites of high potential and, as Deputies rightly outlined, they may not have had the resources to develop them in the past, this Bill will give powers to local authorities to put any revenues they collect as a result of the vacant site levy back into regenerating sites or the general improvement of public services and amenities in a particular area.</p>  <p>  The Bill gives additional powers to local authorities, which essentially constitute housing authorities.  They are closer to the electorate.  They know their areas inside out and it is their responsibility to draw up development plans that are sustainable.  I see no reason for local authorities being exempted.  It would help to focus the minds of officials and elected representatives to ensure that any landbanks or sites with potential are brought back into beneficial use as soon as possible.  In this regard, I have considered and reflected on the comments and contributions of Deputies on Second Stage.  The removal of the exemption will allow for the application of the vacant site levy in a fair and equitable manner to all owners of vacant sites, public or private.  Just having a vacant site on the register, whether it is local authority-owned or otherwise, brings renewed focus on that site and it will initiate renewed discussions and debate on the potential of those sites.</p>  <p>  We must also consider the community view.  It does not matter to members of the public whether a vacant site is publicly or privately owned.  They just see the vacant site, which could be used for housing.  They may see it as an eyesore, impacting negatively on the urban area in which they live, and it is obviously in need of regeneration. In those scenarios, the community wants those sites brought back into beneficial use.</p>  <p>  In recent discussions, much has been made of the fact that this may mean the local authority system will be levying itself.  Some Deputies ask critically how a local authority will levy itself.  Such situations already arise, as I outlined on Committee Stage, through the local authority rating system in situations where buildings or assets owned by one local authority are located in the area of another and there are clear, effective arrangements in place to deal with this.  It is more important that the process of identifying vacant sites is established on a fair and transparent basis and that, whoever owns the site, pressure is brought to bear on getting such key lands into beneficial use at a time of profound housing needs, as had been identified by Deputies.</p></speech>

We cut the housing budget.  That is reason the voids built up.  There would have been a natural flow.</p>  <p>  In terms of the amendment, does the Minister of State realise there are in-fill sites, some of which are large, all over Dublin?  We also have areas that could be identified and counted as derelict or vacant sites and we have parks, which are not official parks but places where children play.  Are we to start levying those?  We also have regeneration sites, such as O'Devaney Gardens.  In Ballymun, the regeneration has left a large number of sites.  Are we to start levying those?  There would be a rush to sell them off.  That is what will happen.  There will be a drive towards privatisation instead of building more social housing on these areas which is what is required.</p></speech>

It is because the crisis we face is so serious and is set to get worse unless radical action is taken.</p>  <p>  The point I made and, as far as I am concerned, the point of this amendment is that if the local authorities are forced to levy themselves because they have not developed a particular site for social housing purposes, because they do not have the funding and they are not guaranteed the funding to develop that site from central government, they will have no choice - there will be at least significant pressure - but to sell that site or enter into public private partnerships, effectively privatising it or requiring some significant trade-off where public land is given over to private developers.  That is back-door pressure for privatisation and it is the wrong way to go.</p>  <p>  I might be a little less anxious about this levy if the Minister of State stated that if a local authority came forward with a plan to develop any of its land, no matter how big those plans are and no matter how many of them there are, the Government would guarantee that the local authority would get the funding to develop those sites.  For example, in my area there are 5,000 applicants on the housing list and if D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown came forward next year and stated it would build 5,000 houses on the land it has available, the Minister of State would give it the funding.  However, in the absence of such a guarantee, which I do not believe the Minister of State will give, this is, at best, tokenism and, at worse, a pressure to privatise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800012#K00500"><p>Most staff in local authorities are closer to the problems on the ground than we are and they are probably more susceptible to the pressures coming from those looking for housing.  Therefore, the idea that local authorities would not want to build on land that they might have available for housing seems a strange one.  I would have imagined that the only reason local authorities would not be building on land that they had would be that they cannot get the funding to do it.  If a local authority had development land, the Minister made funding available to it to build housing and the local authority refused to do so, I would penalise the local authority.  However, I do not know how one can penalise a local authority which has development land and would like to build housing on it, but the Minister will not give it the funding to do so.  The local authority is dependent on central funding to do it.  We probably have one of the worst structures of local government in Europe.  A local authority here has access on average to one fifth of the funding available to a local authority in Europe.  Our local authorities have been so watered down over the years that they are not really local authorities anymore, but merely administrators for central government.  I do not see the logic of penalising the local authority for not building on land where the Minister will not give it the funding to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800012#K00600"><p>Deputy Ellis stated that no funding has been allocated for homelessness in Dublin.  I want to make it clear that there is a 20% increase in the allocation of funds to address homelessness for Dublin.  In 2015, an allocation of &euro;37.16 million was provided.  What is identified in the projections of Dublin City Council is that increased funding will be required.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I have not stated that funding will not be provided.  Our officials are engaged with Dublin City Council to ensure that adequate resources are provided.  I reassure the Deputy that is a priority for Government.  It is not fair to say that the Government is not providing funding for homelessness.  In fact, we have provided 20% more, both nationally and in Dublin, for homelessness services and the provision of units than we did last year.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked if any local authority comes forward with any land whether it would be funded.  The Department wrote to the local authorities seeking their lists of priorities.  We must look for value for money and we must build where there is a demand.  There is no point in having an open-chequebook approach.  We saw where that got us in the past, building houses for the sake of building houses.  We are using data analysis from the likes of the Housing Agency to inform us where is the demand.  Obviously, the main urban areas are where the biggest demand arises and that is where the priority funding is going.  If local authorities come forward with ten or 12 projects and the top four or five are shovel-ready, they will be prioritised.  That is the way it is happening.  We have already prioritised shovel-ready projects.  The next ones we are prioritising are those in the planning system under Part VIII.  We will continue to roll out allocations as local authorities come to us with their priorities, and we are encouraging local authorities to be as ambitious as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I have ring-fenced as much funding as we could in the first year for an ambitious social housing strategy and I assure the Deputy that we want to see the delivery of that as much as anybody else.</p>  <p>  There should be a fair and level playing field for sites of high potential irrespective of who owns them.  We want them brought back into beneficial use.  It is logical.  These are value for money and they will regenerate communities and urban areas for the benefit of citizens who wish to live there.  I am opposing these amendments.</p></speech>

It is taking a long time and the situation is getting worse.  There is chaos at present.  The amount of people being reported as homeless is crazy at this stage.</p>  <p>  The amendment is straightforward.  It identifies a problem and the Minister of State should accept it.  The local authorities should not be penalised.  Certainly, they will not get the funding.  It is quite obvious that if sites are identified, the local authorities will end up being penalised.  That is money they cannot afford to hand out.</p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to consider the amendment.  He knows, as he has dealt with local authorities over the years, that we have had lots of problems with local authority land, whether in-fills, regeneration or PPPs.  This will drive the local authorities to sell off land.  That would be a disaster because we need to target properly that land for social housing, which is the big issue here.</p></speech>

My amendment proposes the deletion of section 5(1)(a)(i) of the Bill, which defines such a site as one &quot;situated in an area in which there is a need for housing&quot;.  One could say there is a need for housing in many places.  I believe a clearer definition is needed.  I support some of the other amendments in this group, including those tabled by Deputy Wallace which refer to &quot;an area of the site greater than 0.05 hectares&quot;.  That seems fair enough.  As I have said previously, many in-fill sites could end up being identified.  It could be suggested that there is a need for housing in several in-fill sites, including areas between two houses.  Places that people have used as parks for many years could be identified.  The definition needs to be much clearer.  A great deal of regeneration land has been identified.  Some of it is fairly small in size.  There are pockets of such land all over the place.  Following the regeneration of Ballymun, there are pockets of land throughout Ballymun that could be utilised under some of the definitions that have been proposed.  I support Deputy Wallace and I hope people will support my amendment.</p></speech>

It has reduced it from 0.1 ha to 0.05 ha.  This is a positive move because it is going to catch many in-fill sites that could have fallen out of the net.  I am afraid I have left my notes on these amendments behind me.  I am at a bit of a loss.  I will leave it for the moment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800014#M01100"><p>I am opposing amendment No. 4, which proposes the removal of the requirement for a vacant site on residential land to be "in an area in which there is a need for housing".  This proposal would weaken the criteria to be used by a planning authority when determining whether a site is a vacant site in the case of such land.  Amendment No. 5 proposes the removal of the requirement for a vacant site on residential land to be "suitable for the provision of housing".  Amendment No. 8 proposes the removal of the requirement that a vacant site, by virtue of "being vacant or idle has adverse effects on existing amenities or reduces the amenity [and] character of the area".  I am opposing amendments Nos 5 and 8 for the same reason that I am opposing amendment No. 4.  These proposals would weaken the criteria to be used in determining whether a site is a vacant site in the case of residential or regeneration land.  The criteria in section 5 set out the principles and policies underpinning the terms "residential" and "regeneration" land.  The proposed amendments would remove essential elements of the criteria to be applied in determining what is and is not a vacant site.  In the absence of such criteria, there is no justification for designating which sites in residential and regeneration land should be targeted for the application of the levy.  This is an important point.</p><p>These are important justifications that underpin the vacant site levy measure in order to incentivise the development of suitable vacant sites in central urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes.  The legislation is lacking without them.</p> <p> The purpose of the criteria outlined in the Bill in this regard is to focus on the appropriate range of sites to be potentially subject to the levy with a view to strengthening the public interest and common good justification of the levy.  That point should be emphasised.  It is not appropriate that any site should be designated a vacant site with a levy applying to it.  We are trying to approach this in a targeted way in areas of high demand, mainly urban areas that have strong housing demand and where there are obvious vacant sites in the hearts of those towns and cities.  I reiterate the logic behind this.  Why would we spend vast amounts of public expenditure on developing new infrastructure on greenfield sites when there are already sites available that are serviced by public infrastructure paid for by the taxpayer?  In fact, it would bring regeneration and renewed footfall to the centres of our towns and cities.  These criteria underpin the Bill and give teeth to the local authorities to categorise, identify and, following due process, designate a vacant site.  I oppose the amendments on that basis.</p> <p> We also oppose amendments Nos. 6 and 7.  Section 5(1)(a)(iii) and (b)(i) provide that one element of the criteria used by a planning authority, both in respect of housing land and regeneration land, to determine if a site is vacant is that the site or the majority of the site is vacant or idle.  The amendment proposes to change this so an area of any site greater than 0.05 hectare must be vacant.  The proposed amendment lacks clarity and confuses the criteria of the area of a site that must be vacant, which is not welcome in this instance.  The wording of the Bill is straightforward, clear and easily understood, and there is no need to amend it.  I therefore oppose the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800015#N00200"><p>I would be interested to hear more from the Deputies who tabled these amendments about the logic of them.  Setting aside the debate we just had about the imposition of this levy on local authorities, with which we disagree with for all of the reasons already discussed, the levy is not a bad idea.  The conditions the Minister has attached to it are reasonable, although open to interpretation.  Is there any area of the country that does not have a need for social housing at present?  I cannot think of any.  Perhaps there is.  Certainly, in all of the urban centres there are ridiculously long waiting lists, of 18 years and rising in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Is there anywhere in the country where there is no waiting list?  If that is the case, people would flock there from Dublin.  While it is reasonable to be targeted, I do not fully understand some of the conditions the Minister has attached to it.  However, the basic principle is not a bad one.</p>  <p>  An issue I wish to raise in the context of this group of amendments is one we discussed on Committee Stage.  I did not submit an amendment because I am not sure how to go about it, but I raised it on that Stage and wish to raise it again.  The Government has the resources to examine it and perhaps come forward with a proposal, even in the Seanad.  The issue is privately owned dwellings that are empty.  Quite correctly, the Minister has excluded private homes which are usually inhabited by the owners of those homes.  That is entirely reasonable.  Any measure we would wish to take would have to ensure that we do not end up seizing the homes of ordinary people.  However, in other parts of Europe where a house is privately owned, is not inhabited for long periods of time and is just sitting empty, there are measures in place to take those properties and give them to people who need social housing.  There should be a provision in this Bill to focus on this as well.</p>  <p>  We are not talking about sites suitable for the development of housing, but physical houses that are sitting empty for whatever reason and into which people could move.  There would have to be a series of criteria around it so one does not end up unfairly targeting people who might have a legitimate reason for not inhabiting their house for periods of time.  None the less, it would target the real phenomenon of houses simply sitting empty for years when people could be living in them.  We need a provision in that area.  Perhaps the Minister would address that and let us know if he intends to bring forward some type of amendment in that regard in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I believe it is unnecessary.  We have seen what the local authorities determine to be a vacant site.  That definition has been in place for a long time, rather than simply referring to a site in an area that is in need of housing.  There are many such sites in areas that are in need of housing, including in my constituency.  That does not mean all of them should have a levy imposed on them or that they could be defined as a vacant site which the local authority must utilise or they end up with a levy as a result.  It is unnecessary to state this.  The definition of a vacant site as defined by the local authorities is far clearer.</p>  <p>  With regard to putting forward a figure, 0.05 of a hectare would amount to approximately three normal sized houses.  Deputy Wallace can correct me on this but I estimate it is three normal sized houses in terms of definition.  That is a far more sensible way of going about it.</p></speech>

One could not expect the owners to be liable for a levy in the event of it not being zoned appropriately or for them to pay a levy thereafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800015#N00500"><p>Regarding the size of a site, one could put 20 apartments on a 0.05 hectare site without a problem.  I am sorry I do not have 20 minutes on this.  I could not tell what the issues were with the repeated use of the word "delete" in the amendments.  My points were dealt with in amendment No. 5.  One is the provision that the site be suitable for the provision of housing.  If this land has been purchased and has been land-banked, if it is not suitable for housing the purchaser should get rid of it and sell it.  However, he should be paying tax on it if he is holding it as land that is zoned for development.  It is banking and it should be taxed.</p><p>The idea that a site should not be taxed because it is not suitable for housing is nonsensical.  I do not understand the Government's approach to this issue because, as far as I am concerned, these are investors who have established land banks.  Although the site may not be suitable for housing for five or even ten years, the investor is engaging in what I described on Committee Stage as shadow land-banking, which is a more long-term process than normal land-banking.  The Government should deal with both practices. </p> <p> In 2002 and 2003, I bought land from an investor who had purchased it in the late 1980s.  My God, did he make serious money on that sale, yet he did not have to pay tax on the site throughout the period in question.  The Government is allowing this practice to continue in this Bill. </p> <p> On the issue of whether the majority of a site is idle, we could argue until the cows come home about the degree to which a site is idle.  It does not make sense that owners of land zoned for development who are not building on their sites and may be doing something else with them while they wait for the value of their investments to rise are not required to pay a levy on their sites.  This legislation should catch the owners of land banks and ensure there are no loopholes available to them.  The Bill is riddled with loopholes and will not catch 20% of those who are engaged in land-banking.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for due process and identifies clear criteria for designating a site as vacant.  The statutory responsibility for this process lies with local authorities, which, as Deputy Wallace noted, are best placed to understand their respective local areas, development plans and housing needs.  A number of factors must be taken into account in determining housing need, the first of which is the local housing list.  While Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that there is a demand for housing throughout the country, demand varies and is much stronger in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford than in smaller towns and villages.  We do not want to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  For this reason, we are providing flexibility and setting out clear criteria for allowing the designation of sites in areas where strong demand exists.  I want to avoid circumstances in which small towns and villages with vacant sites and weak housing demand are excessively burdened with levies.  These areas need to regenerate themselves and demand needs to be allowed to build.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides local authorities with the flexibility to prioritise areas where they wish to designate sites and apply the levy to focus minds on regenerating these sites.  Without these criteria and the clarity provided, this legislation and the powers of local authorities would not be as effective as they should be.  I will oppose the amendments on that basis. </p>  <p>  With regard to site size, I listened to the arguments made by Deputy Wallace and other Deputies on this issue on Second and Committee Stages.  Deputies have generally welcomed the decision to decrease the size at which a site may be designated as vacant from the previous threshold of 0.1 ha to allow smaller vacant sites in urban areas which are unsightly or a blight on the streetscape to be designated, subject to due process.  I will oppose the amendments for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>

These are families who have benefited least from the current low interest rate environment across Europe.  Their mortgage interest rates have steadily increased while those of others have fallen.  The response has been totally inadequate.  We are talking about very substantial amounts of money for the families concerned.  Someone on &euro;200,000 mortgage over 20 years is paying over &euro;992 more than somebody starting a new mortgage or nearly &euro;4,000 more than someone with an average European mortgage.  It is unacceptable and they have borne the brunt for far too long.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said last April: "From any moral point of view, from any ethical point of view, when banks are now restructured and on their way to making profit again, it is just not acceptable that when they themselves can borrow at much cheaper rates, that they continue to have higher rates applied to mortgage holders."  However, nothing has happened since then.  The Taoiseach said last week: "We have a budget coming up in October.  There are opportunities for the Minister to deal with the banks if that is the case and if that is necessary."  Yesterday evening, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in Brussels that the banks have moved.  He had the incredible nerve to suggest that the banks have moved on this issue, but they have not moved at all with any conviction in regard to standard variable mortgage rates.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800017#Q00900"><p>We have put legislation before the House this week.  It is constructive legislation which would give the Central Bank the capacity to intervene for those 300,000 mortgage holders and also for the 46,000 mortgage holders who are at the mercy of vulture funds.  Will the Taoiseach accept our legislation and move on from Second Stage to Committee Stage, given that the Minister of State, Deputy English, said that he agreed with the purpose and the objective of the Bill, or is it the case that the Taoiseach has given up on standard variable rate mortgage holders altogether?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800017#Q01000"><p>No, I have not given up at all on standard variable mortgage interest rates.  I stand by the point of view I expressed earlier that, from any moral point of view, where banks are able to borrow at much lower rates now that they have been restructured, and restructured in the interests of the people and not for the banks' facilities, that they should bear that in mind in terms of the lending rates they allow for their customers.</p>  <p>  It is not true to say that banks have not moved at all; there has been some movement from the banks.  The Deputy is well aware that the Minister met all the banks and they were to respond by 1 July.  Some have made some movement about having fixed rates of interest, others have made some moves about cash-back for customers, there has been a reduction in interest rates, admittedly by a small amount, in respect of some others, and some new products and new facilities have been made available.  That, however, does not deal with the difficulty that hard-pressed families have every week and every month in trying to meet what are much higher interest rates applicable here to variable mortgages than apply elsewhere.  </p>  <p>  In respect of legislation, I said that legislation would be introduced if the Central Bank required it; if the Central Bank requested legislation to be able to deal with this, then the Government would respond to that request.  The Central Bank has said that it does not require legislation of this nature.  The position is that the Minister has received a report form the Governor of the Central Bank.  The officials in the Department of Finance are now looking at the outcome of the meetings the Minister had with all the banks and their deadline of 1 July and there will be a follow-up meeting with all the banks prior to the budget in October.  I have already said to the Deputy that the option remains for the Minister for Finance, in the absence of any real movement from the banks, to take further action in the budget in October and he has already put that on the public record.  Far from removing ourselves from the 300,000 people who are paying excessive variable mortgage interest rates, the pressure is still on here.</p></speech>

The pressure is off.  The Taoiseach or someone leaked the European Commission report yesterday to coincide with the Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill, saying that the EU is now stating that we cannot interfere and should not interfere, and the Central Bank says we should not interfere.  What about the role of the Government to ensure that the Central Bank fulfils its obligation in regard to consumer protection?  What is happening to those 300,000 families is unjust.  The July deadline has passed and the banks have not moved in any substantive way on the standard variable rate mortgage interest issue, and no one can deny that they have not moved.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said yesterday evening that the option of legislation is still open.  The Taoiseach is saying this morning that it is not open because the Central Bank has said it is not open.  The Government does not want to initiate any legislation in this regard.</p></speech>

Despite the Minister of State, Deputy English, saying that he accepted the principle of it, the Taoiseach intends to vote it down this evening.  He will continue to pretend to the thousands of families affected that we mean to do something, that we gave the banks this deadline and, as he said, that officials are now looking at the outcome of meetings.

The Taoiseach has moaned and groaned about that, but he has done nothing about it.</p>  <p>  Last month, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward the Central Bank (Mortgage Interest Rates) Bill 2015, which would have given the Central Bank the power to cap mortgage interest rates from banks that had been bailed out by public money.  The Taoiseach's Government voted down that Bill.  The Taoiseach has done something about it.  He has favoured the banks again against the interests of those struggling householders and he has disguised this compliance with his usual bluster and raim&eacute;is.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach said that 300,000 households paying variable mortgage rates above the rates at which the banks are borrowing is not a morally justifiable position.  That was before the draft European Commission report acknowledged that interest rates here are high while at the same time recommending a hands-on approach to the banks.  Therein lies the reason for the Taoiseach's refusal to act on this morally unjustifiable position.  He always does what the elite tell him to do.  Will he stand up for the rights of Irish citizens?  No.  Will he stand up against the big boys in Brussels?  No.  I have a wee test for the Taoiseach.  He should cut out the bluster, the convoluted, boring narrative, and the excuses, and reject the morally unjustifiable recommendations of the Commission.  He should give the Central Bank the power to cap mortgage rates in banks that have been bailed out with public moneys, and he should stand up for Irish mortgage holders.</p></speech>

They are being ripped off by the banks, and the Taoiseach's Government has stood by while the problem has escalated.  The Taoiseach does act in the interest of the elite.  His response to every issue of importance to ordinary citizens is that he is powerless to take action, yet just last week he rewarded former Taoisigh and Ministers with big hikes in their pensions while he slashed payments to lone-parent families.  Whose side is the Taoiseach on?  I know what side Sinn F&eacute;in is on.  We are on the side of citizens.</p></speech>

This means they could live at home if provided with adequate home care.</p>  <p>  The proportion of the elderly population in Ireland living in long-term nursing homes is higher than the European average.  Many are in these homes because of the inadequacy of home care services here and the supports which the State offers.  We are all in favour of older people living at home and within their communities, as they age, for as long as possible.  However, negative developments such as the cuts to home care packages and reductions in housing adaptation grants for the disabled and the elderly are preventing this.  Since 2009, more than 1.75 million hours have been cut from the vital and crucial home help service.  This has had a devastating affect on home care services and resulted in many people moving prematurely into long-term residential care.  </p>  <p>  While the programme for Government, the HSE service plan and the national positive aging strategy all offer nominal support for the general idea of older people aging at home, the financial means of achieving this have not been, for the most part, provided.  There is a great deal of lip-service, to say the least, and grand aspirations that have fallen short of the targets.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800019#S05900"><p>I thank Deputy Fleming.  The Deputy will be aware that discussions around the budget are a matter for the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  All of that will take place, including public engagement with different sectors, over the next while.  However, I take the Deputy's point.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a very serious matter, which affects families all over the country.  Dementia does not distinguish between borders, or geographical boundaries.  I am informed that in 2011, there were 47,000 people in Ireland suffering from dementia and that by 2021, this will have increased to 68,000, which is 40% to 42% increase, which speaks for itself in terms of the challenge we face in this regard.  It is important to acknowledge that Government has recognised this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and his predecessor, Deputy Reilly, have put in place a process by which the national dementia strategy has now been developed, agreed and published.  The main focus of this strategy is timely access and diagnosis, support, nationally and locally, and training and support for families and health care workers.  It is a priority of Government that people be able to remain in their own homes for as long as that is medically and physically possible.  The HSE has introduced a whole range of initiatives to ensure that older people have timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible, which is what people desire.</p>  <p>  The HSE service plan 2015 references the intention of the HSE to progress the realignment of services to provide home care services and community care services in order to maximise the opportunity for older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.  Currently, 10.3 million hours of home help service are provided, supporting 50,000 people.  There are 13,800 people now in receipt of home care packages.  This includes 600 people who are supported under the delayed discharges initiative.  There are 190 people in receipt of intensive home care packages at any one time.  These were introduced in the first quarter of 2014 for people who have more complex needs.  </p>  <p>  Also, a national tool for assessment of people's needs is now available.  This means that instead of varying standards across the country there is now a national assessment available.  In 2015, &euro;993 million was allocated for the nursing homes support scheme, which is important for people.  I take the Deputy's point but I am sure he will be aware that the national dementia strategy has been welcomed.  It is a comprehensive and thorough analysis not only of the scale of the challenge in terms of, as I stated earlier, the increase to 68,000 by 2021 of the number of people here suffering from dementia but how, given our rising economy, we can deal more comprehensively with this matter in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  The Deputy's point in regard to the budget will be taken into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800019#S06000"><p>Current trends and statistics indicate we have a dramatically aging population.  The Government needs to take this into account and to plan according for the future.</p><p>Options such as supportive housing and extra-care nursing must be available to allow people to live in their communities.  By 2026, it is envisaged that 16% of the population will be aged over 65, compared with the current figure of 11%.  While nursing home care is the only option for many high-dependency patients, the existing model of prioritising that type of care is not sustainable into the future.  Having said that, it is vital to ensure sufficient funds are set aside in the budget for the Fair Deal scheme.  In addition, there must be sufficient funding for the extra respite beds and acute hospital beds that are needed to solve overcrowding problems.</p> <p> These matters can be addressed in the short term, but the demographic issue requires a long-term approach.  As the Taoiseach mentioned, the projected increase in the numbers suffering dementia from 47,000 to 68,000 by 2020 presents a huge challenge for future governments.  Indeed, there are predictions that we will see a 240% increase in the incidence of dementia by 2040.  We are facing a tsunami in this regard and action must be taken.  We need a medium- to long-term strategy, which will require the co-operation of several Ministers and Departments.  Will the Taoiseach agree to set out that strategy in the coming budget and for future years?</p></speech>

It represents a comprehensive analysis of the scale of the challenge.  We can predict reasonably accurately the figures for the coming years, which spell out the scale of the challenge we will have to meet.  I gave the House some of the figures which show how the Government has applied resources to ensuring people can remain at home for as long as possible.  We need to ensure the method of assessment is more accurate in analysing the particular needs of people in different parts of the country.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of the challenges of an aging population, there has a big change of culture in this country in respect of healthy living.  There is a greater awareness of the dangers of obesity, the issues arising from the thousands of deaths that occur each year because of tobacco use, the questions surrounding alcohol and its abuse, and so on.  The Deputy will have noticed increased activity levels among citizens.  With modern medicine and healthier lifestyles, people can live for longer.  The change of attitude towards achieving a healthier Ireland and a healthier population is important in the longer term if people are indeed to live longer.  I note the spectacular achievement by an octogenarian the other day in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, which was an extraordinary feat.  In the Deputy's own county last week we saw the interest people have in achieving personal goals.  That cycle event was for charity, which means it had a double impact.  These are all aspects of the strategy for ensuring people are involved in and engaged with building a healthier Ireland.</p>  <p>  In respect of dementia, the strategy, as I said, is in place.  It is a question now of being able to meet the challenges outlined in that strategy.</p></speech>

In the context of the commitment in the programme for Government to provide for the homeless, we have a situation in which Dublin City Council will have no funding for emergency accommodation in the final months of the year, despite the fact that well over a thousand children are currently in such accommodation.  Can the Taoiseach confirm when the necessary intervention will be carried out by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to address this situation in line with the commitments made both legislatively and in the programme for Government?</p>  <p>  In respect of company law, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, has indicated that legislation may be forthcoming to prevent a recurrence of what happened at Clerys last month.  In particular, this legislation would seek to prevent employers who behaved as those in Clerys did from becoming directors of other companies for a specific period.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when legislation relating to that issue will be brought before the House in line with comments made by the Minister of State?  The Minister of State also indicated that legislation would be forthcoming to ban low-hour and zero-hour contracts, the consequences of which we saw in the Dunnes Stores debacle and the treatment of workers there.  Will the Taoiseach likewise indicate when that legislation will be forthcoming?</p></speech>

I read the report from Dublin City Council and the figure the Deputy mentioned came as a surprise to me.  I intend to follow through on the matter.  We have had some very detailed discussions on housing, homelessness, social housing and making voids available for families.  A package being put together by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, in regard to the private building sector will help to ensure there are sufficient numbers of houses for those who need them.  This is a serious issue and I will be glad to give the facts of the situation after I deal with a number of questions at the Cabinet sub-committee meeting.  The Deputy will note that we have made &euro;2.2 billion available for the provision of social housing.

The D&aacute;il voted on Second Stage of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill yesterday.  The Irish League of Credit Unions produced a depressing report on back-to-school costs for parents.  It provides a great level of detail, such as the fact that 80% of parents see these costs as a significant financial burden.  Many parents admit that costs will have a negative impact on their ability to pay household bills and that they are likely to get into debt, and many also indicated that they might even go to moneylenders.  Such parents are likely to find themselves the target of attachment orders arising from the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that Report Stage of the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il next week?  Does the Government intend to guillotine Report Stage and rush the Bill through?  If it has its way, will it be completed before the summer recess?  If that is the case, it will penalise the most vulnerable families and children once again.</p>  <p>  I refer to the international protection Bill and the McMahon working group report.  Some aspects of the report are welcome, but overall it is a very disappointing response to a humanitarian issue for the people affected.  The direct provision system has been widely condemned.  We warned at the time that the terms of reference decided on by the Government for the working group were too limited.  The report confirms this and falls short of the fundamental and radical reform of the refugee and subsidiary protection application process that is needed.  Last month the Taoiseach told me that he would facilitate a debate on this report.  Can he tell us when that will take place and whether it will be held before the D&aacute;il rises for the summer?</p></speech>

It is designed to help people, arising from work done by the Law Reform Commission.  I heard the comments about the difficulties faced by some parents regarding back-to-school costs for children.  I also listened carefully to the Minister for Education and Skills, who outlined the work being done on book rental schemes and the opportunity to have more affordable facilities for children.</p>  <p>  The McMahon report, which was presented to the Minister some time ago, involved six months' work on the part of Mr. Justice McMahon.  It is the first comprehensive examination in 15 years of Ireland's protection system and contains 173 recommendations for the Government on improvements to the scheme.  The most important issue is having a single process for the analysis of the applications to ensure it is as effective and efficient as possible.</p>  <p>  The international protection Bill is at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage and members of the committee will make their views known on the report and how the system might be improved this week.  The Bill will not be finalised before the summer recess, but it is important that, arising from the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the Minister for Justice and Equality hears the views of Members on the recommendations in and their observations on the McMahon report.  I would like to think this is an issue that will become more important in the years ahead, and we need to make provision to deal with it in a speedy and efficient manner, as well as from a humanitarian and compassionate point of view.</p></speech>

There is concern in the north of Dublin about young adults with intellectual disabilities who finish secondary school and find there are no places for them.

It is highly unusual that we must sit on a Friday to enforce the Government's will because it will obviously bring it forward for Report Stage next week.  I want to bring a number of justice Bills to the Taoiseach's attention and I want an answer as to when they will be brought before the House.  I think his behaviour is shameful.  The Bills are the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill to set up a new Garda authority, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, the international protection Bill, the mediation Bill, the judicial council Bill and the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  None of these Bills has come through the Houses.  Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting on these Bills, but the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill is being brought through before the summer recess to enforce Irish Water's authority.  When will all these Bills, some of which we have been waiting for for years to come through the Houses, finally get dealt with?  The Taoiseach's behaviour is outrageous.</p></speech>

I refer him to 1 July 2014 when I asked the following parliamentary question:<blockquote>To ask the Minister for Finance the number of mortgage holders of each financial institution operating here whose repayment schedule and interest rate was either aligned to at the time or due to be converted to an ECB tracker rate at a point in the future who have since converted to a variable rate, waived entitlement to a tracker rate for the period of 2008 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</blockquote>The Minister's response was:<blockquote>The Central Bank has advised me that they do not publish the information requested by the Deputy. </blockquote>That suggests to me that the Central Bank possesses this information but does not publish it.  I went into the Central Bank, and wrote to it, asking if it would provide me with the information which I, as a public representative, sought.  Following a further letter to the Governor, I was surprised to receive a call from the director of consumer affairs in the Central Bank who had discussed the matter and my letter with the Governor.  The Governor asked him to call me directly before responding to my letter.  I will read into the record a transcript of what I noted after that call on 3 September 2014.<blockquote>My office received a call today from Bernard Sheridan of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I returned the call at 15.05 approx on Sept 3rd 2014 and spoke with Mr. Sheridan.  After 11 minutes of verbal procrastination and [circumlocution] on a scale I have not witnessed for a while, Mr. Sheridan eventually acknowledged that the Central Bank does know the amount of mortgage accounts moved from tracker rates to variable rates - but only for accounts in arrears.<br /><br />I requested this information despite being told previously in writing that the CB does not have that info - from the CB.  After initially side stepping the question on numerous occasions and using vast amounts of verbiage - Mr. Sheridan under forced very direct questioning admitted being in possession of the numbers I requested and eventually agreed to furnish me with the numbers again stressing only for those in arrears.<br /><br />The phone call from Mr. Sheridan began along the lines of The CB does not believe that the Banks are engaging in any practice to encourage borrowers to move off trackers - explicitly used the word &quot;believe&quot; which I took issue with and advised Mr. Sheridan that as a representative of the public who remain traumatised by the events of recent years and are not trusting of banks and the system of Governance - I wanted to know does the CB know the amount of [mortgage-holders who have been moved from a tracker rate to a variable rate].<br /><br />Mr. Sheridan repeatedly obfuscated before finally relenting after vigorous questioning.  I hope that this call has been recorded at the CB.</blockquote>Some 11 months on, almost to the day on which I first submitted the parliamentary question, I have had a meeting with the Central Bank and have numerous pages of correspondence.  I received a letter last month, on 24 June.  It states:<blockquote>You will note in particular that all lenders have confirmed that, as a matter of policy, they do not and have not required [private dwelling-home] borrowers to move from a tracker mortgage rate to a more unfavourable rate during the lifetime of the mortgage.  During our inspection, we found no evidence to suggest that this is not the case.  However, we identified some weaknesses in lenders' monitoring of compliance with these policies.</blockquote>To this day, I remain confused, exasperated and unsure of how to get the information.  I am at a complete loss to understand how the Central Bank does not know how many mortgages have been moved in the last number of years from a tracker rate to a variable rate.  I was told on the telephone that it has the information while I was told in letters, it does do not have it.  In all the correspondence, I have been told about policy, waving words around and playing with language, but I still cannot get the information.</p></speech>

I am not sure my scripted response will be an appropriate answer to the issues he has raised now, but I will read it anyway and we can talk about it at the end.</p><p>As Deputies will be aware, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, provides a strong consumer protection framework for borrowers.  One of the elements contained in the code is protection for borrowers who have tracker rate mortgages.  Recent data published by the Central Bank indicate that 52%, or approximately &euro;60 billion, of the balances outstanding for credit advanced to Irish resident households for home purchases is at a tracker rate.  At the outset, it is important to state that lenders cannot remove a borrower's tracker rate just because the borrower is in arrears.  The Central Bank has published guidance to support borrowers and the website <i>keepingyourhoime.ie</i>also has information to assist borrowers.  Furthermore, there are a number of support bodies, such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, that can provide essential assistance to borrowers who are dealing with arrears.</p><p>On the issue of tracker mortgages specifically, the Central Bank has carefully considered whether there are any circumstances which would merit a lender offering a borrower an arrangement which resulted in the borrower changing from his or her existing tracker rate and concluded that there may be exceptional cases where this could arise in order to prevent the borrower losing his or her home.  Consequently, the CCMA provides that the lender must not require the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered to the borrower, except in prescribed circumstances.</p><p>Provision 39 of the CCMA requires that in order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options offered by that lender.  If the lender concludes that none of the options that would allow the borrower to retain his or her tracker interest rate are appropriate and sustainable for the borrower's individual circumstances, provision 46 of the CCMA provides that the lender may offer the borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, if the proposed alternative repayment arrangement satisfies the following conditions: all other options, which would retain the tracker rate, have been considered to be unsustainable; it is affordable for the borrower; and it is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability.</p><p>In addition, the CCMA requires lenders to explain in the offer letter the reasons the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, with regard to the individual circumstances of the borrower.  Furthermore, and importantly, lenders must engage with the Central Bank on any proposal to avail of provision 46 of the CCMA.  This means there are further strong protections in place.  The Central Bank has indicated that to date no lender has engaged with it on developing any such products.</p><p>This was also confirmed in the outcome of the Central Bank's recently published report on its themed inspection on compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  During this inspection all lenders confirmed that, as a matter of policy, they do not require, and have not required, borrowers to move from a tracker mortgage rate to a more unfavourable rate during the lifetime of the mortgage.</p></speech>

In essence, we are part of a government of a very stressed society and people rightly expect their public representatives to demand accountability.  While I am proud of our record as a Government on many fronts, this is an issue on which the record will show I have been seeking answers for 12 months, almost to the day.</p>  <p>   It is simple and straightforward.  As somebody humbled and honoured to represent the people as a Member of this House, I requested first the Minister and then the Central Bank to answer the straight question as to how many accounts under the governance of the Irish banks have been moved from a tracker rate to a variable rate, because the evidence of which I am aware suggests a number of them have been moved?  It is a practice that must be examined.  It is despicable if the banks are taking advantage of borrowers under duress and stress and encouraging them off their tracker rates onto variable rates.</p>  <p>  The bigger issue is that the Central Bank, which governs and monitors the banks - that is not my duty, as a public representative, or the Minister's - cannot or will not provide me with the answer to that one question I have sought for 12 months.  It has sent me around the houses and down every avenue rather than provide me with it.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank talks about policy.  My personal assistant and I met a number of the officials in the Central Bank.  We asked, ahead of their last investigation into the banks and the report they was compiling, if they would specifically ask each bank how many accounts had moved and yet they have come back to me again with the same nonsense on what the policy is.  I am not interested in the policy.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would commit today to getting the information that I seek from the Central Bank and, by extension, from all the banks.</p></speech>

It is an important report, widely accepted nationally and internationally and warmly welcomed by the head of the mental health services in the World Health Organization at the launch by the Taoiseach in Dublin.</p>  <p>  For a number of years, we have discussed the difficulties experienced by the State in determining the levels of suicide.  The most recent statistics for 2014 show that 459 persons - 368 males and 91 females - took their own lives, but undetermined deaths numbered 62.  In Northern Ireland and Britain and in Europe, undetermined deaths are counted as suicide.  There is a reluctance among some coroners to bring in a verdict of suicide because of the stigma and the difficulties experienced and felt still by some families, even though there have been many efforts made to reduce the stigma around suicide.  Of course, there are some suicides, such as single-occupant road traffic accidents, which cannot be identified.  We would not want to exaggerate the numbers either - I have heard very exaggerated numbers in that regard - but international research in an Irish context would put it at between eight and 15.  There are also drownings that cannot be identified and other tragedies that are seen as accidents but, in fact, are suicide.</p><p>Compare the 459 suicides last year with the number of road traffic deaths, which is unfortunately on the increase at 196.  Our suicide levels are a little below the European average, but our rate of youth suicide is the fourth highest in Europe after Lithuania, Estonia and Finland.  We have a particular problem in this regard.<br/><br/>The question that is always asked is why did someone take his or her life.  Many studies have been done on this complex matter and we want a simple answer, but there is no simple answer to most suicides.<blockquote>Addressing suicidal behaviour means supporting people in many different ways and requires a co-ordinated effort across many different sectors and levels of society.  Connecting for Life is designed to coordinate and focus the efforts of a broad range of government departments, state agencies, non-statutory organisations and local communities in suicide prevention.</blockquote>This is a quote from the report.  To continue:<blockquote>Usually no single cause or risk factor is sufficient to explain a suicidal act.  Most commonly, several risk factors act cumulatively to increase an individual's vulnerability to suicidal behaviour, and risk factors interplay in different ways for different populations, groups and individuals.<br /><br />In Ireland [and internationally], one in four people will use a mental health service at some stage of their lives.  Research shows a strong link between mental health difficulties and death by suicide.  In high-income countries, mental health problems are present in up to 90% of people who die by suicide.</blockquote>I would say that everyone who dies by suicide is suffering from some level of mental ill health, although perhaps not a mental illness.</p></speech>

I am taking this Topical Issue debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is abroad on Government business.</p>  <p>  We are all too aware that a death by suicide does not just affect family and close friends, but a community as a whole.  The sometimes unanswerable questions of why, if only and what if reverberate around the community.  It is at that time that those dealing with a death by suicide need to find support to make sense of what has happened, deal with their grief and learn how to live with their loss.</p>  <p>  Sadly, too many lives in this country are lost to suicide.  While we will never eliminate it completely, we should make every effort to reduce the number of lives lost by ensuring that there is a co-ordinated partnership of a broad range of Departments, State agencies, non-statutory organisations and, perhaps most importantly, local communities in tackling this issue.</p>  <p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm has been, and continues to be, a priority for the Government.  As the House will be aware, the previous suicide prevention strategy, Reach Out, came to the end of its ten-year term at the end of 2014.  The Minister of State requested the Department of Health and the HSE to develop a new strategic framework for suicide prevention, building on the work and achievements of Reach Out.  The new strategy, Connecting for Life, which was launched by An Taoiseach and the Minister of State on 24 June, sets out a vision of an Ireland where fewer lives are lost through suicide and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well being through a number of specific goals, including a better understanding of suicidal behaviour, supporting communities to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour, safe and high-quality services and improved access, consistency and integration of services.</p>  <p>  Connecting for Life is much more than a vision.  It provides a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual objective.  This action plan will be supported by robust implementation and governance structures and resourcing and communications frameworks.  Monitoring and evaluation will be embedded into the implementation process, progress will be tracked and the impact of the strategy will be objectively measured against baseline indicators.  The agreed implementation structure sets out clear lines of responses and accountability at all levels: political, administrative and local.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP's role and authority to support the implementation of the strategy is clearly set out.</p>  <p>  Suicide is a complex problem and addressing suicidal behaviour means supporting people in many different ways.  It also requires a co-ordinated effort across many different sectors and levels of society, for example, service providers, communities, families and friends.  Connecting for Life places a significant value on partnerships and is designed to co-ordinate and focus the efforts of a broad range of Departments, State agencies, non-statutory organisations and local communities in suicide prevention.  It is the Government's hope that the implementation of this new strategy will help us to achieve our goal of fewer lives lost through suicide.</p></speech>

I also thank him and the Minister of State for their investment in developing mental health resources.  I congratulate and recognise the work of the NOSP under Mr. Gerry Raleigh, who has done a good job.  I commend the Government on increasing the amount of money that is given to the NOSP from &euro;4.3 million to &euro;8.7 million.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask about the report and Reach Out.  The department of economics at NUI Galway calculated the cost of suicide to the State in 2001 as being &euro;906 million.  Reach Out included a special section on the economic cost of suicide.  Perhaps we could determine today's figure.  In this country, economics often talk as much as, or more than, other factors that we might hope would be given more attention.</p>  <p>  It is important that we invest in services to those bereaved by suicide.  They are a special group and face special difficulties.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is no way of capturing that amount or levying people who did not commit suicide so as to generate revenue.  While the cost is real, there is no way of capturing and spending it, which I am sure the Deputy understands.  However, it is appreciated that funding for the office has doubled under this Government and that further investment will be needed in the coming years in order to implement the strategy, subject to budgets.  As the Minister of State pointed out, it is not all about money, but other factors as well.  I agree with Deputy Neville that it is important to provide bereavement counselling and other bereavement services for the families affected.</p></speech>

There is a growing frustration among the relatives that they are being left in the dark about plans to review the horrific actions of those individuals and there is an increasing concern that the truth will never come to light.</p>  <p>  My party and I understand that dealing with the past is an important part of the Stormont House Agreement and that the implementation of that agreement has stalled due to a failure to agree on certain welfare levels in Northern Ireland.  However, l am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to consider this issue with clear eyes.  Failing to progress matters that go to the core of justice within Northern Ireland due to a dispute over welfare changes would strike anyone from these islands or beyond as inexcusable.</p>  <p>  Having listened to the stories of many victims' relatives, I believe that it is time for both Governments and the parties to the Stormont House Agreement to re-engage in a meaningful way and seek the full implementation of that agreement.  Certain parties' abdication of their responsibilities relating to their previous commitments made under the agreement is shocking.  Victims and their families continue to be denied the truth and basic justice.</p><p>It is not acceptable that efforts to find out the truth about atrocities such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the murder of Pat Finucane, the murderous behaviour of the Glenanne gang and the activities of the Mount Vernon UVF gang are still being delayed.  We have to realise that many families, both North and South, are continuing to suffer because of those atrocities and because they have been denied the basic truth.</p> <p> When I raised this matter on the floor of the House recently, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, assured me he would raise the reasonable demands contained in the all-party motions passed in this House in 2008 and 2011, which called for an independent international judicial figure to be given access to all material held by the British Government with regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I appreciate that the Minister has consistently raised that matter with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers.  My party leader, Deputy Martin, and I have also raised this issue in a number of meetings with Ms Villiers and the British ambassador.  In his most recent response to me in this House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade assured me that the Secretary of State is "actively considering" the matter.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could give me an update on that.  Has any progress been made in ensuring access to those papers is given to an independent eminent legal person?</p> <p> The allegations surrounding the collusion of British state forces with loyalist paramilitaries need to be investigated fully.  I ask the Government to continue to pursue this matter with the utmost urgency.  Recent RTE and BBC programmes exposed the level of violence that was unleashed when the British state colluded with vicious paramilitary groups on this island.  There is a duty on all agencies to ensure the murderers responsible for such heinous crimes are brought to justice.  The full truth is needed in the interests of true reconciliation.  The horror of the Troubles inflicted by the Provisional IRA and other so-called republican groups, loyalist paramilitaries and agents of the British security forces must be fully exposed.</p></speech>

I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Recent RTE and BBC documentaries presented a shocking account of allegations of collusion that span three decades.  In the first instance, our thoughts are with the families and relatives of those who were murdered in these events, and for whom the documentaries must have been deeply upsetting.  The hurt caused by the murder of their loved ones in such vicious circumstances is compounded by the knowledge that elements of the British security forces colluded with such callous crimes.  It is a matter of public record that collusion between State forces and paramilitaries occurred during the Troubles.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade outlined during a previous Topical Issue debate on this matter on 17 June last, successive Irish Governments have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government in ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg.  The Minister is continuing to raise the issue of collusion, including in relation to a number of individual cases of long-standing concern, such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the killing of Pat Finucane.  He advocates that all relevant documentation should be made available to be examined by the appropriate mechanisms.  Such cases must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled and shared society.</p>  <p>  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  The Minister and I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families that have had to contend for too long with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House agreement, remains a priority for the Government.  We believe these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion.  These institutions will include a historical investigations unit to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an independent commission on information retrieval to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.  Good progress is being made on the establishment of these institutions, which we believe will assist all victims, including victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and truth.</p></speech>

In her book <i>Lethal Allies</i>, Anne Cadwallader recounts the stories of 120 people who were murdered by loyalist gangs, some of which were armed from UDR depots.  With one exception - a person who was linked to the IRA - none of those 120 people was involved in violence.  They were citizens going about their daily work and included active members of the SDLP, the GAA and other local community organisations.  I wish to refer to a desperate atrocity for which the murderer or murderers have never been brought to justice.  In <i>Lethal Allies</i>, Ms Cadwallader explains:<blockquote>In between the Dublin bombings of 1 December 1972 and 20 January 1973, Fermanagh-based members of the UDR and UVF carried out three bombings within an hour - in Clones (County Monaghan), Belturbet (County Cavan) [both of which are in my constituency] and Pettigo (County Donegal) - all on 28 December 1972.  Two teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly (aged fifteen) [from Belturbet] and Paddy Stanley (aged sixteen) [from Clara, County Offaly], were killed in Belturbet.  Again, no one was brought to justice.</blockquote>The Minister quite rightly referred to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which, as we know, happened on 17 May 1974.  Some 33 innocent people were killed and almost 300 people were wounded.  That day witnessed the highest number of casualties on any single day during that awful period on this island known as the Troubles.  We should always remember that the UVF claimed responsibility for those bombings in our capital city and in Monaghan in my own constituency.  Various credible allegations that elements of the British security forces colluded with the UVF in those bombings are available as well.  A number of years ago, an Oireachtas committee did excellent work following on from the Barron report.  It termed the attacks of 17 May 1974 as an act of &quot;international terrorism&quot;.</p><p>The Minister also referred to the recent BBC and RTE documentaries.  All of us were probably aware of the individual incidents, but when we watched the programme it was really chilling to see how it put a background to the carnage and horror that were inflicted on so many innocent people.  I had the privilege and honour of being able to speak during the debates in 2008 and 2011 when this House unanimously carried motions calling on the British Government to give access to all papers pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to an international independent eminent judicial person.  Unfortunately, the British Government has refused to accede to this fair request, which was made by a sovereign Parliament.  I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, intends to talk to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, about this matter.  I put it to both Ministers that it is of the utmost importance for the Government to use every forum available to it at political and public administration levels to call on the British Government to respond positively to the requests of this sovereign Parliament.  The minimum that the families deserve is the truth.  These murderers must be brought to justice.  I refer not only to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but also to the bombing I have mentioned in County Cavan, which is in my constituency.  I know the two families that lost young teenagers on that desperate night at Christmas 1972.</p></speech>

The Stormont House agreement provides for new ways to investigate the past and facilitate information recovery and for victims and survivors to share their experiences.  The Government continues to prioritise the implementation of the agreement, not least because those who suffered the loss of a loved one, or were themselves victims of violence during the Troubles, deserve the best means possible of dealing with the legacy of the past.  In that regard, they continue to have the total support and commitment of the Government.  I undertake to convey what Deputy Smith has said today to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I will make sure the Minister is aware of it, if he is not already.</p></speech>

Students are no sooner out of school on their summer holidays than parents start to worry and fret about the cost of sending them back to school at the end of August and the start of September.  The Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, may be aware of the recent publication of a survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p><p>It indicates the financial pressures parents find themselves under when sending their children back to school.  I acknowledge that there were some positives in that report.  For example, the cost of sending a child back to primary school has reduced from &euro;122 to &euro;116.  However, the cost of sending a child to post-primary school has risen significantly.</p> <p> When one looks at the report and listens to what parents tell us, it is clear this is a huge issue.  A total of 70% of the parents surveyed said that the cost of sending their children back to school will negatively impact on their ability to pay basic household bills.  Furthermore, 16% of families who responded said that they will have to sacrifice spending on food to meet the costs of sending their children back to school.  A total of 16% of families in this State who are sending children back to school face the situation of having to reduce their grocery bills to meet back to school costs.</p> <p> The education committee has examined this issue and put forward recommendations.  While I agree with the Minister on many matters, I have said from that outset that when I believe she is not doing enough to tackle an issue I will call her out on it.  She is not doing enough on this issue.  To be honest, she is not doing anything about it.  She has put the responsibility back on the shoulders of parents to lobby the boards of management in respect of back to school costs.  That is simply not good enough.  The Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service research unit did a research paper on this for me.  It states, and the education committee and I agree, that the Minister has statutory powers under the Education Act 1998 to make recommendations on this or any issue which affects schools.  In fact, a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Minister made recommendations in 2008 on the issue of school uniforms.</p> <p> School uniforms are one of the huge costs in sending children back to school.  Another is the cost of school books.  On top of that there is the cost of voluntary contributions, which average &euro;112.  In my experience as a parent, many of these voluntary contributions are not voluntary.  In many cases students who do not pay the voluntary contribution do not have access to lockers, libraries and other school facilities.  There is nothing voluntary about these contributions.</p> <p> In recent years there has been a decrease in capitation grants for schools.  Schools are trying to operate on less funding with more students and they are unable to make ends meet.  The burden is falling back onto the shoulders of parents.  The Minister must confront this issue.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it is hugely important for parents throughout Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to debate it in the House.</p>  <p>  Everybody accepts that back to school costs place a burden on families.  The Government is taking action to help reduce those costs and to provide direct support to those families that need it most.  There are four areas I wish to mention - the cost of school books, the cost of uniforms, voluntary contributions and the payment of back to school allowances.</p>  <p>  With regard to textbook costs, an agreement was reached by my predecessor with the Irish Educational Publishers' Association which resulted in the agreement of a code of practice.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock book rental schemes.</p>  <p>  Book rental schemes are the most effective method of reducing the cost of school books for parents across the country.  Since we came into Government, school book grants have been protected, and we also increased the investment to ensure that all schools can offer book rental schemes.  We spent approximately &euro;6.7 million in 2014 to give seed capital to 400 schools that do not have book rental schemes so they could establish them.  In 2015 and 2016, we are increasing that investment to give additional support to the other schools which already had book rental schemes established before that point, to allow them to expand their schemes.  In total, we have invested &euro;15.6 million specifically on expanding book rental schemes over these three years.  This is on top of the &euro;15 million spent annually on book grants for schools, which can be used for the maintenance and upkeep of book rental stock.</p>  <p>  The National Parents' Council surveyed the views of its members on the book rental schemes that are currently operating.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  The Government has shown a clear commitment to investing in book rental schemes, and we have every intention of continuing to do so.</p>  <p>  School uniforms are a more challenging area, and I am aware that Deputy O'Brien has made some suggestions in that regard.  Obviously the approach we are taking on book rental schemes cannot be replicated for school uniforms.  Nevertheless, I strongly believe that lowering costs should be the primary factor in school uniform policies.  Individual schools have the right to decide on their policy in this area, but I am anxious to have greater consultation and the involvement of parents in these decisions.  I recall the frustration of stitching a school crest onto a jumper each year as my son grew bigger over the years.  Many other parents are obliged to do that where the school has an embedded school crest on the school uniform.  I do not believe there should be such crests.  A generic option should be chosen.</p>  <p>  My focus is on giving parents a greater say in school policies that affect them.  I will be working in the coming months on a parents and students charter that will give a greater role to parents in formulating policies such as these.  As the Deputy suggested, perhaps a Minister can be more clear in terms of directing schools but a parents and students charter will give more clout, as it were, to parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  Regarding voluntary contributions, we all know that these are requested by many, but not all, schools in Ireland.  One point on which the Deputy will agree is that there is a clear need for parents to know that such contributions must be voluntary.  There can be no compunction involved.  My Department is ready and willing to take action where there are any allegations of pressure on parents or students.  I am anxious to see the reliance on voluntary contributions in schools diminished.</p></speech>

There is no evidence to suggest it is reducing costs.  One of the matters I have raised personally with the Minister and in the education committee is the need to look at the effectiveness of that voluntary code of practice.  If it is not working, it should be put on a statutory basis.  It must be made an enforceable code of practice.</p>  <p>  With regard to school book rental schemes, I acknowledge that the Government finally has a policy that a school books rental scheme should be available in every school.  On the subject of school books, one of the recommendations from the committee related to the use of workbooks.  The use of workbooks should not be outlawed but it certainly should be reduced.  They are a significant school book cost.</p>  <p>  School uniforms are the third issue mentioned by the Minister.  I do not accept that the Minister does not have the power under the Education Act 1998 to make recommendations which are binding on school boards of management in respect of the policy on school uniforms.  The Minister used that Act previously for recommendations and regulations on mental health and bullying.  The Minister has the power to make such recommendations.  Previous Ministers have made recommendations on the issue of school uniforms.</p><p>The Minister has expressed the opinion that generic uniforms should become available.  This is possible, but it will take political will on the part of the Minister to achieve.  She must use her statutory powers to compel boards of management to act rather than making the wishy-washy statement that she wants parents to put pressure on boards of management.  Parents are under enough pressure.  As Minister she has responsibilities and powers, and she must use them. </p></speech>

I understand, however, that schools are adhering to it.  Deputy O'Brien also referred to the possibility of placing the code of conduct on a statutory footing.  I will first ascertain whether schools are adhering to it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy and I probably agree that the book rental schemes are good.</p></speech>

In some schools, workbooks come under the rental scheme.  While I am aware that these books cannot be reused, anecdotally, I understand that in some cases parents who rent the book that accompanies the workbook also receive a copy of the workbook.  I admit this may not be the case in all schools.</p>  <p>  With regard to my powers under the Act, my advice is that I do not have the power to require schools to have generic uniforms.  For this reason, I am primarily concerned with using my power of persuasion.  Parents' wishes also need to be taken into account, because parents dress their children and pay for their clothes.  As the Deputy will be aware, some schools, primarily Educate Together schools, do not have school uniforms.  As to whether one uses powers to require a school to have a uniform or not, I do not intend to change the current position under which schools are given a choice about having a uniform.  In terms of uniform type, I am not sure whether a Minister can order schools to have a certain type of uniform.</p></speech>

The advice I have received is that I cannot do so, but I will certainly examine the issue.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking, we have made some progress, particularly in book rental schemes.  It is good to have an opportunity to emphasise that the voluntary contribution is voluntary.  The Department should be informed if schools are telling parents that the contribution is not voluntary and must be paid.  There is an issue with the running costs of schools and I will certainly keep that matter under review, particularly in the context of the Estimates.</p></speech>

I do not know why we have to wait until January 2017 and, as such, we have put down a series of amendments to change the provision to 2016.  I do not know the purpose of waiting so long.  This has been a problem for many years.  Amendment No. 19 relates to the requirement in section 15 to the effect that the vacant site levy shall be payable in arrears each year beginning in 2019, and seeks to bring that back to 2018.  I am not clear why this is not being brought forward more quickly, as it could be.  Perhaps it is because the Government wishes to buy the election.</p><p>This provision could be brought forward more quickly.</p></speech>

The Minister of State might explain why it would take so long to put this provision in operation.  The timeframe for bringing it forward seems very long.</p></speech>

Deputies have asked me to explain the reason for the timeframe set out in the Bill and I am happy to clarify it.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement between officials of my Department and the Attorney General's office in developing the proposals for the vacant site levy from the general scheme to the published Bill.  While in certain circumstances the Constitution allows the State to delimit the property rights of individuals in the interest of the common good, such restrictions on landowners' property rights must be reasonable and proportionate to the ends that the legislation seeks to achieve.  In particular, measures such as the vacant site levy must be introduced in line with the principles of fair procedures and administration.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Bill provides the timeframe for key actions by the planning authority in the implementation of the levy as follows: a register of vacant sites shall be established by planning authorities beginning on 1 January 2017; annual notices to owners of vacant sites shall be issued by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018; and the actual application of the vacant site levy shall commence in 2019, but it is important that this initial levy charge will be in respect of the previous year, which is 2018.</p>  <p>  The individual dates within the overall timeframe are set with a view to allowing appropriate time and notice for each key action.  The deferment until 2019 of the commencement of the charging of the levy is intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to initiate development or alternatively to sell their sites in order to avoid becoming liable to the levy, which ultimately facilitates the achievement of the primary objectives of the measures in the Bill.  While the bringing forward of the various dates, as proposed, by which specific actions shall be undertaken or commence may, on initial consideration, seem to be justifiable, it is important that an appropriate degree of proportionality and reason are applied in the implementation of the levy provisions.  I am satisfied that the timeframes in the Bill, as proposed, are reasonable and balanced, while allowing site owners the necessary opportunity to regularise their affairs before becoming liable to payment of the levy.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that one element of his argument has merit, namely that it would take a certain amount of time to offload a site if one wanted to sell it rather than pay a levy.  The Minister of State spoke about giving people a fair opportunity to deal with the new measure and to come to terms with it because of property rights and so on.  A longer period is being allowed for this measure than people were given to register their properties for the property tax.  To treat the two measures differently is a little unreasonable.  Likewise, with respect to separate legislation, a landlord will become liable for a tenant with regard to water charges and the landlord will be given 20 days to re-register a new tenant.  If I was a landlord-----</p></speech>

The primary objective of this Bill is to stimulate activity on sites that are of high potential in areas of high demand.  The objective, essentially, is not to put levies on sites but to stimulate activity.  It is a carrot and stick approach, and this is the stick element.  I believe it is fair and reasonable that due process be allowed for any owners of sites.  We must remember that many of these sites may have been lying idle for many years and it takes time for local authorities to reassess their local town and city development plans, identify these sites and then engage with the various stakeholders and the owners involved.  We have to allow for due process in terms of allowing sufficient time for the owners to come back to the local authorities with their plans for those sites.  We all know as public representatives that it takes time from concept to design to planning permission to construction.  We believe that by flagging these levies now the establishment of the register will go ahead and they will be charged from 2018 but they will apply the following year.  That is a reasonable approach and it gives due process and time for the owners of these sites to come forward with proposals on how they propose to bring them back into beneficial use.  We believe it is adequate and appropriate in the circumstances.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800033#GG00200"><p>We have previously discussed the principle of this amendment, at which time I made the argument that any land purchased for the purpose of landbanking should be taxed.  I was taken aback by the Minister of State's response on the last occasion when he said that the objective of this Bill is not to put levies on sites but to stimulate activity.  In terms of the housing market in Ireland over the past 30 years, landbanking has been the biggest problem.  The Minister of State said a levy on landbanking is being introduced to stimulate activity.  In my opinion, the desire of Government should be to stop or, at least, discourage landbanking.</p>  <p>  It was mentioned earlier that not only do we have land banking, but we have shadow landbanking which is long term.  In many cases, people are buying land at just above the agricultural price and holding on to it for between ten and 15 years.  If this issue is not addressed now, we will face similar problems in the future.  As long as landbanking continues unhindered by Government policy, it will be encouraged and the result will be a small cartel of people controlling the price of sites.  That, to me, is a major problem.  </p>  <p>  During the height of the boom, an apartment cost up to &euro;400,000, some &euro;200,000 of which was the site value with the remaining &euro;200,000 being the construction cost.  Even though it cost only &euro;200,000 to build the apartment, the builder or developer had to charge more than &euro;400,000 to cover the cost to him of the site.  That is a fact.  A site that had planning permission for 20 apartments cost &euro;4 million, which equates to &euro;200,000 per site per apartment.  For the developer to make a profit, he had to charge &euro;400,000 per apartment.  If it had not been possible for him to sell the apartments at that price, the bank would not have given him the money in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  The Government needs to take on board that the biggest problem in this area is landbanking.  To the best of my knowledge, the Kenny report was published in 1974, which is a long time ago.  One of the proposals in that report was that one could only charge 25% more than the price for agricultural land for any land.  That would be difficult to apply.  I believe it is possible to apply a ruling to the effect that only double the price of agricultural land could be applied to any land.  This would require the Government to establish a market price for agricultural land, with double that price being applied to land that was earmarked for zoning or already zoned for development.  In refusing to regulate this area, the Government is driving up the cost of property in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Reference was made to all of the great bargains in the property market during the recession, which was the case to a degree.  However, as members are aware, the market is quickly recovering.  We are once again in a situation whereby most young people cannot afford to buy a home.  Last night, I referred to the impact of the Central Bank ruling in that regard.  I agree with that ruling, which is sensible and sustainable.  It ensures that people are not able to get crazy mortgages that they cannot afford.  I do not disagree with the Central Bank on that point.  However, the State must examine the effect of the Central Bank ruling in the context of the landbanking issue.  The price of land now will not be cheap because of the huge prices people paid for it in the past.  This is one of the reasons there is little activity in the private sector.  If, five years ago, I obtained planning permission for 50 apartments on a particular site at a cost of &euro;100,000 per site per unit, I could not possibly build on that site today because to do so would be to acknowledge that I paid too much for it.  Taking into account the cost of the site and the cost of building each apartment, I would not get any return for my money.  The only thing I can do is sit on that land.  If I cannot meet the interest repayments, the bank has to make a call on whether to repossess the site and fire sale it or nurse me through the problem until such time as I can pay.  That is a decision for the bank.  </p>  <p>  The Government could address the issue of landbanking by way of the introduction of a measure that would, at least, stop more land going into this golden pot which allows the price of property in Ireland to escalate.  The current price of an apartment is between &euro;250,000 and &euro;350,000, the knock-on effect of which is high rents.  If I own 20 apartments that are worth X amount, I might also owe X amount on them and as such I will be under pressure to charge sufficient rent to meet the repayments on what I owe.  The price of housing has a direct impact on the rental market.  This is all part of our housing crisis.  The problem starts with landbanking.  The Minister of State said the focus of this Bill is to stimulate activity.  The Government needs to think again about how it is going to address the issue of landbanking.  I am aware of the problems highlighted in the Kenny report around property rights in the context of the Constitution.  However, this issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>I am not saying it will be easy.  On the contrary, it will be a challenge to deal well with the issue, but we must start somewhere.  Whoever does it, whether this Government or the next, there will be a great deal of opposition from vested interests.  As we all know, challenging vested interests is never easy, but somebody has to do it.  Until that happens, we will continue to have periodic housing crises.  That is a given.</p></speech>

Looking back at what went on in the property market in recent years, we see that much of the activity was speculative, that is, it was designed to make a short-term profit.  The only profit that was made was on the backs of those people who wanted to have a house located on a particular piece of land.  It was the same in Waterford as it was in many other cities and counties.  Deputy Wallace is 100% correct that if we allow lots of land to be bought up by people who are hoping to get five or six times what they paid in a few years time, then we are falling into the same trap into which previous Governments fell.  The party that was in power for 14 years allowed all this speculation and landbanking to take place.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there is a difficulty for the Minister of State in that this issue touches on the constitutional right of citizens to own property.  It is very difficult to find a way of imposing conditions on how long a person may own a piece of land and what they can do with it.  We must, however, find some way to prevent what happened in the past, where so much land was left aside for no other reason than to make a profit on it.  That is what Deputies Wallace and Ellis are seeking in this amendment.  There must be some mechanism whereby we can prevent speculation without interfering with the right of the individual to buy land and do with it as he or she wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800034#HH00900"><p>I have no doubt the Deputies are genuine in the concerns they have raised.  I wish to make crystal clear, however, that the mechanisms and provisions set out in this Bill are concerned with targeting the urban regeneration of city and town centres where vacant sites are a blight on streetscapes and are not being utilised to their full potential.  We all know where they are in our own towns or cities.  The first objective of the Bill is to stimulate activity in the housing sector.  If that activity is not taking place, then the vacant-site levy will apply.  That is what I mean by the primary objective of the Bill being to stimulate activity.  It is a perfectly logical approach to take because, unlike the landbanks to which Deputy Wallace referred, these are sites that already are served by public infrastructure.  They have enjoyed investment out of the public purse already and can, therefore, be turned around relatively quickly.  They are sites in zoned areas in locations of high demand.  That is where the focus of this Bill lies.</p><p>Taking account of what the Deputy is saying about landbanks, if we learn only one thing from the past it really should be an understanding of why the property crash happened.  In that context, a number of measures have been taken by this Government to ensure we do not go back to the boom-bust property cycles of the past.  For the first time ever, we have an independent body, the Housing Agency, engaged in analysing the country's demographics and growth patterns, where the demand is and where infrastructural deficits are.  We are utilising its findings to inform public policy and decision-making.  That was never done before.  In the past, we had a lot of <i>ad hoc</i>development happening around the country, with local development plans and local area plans sprouting up all over the place and huge tracts of lands being zoned.  That will not be allowed to happen under the new regime.  Instead, we are utilising informed decision-making methods.</p><p>There are several methods for dealing with the landbanks to which Deputy Wallace referred.  We are already seeing huge tracts of land being dezoned around the country.  It is our intention, moreover, to bring forward another planning Bill in the autumn.  That might be the more appropriate legislation in which to seek to address the concerns expressed by the Deputy around landbanks and how they are impacting on housing and property infrastructure.</p><p>I do not propose to accept amendment No. 10.  Deleting section 6(4) would remove critical criteria and provisions that underpin the legislation, which, as I said, is essentially concerned with stimulating activity in the housing sector.  The section sets out the specific criteria to be used by a planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, for determining whether or not there is a need for housing in an area, with reference to the housing strategy and core strategy of the planning authority.  The criteria include house prices and the cost of renting houses in the area, the number of households which qualify for social housing support and have specified the area as an area of choice, and whether the number of houses available for purchase or rent in the area is less than 5% of the total number of houses in the area.  These provisions will help to deliver more houses and ensure more sites are turned around and put back into beneficial use.  I have explained the focus of the Bill and why we cannot accept the amendment.  We will consider the wider issue to do with landbanks as part of the new planning Bill to be introduced in the autumn.</p></speech>

However, requirements such as factoring in house prices in an area will effectively see the invention of a great deal of bureaucracy.  It would be much cleaner and involve a lot fewer loopholes if my amendment were adopted.  As to stimulating activity, I maintain that in the present climate, if legislation does not initiate some really dramatic change, it will simply remain unappetising for the private sector to start building again in a serious way.  People will build one-off houses, of course, and there is a whole separate discussion to be had about how much of that should be allowed.  The worst of the housing crisis is in Dublin and I estimate that fewer than half the units completed in the city this year will go for sale.  In the case of most of the major developments by the likes of Kennedy Wilson, there is no intention of putting the units up for sale.  Kennedy Wilson has no appetite for that, but it does, because rents are so high, have an appetite for going into the rental market.  Unfortunately, a whole range of factors that are relevant when it comes to stimulating activity are not being addressed under this legislation.</p></speech>

I remind the Minister of State that when the property tax was introduced, there was no suggestion that somebody would go out and identify all the properties liable for the tax and make their owners register for it.</p><p>The onus was put on people to self-register.  People were told they were obliged to register their houses.  I do not understanding the thinking behind not asking the owners of vacant sites to register and giving them a certain period within which to do so.  I would not like the job of looking for them all, but I imagine the sensible thing to do would be to put pressure on the owner to register.  If someone tried to make the argument to me that not everybody will know whether their sites are included, I would forgive them, given that there are so many loopholes for which people might think they qualify.  I would put pressure on everybody to register their sites, explain the circumstances involved and give the State authority any information it might need. </p> <p> A lot of self-certification takes place, something with which I disagree.  There is self-certification in building regulations, which has not worked but is continuing.  The new system has simply increased bureaucracy.  We are still not checking to see whether buildings have been built correctly.  Architects who have not even been on site are expected to sign off on things that craftspersons, engineers or steel fixers have done on site.  A four-metre beam which is supposed to have 32 mm bars at 100 mm centres at the top, bottom and middle, but instead has a 20 mm bar on the side over which concrete is poured, will stay in place.  The building will not fall down, but if the bar ever comes under the pressure it was designed to take it will crack.  Will an architect see that?  He or she does not have a prayer.  He or she is not a genius and can only see what is in front of him or her.  As the bar has been covered in concrete, it will never be seen.  I disagree with that end of self-certification.  There should be supervision on site by the local authority in the shape of clerks of works which were in place years ago.  The system made sense, but it was a cost to the State because they had to be paid.  The costs should be passed on to builders and developers.  We will continue to have problems in construction until independent supervision controlled by the State is reintroduced in the form of clerks of works.  </p> <p> I would like to hear a good argument from the Minister of State as to why he should not ask the owners of vacant sites to put their hands up and say they have sites in certain locations.  They do not even need to know the size of each site, only whether it is more than one acre.  The authorities could examine sites and determine whether they qualify for the site levy.  Why should we not put the onus on property owners?</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Wallace that there should be an onus on owners to register sites.  Such an onus will entail recording what a site is used for and whether it is vacant or used for some activity.  It is a sensible thing to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800035#JJ00300"><p>What Deputy Wallace proposes does not compare like with like.  He compared the local property tax with the vacant site levy.  To be clear, self-registration was an option for the local property tax because everyone was liable for the tax, whereas not everybody will be liable for the vacant site levy; it will only apply in certain cases, and selective criteria will apply.  To expect everybody to understand the criteria that would apply and volunteer to levy themselves is untenable and would not work.  </p>  <p>  In a similar vein to the derelict sites levy or other processes, local authorities are housing authorities and, as such, when developing town and city development plans, are obliged to identify potential sites in their jurisdiction and then go through the process outlined to apply the designation as appropriate.  The local authority, as the Deputy said, includes elected members, is the closest body to citizens, and is the best place to address the issue.  As I said, they understand their development plans, know how their areas will develop and know what their priorities are.  Therefore, they are best placed to identify these plans.  Deputy Ellis mentioned that there would be engagement.  Once a local authority identifies sites, it will be obliged to engage with owners in a proactive way to determine what the plans for the site are, and due process will then apply.  That is the way the system should and will work.</p>  <p>  For those reasons, we will oppose the amendment.  It is not practical and proposes an inappropriate and unworkable approach.  The process as outlined involves very clear criteria, which means that local authorities can apply them in a consistent manner across the board where they feel designations are required.  We oppose the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

He said people will not know whether their sites are eligible for the levy.  They should first acknowledge their ownership and let the State decide whether they are eligible for the levy.  I have argued that every site should be eligible and disagree with all the loopholes.  A small percentage of those who own land banks will be caught.  It has slowly dawned on me that this Bill is not designed to deal with land-banking.  The Minister of State referred to another Bill in the autumn, but this is a missed opportunity to deal with land-banking, which is clearly not the aim of the Bill.  He said its aim was to stimulate activity, but because NAMA has sold assets for less than half of what they cost to build, it will be difficult to get the private sector involved.  I know people with development land that would love to build on it because they want to create work, be back in business and employ people who were loyal to them for years, but they cannot access funding because they cannot compete in view of the asset prices that have prevailed for the past couple of years.  Apartments were sold in 2014 for less than half of what it cost to build them.  I do not know how the Bill will stimulate activity.  I do not accept the logic that the Minister of State thinks it is unworkable to ask the owners of vacant sites to state that they own them.  That is not rational.</p></speech>

Local authorities could examine such registrations and decide whether it is appropriate to take action depending on replies.  There would be a mechanism in place to check what was registered and whether the information was correct.  I do not see the logic in the Minister of State's argument.  Other people have to register for other things and I see no reason owners of properties should not do the same.</p></speech>

The practice of land banking is not being addressed otherwise.  If I bought a site with five acres for development, do people honestly believe I would leave over half of that vacant and pay a levy?  I would make sure it would be occupied in some form or another so that I would not have to pay the levy.  This is just another loophole and arguing about whether a site is vacant, putting the onus on an owner to provide proof, would not even come into play if the scenario was not allowed to develop.  If the land is being banked, nobody should be allowed out without the levy being applied.  As I have said, land banking is encouraged otherwise.</p></speech>

On the face of it, that seems a tricky route as there are so many ways in which people can argue their case.  The process must be much more straightforward.  Allowing people to appeal is to give them time and leverage for delaying a process.  We should employ the levy and then consider whether something can be appealed.  There are too many ways out for developers, and I do not know how many times we have seen them argue about the use of land and whether it is a proper vacant site.  We could get into a long and drawn-out process, giving developers far too much leverage.</p></speech>

I have gone to great lengths to outline that it is important with respect to property rights in the Constitution that we have recognition of due process and fair and transparent procedures.  The process as outlined in the Bill is clear with the criteria as outlined.  We have to allow that if an owner's site is to be designated for a levy, an appeal mechanism should be available, as it is in any due process.  If we removed that, we could weaken the Bill and leave ourselves open to judicial challenge.  For those reasons, we oppose amendments Nos. 13 and 14, as they remove the critical provisions in section 9 outlining the mechanism open to a site owner to appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding entry of a site to a register of vacant sites.</p>  <p>  It is important in a measure like this that a clear and fair appeals mechanism is in place.  In this case, the proposed amendments remove, in summary, part or all of the following provisions: the burden of proof on the owner to show the site is not vacant; the power of the board to determine if a site is not vacant and direct that it be removed from the register; and that the entry of a site on the register would not take place until an appeal is determined.  These are fundamental provisions of the appeals process against the entry of a site onto the register.  It elaborates on how the appeal mechanism would work in practice, and without them it would not function.  Therefore, I oppose these amendments.</p></speech>

It does need to be addressed.  It would be so much cleaner if, as I have argued before, we just set out to levy all land-banking, without any loopholes.

I have rarely bought a clean one.  There was some element of contamination in most of the sites we bought in Dublin.  Some were worse than others.  Sometimes it was not a huge issue, but sometimes it cost up to &euro;500,000 to clean a site before we could start excavating or piling.  Any developer who buys a site in Dublin without checking the amount of contamination is very silly.</p>  <p>  Contamination comes from many areas, but much of it has come from the tipping of waste over the years, particularly in in-fill sites.  If there was space to tip rubbish, they used that space and they filled it.  That is where the contamination usually comes from.  It settled and more stuff went over it, including clay, and it might not have been visible, but if someone were buying land and paying too much money for it, they would want to be testing it out to see what contamination was in it.  I remember getting caught once with a site up around the North Circular Road, where the contamination was severe and I had not realised it.  It cost us about &euro;500,000 to get rid of the contamination.</p>  <p>  How will contamination be measured?  What does "contaminated" mean?  There are so many degrees of it.  The Government is opening a hornet's nest.  It is a good idea to bring in legislation that means builders will pay a levy whether the site is contaminated or not, because it puts the onus on the buyer to check how much contamination is in it so that he is not overpaying for a site that is contaminated.  He is taking on a great deal of extra work before he can develop it and he must factor that in when he is buying it.  That would be better than letting the land-banker, who might have held it for 10 or 20 years, sell a faulty product.  A contaminated site is a faulty product and if a person does not detect the contamination before buying it, he or she has bought a pig in a bag, which is not a great idea.</p>  <p>  If the Government ensures all sites, including contaminated ones, are caught in the net of the levy, it will open people's eyes to the fact that a site may be contaminated and the buyer will have to pay the tax on it either way, so they will want to check it.  There is a very simple way of testing it.  If someone were digging out 4 metres, they would get someone to take a sample of no more than three or four inches, right down to four metres.  They would bring it back up, send it away to be tested and then get the results.  It is not a madly expensive process, but it is something people should do.  I encourage the Minister of State to think again about that.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to delete the following criteria:<blockquote>(a) no market exists for the site, or<br /><br />(b) the site is situated on contaminated lands and the estimated costs of remedial works necessary in order to use or develop the site exceed the market value of the site itself.</blockquote>This is the key point: we must have a realistic economic development cost for sites, as Deputy Wallace knows only too well.  Some scenarios arise whereby the land is so contaminated that the remedial works necessary to bring it back to a proper development site would exceed the market value of the site.  In the interest of fairness, the Bill is drafted to ensure that if there are contaminated lands that require remedial work to that extent, the levy provisions are as fair and reasonable as possible.  That does not preclude the local authority from engaging with the owners of those sites and does not preclude them from working with the owners to have those sites remediated, but it recognises that if there is serious contamination and as a result the market value is zero, there is an opt-out for the levy on that particular site because of the issues associated with it.  In the interest of fair, reasonable and proportionate application of the Bill, we oppose this amendment.</p></speech>

I was really surprised to see it in the Bill.</p>  <p>  What percentage of banked land out there is not mortgaged?  I would imagine it is low.  As anyone who knows the sector well will confirm, if one had a site worth &euro;2 million and one owed nothing on it, one would mortgage it to get some money.  If I have an asset worth &euro;2 million and I let it sit there, that would not be clever.  One uses money to make money, if one is in this game.  If one has such an asset and goes to the bank stating it is valued at &euro;2 million, it would not be unusual for the bank, following independent valuation of it, to provide a mortgage of 75% of the asset.  They would not give one 100%.  They would allow for shrinkage.  In the present market, they would probably only give 50% but I can confirm that ten years ago getting 80% was not a problem.  When we built offices and restaurants and kept them, we did not just let them sit there.  We would have had units worth, maybe, &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  We would have been off our head to let them sit there and not get money for them that we could use to do other work.  That is what we did.  We mortgaged them so that we could do other development and we could build in other places with the money that we would get from it.  Anyone who would own a valuable development site and not mortgage it would be a very poor businessman.</p>  <p>  The only scenario I could imagine where those involved in the land-banking game would not have land mortgaged is probably those with what we would regard as old money and those who had cash down through the years who worked in a different way in business and never really adopted the modern business methods.  However, it would not be encouraged by any financial adviser that one would have an asset worth serious money and not mortgage it so that one could get money to do other work and make further money with it.  From a business point of view, it does not make any sense that a site, deemed vacant and eligible for a levy, will be free or partially free of a levy because of a certain mortgage on it.  The majority of sites will be mortgage.  That is a call an investor will make.</p>  <p>  If it so happens that the site is mortgaged at close to the current market value because one might have bought it when sites were dearer and the value has come down, I would say the investor has a decision to make.  If I was the bank manager who gave the investor the mortgage in the first place, I would say he or she must make a call as to whether it is in his or her interests to hold this site even though the mortgage on it is approximately equal to its market value, to hold this site and pay a 3% levy on it, or to sell it on.  That is a call one makes; it is a business decision.  One looks at the site's location, its potential and the markets.  One looks at all that one can do with it.  One might get someone to do up a scheme to see the site's potential.  One garners as much knowledge about it as one can and makes a business decision.  However, the idea that such a site would not be eligible for the 3% levy does not make any business sense.  That is a mistake.</p></speech>

Obviously, everything in this Bill reeks of that.  In relation to when this vacant site levy will and will not be invoked, I had an amendment ruled out.  The Government is actually reducing the levy on vacant sites and while I am thrilled to hear from Deputy Wallace about the way developers think, we need to introduce serious emergency legislation in this D&aacute;il to deal with the emergency that is out there.  Obviously, this will not deal with it.</p>  <p>  Developers are sitting on land and we are in thrall to them to make it available for housing.  Why not pass a law in this D&aacute;il before the summer recess to compulsorily purchase all of these vacant sites at a nominal rate?  That is the only way we will get our hands on the land that we need to provide housing in this country.  If we are sitting waiting for developers, out of the goodness of their hearts, to provide it, it will not happen.</p>  <p>  Everything that is in this legislation reeks of incentives, such as cutting development contributions to local authorities and making the market good for developers to suddenly provide us with housing, and it will not work.  Developers are not interested.  As has been outlined, they are only interested in profit.  They do not have a social conscience.</p>  <p>  Why are we throwing taxpayers' money at these developers in the hope that they will suddenly wake up some day and provide land or build houses?  It will not work.  Why is the Minister of State completely relying on it?  There are people hoping some provision will emerge from this building some day soon that will build some houses.  The Minister of State is responsibility for Construction 2020.  There are no houses available.  He is not building any and it has not gone unnoticed.</p>  <p>  This Bill, that we are cutting and dissecting line by line, is ridiculous because the only way that we will get houses built in this country is the way they were provided in the 1970s and 1930s, that is, by funding local authorities to build them.  Developers, even in the good times, would not leave aside 20%.  They will not leave aside 10%.  We will deal with that when those amendments come up.  I will not intrude on that discussion.  However, I am quite sickened here listening to all of these incentives that we must throw in the lap of developers that they might provide a few crumbs from their land banks.  It is galling for people.</p></speech>

A levy is a levy.  That is clear to anyone.  We are opposing amendments Nos. 20 and 23, which amend section 16 by removing the provision that a reduced or zero rate of levy should apply in certain circumstances.  We recognise that some sites are in negative equity and that loans attach to same.  In the interests of a fair, reasonable and proportionate approach, we recognise that difficult circumstances are faced by individuals who bought these sites during the height of the boom and that there is no gain in applying a levy.  As I outlined, however, this does not stop local authorities from engaging with owners to establish the latter's plans for their sites and to incentivise within the authorities' development plans through zoning and other mechanisms the sites' beneficial use.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement between my departmental officials and the Attorney General's office in developing the proposals on the vacant site levy from the general scheme to the published Bill.  The Bill provides that the levy should be applied at a flat rate of 3% of the market value of a site.  In certain circumstances, a reduced or zero rate can apply.  These provisions were included to help alleviate the financial burden faced by owners of vacant sites that are subject to site loans greater than 50% of their market value.  Owners who purchased at peak prices in the boom years and whose sites have reduced in value arising from the property crash are examples of those likely to be affected.  These legacy issues must be addressed.</p>  <p>  The intention of the provisions in section 16 regarding the application of reduced or zero rates of levy is to ensure that the levy provisions are as fair, reasonable and proportionate as possible.  Section 14 provides that a zero rate levy will apply where no market exists for the site or the site is on contaminated land and the estimated remediation costs necessary to use or develop the site exceed its market value.  Therefore, I am satisfied that these provisions are appropriate and I oppose the amendments.</p></speech>

The Government is telling them that, if the mortgages are of a certain size, it will reduce the levy.  I am baffled by how the Government will justify it.  This is a no-brainer, another serious loophole, and I will be curious as to how many sites are caught in the so-called net that the Bill will introduce.  It is more of a sieve than a net.  Not many sites will qualify for the levy as presented by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made the point that the Government was trying to stimulate activity and that this provision was not directly related to landbanking, but it was presented initially as something that would deal with landbanking in some form or another.  He must admit that this has zero to do with tackling landbanking.  This missed opportunity is a disappointment.</p></speech>

The proposed vacant site levy, which the amendments address, will reduce the levy for developers with outstanding loans on or negative equity in their sites.  Developers in NAMA, receivership or negative equity could be exempted.  That is the sum total.</p>  <p>  The lands in question are needed urgently.  In fact, we should be taking them over.  In my area of Dublin 15, for example, not one social house is due to be built by Fingal County Council, which covers an area of 100,000 people.  However, NAMA has control of a number of sites where houses are being built or have received planning permission and are due to be built.  None of these houses will come into the hands of people on the housing waiting list or workers who cannot get on that list and are priced out of the market.  Despite this, loopholes are being written for developers.</p>  <p>  The Bill makes retrospective the development contribution cuts that have been made by local authorities in order to incentivise developers.  A number of cuts were made by Fingal County Council while I was a member of it before being elected to the D&aacute;il a year or so ago.  Loads of councils have made cuts.  The Government is saying that this should be encouraged and councils should do more.</p>  <p>  Relying on developers is a failed policy.  Many of them are dysfunctional and not in a position to provide social or private housing even if we wanted them to.  This provision will disappoint many people.</p></speech>

The Bill is just one mechanism for addressing regeneration and housing provision in urban areas.</p>  <p>  As to the wider debate on housing, local authorities are being provided funding to build again, to restore voids to use, etc.  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, will also play a role.  It would be negligent of us all were we not to recognise the issues of viability in the construction sector.  The thrust behind reducing development levies is to take these issues into account where high, but previously appropriate, development levies are no longer appropriate.  Levies affect construction's ability to deliver what we want, that being, houses.  We cannot ignore this fact and are working to address it.</p>  <p>  I outlined the landbanks issue to Deputy Wallace.  He is well aware that local authorities have powers to zone their lands and development plans.  They have dezoned land across the country where landbanks were inappropriately zoned and contributed to the crash.  I welcome the fact that local authorities are engaging in sequential zoning in a planned and appropriate manner.  This power is available to local authorities.</p>  <p>  In this autumn's planning (No. 2) Bill, we will consider additional measures to address the genuine concerns raised by Deputy Wallace about the hoarding of land.  We must be cognisant of property rights and the Constitution.  We are opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

The amendment addresses an aspect that must be changed if the Government has any appetite to challenge land hoarding.  A number of large players controls many of the landbanks that are being hoarded.</p><p>It is amazing how so few people own so much of it.  That has been the way for a long time.  Most of the land we were building on in the boom time between 1998 and 2007 was purchased in the late 1980s.  It was held and hoarded by a small number of guys before being sold on when the price was good and high.  It was easy for them to have a cartel and to pull together in dictating the price of the land.  This led directly to our housing crisis.  Such crises will continue until measures are introduced at Government level to prohibit the hoarding of land for development or make such hoarding very unattractive.  Sadly, this Government has not yet developed an appetite for the necessary measures.  It is a terrible pity.  Some Government will introduce such measures someday.  We will continue to have housing crises until that happens.  I do not think the measures that are being proposed to deal with the current housing crisis are sufficient to make a serious dent in the problem.  Our housing crisis will continue for a while yet because the measures in question do not have the capacity to make a big difference.</p></speech>

The legislation provides for a number of areas where it can be used, but we believe this money should solely be used for social housing for local authorities.  The Minister said it can be used for all sorts of things, be it structures or providing services and facilities for local communities, including education, training and so forth.  However, there are other mechanisms from which they should be funded.</p><p>We should have a clear picture of what will be done with this levy.  We are imposing it in the context of housing.  The building of social housing is the major issue that faces us, so that is where the money should be targeted.  It should not stray off into areas that are already looked after, as other services are dealing with those.  I hope the Minister will support the proposal that all of the levy should go towards social housing.</p></speech>

It is unnecessary.  The existing provisions in the Bill allow for what the Deputy is proposing.  Section 23 outlines how the proceeds of the vacant site levy are to be used by the planning authority.  It essentially ring-fences the proceeds to be used solely on the provision of housing on residential land or for the development and renewal of regeneration land.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendment inserts a new paragraph in subsection (i) to provide that the proceeds of the levy may be spent "on any local authority owned land in the area on the development of social housing".  I already brought forward an amendment to this section on Committee Stage to provide greater clarity on how the planning authority may use the proceeds of the levy.  Following this amendment, the section provides that the proceeds may be used for the provision of housing on residential land in the vicinity of the site or for the development and renewal of regeneration land in the vicinity of the site.  This gives the planning authority wider scope in the use of the levy proceeds, including on the provision of housing on local authority owned land in the area, thereby providing greater benefit to the overall local area in which vacant sites are located.</p><p>I consider that the provisions as they stand enable the planning authority to use the levy proceeds in the most appropriate way.  The proposed amendment is unnecessary and I oppose it on that basis. </p></speech>

I wonder why he is not willing to stitch the proposal into the Bill.  Section 23(1)(a) provides that "where the vacant site comprises residential land", moneys received from the levy may be spent "on the provision of housing on residential land in the vicinity of the site".  It does not, however, specify that this should be social housing.  The purpose of the amendment is to nail down a requirement to spend these moneys on social housing.  We must be specific in this matter.  Why will the Minister of State not agree to include a reference to social housing?  Surely the ultimate purpose of the vacant site levy is to deliver social housing.  In that case, why not agree to the amendment?  The reference to using the proceeds of the levy for "the provision of housing on residential land" is vague.  What type of housing will be provided?  We want and need social housing because this is the area most affected by the current housing crisis.  The reason the Minister of State will not accept the amendment is unclear.</p></speech>

There is no guarantee this money will be used to contribute to the provision of additional social housing.  The Minister of State was studied in his vagueness in answering the question.  I ask him to provide a direct "Yes" or "No" answer to the following question.  Will the money that accrues from the levy be ring-fenced specifically for social housing and must it be spent solely for the provision of social housing?  We want a direct and clear answer to that question.</p></speech>

The Government has not indicated how quickly social housing will be provided.  Social and private residential housing are urgently needed.  Will the vacant site levy be directed towards social housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800043#RR00500"><p>We have been discussing the serious shortfall in funding for local authorities, which is all well and good.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has always considered regeneration projects and the Minister of State referred to the use of some of the proceeds from the vacant site levy for regeneration and other purposes.  Will funding for other Departments be reduced to make up for the levy?  I do not know how long it will take under the current system to build up a fund that would be worthwhile in terms of delivering housing.  However, once a certain amount has accumulated, the priority must be to deliver social housing.  Local authorities have land and we should invest in building social housing.  This is the main issue in the current housing crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government has promised on numerous occasions to provide rent certainty for the large numbers of people who are renting.  I have been arguing for a long time that rent certainty is urgently required, yet we are still waiting for legislation on the issue.  Despite the severe crisis in the rental market, the Government is proposing to direct the proceeds of a levy into a number of areas for which funding has already been provided.  Will it not make a clear-cut statement that the money will be allocated exclusively for social housing?  That is all we are asking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.626" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800043#RR00600"><p>Deputies are in broad agreement that the need for the Government to build State housing again has not been greater in our lifetime, even if it was greater in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  The financial challenges that have arisen in recent years have prompted the Central Bank to intervene in the market to ensure the days when people were lured into buying property for which repayments could have become unsustainable are not repeated.  While it is correct to intervene in this way, the flipside of the coin is that at least half of the younger generation will not be able to get on the house ownership ladder.  This may not be the end of the world but it would be the end of the world for young people if there were no alternatives available to them.  This means the State will have to build houses.  The Government's reliance on the private and rental sectors to provide housing does not stack up, will not work and will lead to serious problems.</p>  <p>  Rent levels in cities will go up before they go down.  Leaving a large chunk of the population at the mercy of the rental market is not a sustainable approach.  One could ask where we should go from here but it would be preferable not to start from where we are.  The Government must persuade our European partners to adopt a more flexible approach to the current rules on borrowing.  European Union rules preclude the State from borrowing, at less than 2%, the money it needs to build social housing.  These rules must change to allow the Government to borrow to invest in infrastructure without these loans going on the books.  In the event that the Government decided to build social housing but was prevented from accessing cheap money, the alternative would be to engage in public private partnerships or PPPs.  Public private partnerships are not a good approach because they place the State in the hands of investors who make a killing through the high interest rates they charge.  They are another form of vulture capitalism and similar to the vulture funds that pay peanuts to the National Asset Management Agency for assets which they either flip or hold and rent out, thereby driving up rents.  Public private partnerships have cost the State astronomical sums.  It beggars belief that the State can borrow money for infrastructure investment at a rate of approximately 1.7% but is being prevented from doing so on the basis that it would break the rules on the debt to GDP ratio.  This does not make sense. </p>  <p>  Continuing to depend on the rental market and refusing to build social housing which the State would own and make available to people who need it is not the way forward.  The State will eventually have to build social housing again.</p><p>Relying on the rental market and rent supplement is not even good economics.  If rent goes up, the rent supplement has to go up, and what we have then is the State subsidising the rental sector.  We need to think more about the long term and less about the short term.  Long-term thinking encourages real investment for the long term.  Relying on the private rental market to provide the necessary housing for those who cannot get on the ownership ladder is short-termism, not long-termism. Obviously, the fact that the political process works from one election to the next is a big factor.  This has a dramatic impact on how we deal with climate change also.  I see it now having an impact on the housing crisis in that we are not prepared to make the decisions required to bring long-term sustainability into the housing market.</p></speech>

As I outlined earlier, the intention and objective of the Bill is not to raise revenue.  The primary objective is to incentivise and stimulate the beneficial use of vacant or dormant sites in our cities and towns.  The purpose of the levy is to incentivise the owners of sites to unlock and develop them.  I want that to be clear.</p>  <p>  On the question of local authorities and social housing, the Bill already allows local authorities to utilise the levy proceeds for social housing.  The success of the Bill will not be measured with reference to the amount collected in levies; it will be measured with reference to the number of vacant sites brought back into beneficial use.  The levies collected should be relatively small if the Bill is a success.  If we are not successful in that area, the levies can be collected and invested in social housing by local authorities.  As drafted, the Bill also allows local authorities to invest the money in amenities, facilities or infrastructure to allow the development of more housing units.  I brought forward an amendment on Committee Stage to give greater flexibility to local authorities so that the money does not have to be spent specifically on sites and can be spent in the vicinity of sites within local development plan areas.  As such, we will oppose the amendments, because the Bill as drafted provides local authorities with the flexibility and authority to invest in social housing, amenities or facilities according to their preferred priorities.</p></speech>

The question is: are local authorities required to spend the money on social housing or can they spend it on other things?  That is what we want to know.  As I understand the amendment, it states that we need to spend the money on social housing.  I think the Minister of State has told us they can spend it on other stuff.  Can he just clarify that?  We cannot even vote on something unless we get a clear answer from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

What is emerging is that the vacant site levy will not help us to develop social housing.  On closer scrutiny, my reading of section 23(1) is that any money received by a planning authority pursuant to section 15 should be spent by it:<blockquote>(a) where the vacant site comprises residential land [if there is a vacant site that is residentially zoned], on the provision of housing on residential land in the vicinity of the site, and (b) where the vacant site comprises regeneration land, on the development and renewal of regeneration land in the vicinity of the site.</blockquote>There may never be social housing from whatever funds come forward from this.  That says it all.  Is it an ideological matter whereby the Government is completely opposed to council housing?  Is it a Thatcherite thing that it has an aversion to local authority housing?</p></speech>

It has been said here already that this is not going to work.  The fact that we are spending so long discussing the Bill is somewhat annoying, because it is not going to deal with the housing crisis.  We are trying to use it as an opportunity to expose that.  It lays it bare that the Government will not make it compulsory for local authorities to provide social housing based on this.  They can spend it on architectural, historical, archaeological and artistic structures.  They can build statues with the money from the vacant site levy or provide services and facilities for local communities.  That is not ring-fencing the money for housing.  It is a general fund that local authorities can use for all sorts of things, including the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities.  That money could, in theory, be used to put a statue in Malahide.  This is ludicrous stuff.  The fact that the Government is not willing to nail it down means the amendment must be put to a vote.</p></speech>

He does not really envisage a great deal of money coming in through the levy and is hoping it will push developers and others to use the lands.  He is mistaken.  It will not work in the way he thinks.  The reason I proposed the amendment was to clearly provide that whatever money comes in through the levy be targeted at social housing on lands under the control of local authorities.  The Minister of State referred to the vicinity of sites and a raft of areas.  Even in the present legislation, there is a raft of areas where the money could be used.  It is a get-out clause for a lot of local authorities.  If it came before me on Dublin City Council, I would be saying to myself that I could send the money into any department.  I am asking specifically to include in the Bill a clear undertaking that the money will go to local authority social housing.  That is what I clearly want, because the crisis out there requires it.  I ask the Minister of State to think again about what he is saying here.  He is giving local authorities an awful way out.  I know he, or at least his party, is ideologically opposed to social housing, as we have seen time out of number.  That is wrong and it is why we have a crisis.  It is why we have so many people on the housing lists at the moment.  It is why so many people are homeless.  Since the death of Jonathan Corrie, the number of families who have gone on the housing and homeless list has doubled.  That is the reality of what has happened.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800046#UU00400"><p>I move amendment No. 33:<blockquote>In page 19, to delete lines 33 to 35.</blockquote>This amendment seeks to delete lines 33 to 35 on page 19.  In effect, that retains the existing Part V percentage of 20% rather than the reduction as proposed by the Government to 10%.  Despite the criticism that has been levelled at the Part 5 provision by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and others, it delivered 15,000 units between 2002 and 2011.  The Minister proposes to halve it from 20%, which would appear to be a capitulation to the building sector on the part of Fine Gael and a capitulation by the Labour Party to Fine Gael with the retention of the site levy, despite the fact that the site levy has the support of all parties in the House as an effort to address dilapidation and encourage the development of many derelict and hoarded sites throughout the country.</p><p>I agree with the provision in the legislation to abolish the cash <i>in lieu</i>element and recognise that it did not work in a way that would assist local authorities.  That might be due to the fact - this touches on a point raised in the previous amendment proposed by my colleagues - that the funds collected by local authorities from that source were not properly ring-fenced in such a way that they could be redistributed for the purpose of providing social housing.  As an add-on to that, and further to a question put down by Deputy Troy in recent weeks, could the Department provide the Members with a breakdown of what was collected by each local authority during the lifetime of that legislation in terms of where it was spent, how it was spent and whether any funds retained by any local authority were collected in that fashion?</p><p>My reasons for seeking to retain the 20% provision are much the same as those outlined by many speakers since the beginning of this debate and long before that, while we awaited confirmation of proposed legislation on the part of the Government to tackle this crisis rather than allowing it to develop into the crisis it is now.  An effective house building programme needs to be twin-tracked.  The public and private elements should run parallel and every effort should be made to accommodate the private sector, which in turn can provide 20%, in addition to proper elements of policy on the part of the Government for local authorities to do what they do best and to tackle this issue in the manner in which it should be tackled.  The only way in which it has been resolved in the past, as others have said, was when local authorities were building houses in the 1930s and 1970s.  If there is a supply issue, the only way to address it is to build units, but it seems the Government is proposing to go to new lengths to appease the landlords, and it relies far too much on private rental accommodation.</p><p>The abolition of the affordable element is being done by ministerial order rather than through any specific part of the legislation.  I appreciate that this is because it was at the discretion of the local authorities to apportion percentages within the 20% provision between social and affordable housing, cash <i>in lieu</i>, and affordable units, but I disagree with that element of it.  Banks have intimated that they may deal with people in mortgage distress and allow them a break on their negative equity if they surrender their property and qualify for social housing from a local authority.  Unfortunately, many of those who find themselves in that position would not qualify for social housing, but it may be that local authorities could furnish loans and allow an affordable price within the current legislation.  I put that to the Minister of State.  I do not expect him to respond positively to it now, but I take at face value what he said earlier about other measures being brought before the House in the coming months to address the difficulties and deficiencies in the current programmes.</p><p>As I said, we were a long time waiting for movement on the part of Government to address this issue.  Now that there appears to be some semblance of movement, although it is not manifesting itself on the ground, I ask the Minister of State to consider that seriously.</p> <p> On the 20% provision, I was approached in recent months by people who wish to provide private sector housing for the elderly and in this regard wanted the 20% provision done away with.  As the Minister of State will be aware, there are many elderly people who, because their existing homes cannot be adapted to meet their needs, are on the housing waiting lists for senior citizens' dwellings and so on.  They have as much entitlement to a unit as does any young person or other person on those lists.  For this reason, I do not support the proposed reduction in the 20% provision.  I also believe people living in houses that are larger than they need should be incentivised to trade down, which in itself would create a gap for those wishing to trade up.  If the people who approached me in recent months are serious about providing those facilities, I would encourage them and others to do so.  Measures such as breaks in relation to stamp duty and the property tax could be introduced to encourage this.  That is just an example of the different suite of measures that is required by way of a more wholesome housing Bill to seriously tackle this issue.  As stated by many speakers, this issue needs to be tackled seriously.</p> <p> Suffice it to say, I do not agree that the 20% provision should be reduced to 10%.  I believe it should be retained at 20% and that more efforts should be made not only in public housing provision but in private house building and development.  To this end, the Strategic Investment Fund could lend itself towards a home development bank that could lend to developers and those who have land and sites throughout the country at a rate that would be competitive and would encourage them to undertake house building.  This, in parallel with the Government's programmes, would address this issue in the short term.  This is the type of out-of-the-box thinking that is necessary to address the housing crisis.  </p> <p> I do not expect that the Minister of State will take on board my proposals in this instance, but I ask that he give serious consideration to them in the preparation of other legislation that might be introduced, such that the public will see a real and meaningful effort being made by the Government which is cognisant of the obligations of the private sector as well as the obligations of local authorities.  This might address the imbalance in the legislation to which I referred earlier, whereby the Government is seeking to penalise those councils that cannot provide housing on sites they hold despite the fact that they are not being provided with the funding to do so, which is a huge contradiction, one of the greatest contained within this Bill and on which members of the Government voted accordingly.  I am surprised and shocked that this proposal has not yet reached the public domain.  However, we will do our best to ensure that it does.</p> <p> I disagree with the proposed reduction of the 20% provision to 10% and ask others to support my proposal in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.650" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800047#VV00200"><p>As far as I am concerned, this is a private developments charter.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we are going down this road.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 44 relate to the reduction from 20% to 10% in respect of the number of social and affordable units to which we are entitled under the Part V provision and to the increase in the number of units that constitutes a development from five or more to ten or more.  This might fit into the mindset of Fine Gael, but I am disappointed with the Labour Party.  This should have been a red-line issue for the Labour Party.  It should never have agreed to it.</p>  <p>  In the past, developers used every means possible to get out of meeting their obligations under Part V.  We do not get this 20% social and affordable housing for nothing.  We pay for it.  One would think from the way this is being presented that we get that 20% social and affordable housing for nothing.  That is not the case.  In the past, land or money was exchanged instead of housing units, which caused major problems.  In my own constituency, social and affordable housing units were not provided in particular areas because the developer did not want that type of housing in the area or because the developer felt he would get more money by not providing social housing there.  That happened in many areas.  Affordable housing delivered homes for people who could not afford housing in the private sector.  I cannot understand why that obligation was removed by way of ministerial order.  That, to me, does not make any sense.     </p>  <p>  I am at a loss to understand why we have gone down this road.  I expect that the Minister of State's response will be that there is not enough building taking place and that this will incentivise building.  I do not believe it will.  I believe that people intent on building will do so.  All these incentives will do is punish local people, as they will get no social and affordable housing, and put more money into the pockets of developers.  This proposal is scandalous and should be re-examined.  As I said, I do not understand why we are going down this road.</p></speech>

This issue has never been addressed.  The purpose of Part V provision was to address ghettoisation.</p><p>Deputy Cowen mentioned that 15,000 units were delivered under Part V, one third of which - 5,000 - were social housing units, with the remainder being affordable housing units.  During the five years in question between 55,000 and 75,000 units per annum were being built in this country.  This means approximately 400,000 units were built, only 5,000 of which became social housing units, which is a pretty poor offering.  There were many reasons for this, including loopholes in the legislation which allowed developers to buy their way out of meeting their obligations.  When I raised this issue with the Minister of State on Committee Stage he told me that provision under Part V was ring-fenced.  I have taken another look at the Bill.  In regard to whether it will be impossible to have a development that does not include social housing, the answer is &quot;No.&quot;  We will still have developments that contain no social housing.  While developers will not be allowed to buy their way out of meeting their obligations, they will be allowed to provide housing somewhere else <i>in lieu</i>of that obligation.  This does not address the issue of ghettoisation.  It means that a developer seeking to build in Ballsbridge could seek to provide the necessary units somewhere else.  This leads to ghettoisation.  It is a case of allowing people who are better off to live together and the poor people to live together.  The number of problems that arise because of ghettoisation is frightening.  How one does in life and how things fall for one is determined to a great degree by where one lives.</p><p>That factor determines life opportunity.  It determines the quality of the transport and other amenities of which one can avail.  I am not saying that people living in poor areas never have access to good transport but, generally speaking, those living in better-off ones have available to them a better transport system as well as more social amenities and a better selection of schools to which to send their children.  They probably have more shops to choose from close to where they live because it is easier for retailers to do business where people have more money.  Major associated problems develop out of ghettoisation.  It creates an underprivileged class, which leads to drug problems and crime.</p> <p> Another serious consequence of ghettoisation is poor housing.  Like all the other things I mentioned, poor housing has outcomes and they are not very good ones.  People who live in good housing have better outcomes.  It was very disappointing that even where social and affordable housing was delivered under Part V, the developer or builder - it was often the same person - was allowed to put different material into those units from what was being used in the units that were put on the private market.  It is very sad that this was allowed.  Most people will agree that inequality is at a greater level now than it was 20 years ago.  It is a primary responsibility of any Government to challenge inequality and any increase in it.  Moreover, any Government that is serious about challenging inequality will certainly tackle the blight that is ghettoisation.</p> <p> The point has been made that it is not as if it costs nothing for the builder-developer to provide social and affordable units.  In fact, because of the way in which the scheme is framed, that is not completely true.  Builders were offered their build costs plus 15% under the provisions, but were not given the value of their site purchase.  If, say, a builder paid &euro;100,000 per unit for 30 units, which amounted to &euro;3 million for the site, he or she did not get &euro;100,000 per unit back from the local authority in respect of the social and affordable element.  What happened was that the value of the site land was based on an agricultural value, which was a major problem.  It is my strong view that developers should be given their site value in order to make it bankable.  Very often, smaller players could not bank it if they had paid a lot of money for a site.  Some people paid up to &euro;230,000 per unit for apartment sites in 2006.  If they had delivered social and affordable units on that site, they would not have got their &euro;230,000 per unit back.  As I said, it was worked out on an agricultural value formula.  They would have got 15% profit on the construction costs, but they would have lost out on the supply of the units.  That should not have been allowed to happen.  Of course, when the formula was designed, it was not envisaged that site values would ever reach such crazy highs.  That is what happened, however, with the result that the State allowed developers to get out of their obligations when they claimed social and affordable housing would not fit on a particular site or would not work alongside expensive apartments for private sale.  What we had, as a result, was a continuation of ghettoisation.</p> <p> Last summer, when Kennedy Wilson got planning permission to build 164 apartments on the Clancy Barracks site, it told the planners the site was not suitable for social housing.  The outcome was that there is no social housing on that site.  We need to think again about how the system should work.  No site should ever again be developed in this country that is exempt from including an allocation of social housing.  I do not care where it is, in any part of this city or any part of the country, every development should have its quota of social or affordable units rather than allowing them to be moved elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is just unbelievable that the social and affordable housing quota is being reduced from 20% to 10%.  When this change was originally thrown out into the ether, one of the reasons given was that affordable housing was no longer needed in a context where house prices were decreasing.  Nothing could be further from the truth now, as house prices continue to rise relentlessly, particularly in cities.  Any argument that affordable housing is not required no longer stands.  The other reason given was that the change would remove impediments to developers in getting construction going.  It would be a terrible drain on them, we were told, if they had to set aside 20% of any development for social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  As we know, the Part V provisions did not work particularly well in the past, producing only 15,114 units, or 3.5% of total dwellings built during one of the greatest building booms the country has seen.  Developers found all sorts of way to avoid meeting their obligations.  As we know, no social housing was built in places like Malahide or Castleknock.  Instead, money was given in lieu to fund social housing on other sites.  We had developers claiming people would not want to live in an estate if it included a component of social or affordable housing.  As a result, the intended integration never happened.  Be that as it may, the provisions did produce some housing.  Why, then, is the Government seeking to reduce the quota at precisely the time when it could usefully be utilised?</p>  <p>  The other justification given for this change is that cash payments or the money in lieu provision is being abolished.  It will be a more stringent regime, we are assured, which will see more houses being built.  There are several reasons that will not prove to be the case, one of the most obvious being that local authorities will still have to buy the units from the developers at normal market costs.  The Bill provides that where houses are transferred to a planning authority, the price will be determined on the basis of the site cost of the houses and "the costs, including normal construction and development costs and profit on those costs, calculated at open market rates".  That is simply incredible.  Local authorities are not allowed to build houses themselves but must instead stump up greater costs to developers to provide them.</p><p>As a previous speaker said, one would think we were getting them for free.  I have spoken to people at a high level in local authority housing and they told me they do not want this because it is too expensive.  As they are starved of funds, they will not have money to buy large numbers of houses from developers and will have to go for the other option that has been introduced, that is, alternative arrangements, which I will discuss.  </p> <p> One of the claims made by the Minister of State and others is that is it cheaper for local authorities to go this route than to build houses.  I have heard that argument in councils.  How could it possibly be cheaper to provide housing through this scheme?  There is no way that could be the case.  Unlike Deputy Wallace, I do not think we should have to pay developers money to provide social housing.  He referred to their site costs.  One could argue that we should get the units free of charge on the basis that developers are being granted the very valuable resource of planning permission.  The idea that local authorities have to pay private developers which are crawling their way out of NAMA or trying to get back into the market at this level is outrageous.</p> <p> I refer to the alternative arrangements provided for in the Bill.  They include entering into a rental accommodation availability agreement or a lease agreement with a planning authority in respect of those houses.  We all know councils will not be able to buy houses given the current costs in Dublin, Cork and Galway, whatever about other locations.  Such places are where the crisis is particularly acute, but things are bad everywhere.  Councils will have to use taxpayers' money to put tenants into rented properties at a significant cost.  What will the rental rates for such homes be?  I assume the market rate will apply or developers would not engage.  Will there be long-term leases?  We again have the problem of people living in houses without security and from which they can be moved after five or ten years.  I do not know what is envisaged.  </p> <p> This scheme is likely to have large-scale take-up and could even become the norm for councils that cannot afford to buy houses up-front or take on debt due to EU rules.  It will mean councils paying rent to developers indefinitely, as is already happening under the NAMA social housing leasing initiative, without ever becoming owners of the property.  It would link up quite nicely with the social housing 2020 strategy which wants to replace more and more local authority housing with long-term leases.  The gist of this is that such arrangements will not be exceptional; they will be the norm.</p> <p> It is disappointing that, yet again, we have to worship at the feet of developers and nothing proactive is being done to fund councils to build houses.  I oppose any reduction in Part V from 20% to 10%. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800049#XX00200"><p>Somebody asked why the Government would want to reduce the requirement for developers to reduce from 20% to 10% the level of development given over to social and affordable housing.  I found part of the answer in the latest document from the European Commission, the post-programme surveillance report.  It comments on the shocking rise in rents and so on and states: "Policies should aim to increase supply more effectively through raising low private sector financing to developers and revising planning and development regulations."  That is, essentially, what the Government is doing and what its strategy involves.</p>  <p>  The Government opposes, on an ideological basis, large-scale public investment in the direct provision of local authority housing and has submitted itself to the diktat of the troika and the neoliberal ideologues in Europe.  Therefore, public investment in the direct provision of local authority housing is not on because it is ideologically opposed to it and favours the privatisation of everything that moves.  One is left with no option but to rely on the private sector to deliver social housing.</p>  <p>  As a result of the scale of the crisis, the Government has to pay some lip-service to a return to local authority housing provision.  However, as I said yesterday, when I rang the alarm bills about a document that came from the Department of the then Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, in 2011, I got very little traction.  I do not know why, but I suspect it was because media commentators could not get their heads around the idea in 2011 that a housing crisis would be coming down the line.  We had just come out of an enormous and unprecedented housing boom, so it probably seemed inconceivable to people who did not understand what was happening in regard to social housing lists that we would face what is now a catastrophic crisis.  </p>  <p>  I, and one or two others, tried to ring the alarm bells when the document was released.  The Government said it would no longer be involved in the construction of direct social housing, but would instead source it from the private sector.  As a result of the crisis that ensued from a policy decision taken by the Government, a situation that was bad turned to disaster, about that there is no question.  We are no longer building council housing and are instead relying completely on the private sector.  We have since seen the results.</p>  <p>  The homelessness rate is spiralling out of control.  When I came into the D&aacute;il, people were on the social housing lists for nine or ten years, which was outrageous.  People would get on the list when their children were born and their children would be ten before they had secure housing.  If one goes onto a housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire now - I know it is the same elsewhere - it will be 18 years before one gets a house.  If ones goes on a housing list when one's child is born, he or she might have reached an age where he or she would be moving out and will have had no secure housing.  The dramatic spike in the length of the housing lists happened because the Government made a bad situation a hell of a lot worse with a policy decision that was set out in clear and unambiguous terms in July 2011.</p>  <p>  For that alone, this Government should be flung out of office.  It was incompetence on a scale that is quite staggering.  Now, having made that catastrophic mistake, it is continuing along the same line by saying that it cannot or will not deliver social housing, therefore it will get down on bended knees, with the encouragement of the troika, to again incentivise private developers to deliver it for us.  </p>  <p>  Surely it is obvious, after what happened during the last boom, that even if the private sector builds the record levels of social housing it did during the boom, which were mentioned earlier on, when 70,000, 80,000 and 90,000 houses a year were built, the housing crisis will worsen.</p><p>Every single year of the building boom the housing list got longer and the homelessness crisis got worse.  If we wanted a textbook example of how the housing version of the trickle down just does not work, we have it in Ireland with the building boom.  It just does not work, yet the Government wants to do it again.  It wants to state it cannot, or will not, do this because the EU will not let it and it is submitting to it.  In any event, it believes in the private sector anyway, even though we have the most clear evidence of the failure of this ideology and strategy in our very recent history but here we are doing it again, saying we must incentivise it.  Then we have the troika.  It is beyond belief these guys are pushing this stuff.  I do not really care whether it is because the troika is pushing and the Government is submitting, or because they are all in cahoots in just believing in this stuff, but it is absolute madness.</p> <p> We have said we agree with the levy, but the truth is that levy is small beer really.  We agree with it, but it will not really address the issue in a very substantial way.  If property prices rise at the level at which they are at present, even the levy will not hurt the developers who are land-banking because they are sitting on a rapidly accumulating asset.</p> <p> The really substantial elements of the Bill are the reduction of the requirement for social and affordable housing from 20% to 10% and the issue of leasing.  What will be the cumulative effect of this?  To cut a long story short, the developers will not have to give 20% but will have to give 10%.  However, they will not actually have to give the 10% because they can lease.  They can discharge their obligation on social housing not by giving the housing to the local authority but by leasing it to the local authority and making a fortune on the rents they set, which will be controlled by a tiny oligarchy of huge owners of property.</p> <p> The other interesting thing in the EU Commission document is the comment made about the scale of the real estate investment trust, REIT, business, which is now &euro;1.8 billion, so these guys control 1% of GDP.  The document states REITs have become an important channel through which foreign capital can enter the Irish property market.  So far, REITs have primarily focused on purchasing or refurbishing existing properties.  How true it is that they are just interested in making money.  They do not give a damn about providing social housing or providing the supply the people desperately need.  They are just interested in making money out of it, yet we are getting down on our knees trying to incentivise these people.  It is total madness.</p> <p> The points have been made, but we must ring the alarm bells.  The people who said we are heading towards a disaster before the crash were told by one Taoiseach that they should go and commit suicide and that they were insane.  It was only afterwards that it was said we should have listened a little more to these people whom Nyberg called contrarians.  I can tell the Minister of State, and quite a few other people are saying it here, we are heading towards a disaster if the Government continues down this road.  There needs to be a radical shift back towards the direct provision of local authority housing on a very large scale for obvious reasons for the people on the housing list but also for the sustainability and security of the economy as a whole.  If we do not do this, we will pile up a massive problem.</p> <p> I have raised this with the Fiscal Advisory Council and it acknowledged we have a point on this.  I do not see how, when the troika wants to push so hard on the question that we must keep public spending down and we are not allowed to have public spending, that it does not see the Government will continue to spend more for years and years to come, in a way that will suck money out of the Exchequer, by trying to deal with the social housing problem in this way.  It is just billions and billions of euro and it is set to expand every year, going into the pockets of property developers and landlords.  As a proportion of the overall social housing stock, it will increase exponentially as a result of what Government is doing.  It potentially could bankrupt the State, that is how bad it is, when these people control the rental and property market to the extent they now do.  It could actually bankrupt the State.  The Government will not introduce rent controls, so there will be no mechanisms to control these guys.  We will be utterly at their mercy and the housing crisis and homelessness crisis will be out of control.  We are doing our best to ring the alarm bells.  It would appear the Government is immune to it, but sooner or later this crisis will blow up in a very big way in all of our faces unless we radically change tack.</p></speech>

Almost 100,000 people are on the housing list.  Many people are couch surfing and in emergency accommodation.  Last month 65 families, all from the private rental sector, approached the local authority homeless section seeking emergency accommodation.  In May the figure was 64 families.  If a natural disaster, such as a flood, wiped out 200,000 houses we would have a national emergency trying to deal with it.  What we have is a national disaster.  We are speaking about cutting back on one area where we could, as a State, enforce social housing in the way it was presented previously.  I believe we should move away from the 20% social and affordable housing model in Part V.</p>  <p>  The Bill should be just taken off the agenda.  To see all of the Government backbenchers coming in to vote for it but not sitting in the Chamber trying to challenge what is going on is unbelievable.  It is shocking.  It shocks me that we are still in this situation.  The opportunities the State has to get developers to provide social housing is being halved from 20% to 10%, which is a disaster.  The next step will be that developers will actually go to local authorities to tell them they will come to a leasing arrangement with them rather than providing social housing.  We will never get a social house out of this.  Developers will immediately jump at the leasing aspect of it whereby they can make money more easily.  It is a disaster.  It is mocking the people of the State debating this and for the Government to have presented it as an alternative way to try to deal with the housing crisis.</p></speech>

We are dealing with a legacy of problems that many would argue is a perfect storm in terms of housing provision in this country.  Deputies are correct in that we have not been building local authority housing for many years.  This Government, and specifically my Department, has ring-fenced funds to build local authority houses directly for the first time in years.  I do not see that being welcomed here, although councillors from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independents are welcoming the projects going ahead.

There will be more allocations as resources allow.  That is the type of realism the Government has to deal with.  There is no magic bullet or pot of gold from which we can access funds.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned on Committee Stage some &euro;1 billion fund that exists in the ether.  I am not using this as a point of attack but if such a fund exists, will the Deputy please emphasise where it is?  I certainly cannot see it.</p>  <p>  We are accessing all types of funding to try to address the housing crisis in the country, including direct provision of funding from the Exchequer, leveraging funding from the approved housing bodies off balance sheet and the public-private partnership system.  We have a very open mind on all ways of delivering housing.  To say that the direct building of social housing is the one solution for the problem we face is not realistic.  The local authorities do not have the capacity to build to the extent being mentioned, although we are gradually ramping up planning and housing staff.  We have allocated more than 300 staff to local authorities so they can increase the capacity to respond as we start allocating funds to them.</p>  <p>  I will repeat what I said about the void issue.  There was a totally unacceptable level of vacant and void existing housing stock.  We have prioritised those because we feel they can be turned around more quickly.  We are seeing progress in the area, as we have returned over 2,000 vacant houses to beneficial use, with another 1,000 to be delivered by providing additional funds to local authorities in those areas.  There is no conspiracy on this side of the House and we are using all available avenues to address the housing issues.  Saying that the private sector cannot, and will not, be part of the solution is not realistic either.  As I have said in previous debates, if in the morning we had all the money being mentioned to put into the direct building of social housing, there would still be a time lag of a number of months, if not years, in delivering those houses.  What would be done in the mean time?  We have to utilise the private sector; we have no other option.  That is what we are doing, and to write off such a process would certainly do an injustice to the people on the housing lists.</p>  <p>  It is recognised, not by Deputies on this side of the House but by independent agencies like Housing Agency, that the construction sector is not working to its full potential.  We do not have a viable and normalised construction sector, as we are operating at half the rate of possible production of houses.  This is because existing planning permissions have very high development levies attached, which makes those construction projects unviable.  This Bill addresses the issue by giving flexibility to local authorities to revise those levies to more realistic levels.  That will unlock construction sites and deliver more housing units.</p>  <p>  The Part V element has been examined closely by the Housing Agency and an independent review has been carried out.  A recommendation was made that because of overhead costs and viability concerns, a reduction in the Part V contribution would assist in the delivery of more housing units.  That is why we are proposing in the Bill to reduce the proportion from 20% to 10%.  Over the past five years, the number of private sector housing construction projects has been close to zero.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett noted on Committee Stage, 20% of zero is zero.  We need to see activity on these sites, so a 10% Part V element is a reasonable level in order to achieve viability in construction.  On top of that, we are removing the cash in lieu element that existed heretofore.  I welcome the fact Deputy Cowen welcomed the removal of that mechanism as, in the past, it allowed many developers to get out of their obligations.  Aside from Deputy Cowen, I do not hear too many others welcoming that fact.  We are not on the side of the developers; we want to see units delivered.  We are making interventions in many different ways to try to achieve it and the removal of the Part V cash in lieu element is one of those.</p>  <p>  We are strengthening the hand of local authorities in getting agreement on Part V prior to the commencement of construction on a site.  Although it is a provision of the Bill, I do not hear people talking about it.  We all know of cases in the past where developers managed to get out of that commitment through negotiation.  In this legislation, it will be part of the planning condition that negotiated Part V output will have to be agreed before work commences on a site.  That is a positive element that should be welcomed as it ties down a commitment on the delivery of units under Part V.</p>  <p>  For the reasons I have outlined, we will oppose the amendments.  The Government feels that what it proposes is reasonable and addresses viability issues as well as issues that must be considered in order to see more construction of housing units in the country.  We need to get back to a normalised and sustainable level that will meet the needs of society.</p></speech>

I stated earlier that I accept there must be a public and private mix in addressing the large housing crisis.  This D&aacute;il more than any that has gone before it has a responsibility to learn from the past.  I have no problem accepting that.  The Minister of State and his Government are relying solely on the advice of an independent group made up, I presume, of stakeholders in the industry.  I am not aware of who exactly comprised that review group.  The Government has relied on the recommendation to reduce the social element of Part V from 20% to 10% but that is a grave mistake as it disregards the views and knowledge that exists not only on this side of the House but on the Government benches as well.  As the Minister of State has correctly stated, we are all in the same boat in terms of our responsibility to those who give us the privilege to represent them.  We have all been inundated with representations from people in our constituencies who are at their wit's end because of the unfortunate prospect of not having a home or being in a position to receive accommodation from the local authority charged with the responsibility for it by the Government.  That is a source of great disappointment to me.</p>  <p>  There are inquiries taking place in other parts of this building, with people giving open, frank and honest responses to questions.  An exercise for Members in this House is to learn from what went before.  One lesson is not to take at face value advice that might appear sound.  I implore the Minister of State not to be led by some review group with faceless people, as far as I am concerned, because I do not know who they were.   The Government should accept the best will and intention of those on this side of the House and on the Government benches who believe we must learn from the mistakes of the past and adhere to a 20% social dividend rather than a 10% portion.</p></speech>

I suggest that he and his party are out of touch with the reality.  The Minister of State mentioned funding.</p><p>There was no problem chasing after Irish Water and taking &euro;1 billion out of the pension fund.  The strategic investment fund is still there and there is over &euro;7 million in it if the Government is looking for money.  We have had four years under this Government in which this crisis has been getting worse and worse.  Local authorities also gave over land when it came to Part V.  They gave land free to the developers in return for housing.  Infill sites were used quite a lot in my area to deliver social and affordable housing.  Other European countries have 20% and 30% in their rules and regulations, so why are we going down this road?  Why are we lowering our guidelines on the number of units?  Previously, developments of five units and upward would come under Part V but now the lower limit is ten.  What is the logic for that?  It does not make sense.</p> <p> I do not know where the Housing Agency and others are coming from in giving that guidance because everyone I listen to, including all the different housing bodies - I have met with nearly every one of them, including Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust - is finding this very difficult to understand.  I do not know where these people are coming from and questions must be asked about how they are coming to their conclusions so that the Government can drop Part V in the way it has.</p></speech>

He claimed he was as much in touch on the housing issue as those on this side of the House and that he was from the same type of background.  That is not true of the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il is not in any way representative of working class people.  Approximately 27% of Deputies are landlords, which is not the case in wider society.  I do not know how many millionaires are in the D&aacute;il, but in one D&aacute;il there were 25.  Ministers and Deputies are on much higher salaries than the general population.  Very few Deputies are from working class backgrounds compared to the proportion of the general population and very few were brought up in a council house.  This D&aacute;il is not in any way representative of society at large.  Some people made their money through politics but there are many who were very wealthy before they came in here and who have carried on those vested interests.  How many Deputies got bank write-downs compared to the general population and how many have property portfolios?</p>  <p>  What projects was the Minister of State talking about us welcoming in local authorities?  There are no projects.  There are no houses-----</p></speech>

We have made the argument many times before and I do not see much point in labouring it, but it will become evident very quickly to the electorate.  The Minister of State referred to projects in his speech.</p></speech>

In response to a recent question, the Minister of State informed us that 1,700 housing units are to be built in 100 separate projects across all 31 local authorities by the end of 2017.  To put that in context, in my area alone, 1,200 people joined the list last year.  They are joining the list at a rate of 100 per month.  The figures are the same elsewhere.  Not only will that not deal with the crisis, but based on those figures, it will be ten times worse by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  In terms of Part V, the Minister of State says the Government estimates 4,000 additional units will be made available, although this is entirely conjectural because it is based on the private construction industry, over which we have no control and which even the European Commission says is not interested in building at the moment because it has a captive market in terms of buying up property that is already there and renting it out at massive prices.  This is pathetic and I do not want to say that.  For the sake of what I have to go through every Monday and Friday in my clinic and what so many others have to go through, I wish I could say there was something in this that gives me hope.  People come in who are in absolute bits, faced with the possibility of homelessness.  Landlords just announce they are putting up the rent and the tenants have nowhere to go.  There is nowhere anywhere near the rent allowance caps and they just do not know what to do.  They have been on the list for 18 years, they have kids who are sick and all the rest of it.  I welcome the levy and the removal of the cash in lieu provision but it will not even come close to solving the problem and it will be counteracted by the renewed reliance on the private sector, which will make the problem worse.</p></speech>

However, the point being made was that reliance on an element of the private sector is one thing but over-reliance on it is another.  It is no secret that the primary motive of the private sector is profit.  That does not mean that all builders are rogues or that they all fail to do their job properly.  We have good builders and bad builders, as in every profession.  However, their primary motive is profit while the State's primary motive should be taking the best care of the interests of the citizens.  Doing away with the cash buy-out is, of course, a good idea.  That is a given.  However, I thought the Minister of State was going to ring-fence these obligations and ensure there is no way around them.  If this is ring-fenced, in future every single site will have social or affordable housing on it.  We are not getting that.  We are allowing ghettoisation to continue.  Would the Minister of State not consider making sure that element is challenged and stopped forever?  Would he not look at the legislation again and ensure that no site can be developed in the future unless there is social or affordable housing on that particular site?</p></speech>

It states:<blockquote>Section 33 amends [section] 96 of the 2000 Act.  [It d]etails how a developer may satisfy his or her Part V obligations.  This section removes the option of providing a cash payment in lieu of social housing, [which is grand] as well as removing the option of providing sites elsewhere [which is also grand].  It allows the developer to provide completed social housing units in another location in the event that the development in question does not meet the needs of the local authority.  Provision is made for the Part V obligation to be fulfilled through long-term leasing.</blockquote>The removal of the cash element is very welcome but if the leasing aspect of it comes in, we are not going to get social housing out of this.  The developers will say to the council that it is not acceptable and they cannot provide social housing in the development but they will allow long-term leasing.  It is a no-brainer.  The Minister of State cannot allow this to happen.  If he is going to reduce the 20% requirement to 10%, which I think is the wrong move at the wrong time, when we need actual social housing, he should at least take the provision allowing long-term leasing arrangements out of it.  It has to be done.  No one here is saying that all private developers are bad or that we do not need private developments.  Of course, we do.  We need aspects of everything.The State's obligation is to look at the needs of a society and put in place structures to provide for the housing needs of the people.</p><p>We need to build at least 100,000 to 150,000 houses over the next period of time.  The Minister of State said it will take time.  Of course it will take time, but it will take even longer under the proposals in this legislation.</p></speech>

It is but one way of responding to the housing crisis of which the Deputies speak.  The Government is making other inventions as well.  It is treating it as a priority.  The social housing strategy is a priority for the Government.  We would all like to see far more funds available for it, but a strong commitment has been made by the Government to build houses over the next number of years and to engage with approved housing bodies and local authorities to ensure more houses are delivered through direct construction in local authority areas right around the country.</p>  <p>  We need more social housing but I would argue from an ideological point of view that we also need more private housing.  I have listened closely to some of the arguments on the other side.  The solution I am hearing in the main is that we only need social housing on a large scale and that will solve all our problems.</p></speech>

Section 96 (inserted by section 3 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002) of the Act of 2000 is deleted.&quot;.</blockquote>Part V was weakened by amendments lobbied for by developers in 2002.  This should never have happened.  The Government now wants to weaken it further by allowing leasing to become a major part of Part V.  I completely oppose this.  Leasing is not a means of delivering proper social housing, which is what the Government claims it wants to do.  Leasing arrangements are part of the Government's social housing policy, but I do not believe they constitute the delivery of proper social housing.  That is why I am opposing the Government's approach.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has spoken about, and made a play of, the proposal to insert the words "prior to the lodgement of a commencement notice within the meaning of Part II of the Building Control Regulations 1997" after the words "to which the application relates".  In the past, there was a problem in this regard because one was allowed to start building and commence development after getting planning permission even if one had not settled one's Part V arrangement with the planning authority.  The Government is planning to introduce a system whereby one will not be allowed to start building until that is sorted.  That is actually good, to a degree, but my argument relates to why there should there be any debate about it.</p>  <p>  If the Government had ring-fenced the Part V arrangement, as I recommended, there would be no need for a debate because every site for which planning permission is granted would have a proportion of social and affordable housing laid down for it as a condition of planning.  This would do away with the practice of strong lobby groups and big developers going into planners to exercise their muscle.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that guys who can build 500 units at a time go into the planning process to challenge planners about how Part V arrangements should be dealt with and what sort of deal should be done.  I assure the House that the guys developing 100 or 500 units have much more power than those developing five or ten units.  It is not a level playing field.  We are not getting a consistent result in how it is being dealt with.</p>  <p>  The process that the Government is facilitating will allow the great, good and powerful to continue to exercise a level of influence in this area that is not good for the system.  I recommend that the Government should put in place a system that requires a decision to be made in advance of the issuing of planning permission on whether the development will consist of social housing, affordable housing or a mixture of both.  If this is clearly stated as a condition of planning permission, it will have to be accepted by developers and builders.  When a builder or developer gets planning permission, of course he looks at the conditions.  The conditions are significant to him because some of them will impose a cost on him.  If a cost does not materialise because a condition has been left out, it is a case of "happy days".  I assure the House that getting planning permission with conditions is much better than not getting planning permission at all.  I looked for planning permission on many occasions.  I did not always like the conditions that attached to planning, but I was always glad to get it.  Regardless of the conditions that may have been attached to a site, I did not leave it there.  I went ahead and built on it.  I put up with the conditions because that is business life.  The Government has the potential to sort out Part V in advance of the giving of planning permission.  I suggest that if this is included in the conditions, there will be no argument afterwards.</p></speech>

We have gone through the various arguments in great detail on Committee and Report Stages.  The five amendments I have tabled and the amendments tabled by some other Deputies deal with the worst aspects of this Bill.  We have argued at length about the big weaknesses in the Bill.  There are one or two strengths as well.  The get-out clauses and loopholes in this Bill will allow private developers to avoid providing the amount of social and affordable housing that is necessary to address the absolutely dire crisis in this area.  All of the Government's efforts in this regard will come to nothing because of what it is proposing to do in this section of the Bill.  Developers will no longer have to assign 20% of any development to social and affordable housing.  Instead, they will be able to get out of having to meet the 10% level that the Government is now setting by opting to lease the property back to the council.  They will keep the property.  The tenants, the State and the wider public Exchequer will fork out money to them week after week and month after month.  The gold mine we are opening up for developers will cost the State an absolute fortune at a time when rents are increasing.</p>  <p>  A tiny number of property developers and big property speculators control a vast amount of the property in this country.  Indeed, the ownership of commercial residential property is now more concentrated in them than it was before the disastrous boom.  We are going to be complete hostages to them, to such a degree that it could bankrupt the State.  Rather than dealing with the social housing crisis, this measure will suck money out of the public coffers.  That money could be used to deal with the social and affordable housing crisis in the permanent, serious and sustainable way in which it should be dealt with.  The direct construction by the State of its own council houses would save us the money that would not have to go to private landlords and would generate rental revenue back for the State.  It is beyond me that the Minister of State and his colleagues do not see the economic logic of such an approach, which also represents the best solution to deal with the housing crisis.  I suggest the only explanation is that they are the hostages of these big developers, speculators and financial institutions and that the troika is backing all of this up.  That is the purpose of this measure.  The decision to give the developers a big get-out clause that will make a bad situation worse completely unwinds any possible progressive element in this Bill.</p></speech>

I would like to reiterate the request I made to the Minister of State last time out.  The reduction in the Part V social and affordable housing requirement from 20% to 10% is bad enough.  It is actually terrible.  Now it has been decided that rather than securing that 10%, provision should be made for the option of leasing out that 10% as private rented accommodation.</p><p>This is like the out clause that allowed the developer to buy out the 20% social and affordable housing.  I appeal to the backbenchers of the Government parties not to allow this to go through.  It serves nobody to include it.</p> <p> I support amendment No. 42 which relates to specialist age developments.  St. Michael's Estate in my constituency is now Thornton Heights, which is part of the regeneration that was built with 75 social housing units.  There is a proposal to build a 50-bed step-down facility for old folks with special needs beside the Richmond Barracks section, where there is a ten acre site.  The council and St. Michael's Estate regeneration board support it and there will be a community meeting tomorrow night to hear the views of the community.  I appeal to the Minister, who has not yet stepped up to the plate on this, to say it is a good idea.  It is beside the local primary care centre and a nursing home, and it is linked with another small old folks' camp at the beginning of the estate.  The inclusion of amendment No. 42 would mean something positive, at least, in this part of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.692" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1195" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800056#EEE00200"><p>We have argued about this all evening but this marks a huge change in social housing policy in the State.  Previously, local authorities or housing agencies were funded to build and provide social and affordable housing, whereas now the priority is that developers and landlords will be funded by the taxpayer.  Rather than being able to buy houses, councils will be forced to lease them from these developers.  How likely is it that councils will be able to buy houses at market rates from developers?  It is extremely unlikely.  Why would the Minister not give them the money to build the houses at a cheaper rate themselves?</p>  <p>  This appears to be an ideological policy to get the poor old developers, including the dysfunctional ones, out of a hole and to provide them with a regular, steady income.  Why would the Minister do this otherwise?  However, it means that the taxpayer will be stumping up a huge amount of money for rent for social tenants.  The waiting lists have increased dramatically.  There are now 100,000 people on the lists.  It will be an extremely expensive means of housing people.</p>  <p>  The other problem is that families will be stuck in an invidious position.  They will not have security in their lives.  Their children will be faced with moving from one school to another every couple of years, which is the situation they are in at present.  They can never put down roots.  In fact, there could be ghettos in some of these estates.  There are social consequences to renting out 10% of an estate.  At least in the case of the county council there are councillors who are accountable to the people in rented units and if there are problems there are agreements, and pressure can be exerted on the tenants.  Who will be managing these units?  There is a serious issue in that regard as well.  For families on the housing lists, they will be stuck in the rented sector for the rest of their lives.  It is ironic that the Minister waxes lyrical about people's right to own their own houses.  These people will never own their own house because they will be stuck paying rent.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister budgeted this?  Will people be paying rent as they do at present, by claiming from the community welfare officer and paying it to landlords?  Will it be under the housing assistance payment, HAP, or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS?  What will be the cost to local authorities and the State for housing people in this expensive and very unfair fashion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1087" speakername="Noel Coonan" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800056#EEE00300"><p>I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 41 and 42.  What we are discussing here could be described as social or voluntary housing.  I am proposing a system of integrated housing for a specified age group, for example, people over 70 years of age.  There are many examples of this in rural areas where people who are no longer able to continue living alone, due to lack of services, lack of care or for security reasons, move into a system of integrated housing.  Integrated housing means housing where care is provided, health services are available and there is security.  They live independently and continue to live in that home for much longer.  They continue to live in the community, as most people wish to do.</p>  <p>  There are a number of examples of the benefits of this throughout the country.  If the people concerned have a home in the country, they give up that home.  Sometimes the local authority will take it over and make it available for housing other people.  There are people who would like to move out into the country and many people are desperately in need of housing, so this frees up housing as well.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to remove this.  The developers and voluntary groups in many cases provide this system of housing, and it is an impediment to them to have the restriction placed on them.  This is a difficult scheme of housing to operate, and people must raise funding.  It is very important that we continue to provide this.  We are conscious that there is a housing crisis not just in the cities but across the country.  While there is much talk about it being resolved, there is not much action on it at present.  There are people and builders who are ready to move on these houses but this provision is creating a difficulty for them.  In fact, amendment No. 42 specifically identifies what is integrated housing.  In this case we are talking about elderly people over 70 years of age, and the services are provided along with the housing.</p>  <p>  I often think, and many people have said this to me, that the terms we use for housing, such as "social housing" and "affordable housing", are not very wise.  It is pity we should have to classify people and put them into sections or label them for housing.  There should be a better term than "social and affordable housing".  Everybody's home is his or her castle and people want homes.  That is what we should provide.  In this instance, the Minister is putting obstacles in the way of developers and communities who have plans to build and deliver houses for older people throughout the country.  I ask him to re-examine this.</p></speech>

The Part V agreements must now be in place before developers can turn a sod on a proposed development site.  The Part V negotiation process has been pinned down under the Bill and agreements must now be in place prior to works commencing.  This new provision will avoid protracted disputes arising after developments have been built, which was the case in the past.  Paragraph (1)(a) of section 33 amends section 96(2) of the principal Act to explicitly provide that the Part V agreement must be made with the planning authority before the developer lodges a commencement notice within the meaning of Part 2 of the building control regulations of 1997.  In certain instances in the past, Part V agreements were not finalised between the parties before construction commenced.</p><p>This led to confusion and a lack of clarity on the part of developers and planning authorities about the social housing dividend required.  This amendment will ensure there is clarity about the social housing dividend early in the planning and construction process.  It will remain the case that a planning condition will require a Part 5 agreement to be put in place.  Planning enforcement provisions will continue to be used to ensure all planning conditions are fulfilled by developers. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-08a.701" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070800057#FFF00700"><p>I welcome the Bill devised by Deputy Michael McGrath.  It offers and demonstrates the necessary mechanism to get us out of the ongoing impasse whereby the banks are continuing to mistreat and abuse existing mortgage holders.  In concentrating on chasing new house buyers, the banks have slashed interest rates.  However, approximately 320,000 variable rate customers are losing out and paying on average &euro;2,000 per annum more than new borrowers.  This unfortunate cohort of mortgage holders is trapped with its lenders and remains vulnerable to higher interest rates in future.</p>  <p>  It is disingenuous of the European Commission to intervene in this matter by backing up the hard line taken by the banks and advocating that the banks which were bailed out by citizens be allowed to further profiteer on the backs of mortgage holders.  The President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, stated twice in 2014 that the ECB wanted the Irish banks to pass on cuts in lending rates but stopped short of contacting the banks to ask them to reduce their variable mortgage rates, which are the highest of the 19 members of the eurozone.</p>  <p>  A variable rate cut would have several benefits for the wider economy.  Most people have yet to see any increase in their disposable income.  This is the main reason consumer spending on goods and services has been the weakest indicator of recovery in the economy.  Given the many benefits that would accrue as a result of the enactment of the Bill, I will support it in the hope that it will be passed. </p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether the Government would legislate to give the Central Bank powers to act on mortgage interest rates and stand up for Irish mortgage holders and called on the Taoiseach to answer his question with "Yes" or "No".  The Taoiseach replied that the answer was "Yes", on condition that the Central Bank requested such legislation.  One could argue that this reply confirmed who is in charge and it is not the Taoiseach given his admission that he needed to receive a request from the Central Bank before he could act.  This was a strange response and one which he may wish to reconsider.</p>  <p>  Most people will agree that the mortgage crisis has not gone away.  Irish banks are charging higher interest rates than banks in the rest of Europe, including Northern Ireland.  The problem we have is that we do not seem to be able to tell them what to do. </p></speech>

Despite proposing new legislation and presenting alternatives, the Opposition is regularly criticised in the national media for not having options.  This is welcome legislation which will be important for the 300,000 families affected by high variable mortgage rates, many of whom are suffering stress.</p>  <p>  Despite the role played by the banks in recent years, nothing seems to have changed.  Many of us are not impressed by and do not trust the senior officials in the banks.  Many families, particularly young people, are suffering.  People with a &euro;200,000 mortgage on a variable interest rate are paying &euro;992 more than new customers and &euro;4,000 more than the European Union average.  </p>  <p>  The country faces a child poverty crisis.  In 2008, the rate of child poverty stood at 6.3%.  It now stands at 11.7% and a further 17.9% of children are at risk of poverty.  These are shocking figures for a developed country.  Many families are struggling to survive and pay their mortgages and they need our support. </p></speech>

Its attitude contrasts sharply with the experience of mortgage holder and this gets to people because there is no justification for it.  Double standards operate in this State, with those with influence being looked after while the vulnerable at the bottom are ignored.</p>  <p>  I received a letter from a family living in County Roscommon who were informed by the sheriff that he would visit their home on 17 June last.  The sheriff did not show up on the appointed date but subsequently appeared on 24 June with ten other people, including six garda&iacute; in two patrol cars.  As the father pointed out, there had never been any threat of violence from the family, which has gone through the courts in its efforts to have the matter resolved.  The husband, wife and one child were present when the sheriff arrived.  When the group was refused entry to the house, it moved off to take possession of another house in the area, leaving the family in a state of fear and dread.  Where will these families end up?  If the sheriff had got his way on the day in question, eight people would have been left without a home and the local authority would have been required to rehouse them.</p>  <p>  The father wrote that while he knows people must pay back the money they owe, it is not fair when one sees the deals being done and favours given to those at the top.  He stated that he and his family will have sleepless nights waiting, without a date, for the sheriff to return.  I received an e-mail yesterday informing me that the sheriff had since returned and repossessed the house, leaving eight people without a home and at the mercy of the local authority.  No one cared where they would spend that night and they were given a telephone number and told to make an appointment.  This family was trying to resolve the issue.  It is unacceptable that these types of events are taking place in Ireland today.  This modest Bill would alleviate some of the pressure on some families.  It is unacceptable that the Government seems to be satisfied that the banks are allowed to do whatever the hell they like.  </p></speech>

One can imagine how people across Europe feel about how the European Union treats ordinary works.  When one considers what the EU is doing to Greece and its role in the negotiations on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, it is little wonder people are losing faith in the European project.  The European Union should stand by hard-pressed, ordinary Europeans.</p>  <p>  What is happening is very simple; the banks are profiteering on the backs of hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders.  This is incomprehensible to hundreds of thousands of people. </p></speech>
